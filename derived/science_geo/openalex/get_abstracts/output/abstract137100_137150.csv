https://openalex.org/W2115780677,"Analysis of the 1,042,519–base pair Chlamydia trachomatis genome revealed unexpected features related to the complex biology of chlamydiae. Although chlamydiae lack many biosynthetic capabilities, they retain functions for performing key steps and interconversions of metabolites obtained from their mammalian host cells. Numerous potential virulence-associated proteins also were characterized. Several eukaryotic chromatin-associated domain proteins were identified, suggesting a eukaryotic-like mechanism for chlamydial nucleoid condensation and decondensation. The phylogenetic mosaic of chlamydial genes, including a large number of genes with phylogenetic origins from eukaryotes, implies a complex evolution for adaptation to obligate intracellular parasitism."

Starting with an unfolded state of villin headpiece subdomain, hydrophobic collapse and helix formation occur in an initial phase, followed by conformational readjustments. A marginally stable state, which has a lifetime of about 150 nanoseconds, a favorable solvation free energy, and shows significant resemblance to the native structure, is observed; two pathways to this state have been found."
https://openalex.org/W2107339893,"A map of 30,181 human gene–based markers was assembled and integrated with the current genetic map by radiation hybrid mapping. The new gene map contains nearly twice as many genes as the previous release, includes most genes that encode proteins of known function, and is twofold to threefold more accurate than the previous version. A redesigned, more informative and functional World Wide Web site ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genemap ) provides the mapping information and associated data and annotations. This resource constitutes an important infrastructure and tool for the study of complex genetic traits, the positional cloning of disease genes, the cross-referencing of mammalian genomes, and validated human transcribed sequences for large-scale studies of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1975981650,"A fundamental question in cognitive science is whether animals can represent numerosity (a property of a stimulus that is defined by the number of discriminable elements it contains) and use numerical representations computationally. Here, it was shown that rhesus monkeys represent the numerosity of visual stimuli and detect their ordinal disparity. Two monkeys were first trained to respond to exemplars of the numerosities 1 to 4 in an ascending numerical order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4). As a control for non-numerical cues, exemplars were varied with respect to size, shape, and color. The monkeys were later tested, without reward, on their ability to order stimulus pairs composed of the novel numerosities 5 to 9. Both monkeys responded in an ascending order to the novel numerosities. These results show that rhesus monkeys represent the numerosities 1 to 9 on an ordinal scale."
https://openalex.org/W2082936810,"The self-organization of pyramidal PbSe islands that spontaneously form during strained-layer epitaxial growth of PbSe/Pb1-xEuxTe (x = 0.05 to 0.1) superlattices results in the formation of three-dimensional quantum-dot crystals. In these crystals, the dots are arranged in a trigonal lattice with a face-centered cubic (fcc)-like A-B-C-A-B-C vertical stacking sequence. The lattice constant of the dot crystal can be tuned continuously by changing the superlattice period. As shown by theoretical calculations, the elastic anisotropy in these artificial dot crystals acts in a manner similar to that of the directed chemical bonds of crystalline solids. The narrow size distribution and excellent control of the dot arrangement may be advantageous for optoelectronic device applications."
https://openalex.org/W2156515964,"Nonpeptide agonists of each of the five somatostatin receptors were identified in combinatorial libraries constructed on the basis of molecular modeling of known peptide agonists. In vitro experiments using these selective compounds demonstrated the role of the somatostatin subtype-2 receptor in inhibition of glucagon release from mouse pancreatic alpha cells and the somatostatin subtype-5 receptor as a mediator of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Both receptors regulated growth hormone release from the rat anterior pituitary gland. The availability of high-affinity, subtype-selective agonists for each of the somatostatin receptors provides a direct approach to defining their physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1979890053,"The Earth's atmosphere is generally considered to be an example of a chaotic system that is sensitively dependent on initial conditions. It is shown here that certain regions of the atmosphere are an exception. Wind patterns and rainfall in certain regions of the tropics are so strongly determined by the temperature of the underlying sea surface that they do not show sensitive dependence on the initial conditions of the atmosphere. Therefore, it should be possible to predict the large-scale tropical circulation and rainfall for as long as the ocean temperature can be predicted. If changes in tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature are quite large, even the extratropical circulation over some regions, especially over the Pacific–North American sector, is predictable."
https://openalex.org/W2158507234,"Patients with abetalipoproteinemia, a disease caused by defects in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), do not produce apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins. It was hypothesized that small molecule inhibitors of MTP would prevent the assembly and secretion of these atherogenic lipoproteins. To test this hypothesis, two compounds identified in a high-throughput screen for MTP inhibitors were used to direct the synthesis of a highly potent MTP inhibitor. This molecule (compound 9 ) inhibited the production of lipoprotein particles in rodent models and normalized plasma lipoprotein levels in Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, which are a model for human homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. These results suggest that compound 9 , or derivatives thereof, has potential applications for the therapeutic lowering of atherogenic lipoprotein levels in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1985888026,"The kinase inhibitors SB 203580 and PD 98059 have been reported to be specific inhibitors of the 38- and 42/44-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, respectively. In this study, the two inhibitors were found to decrease platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of arachidonic acid, suggesting that they also interfere with the metabolism of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2. In support of this, SB 203580 and PD 98059 inhibited the conversion of exogenous [3H]arachidonic acid to [3H]thromboxane in intact platelets. Measurement of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity following immunoprecipitation revealed that SB 203580 and PD 98059 are direct inhibitors of this enzyme. Both compounds were shown to inhibit purified cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 by a reversible mechanism. In addition, SB 203580 (but not PD 98059) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by prostaglandin H2 and the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane A2 in intact platelets. SB 203580 also inhibited this pathway in platelet microsome preparations, suggesting a direct inhibitory effect on thromboxane synthase. These results demonstrate that direct effects of the two kinase inhibitors on active arachidonic acid metabolites have to be excluded before using these compounds for the investigation of MAPKs in signal transduction pathways. This is of particular relevance to studies on the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 as these two MAPKs are capable of phosphorylating cytosolic phospholipase A2, thereby increasing its intrinsic activity.

Since specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascades were first described, they have been widely exploited to investigate the involvement of p38mapk(also called SAPK2a) and p42/p44mapk in intracellular signal transduction pathways. The pyridinylimidazole compound SB 203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole) was developed from a series of bicyclic pyridin-4-ylimidazoles that exhibited potent anti-inflammatory actions mediated via inhibition of cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α was decreased in human monocytes in the presence of these compounds, and they were therefore termed cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs. Further studies revealed that the molecular target of the pyridinylimidazoles was the stress-activated p38mapk (2Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

SB 203580 inhibits p38mapk and its isoform p38β (SAPK2b) with in vitro IC50values of 0.3–0.6 μm, but has no inhibitory action on SAPK3 and SAPK4 (4Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S.

The flavone compound PD 98059 (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)oxanaphthalen-4-one) is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian MAPK kinase (MEK) (7Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). It acts by binding to the inactivated form of MEK, thereby preventing its phosphorylation by c-Raf or MEK kinase (8Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). Depending on cell type and stimulation, the IC50 determined in intact cells ranges from 2 to 10 μm, values that are similar to those determined for inhibition of activation of MEK1 by Raf in vitro (7Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 9Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Kinetic properties suggest an allosteric mechanism for inhibition, which might be the reason for its high selectivity toward MEK (7Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc.

We have previously used SB 203580 and PD 98059 to investigate the involvement of p38mapk and p42/p44mapk, respectively, in the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and the activation of human platelets (10Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies, we have not observed an action of either drug consistent with inhibition of kinases other than their known targets. However, we have obtained evidence that SB 203580 and PD 98059 interfere with the conversion of arachidonic acid to the pro-aggregatory metabolite thromboxane (Tx) A2 (11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In platelets, the metabolism of arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase pathway results in the production of several active eicosanoids. The prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide PGH2 activates platelets (12Gresele P. Deckmyn H. Nenci G.G. Vermylen J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 158-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas its stable product, PGE2, can have pro-aggregatory or inhibitory effects depending on concentration (13Vezza R. Roberti R. Nenci G.G. Gresele P. Blood. 1993; 82: 2704-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGH2 is the substrate for thromboxane synthase and is converted by this enzyme to TxA2 in platelets. In this study, we have investigated whether the reduction of TxA2 formation by SB 203580 and PD 98059 is due to inhibition of p38mapk and p42/p44mapk, respectively, or to a direct effect on arachidonic acid metabolism. SB 203580 and PD 98059 were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Lee (SmithKline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA) and Dr. A. R. Saltiel (Parke-Davis), respectively. SB 203580 was also obtained from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, United Kingdom). Purity of these compounds was >98%. Polyclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-1 antibody, purified cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for measuring PGE2 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.(Ann Arbor, MI). Polyclonal rabbit anti-p42mapk antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and rabbit anti-p38mapk antiserum was a gift from Dr. R. J. Ulevitch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). 5-[1,2-3H]Hydroxytryptamine (specific radioactivity of 25 Ci/mmol), [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (specific radioactivity of 212 Ci/mmol), and radioimmunoassay and EIA kits for measuring TxB2 were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Arachidonic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. PGH2(Calbiochem), dissolved in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (9:1), was stored at −70 °C; before experimentation, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2, and PGH2 was dissolved in acetone (100 μg/ml) (14Hamberg M. Svensson J. Wakabayashi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Furegrelate (Sigma) was dissolved in Tyrode's buffer. Prostacyclin was kindly donated by Wellcome Laboratories (Beckenham, Kent, UK). Bovine thrombin and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were obtained from Sigma. Collagen was purchased from Nycomed Arzneimittel (Munich, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade. 50 ml of blood was drawn on the day of experimentation from healthy volunteers by venipuncture using 7.5 ml of acidic citrate dextrose (120 mm sodium citrate, 110 mm glucose, and 80 mm citric acid) as anticoagulant. All solutions were prewarmed to 30 °C. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 ×g for 20 min, and platelets were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin. The platelet pellet was gently resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (20 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.25 mmNa2HPO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.3) and 150 μl of acidic citrate dextrose solution. Platelets were washed with a mixture of 25 ml of Tyrode's buffer and 3 ml of acidic citrate dextrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Tyrode's buffer, and the volume was adjusted to give 4 × 108 cells/ml. Platelets were allowed to rest for 30 min at 30 °C prior to experimentation. Platelets (500 μl) were incubated with Me2SO (0.4%), SB 203580 (20 μm), or PD 98059 (20 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C and stimulated with collagen, thrombin, arachidonic acid, or PGH2 under stirred conditions (1200 rpm). Aggregation was monitored in a Born lumi-aggregometer for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of EIA buffer (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% NaN3). The amount of TxB2 released was determined by radioimmunoassay or EIA as described (15Maclouf J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 86: 273-286Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation of p42mapk and p38mapk was measured after immunoprecipitation from platelet lysates using 5 μl of anti-p42mapk antibody or 2 μl of anti-p38mapkantiserum. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels that contained 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein co-polymerized with the acrylamide. Kinases were denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl and renatured for 16 h at 4 °C as described previously (16Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Gels were incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) for 1 h at 37 °C, extensively washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% Na4O2P7, and dried. After autoradiography, the region of MAPK was cut from the gel and Cerenkov-counted for radioactivity. Platelets were incubated with 10 μCi of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine for 1 h at 30 °C, washed, and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer. Stimulation of platelets was stopped with an equal volume of 6% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a Beckman scintillation counter to a 5% level of significance. Washed platelets were suspended at 2 × 109 cells/ml in 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, containing 25 mm NaCl, 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 12 mm trisodium citrate, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmEGTA, and microsomal fractions were prepared as described (17Habib A. Maclouf J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The suspension was sonicated on ice four times for 5 s and then centrifuged at 1500 × g. This process was repeated on the pellet, and both sonicates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pellet, representing the microsomal fraction, was suspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm benzamidine HCl. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford reaction (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Microsomes were stored at −70 °C. Thromboxane synthase activity was verified by the capacity of the platelet microsomes to convert PGH2 into TxB2. The amount of TxB2 produced was determined by EIA as described by Maclouf (15Maclouf J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 86: 273-286Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some experiments, microsomes were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with Me2SO (0.4%), SB 203580 (20 μm), or PD 98059 (20 μm). Platelets were preincubated with Me2SO (0.4%), SB 203580 (20 μm), or PD 98059 (20 μm) for 10 min and then incubated for 5 min with 1 μm arachidonic acid containing 1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by acidification (addition of 1 n HCl to reach pH 4), and lipids were extracted by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate. Samples were concentrated by evaporation and applied to silica thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck). Lipids were separated by ascending thin-layer chromatography in ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/H2O (110:50:20:100, v/v/v/v) as described (18Daret D. Blin P. Dorian B. Rigaud M. Larrue J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1473-1482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-cm fractions of the silica plate were scraped off, and the radioactive products were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry in a Beckman scintillation counter. Radioactive lipids were identified compared with the migration of standards. The 12-lipoxygenase product 12-[3H]hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid migrated close to [3H]arachidonic acid, and radioactivity from this lipid was added to untransformed [3H]arachidonic acid for the calculation of metabolite formation. For immunoprecipitation of cyclooxygenase-1, platelets were lysed in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm n-octyl glucoside, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm benzamidine HCl) (19Karim S. Habib A. Lévy-Toledano S. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12042-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and cyclooxygenase-1 was immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of polyclonal anti-cyclooxygenase-1 antibody and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B slurry overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by microcentrifugation and washed twice in the ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 8, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mmphenol at 37 °C and were incubated with buffer, Me2SO (2%; control), SB 203580 (20 μm), or PD 98059 (20 μm) for 10 min followed by hematin (1 μm) for 1 min. Cyclooxygenase-1 was stimulated with 25 μmarachidonic acid containing 1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid at 37 °C. After 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 volumes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and centrifugation for 1 min at 5000 × g. Lipids were extracted from the supernatant in 3 volumes of ethyl acetate and separated by thin-layer chromatography as described above. Cyclooxygenase-1 bound to protein A-Sepharose was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Cyclooxygenase-1 immunoprecipitation was verified by immunoblotting. For measuring transformation of arachidonic acid using purified cyclooxygenase, cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 were diluted to give PGE2 production within the linear range of the EIA kit. Cyclooxygenase was incubated with buffer, Me2SO, SB 203580, PD 98059, or indomethacin for 15 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of arachidonic acid (25 μm) as described above. Formation of PGE2 was measured using EIA according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen is dependent on the formation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid by the action of cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase. We have reported earlier that SB 203580 and PD 98059 inhibit platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of collagen. PD 98059 is more powerful than SB 203580 in inhibiting this response (11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Its inhibitory action was only overcome by collagen at 20 μg/ml (Fig. 1 A), whereas the effect of SB 203580 was overcome at 5 μg/ml collagen (11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast to collagen, aggregation stimulated by thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) was not dependent on the release of TxA2, as demonstrated by preincubation with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (Fig. 1 B). The presence of neither PD 98059 (20 μm) nor SB 203580 (20 μm) altered the aggregation traced to thrombin (Fig. 1 B). These concentrations of PD 98059 and SB 203580 are sufficient to inhibit thrombin-induced activation of p42mapk and p38mapk, respectively (10Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Ulm S.L. Börsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The inclusion of Me2SO did not have any significant effect on platelet aggregation as tested with thrombin (0.1 units/ml) and collagen (10 μg/ml) (data not shown). SB 203580 and PD 98059 partially inhibited aggregation stimulated by the Ca2+ionophore A23187 (2 μm) (data not shown), a platelet stimulus that induces profound liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids (21Halenda S.P. Zavoico G.B. Feinstein M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12484-12491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, aggregation induced by A23187 in the presence of the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin was not altered in the presence of PD 98059 or SB 203580 (data not shown). Thus, SB 203580 and PD 98059 impaired platelet aggregation only under conditions where formation of TxA2 contributed to the response. Thromboxane formation stimulated by collagen (2 and 5 μg/ml), as measured by EIA, was partially inhibited by SB 203580 and completely blocked by PD 98059 (Fig. 2), which is in agreement with the effects of the compounds on aggregation. In addition, release of 5-hydroxytryptamine stimulated by collagen in the absence of indomethacin was reduced by both compounds, but could be overcome at higher concentrations of collagen (Fig. 3).Figure 3Release of 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine from platelets.5-[3H]Hydroxytryptamine-radiolabeled platelets (4 × 108 cells/ml) were incubated with Me2SO (1%; ▪), SB 203580 (20 μm; ○), or PD 98059 (20 μm; ▵) and stimulated with collagen for 2 min at 37 °C under stirred conditions. Platelets were fixed in glutaraldehyde solution, and the release of 3H into the buffer was determined.

SB 203580 and PD 98059 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by 0.2 μm arachidonic acid with approximate IC50values of 3 and 0.8 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Aggregation stimulated by 1 μmarachidonic acid was reduced by 50% in the presence of SB 203508 (20 μm) and was blocked by PD 98059 (20 μm)(Fig. 1 C). Moreover, both compounds inhibited formation of TxB2 from arachidonic acid (1 μm) as measured by EIA (Table I). These observations demonstrate that both inhibitors interfere with the metabolism of arachidonic acid to TxA2.Table IT×B2 formation from intact platelets and platelet microsomesIntact plateletsng T×B2/4 × 108 plateletsPart A Me2SO/buffer0.15 ± 0.01 Me2SO/collagen4.25 ± 0.30 Me2SO/arachidonic acid5.08 ± 0.70 SB 203580/arachidonic acid0.24 ± 0.04 (p < 0.05) PD 98059/arachidonic acid0.30 ± 0.02 (p < 0.05) Me2SO/PGH23.67 ± 0.25 SB 203580/PGH20.26 ± 0.01 (p < 0.05) PD 98059/PGH23.84 ± 0.22Platelet microsomesng T×B2/4 × 108plateletsPart B Me2SO/PGH21.38 ± 0.16 SB 203580/PGH20.31 ± 0.04 (p < 0.05) PD 98059/PGH21.18 ± 0.10Platelets (4 × 108 platelets/ml) (Part A) or platelet microsome preparations (Part B) were preincubated with Me2SO (0.4%), SB 203580 (20 μm), or PD 98059 (20 μm) for 10 min and stimulated with collagen (10 μg/ml), arachidonic acid (1 μm), or PGH2 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C.

Arachidonic acid (0.2 and 1 μm) did not stimulate platelet p42mapk and caused weak activation of p38mapkrelative to activation by thrombin (Fig. 4). However, activation of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, the in vivo substrate of p38mapk, was not significantly enhanced above basal levels by arachidonic acid (data not shown). The TxA2 receptor agonist U46619 has been reported to cause weak phosphorylation of p42mapk and p38mapk (20Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Ulm S.L. Börsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, arachidonic acid and its metabolites seem to be only weak stimulators of MAPKs. Because the kinase inhibitors could interfere with the release of endogenous arachidonic acid through an effect on the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2, it was important to determine the transformation of arachidonic acid to TxB2 independent of the release of endogenous thromboxane. For this reason, we incubated platelets with [3H]arachidonic acid (1 μm) and measured the formation of 3H-labeled metabolites. 29.0 ± 4.6% of [3H]arachidonic acid (mean ± S.E., n = 4 (n = number of independent experiments)) added to platelets was metabolized to [3H]TxB2 in 10 min with little formation of the endoperoxide [3H]PGH2 (1.8 ± 0.3%) or its stable product, [3H]PGE2 (2.8 ± 0.7%) (Fig. 5). Untransformed [3H]arachidonic acid and the 12-lipoxygenase product 12-[3H]hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid constituted 42.9 ± 3.7% of total radioactivity. When platelets were incubated in the presence of the cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin, formation of [3H]TxB2, [3H]PGH2, and [3H]PGE2 was completely inhibited (Fig. 5 A). This was in contrast to incubation with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate (10 μm) (19Karim S. Habib A. Lévy-Toledano S. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12042-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Gorman R.R. Johnson R.A. Spilman C.H. Aiken J.W. Prostaglandins. 1983; 26: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which completely blocked the formation of [3H]TxB2, but increased the formation of its precursor, [3H]PGH2, to 13.5 ± 1.3% (n = 4) and of [3H]PGE2 to 14.4 ± 3.0% (n = 4) (Fig. 5 A). In the presence of SB 203580 or SB 203580 plus furegrelate, the metabolism of [3H]arachidonic acid was substantially inhibited with [3H]TxB2, [3H]PGH2, and [3H]PGE2, accounting for 2–5% of total radioactivity (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, in the presence of furegrelate, PD 98059 fully inhibited the formation of all three products (data not shown). These results confirm that SB 203580 and PD 98059 inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase. To test the possibility that both compounds cause direct inhibition of cyclooxygenase, we immunoprecipitated cyclooxygenase-1 from unstimulated platelets and measured its activity in vitro. Under resting conditions, neither p42mapk nor p38mapkis activated (11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-1 converted [3H]arachidonic acid to [3H]PGH2, which was measured as the chemically stable [3H]PGE2 (Fig. 6). There was no significant formation of [3H]PGE2 in the presence of either SB 203580 (20 μm) or PD 98059 (20 μm) (Fig. 6). The presence of Me2SO had no significant effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). Human platelets contain the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase-1, but not the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (23Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the inhibition of cyclooxygenase by the two kinase inhibitors, we measured the effect of increasing inhibitor concentrations on purified cyclooxygenase-1 and -2. SB 203580 and PD 98059 inhibited cyclooxygenase-1 with approximate IC50 values of 2 and 1 μm, respectively (Fig. 7 A). Inhibition was completely reversible for both compounds, as tested by preincubation of cyclooxygenase with 3 μm inhibitor before a 10-fold dilution and incubation with substrate (data not shown). Cyclooxygenase-2 was also inhibited by both compounds in a reversible manner. IC50 values were ∼2 and 4 μm for SB 203580 and PD 98059, respectively (Fig. 7 B). Inclusion of the solvent Me2SO did not reduce enzyme activity. The degree of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 by SB 203580 and PD 98059 (20 μm) was similar to that by a maximally effective concentration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (data not shown). Inhibition by SB 203580 could be overcome by increasing arachidonic acid concentrations; in the presence of SB 203580 (3 μm), the K m for arachidonic acid was increased without a change in the V max, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition (data not shown). In contrast, PD 98059 (3 μm) decreased theV max even at the highest concentration of arachidonic acid used (50 μm) (data not shown). To distinguish between the effects of the kinase inhibitors on cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase, we stimulated platelets with the cyclooxygenase product PGH2. SB 203580 inhibited PGH2-induced platelet aggregation, whereas PD 98059 did not alter the response (Fig. 1 D). In addition, the formation of TxB2 from 1 μg/ml PGH2 was inhibited by SB 203580, but not by PD 98059, as determined by EIA (Table I). It was important to determine the activity of thromboxane synthase independent of the stimulation of receptor-activated pathways and of activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2. We therefore measured the transformation of PGH2 to TxB2 on platelet microsomes, a membrane fraction that contains thromboxane synthase (17Habib A. Maclouf J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Microsomes were obtained from unstimulated platelets, which means that p42mapk and p38mapk were not activated. PGH2 added to microsomes was transformed to TxB2 as determined by radioimmunoassay (Table I). The presence of PD 98059 in this assay did not significantly alter the response, whereas the addition of SB 203580 blocked TxB2formation (Table I). These results demonstrate that SB 20350 (but not PD 98059) acts as a direct inhibitor of thromboxane synthase. Several studies have confirmed the selectivity of the kinase inhibitors SB 203580 and PD 98059 against a variety of kinases. SB 203580 was tested against 16 protein kinases and two phosphatases and was found to be selective against p38 and p38β (SAPK2a and SAPK2b), but to have no inhibitory effect on SAPK3, SAPK4, p42/p44mapk, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK1), or any of the upstream kinases (3Cuenda A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have observed that platelet responses dependent on the formation of TxA2 are inhibited by these compounds. However, since SB 203580 has been developed from drugs that are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, it is uncertain whether the inhibitory actions of SB 203580 on platelet responses can be interpreted as effects of p38mapk or whether they are due to inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, we have also observed inhibition of platelet activation by PD 98059 under conditions that have little effect on p42mapk activation. For these reasons, we set out to investigate the effects of these compounds on the arachidonic acid cascade. We obtained evidence for direct inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by SB 203580 from a variety of approaches: first, inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by stimuli that are dependent on TxA2 to elicit aggregation; second, inhibition of TxB2 release; third, inhibition of the conversion of [3H]arachidonic acid to 3H-labeled metabolites after the addition of [3H]arachidonic acid to intact platelets; and fourth, inhibition of the activity of immunoprecipitated cyclooxygenase-1 as measured in vitro. In addition, we found direct effects of SB 203580 on thromboxane synthase using PGH2 as agonist, as the following responses were inhibited: platelet aggregation, TxB2 formation from intact platelets, and conversion of PGH2 to TxB2 in platelet microsomes. PD 98059 was a more powerful inhibitor of thromboxane-dependent platelet aggregation than SB 203580. In intact platelets, PD 98059 was a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (approximate IC50 for inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation = 0.8 μm) than of MEK activation by Raf (IC50 = 2–10 μm in vivo) (7Dudley D.T.

Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, a 10-fold lower concentration of PD 98059 was sufficient to inhibit platelet aggregation, suggesting that this inhibition is independent of p42mapk. In fact, p42mapk was not activated by arachidonic acid under the conditions of the aggregation experiment. Moreover, PD 98059 does not alter phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 in collagen-activated platelets (11Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The interference with collagen-induced aggregation would therefore seem to reflect its inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase. In contrast to SB 203580, PD 98059 had no direct effect on thromboxane synthase. Inhibition of purified cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 was reversible for both compounds. The IC50 values for purified cyclooxygenase-1 agree with the values determined in platelet aggregation experiments. Cyclooxygenase-2 was slightly less susceptible to inhibition by SB 203580 and PD 98059 compared with cyclooxygenase-1. Marshall et al. (25Marshall P.J. Griswold D.E. Breton J. Webb E.F.

They speculated that this compound and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetoamidophenol and phenylbutazone act as radical scavengers and thereby decrease the availability of hydrogen peroxide intermediates during the enzymatic reaction (25Marshall P.J. Griswold D.E. Breton J. Webb E.F. Hillegass L.M. Sarau H.M. Newton J.J. Lee J.C. Bender P.E. Hanna N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar mechanism applies to SB 203580. The rate-limiting step for the liberation of TxA2 in human platelets is the formation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2(26Kramer R.M. Liscovitch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 13-30Google Scholar). Cytosolic phospholipase A2 is regulated by changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (27Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

SB 203580 and PD 98059 are important tools to investigate MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and the regulation of arachidonic acid release. However, as we show in this report, both compounds interfere directly with arachidonic acid metabolism through the cyclooxygenase pathway. Moreover, in other cases where arachidonic acid metabolites regulate the cell's response, a clear distinction between the effects of kinase inhibition and cyclooxygenase inhibition by SB 203580 and PD 98059 has to be made. For routine application of the inhibitors, we suggest that the compounds be used in conjunction with a cyclooxygenase blocker, such as indomethacin or aspirin, in order to be able to interpret results unambiguously. We thank Prof. J. Maclouf (INSERM U 346, Paris, France) for advice on the cyclooxygenase assay. We are grateful to Dr. A. R. Saltiel for PD 98059 and to Dr. J. C. Lee for SB 203580."

We reported previously that IL-1β rapidly activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and also induces Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. The current study demonstrates that overexpression of the dominant negative form of JNK1 or p54 JNK2/SAPKβ reduces Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production stimulated by IL-1β. Similarly, overexpression of the kinase-dead form of p38 MAPK also inhibits IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2production. These results suggest that activation of both JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK is required for Cox-2 expression after IL-1β activation. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that IL-1β activates MAP kinase kinase-4 (MKK4)/SEK1, MKK3, and MKK6 in renal mesangial cells.

Prostaglandin (PG)1 H synthase is a homodimer that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis. This bifunctional enzyme forms prostaglandins by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) by its inherent cyclooxygenase activity. PGG2 is subsequently reduced to PGH2 by the peroxidase activity of this enzyme. PGH2 serves as a common precursor for prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes (1DeWitt D. Smith W.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins are arachidonic acid metabolites that influence inflammatory responses, bone development, wound healing, hemostasis, reproductive function, glomerular filtration, and renal homeostasis. Furthermore, alterations in prostaglandin production have been linked to cardiovascular disease, chronic and acute inflammation, atherosclerosis, and colon cancer (2Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv.

There are two PGH synthase (also known as cyclooxygenase) isozymes that have been identified in humans bearing 60% homology: cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Cox-2 can be up-regulated by various stimuli including tumor promoters (4Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Recent papers have linked Cox-2 expression with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (10Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

These MAPK family members include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) p44 MAPK (ERK1) and p42 MAPK (ERK2); stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), also referred to as c-jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), which include p54 SAPKα/β/JNK2 and p45 SAPKγ/JNK1 and the p38 MAPKs (α, β, βII, γ, and δ). Phosphorylated MAPKs phosphorylate and activate downstream targets such as transcription factors and regulators of cell function, growth, and differentiation. Activation of these kinases involves a cascade in which the upstream activator MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK1–5 or Raf in the case of ERK) phosphorylates and activates MAPK/ERK kinases/MAPK kinases (MKKs) which include MKK1–7 and which phosphorylate and activate ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAPKs (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that both the JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK cascades are activated by the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as by a wide variety of cellular stresses such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and oxidative stress (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for these two kinase pathways as important signaling mechanisms underlying the inflammatory process. We demonstrated previously that p38 MAPK activation is linked to IL-1β-induced prostaglandin biosynthesis in renal mesangial cells (11Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that overexpression of a constitutively active truncation mutant of MEKK1, a putative upstream kinase of MKK4/SEK1, can induce Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin biosynthesis (14Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Pentland A.P. Templeton D.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated activation of JNK1 by the v-src oncogene and induction of Cox-2 expression (15Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the current study we have expressed either wild type or dominant negative constructs of both p38 MAPK and JNK, as well as their immediate upstream activators, to evaluate their role in IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression. The data presented in this manuscript suggest a requirement for both p38 MAPK and JNK activity for cytokine-induced Cox-2 expression. Control of Cox-2 expression by IL-1β may be linked to elements within the Cox-2 promoter which require activated transcription factor binding (16Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In conjunction with previous findings, our observations suggest a potential mechanism for transcriptional activation of the Cox-2 gene which involves the activation and binding of transcription factors induced by both p38 MAPK and JNK to facilitate full expression of Cox-2 in response to IL-1β stimulation.

GST-ATF-2 (1–96) and GST-p38 MAPK were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by GST-binding resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary mesangial cell cultures were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (17Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F634-F641PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.3 IU/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. All experiments were performed with confluent cells grown in 25-cm2 or 75-cm2 flasks and used at passages 10–18. For experiments carried out in serum-free media, cells were starved for 24 h before the experiments. For all other experiments, serum was reduced from 10% to 5% on the day of the experiment. Normal NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin Bs and 25 mm HEPES. p54 SAPKβ was subcloned into retroviral vector pLXSN, and 10 μg of plasmid DNA was purified and used to transfect PA317 retroviral packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 9078) with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc). Transfected clones were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then isolated with sterile glass cloning rings. Virus was harvested by placing 5 ml of mesangial medium RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.3 unit/ml insulin, 15 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin on confluent, 10-cm plates of transfected PA317 cultures. 1–24 h later the culture supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane (Gelman Sciences) and diluted 1:3 with mesangial medium. Hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene) was then added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml (18Miller B.W. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C130-C136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary rat mesangial cells were cultured as described previously (17Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F634-F641PubMed Google Scholar). 1 ml of the virus-containing solution was added to primary rat mesangial cells at 50–60% confluence. This procedure was repeated at 12 h. At 24 h the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced by normal mesangial medium. At 48–72 h, G418 was added to the medium at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. The medium was subsequently changed every 72 h. After two passages G418 was reduced to 250 μg/ml. MKK4/SEK1 wild type (SEK1-WT), a constitutively active mutant form of SEK1 (SEK1-ED), the dominant negative mutant of SEK1 (SEK1-AL), MKK3 wild type, kinase-dead form of MKK3, MKK6 wild type, or dominant negative mutant MKK6 was subcloned into the popRSV1 mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). The wild type or dominant negative mutant form of p38 MAPK or JNK1 was subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector. Primary cultures of rat mesangial cells were plated and transfected at 50–80% confluence with 20 μg of DNA/75-cm2 flask using LipofectAMINE. Stably transfected isolates were selected in 500 μg/ml of G418 for several weeks. At the time of harvest, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and lysed in whole cell extract (WCE) buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.7, 0.3 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μmNaVO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to which 6 × Laemmli sample buffer was added before heating. After boiling for 5 min, equal amounts of protein were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were saturated with 5% fat-free dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin TBS-T. After washing with 5% milk TBS-T solution, blots were incubated further for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:3,000 dilution in TBS-T. Blots were then washed five times in TBS-T before visualization. An Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection. Harvested cells were solubilized in WCE buffer. Protein kinase assays were performed using our previously described methods (11Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide was polymerized in the presence or absence of 200 μg/ml His-c-jun (1–79), His-c-jun (1–79, Ala63/73), or 400 μg/ml MBP. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed by incubation in 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h. The gel was then washed for 1 h with 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To denature the proteins, gels were incubated in 6 mguanidine-HCl, 20 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h. Proteins were then renatured by overnight incubation in 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.04% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the protein kinase assays, gels were equilibrated for 1 h in kinase buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 40 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 μm NaVO4. The kinase reaction was carried out for 1 h in kinase buffer with 30 μm ATP and 5 μCi/ml of [γ-32P]ATP. Finally, the gels were washed extensively in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate until washes were free of radioactivity. Autoradiography of dried gel was performed at −80 °C. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight with anti-p38 MAPK or anti-JNK antibody and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold WCE buffer. p38 MAPK activity was assayed using MBP or GST-ATF-2 (1–96) as the substrate at 30 °C for 20 min in 30 ml of kinase reaction buffer (5 μg of MBP or GST-ATF-2 (1–96) for p38 activity assay or His-c-jun (1–79) for JNK activity assay, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 mm MgCl2). The reaction was terminated with Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The phosphorylated His-c-jun, MBP, or GST-ATF-2 was visualized by autoradiography. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight with anti-MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 antibody and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold WCE buffer. The immunocomplex MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 activity assay using GST-p38 MAPK (10 μg/reaction) as the substrate was performed at 30 °C for 20 min in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (10 μg of GST-p38 MAPK, 100 μm ATP, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 mm MgCl2). The reaction was terminated with Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was used to reflect MKK3, MKK6, or MKK4/SEK1 activity. PGE2 in the overlying culture media was measured with a PGE2enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cayman Chemical). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using paired or unpaired Student's t test. A difference with a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine whether the activation of JNK/SAPK in response to IL-1β is required for induction of Cox-2 protein expression and PGE2biosynthesis, stably transfected cells overexpressing JNK/SAPK in rat glomerular mesangial cells as well as NIH 3T3 cells were used. We first investigated whether a catalytically inactive form of JNK1 would function as a dominant inhibitor of IL-1β induction of Cox-2 expression. Overexpression of both wild type and dominant negative mutant JNK1 in pcDNA3 was verified by a Western blot assay using an anti-JNK antibody. An immunocomplex JNK activity assay demonstrated that overexpression of the kinase-dead form of JNK1 resulted in decreased IL-1β-induced JNK activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, the kinase-dead mutant JNK1 inhibited Cox-2 protein expression and PGE2 production in response to IL-1β stimulation. In our experiments, we also evaluated whether the kinase-negative mutant of JNK2/p54 SAPKβ could inhibit Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production after IL-1β stimulation. Rat mesangial cells and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with either wild type JNK2/p54 SAPKβ or the JNK2/p54 SAPKβ kinase-inactive mutant were stimulated with IL-1β. Overexpression of JNK2/p54 SAPKβ was verified by the Western blot analysis followed by immunocomplex JNK activity assays that revealed that the kinase-negative form of p54 SAPKβ inhibited total JNK activity induced by IL-1β (data not shown). Similar to JNK1, the dominant negative JNK2/p54 SAPKβ expressed in pLXSN blocked IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production in renal mesangial cells (Fig. 2). This finding was also demonstrated in NIH 3T3 cells in which Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production were inhibited by the kinase-dead form of JNK2/p54 SAPKβ (data not shown). In experiments in which mesangial cells were infected with empty pLXSN we observed enhanced basal levels of Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production and a blunting of the response to IL-1β. Nevertheless kinase-dead JNK2 inhibited both basal and IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2production. These results demonstrate that JNK/SAPK is important for IL-1β activation of Cox-2 protein expression and that the activation of JNK/SAPK is necessary for IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production.Figure 2Effects of JNK2/p54 SAPKβ overexpression on IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production in mesangial cells. pLXSN vector, pLXSN p54 SAPKβ wild type (WT), or pLXSN p54 SAPK dominant negative mutant (MUT) was stably transfected into primary mesangial cell cultures.

Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK can effectively block Cox-2 expression and PGE2release stimulated by IL-1β in renal mesangial cells. To confirm further the physiological function of p38 MAPK in the regulation of Cox-2 protein expression, we analyzed the effects of overexpression of the kinase-inactive p38α MAPK mutant on IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production. As shown in Fig. 3, the dominant negative mutant form of p38α MAPK blocked Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production after IL-1β stimulation. These results demonstrate further the physiologic function of p38 MAPK in the regulation of IL-1β-stimulated Cox-2 induction and PGE2 synthesis. MKK3 and MKK6 are upstream kinases that activate and phosphorylate p38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo. To verify whether MKK3 and MKK6 are involved in IL-1β signaling, we first measured MKK3 and MKK6 activity by an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-p38 MAPK as the substrate and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK with an anti-phospho-specific p38 MAPK antibody. Fig. 4, A and B, demonstrates that IL-1β increases both MKK3 and MKK6 activity, suggesting that MKK3 and MKK6 may function as important mediators of IL-1β signaling. To determine whether MKK3 and MKK6 mediate IL-1β-induced p38 MAPK activation and Cox-2 expression in mesangial cells, we transfected mammalian expression plasmids encoding either epitope-tagged MKK3 or MKK6 wild type or the kinase-negative mutant. Stable overexpression of MKK3 (Fig. 5 A) and MKK6 (data not shown) in popRSV1were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG tag antibody. Transfection of cells with dominant negative MKK3 (Fig. 5 B) or MKK6 (data not shown) inhibited p38 MAPK after IL-1β stimulation. Importantly however, JNK phosphorylation was unaffected (data not shown). These data verify that MKK3 and MKK6 can activate p38 MAPK after IL-1β stimulation in renal mesangial cells. Furthermore, we examined the effects of the kinase-inactive mutant forms of MKK3 or MKK6 on Cox-2 expression and PGE2production stimulated by IL-1β. Interestingly, we observed that overexpression of either kinase-negative mutant (MKK3 or MKK6) resulted in the inhibition of IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis in renal mesangial cells (Figs. 5 and 6). One explanation for these results is that the expressed dominant negative protein binds the p38 MAPK substrates and prevents phosphorylation by either of the activated native MKK3 or MKK6 proteins. These results demonstrate that both MKK3 and MKK6 may mediate IL-1β-induced p38 MAPK activation as well as Cox-2 protein expression and PGE2 production.Figure 5Effects of MKK3 overexpression on IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production.popRSV vector, popRSV MKK3 (WT), or popRSV MKK3 dominant negative mutant (MUT) was stably transfected into primary mesangial cell cultures.

Overexpression of the kinase-negative mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 inhibits basal Cox-2 expression and PGE2production in NIH 3T3 cells cultured in serum-containing media (14Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Pentland A.P. Templeton D.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To determine whether MKK4/SEK1 was involved in the IL-1 signal transduction mechanism, we measured MKK4/SEK1 activity after IL-1β stimulation. We analyzed the MKK4 activity by an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-p38 MAPK as the substrate. We found that IL-1β can enhance MKK4/SEK1 activity in mesangial cells (Fig. 7 A). This finding suggests that MKK4/SEK1 may be involved in IL-1β signaling. We therefore tried to determine whether activation of MKK4/SEK1 is required for activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK and subsequent prostaglandin biosynthesis in mesangial cells. We established permanently transfected mesangial cells containing the wild type (SEK-WT), dominant negative mutant form (SEK-AL), or the constitutively active mutant form (SEK-ED) of MKK4/SEK1.When stimulated with IL-1β, we found that the dominant negative mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 (SEK-AL) inhibited both JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, the constitutively active mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 enhanced IL-1β-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 7, B and C). These results suggest that MKK4/SEK1 can mediate IL-1β-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation in the intact mesangial cell. More importantly, our experiments show that the kinase-negative mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 (SEK-AL) inhibits IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2production. By comparison, the constitutively active mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 (SEK-ED) enhanced IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production (Fig. 7, D and E). Together, these results suggest a role for MKK4/SEK1 in IL-1β-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation and modulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis in renal mesangial cells. The inflammatory cytokine IL-1 is a potent immunoregulatory and proinflammatory agent involved in a variety of pathological processes such as the response to infection, activated lymphocyte products, microbial toxins, and other stimuli (19Taub D.D. Oppenheim J.J. Ther. Immunol. 1994; 1: 229-246PubMed Google Scholar). In glomerular inflammation, infiltrating macrophages produce IL-1, which activates renal mesangial cells and promotes glomerular injury. Our laboratory has reported previously that IL-1β induces Cox-2 protein expression with concomitant synthesis of prostaglandins such as PGE2 in renal mesangial cells (11Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Miller B.W. Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Clin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11689-11693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The induction of this key mediator may provide a critical mechanism involved in IL-1-induced renal inflammation. Recent studies suggest that activation of Cox-2 is not only involved in the pathogenesis of renal inflammatory diseases but may also play a critical role in normal kidney development, differentiation, and function (22Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Loftin C.D. Tiano H.F. Vouloumanos N. Jennette J.C. Mahler J.F. Kluckman K.D. Leford A.L. Lee C.A. Smithies O.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Although much effort has been made to identify the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by IL-1, the signal transduction mechanisms by which IL-1 induces Cox-2 protein expression and prostaglandin production are still unclear. Several recent reports indicate that an important group of protein kinases, the MAPKs, may be involved in these signaling processes. The MAPK pathways have been implicated as a mechanism by which signals are transduced from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to a variety of different stimuli and participate in intracellular processes by further inducing the phosphorylation of intracellular substrates such as other protein kinases and transcription factors. This signaling mechanism is believed to control a wide spectrum of cellular physiological and pathophysiological processes including cell growth, differentiation, and stress responses (12Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Recent work has demonstrated that both JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK cascades are activated by the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as by a wide variety of cellular stresses such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and oxidative stress (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an important role for these two kinase pathways in the signaling mechanisms recruited as part of the inflammatory process. Recent work suggests that the MAPK pathway is also involved in regulating prostaglandin biosynthesis. For example, activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 by thrombin involves activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK (23Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 24Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, we have shown previously that IL-1 stimulation of renal mesangial cells increases PGE2 production and Cox-2 expression concomitant with activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. We have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK dose-dependently inhibits IL-1β-mediated Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production (11Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the current study, overexpression of the kinase-inactive mutant p38α MAPK inhibits IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production, thus confirming further that activation of p38α MAPK is required for Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production. Herschman and his colleagues (15Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D.

To elucidate the physiological function of JNK/SAPK, we overexpressed both wild type and kinase-dead forms of JNK1 and JNK2/p54 SAPKβ in renal mesangial cells. The kinase-dead form of both JNK constructs markedly inhibits IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 release, thus confirming the requirement of JNK/SAPK activity for cytokine-induced prostaglandin biosynthesis. Previous data have suggested that MKK4/SEK1 is an immediate upstream kinase activating the JNK pathway (25Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). We recently reported that overexpression of a constitutively active mutant form of MKK4/SEK1 increases both JNK and p38 MAPK activity and phosphorylation (14Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Pentland A.P. Templeton D.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because IL-1β can activate MKK4/SEK1, we tested the effects of transfection of either constitutively active or dominant negative MKK4/SEK1. We observed that the dominant negative mutant MKK4/SEK1 inhibited IL-1β-induced JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation, whereas the constitutively active form activated both JNK and p38 MAPK. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative MKK4/SEK1 resulted in inhibition of IL-1β-induced cyclooxygenase expression and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Therefore, we believe that MKK4/SEK1 is an important upstream kinase that influences both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK activity, resulting in regulation of Cox-2 expression. Previous data have indicated that both MKK3 and MKK6 can activate and phosphorylate p38 MAPK (27Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 28Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that IL-1β increases the activity of both MKK3 and MKK6 in renal mesangial cells. To ascertain whether MKK3 and MKK6 function in the regulation of p38 MAPK activation and Cox-2 expression induced by IL-1β, wild type and kinase-dead MKK3 or MKK6 constructs were utilized. The data presented demonstrate that activation of either MKK3 or MKK6 can activate p38 MAPK and increase Cox-2 expression and PGE2synthesis with IL-1 stimulation. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant forms of either MKK3 or MKK6 results in marked inhibition of p38 MAPK activation and Cox-2 expression induced by IL-1β. Importantly the kinase-dead mutants do not affect activation of JNK by IL-1β. Overall, our data suggest that MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 are involved in cytokine-induced activation of p38 MAPK and resultant Cox-2 expression. The observation that p38α MAPK can be equally activated by MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 (29Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) suggests that p38α MAPK may function as a common substrate for these three MAPK kinases. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant form of any of these MAPK kinases may result in inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by either 1) competing with endogenous MAPK kinases for binding and activation of p38 MAPK or 2) by competing for activation by a putative upstream MAPK kinase kinase. The latter seems unlikely because dominant negative p38α does not affect MKK4 and JNK activation. The consequence of inhibition of MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6 activity is inhibition of IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression. The aforementioned results suggest that the activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK is necessary both for induction of Cox-2 protein expression and for PGE2 production in the renal mesangial cells when induced by IL-1β. This conclusion is based on the observation that the inhibition of either p38α MAPK or the JNK/SAPK pathway results in significant inhibition of IL-1β-induced Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production. Based on previous observations and our current findings, Fig. 8 depicts a hypothetical model for the combined role of p38 MAPK and JNK activation in the modulation of Cox-2 expression when mesangial cells are exposed to IL-1β. In summary, we demonstrate that activation of both SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK is required for Cox-2 expression and PGE2 production after IL-1β stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MKK4/SEK1, MKK3, and MKK6 are all involved in IL-1β-induced prostaglandin biosynthesis. MKK3 and MKK6 function as upstream regulators of p38 MAPK, whereas MKK4/SEK1 can function as the upstream kinase of both p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. We believe that the activation of both SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades together are crucial intracellular mechanisms that mediate Cox-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis induced by cytokine stress."

In zinc-limited cells, ZRT1 is a stable, N-glycosylated plasma membrane protein. Exposure to high levels of extracellular zinc triggers a rapid loss of ZRT1 uptake activity.

The plasma membrane is an essential barrier between the extracellular milieu and the interior of the cell. The large number of receptors and transport proteins embedded in this membrane facilitate communication between the exterior and interior of the cell, selective accumulation of nutrients, and efflux of ions and other substrates. Controlling the activity of these receptors and transporters is a critical part of how cells respond to fluctuating extracellular signals and changing nutrient availability. While transcriptional regulation is one facet of this control, there is a growing appreciation for the importance of protein trafficking in controlling the activity of plasma membrane proteins. In mammalian cells, endocytosis of cytokine and growth factor receptors occurs following binding of the ligand to the receptor (1Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Ligand binding triggers the movement of these receptors into clathrin-coated pits, internalization into endosomes, and subsequent delivery to lysosomes where they are degraded. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a similar mechanism of regulated endocytosis and degradation has been found for several plasma membrane proteins. For example, binding of the α-factor mating pheromone to its receptor triggers endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex and subsequent degradation in the vacuole, the lysosome-like compartment of the yeast cell (2Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This response attenuates the effects of mating pheromone during periods of prolonged exposure. Several nutrient transporters are endocytosed in response to the increased availability of a preferred substrate. Glucose, the preferred carbon source for yeast, signals the endocytosis of the GAL2 galactose permease and the MAL61 maltose permease (3Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chiang H.-L.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, NH4+ signals endocytosis of the GAP1 amino acid permease because ammonium is preferred over amino acids as a source of nitrogen (7Hein C. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulated endocytosis also controls the activity of nutrient transporters in response to changing metabolic demands. The FUR4 uracil transporter is endocytosed in nutrient-starved cells or in cells in which protein synthesis is inhibited (9Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This decrease in uracil uptake capacity may prevent futile RNA synthesis. Finally, yeast transporters can be removed from the plasma membrane in response to high levels of their corresponding substrate; this regulation presumably prevents overaccumulation of that substrate if it suddenly becomes abundant in the cell's environment. For example, the ITR1 inositol transporter is endocytosed in response to high levels of inositol (10Lai K. Bolognese C.P. Swift S. McGraw P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2525-2534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate the important role that regulated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins plays in controlling nutrient uptake and responses to extracellular signals. Because of its facile genetics, yeast is an excellent model system for study of this intriguing problem of protein trafficking. In this report, we demonstrate the role of regulated endocytosis in the homeostatic control of a metal ion, zinc. Zinc is an essential nutrient for all organisms. This metal is a catalytic component of over 300 enzymes (11Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar) and also plays a structural role in many proteins. For example, several motifs found in transcriptional regulatory proteins are stabilized by zinc including the zinc finger, zinc cluster, and RING finger domains (12Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Proteins containing these motifs are very common; for example, almost 2% of the genes in the S. cerevisiae genome encode proteins with zinc-dependent DNA-binding domains (13Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Bohm S. Frishman D. Mewes H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although zinc is an essential nutrient, it can be toxic if excess amounts are accumulated. The precise cause of zinc toxicity is unknown but the metal may bind to inappropriate intracellular ligands or compete with other metals for enzyme active sites, transporter proteins, etc. Therefore, in the face of fluctuating extracellular zinc levels, cells must maintain an adequate intracellular zinc level to meet cellular requirements while preventing metal ion overaccumulation. Mechanisms of regulating intracellular zinc levels or availability include binding of the metal by metallothioneins (15Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), zinc storage in intracellular compartments (16Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and transport of the metal out of the cell (17Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The primary control point for zinc homeostasis in S. cerevisiae is the regulation of zinc uptake across the plasma membrane. Zinc uptake activity in yeast is mediated by two systems. A high affinity system is active in zinc-limited cells and the ZRT1 gene encodes the transporter for this system (18Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A low affinity transporter is active in zinc-replete cells and is encoded by the ZRT2 gene (19Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). ZRT1 and ZRT2 proteins share 67% sequence similarity and share a similarly high degree of relatedness to the IRT1 Fe2+transporter (20Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and the ZIP1, ZIP2, ZIP3, and ZIP4 zinc transporters of Arabidopsis thaliana (21Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These proteins are members of a growing family of metal ion transporters that have also been identified in protozoans, nematodes, and humans. Transcription of both ZRT1 and ZRT2 is induced in zinc-limited cells, this induction is mediated by the ZAP1 transcriptional activator (22Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In low zinc conditions, ZAP1 activates expression of the ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes by as much as 30-fold. Zinc inhibits ZAP1 function and limits expression in zinc-replete cells through an unknown mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that the ZRT1 zinc transporter is also regulated by a separate, post-translational mechanism. We found that under low zinc conditions, ZRT1 is a stable plasma membrane protein. Exposure of cells to high zinc levels triggers internalization of the protein via endocytosis and its subsequent degradation in the vacuole. This post-translational regulatory system limits zinc uptake when cells are exposed to a sudden increase in extracellular zinc levels, thereby preventing the potentially harmful overaccumulation of the metal. Strains used in this study are described in Table I. DEY1531 and RG3248 are isogenic to DY1457 and were generated by backcrossing the relevant mutant alleles (end4::LEU2 and pep4::HIS3 prb1::LEU2, respectively) from their nonisogenic parent strains into the DY1457 genetic background. Yeast were grown in SD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) supplemented with auxotrophic requirements and either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Where indicated, this medium was made zinc limiting by adding 1 mm EDTA. A low zinc medium (LZM),1 prepared in a similar manner as LIM (26Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), had the following composition: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, (NH4)2SO4, or zinc (BIO101); 0.5% (NH4)2SO4; 10 mmtrisodium citrate, pH 4.2; 2% glucose; 1 mmNa2EDTA; and 1% adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. The MnCl2 and FeCl3 concentrations in LZM were adjusted to final concentrations of 25 and 10 μm, respectively. Cell number in liquid cultures was determined by measuring the optical density of the cell suspension at 600 nm (OD600) and converting to cell number with a standard curve.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeFull genotypeReference/sourceDY1457Wild typeMATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura318Zhao H.

A 900-base pair SacI-PflMI fragment was generated in which a sequence encoding a single hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (30Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was fused to the ZRT1 open reading frame immediately following the methionine initiation codon. This fragment was inserted into SacI-PflMI digested pMC5-HS (18Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) to generate pMC5-HSET. Plasmid pOE1-ET was constructed by isolating the epitope-tagged ZRT1 open reading frame from pMC5-HSET by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing either a BamHI or a SacI site on their 5′ ends. This fragment was then inserted intoBamHI-SacI-digested pRS316-GAL1 (31Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pOE1-3ET was constructed by digesting pOE1-ET with AatII, which cuts within the HA epitope sequence, and inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding two additional HA epitopes. A 2-kilobase XhoI-SacI fragment containing theGAL1 promoter and the ZRT1–3ET open reading frame was transferred from pOE1–3ET to YIp306 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Measurement of total cell-associated zinc levels was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Cells were harvested, washed twice with an equal volume of distilled deionized water, twice with an equal volume of 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in one-fifth volume 6 m nitric acid, and incubated at 95 °C for 24 h. The acid-digested samples were then assayed for zinc content on a Varian Spectra AA-30 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Cells (100 ml, OD600 of 1–2) were harvested by centrifuging 5 min at 1000 × g and washed with an equal volume of distilled water. These cells were resuspended in 20 ml 1 mTris-SO4, pH 9.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, collected by centrifugation, washed once in spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm KHPO4 pH 7.4), resuspended in 10 ml spheroplasting buffer plus zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku) (5 mg/g cells), and incubated at 30 °C for 30–45 min. Cells were then washed three times in an equal volume of spheroplasting buffer, resuspended in 10 ml 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A), and disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the pellet of unbroken cells was discarded. Where indicated, the supernatant was centrifuged 30 min at 123,000 × g at 4 °C and the supernatant (soluble) and pellet (particulate/membrane) fractions were collected. Immunoblots were performed as described (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody specific to the HA epitope tag (12CA5, BABCO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Pierce) were used and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Plasmid p352-HA (36Dancis A.

Densitometric scanning was performed using a CCD camera and IMAGE 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health). Linearity of ECL signal intensity was confirmed with a control immunoblot of serially diluted protein samples. EndoH and peptide N-glycosidase F were purchased from New England Biolabs and used following the manufacturers instructions. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed essentially as described by Pringle et al. (39Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were fixed in 10 volumes of cold methanol (−20 °C) for 30 min. Fixed cells were treated with glusulase to remove the cell wall and bound to polylysine-treated glass slides. The cells were blocked in PBS + 1 mg/ml BSA (PBS/BSA) by incubating at room temperature for 2 h and stained with 12CA5 antibody (1:200 dilution in PBS/BSA) at room temperature for 16 h. Following washing of the cells, goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to ALEXA 488 (Molecular Probes) was applied (1:200 dilution in PBS/BSA) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed 10 times in PBS and viewed using epifluorescence and Nomarski optics. To allow immunological detection of the ZRT1 protein, the ZRT1 gene was epitope-tagged with either one or three tandem copies of the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at its amino terminus immediately following the methionine initiation codon. These proteins (referred to as ZRT1-ET and ZRT1–3ET, respectively) are functional as demonstrated by (i) their ability to complement a zrt1mutant for zinc-limited growth and (ii) 65Zn uptake activity that is indistinguishable from wild type ZRT1 (data not shown). On immunoblots, multiple protein bands of approximately 40–45 kDa molecular mass were detected in cells expressing theZRT1-ET allele (Fig. 1 A). These bands were not observed in cells expressing the untagged protein. These results demonstrate that the anti-HA antibody is specific for the epitope-tagged ZRT1 protein and does not detect other proteins in yeast. Similar results were obtained with the ZRT1–3ET protein although the immunoblot signal intensity was approximately 20-fold greater than that of ZRT1-ET (data not shown). A slower migrating form of epitope-tagged ZRT1 was also frequently observed on immunoblots (Fig. 1 A, arrow). This may be a dimeric ZRT1 complex given that the molecular mass of this band was 80–90 kDa,i.e. twice the apparent monomeric ZRT1 molecular mass. Although ZRT1-ET was not detected in total cell homogenates, the protein was detectable in a subcellular fraction in which cellular membranes were enriched (Fig. 1 A). This result suggests that ZRT1 is an integral membrane protein; further experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Treatment with detergents (Triton X-100,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) released ZRT1 into the soluble fraction whereas agents that can only dissociate peripheral membrane proteins (i.e. 10 mmNa2CO3 at pH 10, NaCl, NaBr, or urea) (40Thomas T.C. McNamee M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) did not (data not shown). The multiple ZRT1 bands observed suggested that this protein may be subject to post-translational modification. To test if ZRT1 wasN-glycosylated, a particulate/membrane fraction isolated from cells expressing epitope-tagged ZRT1 was treated with the glycosidases EndoH or peptide N-glycosidase F. EndoH cleaves the chitobiose core of high mannose oligosaccharides fromN-linked glycoproteins, whereas peptideN-glycosidase F cleaves between the asparagine and the innermost N-acetylglucosamine of the carbohydrate. Either treatment reduced the apparent molecular mass of ZRT1 from the 40–45-kDa bands to a single band of 31 kDa (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that the size heterogeneity observed for ZRT1 is due to different degrees of N-linked glycosylation. It should be noted ZRT1 size heterogeneity was not always observed (see below) and the reason for this inconsistency is unknown. Expression of the ZRT1 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by zinc; ZRT1 mRNA synthesis is induced by zinc limitation and repressed during culturing in zinc-replete media (18Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). As we show here, ZRT1 activity is also regulated by zinc through a separate post-translational mechanism. When zinc-limited cells expressing a high level of ZRT1 were treated with a high concentration of extracellular zinc, a rapid loss of zinc uptake activity occurred that was not observed when cells were maintained in a zinc-limiting medium (Fig. 2 A). The loss of activity upon zinc treatment was preceded by an initial lag period of 10–20 min. The post-translational nature of the effect of zinc on ZRT1 activity was demonstrated in two ways. First, treatment of cells with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, did not prevent the loss of uptake activity in zinc-treated cells (Fig. 2 A, dashedlines). Second, zinc-induced loss of uptake activity was also observed in zrt1 mutant cells expressing ZRT1 from the zinc-insensitive GAL1 promoter (GAL1p-ZRT1) (Fig. 2 B). In this experiment, expression from the GAL1promoter was repressed at time 0 by the addition of glucose and protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. Similar data were obtained for the GAL1p-ZRT1 fusion in the absence of cycloheximide (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that (i) the ZRT1 zinc transporter is regulated by zinc by a post-translational mechanism that is separate from the previously characterized transcriptional control; (ii) new protein synthesis is not required for the post-translational response to occur; and (iii) expression of ZRT1 from the GAL1 promoter can be used to study this response without the added complexity of the zinc-responsive transcriptional control. The half-lives (t½) of uptake activity loss were estimated from the linear portions of the graphs in Fig. 2 (Table III). With or without cycloheximide treatment, the t½ for loss of zinc uptake activity decreased by greater than 7-fold following zinc addition. Identical results were obtained with a zrt1 mutant expressing ZRT1-ET from a high-copy plasmid (pMC5-HSET). The t½ of uptake activity loss in zinc-treated cells expressing ZRT1 from theGAL1 promoter was reproducibly higher than that observed in cells expressing the transporter from its own promoter; the reason for this difference is not yet known. These t½ values highlight the stability of ZRT1 uptake activity in low zinc conditions and its remarkable rate of loss in the presence of high zinc.Table IIIHalf-life of zinc uptake activity lossWild typezrt1− CHX+ CHXpMC5-HSETpOE1-ET−Zn>150>150>150>150+Zn23202137The t 1/2 values (in min) were calculated from the linear portions of the graphs described in the legend to Fig. 2 and are representative of several repetitions of these experiments.

Plasmids pMC5-HSET and pOE1-ET are described in Table II. CHX, cycloheximide. Immunoblots indicated that zinc-dependent inactivation of ZRT1 activity is accompanied by degradation of the ZRT1 protein. Following cycloheximide treatment, the ZRT1 protein was stable in zinc-limited cells but rapidly degraded in zinc-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). As was the case for the loss of uptake activity, protein loss occurred after an initial lag period of approximately 30 min. Densitometric quantitation of the band intensities in Fig. 3 A is shown in Fig. 3 B, thet½ for protein loss was determined from these data. In zinc-treated cells, the ZRT1 protein was degraded with at½ 39 min) that was 25% or less of thet½ (>150 min) observed in zinc-limited cells. We noted that the loss of protein in zinc-treated cells occurred more slowly than the loss of uptake activity (i.e. compare at½ for protein of 39 min and at½ for uptake of 21 min). This result suggested that inactivation of ZRT1 uptake activity is not the direct result of proteolytic degradation but rather that degradation may occur later in the inactivation process. Similar experiments performed with expression of ZRT1 from the GAL1 promoter yielded qualitatively similar results in which ZRT1 was less stable in zinc-treated cells (Fig. 3 C). As was observed for loss of uptake activity, degradation of ZRT1 occurred more slowly (t½ of approximately 65 min) in the cells grown in galactose than in glucose-grown cells. To determine if the degradation of ZRT1 in response to zinc was specific to ZRT1 or part of a more global change in plasma membrane protein composition, we examined the stability of other yeast plasma membrane proteins in zinc-treated cells. The abundance of the CTR1 copper transporter, the FET4 iron transporter, and the PMA1 H+-ATPase was not greatly altered by zinc treatment (Fig. 3 C, data not shown). Thus, zinc-induced ZRT1 inactivation appears to be a specific response of the zinc transporter. The rapid decline of ZRT1 zinc uptake activity is accompanied by an equally dramatic increase in cell-associated zinc levels (Fig. 4 A). The maximum cell-associated zinc level (∼1.3 nmol/106 cells), observed in this experiment after 90 min, was 6-fold higher than the maximum steady-state level observed in our previous studies of zinc-responsive transcriptional control (∼0.2 nmol/106cells) (18Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Given this extremely high level of metal ion accumu"

We studied the effect of H. pylori on the expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in MKN 28 gastric mucosal cells.

PGs synthesis depends on the activity of a constitutively expressed and an inducible PG endoperoxide synthase/cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2, respectively) (10Eberhart C.E. DuBois R.N.

Mounting evidence indicates that COX-2 is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis (12Elder D.J.E. Paraskeva C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1999-2008PubMed Google Scholar, 13Williams C.S. Smalley W. DuBois R.N. J. Clin.

Smalley W. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, COX-2 overexpression has recently been reported in human gastric adenocarcinoma (14Ristimaki A. Honkanen N. Jankala H. Sipponen P. Harkonen M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1276-1280PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of COX-2 in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis is still unclear, its up-regulation is probably an early event (13Williams C.S. Smalley W. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This study was designed to evaluate whether H. pyloriaffects COX-1 and COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis in gastric mucosal cells (i.e. MKN 28 cells) (15Motoyama T. Hojo H. Watanabe H. Acta Pathol. Jpn. 1986; 36: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 16Romano M. Razandi M. Sekhon S. Krause W.J. Ivey K.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 111: 430-440PubMed Google Scholar) in vitro and to study the role of H. pylori virulence factors in any such effect. We found that H. pyloritime-dependently up-regulated COX-2 mRNA expression and significantly increased the release of PGE2. This was partially related to the expression of two bacterial virulence factors (i.e. PicA and PicB) responsible for cytokine production by gastric cells (7Tummuru M.K.R. Sharma S. Blaser M. J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 867-876Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We postulate that COX-2-related events may contribute to development of gastric adenocarcinoma associated withH. pylori infection. MKN 28 cells are derived from a human gastric tubular adenocarcinoma (15Motoyama T. Hojo H. Watanabe H. Acta Pathol. Jpn. 1986; 36: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar) and show gastric type differentiation (16Romano M. Razandi M. Sekhon S. Krause W.J. Ivey K.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 111: 430-440PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, as described previously (17Romano M.

We have used the urease positive VacA+ CagA+ wild-type H. pylori 60190 strain (ATCC 49503) and isogenic mutants in whichvacA, cagA, vacA and cagA, picA orpicB genes were disrupted by insertional mutagenesis (5Cover T.L.

We also used the VacA− CagA− H. pylori strain Bx2 U+ and its urease-negative mutant Bx2 U− (provided by F Megraud, Bordeaux, France) and the CCUG 17874 (VacA+ CagA+) strain (from the culture collection of the University of Goteborg, Goteborg, Sweden). Bacteria were grown in brucella broth supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24–36 h at 37 °C in a thermostatic shaker under microaerobic conditions. As described previously (17Romano M. Ricci V. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Del Vecchio Blanco C. Bruni C.B. Ventura U. Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Coffey R.J. Zarrilli R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), when the bacterial suspensions reached 1.2 optical density units at 450 nm, bacteria were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were sterilized by passage through a 0.22-μm pore size cellulose acetate filter (Nalge Co, Rochester, NY) to obtain the broth culture filtrates. Broth culture filtrates from different bacterial strains and different preparations from the same strain were standardized by growing the bacterial suspensions until they reached an optical density of 1.2 units at 450 nm, which corresponds to a bacterial concentration of 5 × 108 CFU/ml. The presence or absence of VacA and/or CagA in H. pylori cells or filtrate was verified by means of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-VacA or anti-CagA polyclonal antiserum, as described previously (17Romano M. Ricci V. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Del Vecchio Blanco C. Bruni C.B. Ventura U. Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Coffey R.J. Zarrilli R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the experiments with bacterial suspensions, cells were incubated with bacterial preparations at the concentration of 5 × 107 CFU/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was isolated from MKN 28 cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate acid-phenol procedure and subjected to Northern analysis as described previously (17Romano M. Ricci V. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Del Vecchio Blanco C. Bruni C.B. Ventura U. Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Coffey R.J. Zarrilli R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). COX-1 mRNA expression was analyzed on poly(A)+ RNA from untreated (control) and H. pylori-treated cells. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Amersham poly(A)+ RNA kit (Amersham Italia Srl, Milano, Italy) according to the manufacturer's procedures. In brief, 10 μg of total or poly(A)+ RNA/lane was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Italia Srl), cross-linked (UV Stratalinker-1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and hybridized to32P-labeled cDNA probes. 32P-Labeled isotopes were from Amersham Corp. The COX-1 probe was aHindIII/PstI 514-base pair fragment corresponding to the 3′ end of the human COX-1 cDNA (11Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar). The COX-2 probe was a 276-base pair EcoRI/EcoRI fragment of the human COX-2 cDNA (11Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar). COX-2 mRNA levels were normalized to mRNA levels of the constitutively expressed GAPDH gene. mRNA levels were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograph using a Howtek Scanmaster-3 densitometer with RFL Print-TM software (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Cologno Monzese, Italy). Semi-confluent monolayers were washed three times with DMEM (37 °C) and incubated for 24 h with uninoculated broth filtrate (control) or with broth culture filtrates from H. pylori 60190 wild-type strain or its isogenic vacA, cagA, picA, orpicB mutants. Uninoculated broth filtrate and broth culture filtrates were diluted 1:3 in DMEM not supplemented with fetal calf serum. The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were combined with corresponding monolayers, and protein was determined with the Bradford's dye binding test. PGE2 concentration in the conditioned media was measured directly in triplicate with a highly sensitive125I radioimmunoassay kit according to the procedure indicated by the manufacturer (Amersham Italia Srl). Briefly, conditioned media were subjected to solid phase extraction, and extracted PGE2 was converted into its methyl oximate derivative using the methyl oximation reagent provided by the manufacturer. Samples were then stored at −70 °C in N2atmosphere before analysis. Standards in the range of 1.25–160 pg PGE2/tube were treated in the same way as the samples, and the curve was calculated by regression analysis. The limit of detection was 1.0 pg of PGE2 in 0.1 ml volume/assay tube. For PGE2, cross-reactivity with PGE1 was 5% and with all other PGs was less than 0.01%. Cross-reactivity between uninoculated broth filtrate and broth culture filtrates and antiserum to PGE2 was evaluated in each assay experiment and found to be not significant. Results were expressed as pg/mg protein. Significance of differences was assessed by one-way analysis of variance and, when the F value was significant, by Duncan's multiple range test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. To evaluate the effect of H. pylori on COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression, MKN 28 cells were incubated for up to 48 h with bacterial suspensions or broth culture filtrates derived from aH. pylori 60190 (wild-type) strain. We did not detect any basal level of COX-1 mRNA expression, nor did we find any increase in COX-1 mRNA expression following exposure of MKN 28 cells toH. pylori (data not shown). There was, however, a time-dependent increase in COX-2 mRNA content in these cells in response to H. pylori (Fig. 1). The increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was evident after 12 h of treatment, reached a peak at 24 h (5-fold increase versus control), and declined at 48 h (Fig. 1). To determine whether the increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was specific for H. pylori 60190, we evaluated the effect of a bacterial suspension or of a broth culture filtrate from wild-type H. pylori strain CCUG 17874 and obtained comparable results (data not shown). Because similar effects were obtained with bacterial suspensions or with broth culture filtrates from H. pylori 60190 or CCUG 17874 strains (data not shown), in the subsequent experiments, we used H. pylori broth culture filtrates only. To identify potential H. pylori virulence factors responsible for induction of COX-2 mRNA expression, MKN 28 cells were incubated for 24 h with uninoculated broth filtrate (control) or with broth culture filtrates from H. pylori 60190 (wild-type) strain or its isogenic mutants lacking vacA, cagA, vacA/cagA, picA, or picB. Fig. 2 shows that a comparable increase in COX-2 mRNA expression was observed independently of the vacAor cagA status. On the contrary, H. pyloristrains specifically lacking picA or picB, which are genes in the cag pathogenicity island whose expression are necessary for the induction of cytokine production (7Tummuru M.K.R. Sharma S. Blaser M. J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 867-876Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovski M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), were less efficient in the induction of COX-2 expression compared with the wild-type strain (approximately 2-fold increase compared with 5-fold increase, respectively). We also investigated whether urease-dependent ammonia generation might play a role in the up-regulation of COX-2. Broth culture filtrates from a urease positive (Bx2U+) strain and its urease negative mutant (Bx2U−) did not differ in the ability to induce COX-2 mRNA expression, nor did NH4Cl (4 mm) exert any effect on COX-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2). This concentration of NH4Cl was similar to the ammonia concentration present when MKN 28 cells were incubated with broth culture filtrates from all the urease-positive H. pylori strains used (4Ricci V. Sommi P. Fiocca R. Romano M. Solcia E. Ventura U. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar effects were induced by other Gram-negative bacteria, we studied the effect of Escherichia coli. That incubation of cells with broth culture filtrate or cell suspension from a clinicalE. coli isolate (ATCC 25922) did not have any effect on COX-2 mRNA expression compared with control (Fig. 2 and data not shown) suggests that the observed effects were due to unique properties of H. pylori. We also studied whether induction of COX-2 mRNA expression was associated with an increased release of PGE2 in the conditioned medium by MNK 28 cells. To address this issue, MKN 28 cells were incubated for 24 h with broth culture filtrates from H. pylori 60190 wild-type strain or from its isogenicvacA, cagA, picA, or picBmutants. H. pylori 60190 wild-type strain caused an approximately 3-fold increase in PGE2 release by MKN 28 cells compared with control cells (478 ± 126 pg/mg proteinversus 143 ± 42 pg/mg protein, respectively;p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). Comparable effects were observed using isogenic vacA orcagA mutants, thus confirming that VacA and CagA do not play a role in the up-regulation of COX-2 expression and activity. Incubation with isogenic picA or picB mutants still caused a significant increase in PGE2 release by MKN 28 cells (271 ± 65 pg/mg protein and 246 ± 55 pg/mg protein, respectively, versus 143 ± 42 pg/mg protein in control cells; p < 0.05), but this increase was significantly lower than that obtained with H pylori 60190 wild-type strain (approximately 45% reduction; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). Several studies indicate that H. pylori is an important risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach in humans (2Blaser M.J. Parsonnet J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 3Huang J.-Q. Sridhar S. Chen Y. Hunt R.H.

Although the role of COX-2 in the carcinogenesis of the gut is unknown, its up-regulation represents an early event (13Williams C.S. Smalley W. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This study was therefore designed to evaluate COX-2 expression and activity in gastric mucosal cells exposed to H. pylori, in vitro. Our data show that H. pylori up-regulates COX-2 mRNA expression and stimulates the release of PGE2 in MKN 28 gastric mucosal cells in vitro, effects not only observed with H. pylori suspensions but also with broth culture filtrates, suggesting that it might be mediated by a soluble product released from the bacterium. VacA, CagA, and urease-generated ammonia do not seem to play a role. That H. pylori 60190 isogenicpicA and picB mutants are less effective than the parental wild-type strain in the induction of COX-2 expression and PGE2 release suggests that PicA and PicB may contribute to the increased COX-2 expression and activity, possibly through stimulation of cytokine production. In fact, the expression of picA and picB plays a major role in H. pylori-mediated induction of cytokine production by gastric mucosal cells in vitro (7Tummuru M.K.R. Sharma S. Blaser M. J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 867-876Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytokines are known to induce COX-2 expression (11Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar). Because H. pylori 60190 isogenic picA and picB mutants, even though to a lesser extent than the parental wild-type strain, still up-regulate COX-2 expression and activity, other factors may be involved. EGF-related growth factors are known to up-regulate COX-2 expression through activation of the EGF receptor (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. DuBois R.N. Jetton T. Morrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We have recently shown an increase in the expression of heparin binding-EGF-like growth factor and amphiregulin, members of the EGF receptor ligand family, as early as 4 h following incubation of MKN 28 gastric mucosal cells with H. pylori broth culture filtrates or suspension (17Romano M. Ricci V. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Del Vecchio Blanco C. Bruni C.B. Ventura U. Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Coffey R.J. Zarrilli R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because in the present study induction of COX-2 mRNA expression starts at 12 h of incubation, we hypothesize that H. pylori-induced up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA levels might be contributed to by EGF-related growth factors. In partial support of this hypothesis, we found that 24-h incubation with heparin binding-EGF-like growth factor or amphiregulin (10 nm) up-regulated COX-2 mRNA expression in MKN 28 cells (data not shown). MKN 28 cell line has been proven to be an appropriate model for the study of the response of gastric epithelial cells to H. pylori (4Ricci V. Sommi P. Fiocca R. Romano M. Solcia E. Ventura U. J.

Moreover, we previously have studied this cell line in comparison with human gastric cell monolayers obtained from normal gastric tissue to evaluate the response to cytotoxic drugs and to cytoprotective agents and obtained qualitatively similar results (16Romano M. Razandi M. Sekhon S. Krause W.J. Ivey K.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 111: 430-440PubMed Google Scholar). However, because these cells are derived from an adenocarcinoma, the effects observed could reflect the biology of tumor cells more than that of normal, nontransformed cells. This might explain the lack of detection of COX-1 mRNA, which has been shown to be constitutively expressed in the normal gastric mucosa (14Ristimaki A. Honkanen N. Jankala H. Sipponen P. Harkonen M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1276-1280PubMed Google Scholar). Recent preliminary reports indicate that in human gastric mucosa, COX-1 is mainly expressed in parietal cells, endothelial cells, and lamina propria macrophages (20Wu K.C. Jackson L. Mahida Y.R. Jenkins D. Hawkey C.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114 (abstr.): 334Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar,21To K.F. Chan F.K.L. Leung W.K. Sung J.Y. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114 (abstr.): 310Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Therefore, COX-1 mRNA levels might be below the level of detection in MKN 28 cell line that consists of mucus producing cells (15Motoyama T. Hojo H. Watanabe H. Acta Pathol. Jpn. 1986; 36: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 16Romano M. Razandi M. Sekhon S. Krause W.J. Ivey K.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 111: 430-440PubMed Google Scholar). Even though epidemiological evidence of causality suggests thatH. pylori is a human carcinogen (2Blaser M.J. Parsonnet J. J. Clin.

However, increased proliferative activity of epithelial cells in gastric mucosa colonized by H. pylori in the absence of a corresponding increase in apoptosis (22Peek Jr., R.M. Moss S.F. Tham K.T.

https://openalex.org/W1968884377,"The culture of human submandibular gland (HSG) cells on laminin-1 induces acinar differentiation. We identified a site on laminin involved in acinar differentiation using synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal G-domain of the laminin α1 and α2 chains. The α1 chain peptide AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT) decreases the size of acini formed on laminin-1. Cells cultured with either AG73 or the homologous α2 chain peptide MG73 (KNRLTIELEVRT) form structures that appear acinar-like, but the cell nuclei are not polarized to the basal surface and no lumen formation occurs, indicating that additional sites on laminin are required for complete differentiation. The G-domain of laminin-1 contains both integrin and heparin binding sites, and anti-β1-integrin antibodies disrupt acinar formation. Cell adhesion to the peptides and to E3, an elastase digest fragment of laminin-1 containing AG73, is specific, since other laminin peptides or EDTA do not compete the binding. Heparin and heparan sulfate decrease cell adhesion to AG73 and MG73 but anti-β1-integrin antibodies have no effect. Treating the cell surface with heparitinase inhibits adhesion to both AG73 and MG73. We isolated cell surface ligands using both peptide affinity chromatography and laminin-1 affinity chromatography. Treating the material bound to the affinity columns with heparitinase and chondroitinase enriches for a core protein identified as syndecan-1 by Western blot analysis, thus identifying a syndecan-1 binding site in the globular domain of laminin-1 and laminin-2. In summary, multiple interactions between laminin and HSG cells contribute to acinar differentiation, involving both β1-integrins and syndecan-1."

We describe here our study of human α3 AChRs stably expressed in a derivative of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Compared with the Xenopus oocyte expression system, stable mammalian cell lines provide several advantages. 1) We can obtain more reproducible and long lasting levels of AChR expression that are required for detailed single channel studies without the seasonal vagaries of transient expression in Xenopus oocytes. 2) We can better study the effects of chronic exposure to ligands such as nicotine than is convenient in a transient expression system like Xenopus oocytes. 3) Cell lines expressing various AChR subtypes provide a potential for drug discovery by high-throughput screening.

The number of high affinity nicotine-binding sites in the brains of tobacco smokers and animals chronically given nicotine is increased up to 2-fold (26Wonnacott S. Trends Pharmacol.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2216-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the amount of increase varies between brain regions and probably involves several AChR types (28Pauly J. Marks M.

It has been hypothesized that smoking a cigarette results in a rapid bolus of nicotine that activates the mesolimbic dopaminergic system producing pleasure and reward and that nicotine in the smoker's brain slowly builds to a low steady concentration which causes both reversible desensitization and long term inactivation of some AChR subtypes as well as increases in the amount of some AChR subtypes (19Olale F. Gerzanich V. Kuryatov A. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dani J. Heinemann S.

An understanding of the effects of chronic exposure to nicotine on the amount and functional activity of various AChR subtypes might provide better insight into mechanisms of nicotine dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal, as well as the effects of medication with nicotinic drugs.Chronic exposure to nicotine has been shown to differentially affect both the amount and function of neuronal AChR subtypes. α4β2 AChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes or a permanently transfected cell line were shown to double in amount when chronically exposed to submicromolar concentrations of nicotine (34Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar). These concentrations of nicotine eliminated most α4β2 AChR function due to permanent desensitization (19Olale F. Gerzanich V. Kuryatov A. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar, 34Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a mixture of α3 AChRs expressed by the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y increased by 600% in response to chronic exposure to very high concentrations of nicotine (18Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Wang F. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Micromolar concentrations of nicotine blocked only a small part of α3 AChR function (19Olale F. Gerzanich V. Kuryatov A. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that some of the behavioral effects of nicotine are likely to depend on the inactivation of both α4β2 and α7 AChRs while leaving α3 AChRs and other subtypes available to respond to endogenous ACh-mediated signaling and to the micromolar boluses of nicotine that occur after inhaling smoke (19Olale F. Gerzanich V. Kuryatov A. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hsu Y. Amin J. Weiss D. Wecker L. J.

Here we provide an initial description of these cell lines, including pharmacological and electrophysiological characterization of their AChRs, and study the effects of chronic nicotine exposure on the amount of these AChRs.DISCUSSIONWe established stable cell lines that express four different subtypes of human α3 AChRs: α3β2, α3β2α5, α3β4, and α3β4α5. They form functional ion channels in the cell surface. We found that chronic exposure of cells expressing α3β2 AChRs or α3β2α5 AChRs to nicotine or carbamylcholine up-regulated the amount of AChRs up to 24-fold but had no effect on the amount of α3β4 or α3β4α5 AChRs, i.e. the up-regulation of α3 AChRs depends on the presence of β2 but not β4 subunits in the AChRs.Saturation binding curves of α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs with [3H]epibatidine indicated that α3 AChRs stably expressed in tsA201 cells (K D = 1.26 × 10−10m for α3β2 AChRs and 4.83 × 10−9m for α3β4 AChRs) have similar binding affinities as corresponding α3 AChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (K D = 1.2 × 10−10m for α3β2 and 4.9 × 10−9m for α3β4 (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)) or the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (K D1 = 1.5 × 10−10m and K D2 = 7.4 × 10−9m (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis indicated that AChRs expressed in the cell lines were consistent with the expected pentameric structure of AChRs and revealed no partially assembled AChRs. The expression levels for α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs were different, with α3β4 cell lines producing more AChRs. The different levels of expression between α3β2 and α3β4 in tsA201 cells were also seen in transiently transfected cells by solid phase RIA; thus, this is not an artifact of the particular lines chosen. This suggests that there are intrinsic differences between β2 and β4 subunits in either the efficiencies of synthesis, maturation, or assembly with α3 subunits or that the rate of AChR turnover is different between α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs. We consider the last three possibilities as being more likely because in the absence of protein synthesis nicotine could up-regulate the amount of α3β2 AChRs to a level similar to that found for α3β4 AChRs.The α3β4 cells expressed high levels of functional AChRs. Responses in the early passages of the cells following recloning were typically 5–10 nA in maximal amplitude at a holding potential of −60 mV. With higher numbers of passages (>15), the responses of the cells were somewhat reduced in amplitude (1–2 nA maximum at −60 mV) but were more than sufficient for functional studies. Concentration/response studies revealed EC50 values for activation by ACh and nicotine of 79 and 55 μm. These values are lower than the values of 163 and 106 μm observed when human α3β4 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These values are also significantly lower than what has been reported for rat α3β4 AChRs studied in transfected HEK-293 cells, but the order of potency with nicotine > ACh was the same (20Stetzer E. Ebbingbaus U. Storch A. Poteur L. Schrattenholz A. Kramer G. Methfessel C. Maelicke A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The EC50 values for ACh or nicotine activation of α3β4α5 AChRs (81 or 42 μm, respectively) were not greatly different from α3β4 AChRs. This may reflect the low percentage (14%) of AChRs that contained the α5 subunit in α3α5β4 tsA201 cells.Even after nicotine-induced up-regulation, α3β2-transfected tsA201 cells responded less robustly than β4-containing AChRs to applications of either ACh or nicotine, having maximum currents of 0.5–2 nA. This may in part reflect the more rapid desensitization of α3β2 AChRs. The EC50 values were 209 and 70 μm for ACh or nicotine, respectively, and nicotine had partial efficacy. α3β2 AChRs expressed in Xenopusoocytes had EC50 values of 28 and 6.8 μm for ACh and nicotine, respectively, and nicotine had an efficacy of 55% (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 49Gerzanich V. Wang F. Kuryatov A. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 311-320PubMed Google Scholar). The differences in EC50 or response kinetics between the cell lines and Xenopus oocyte expression were not due to the necessity to expose α3β2 AChR lines to nicotine to get substantial expression. We found that overnight exposure of oocytes to 100 μm nicotine followed by 1 h of rinsing did not increase the extent of response, change the kinetics of response, or change the EC50 values for ACh or nicotine on either α3β2 AChRs or α3β4 AChRs (data not shown). Thus, differences between responses of cell lines and oocytes probably reflect a combination of cell biological differences in membrane lipid composition, levels of protein phosphorylation, and other modifications as well as technical differences that permit more rapid and uniform agonist application to small cells than to large oocytes. No published report of the pharmacological properties of human α3β2 AChRs in transfected cells has appeared previously. The additional transfection of the α3β2 tsA201 cells with the α5 subunit resulted in an EC50 for ACh that was slightly lower than that for α3β2 AChRs. The difference could reflect changes in channel-gating kinetics but probably is due to agonist-induced channel block brought on by the addition of the α5 subunit to the channel forming region of the AChR causing a premature saturation in the concentration/response relationship. This would cause the appearance of a reduction in the EC50 value, as we believe is the case here, but would not reflect a true change in the affinity of the AChR for ACh. We conclude that although the EC50 values for activation of α3β2 or α3β2α5 AChRs by ACh are different, the difference is probably unrelated to agonist binding. This is consistent with the model proposed previously that the α5 subunit would be located in a position separating the α3 subunits of the α3β2 dimers with the agonist-binding site located between the α3 and β2 subunits (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In this position, the α5 subunit would not contribute to the agonist-binding site but would contribute to the lining of the channel of the AChR and influence the permeability, conductance, and gating properties of the channel. In contrast to what was observed in AChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 49Gerzanich V. Wang F. Kuryatov A. Lindstrom J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 311-320PubMed Google Scholar), the current decay of α3 AChRs was not accelerated by the coexpression of the α5 subunit. This might be explained by reduced incorporation of α5 into AChRs expressed in cell lines as compared with oocytes. In the case of α3β2α5 AChRs in the cell lines, 50% incorporation of α5 was sufficient to increase the efficacy of nicotine (relative to ACh) to about 80% as compared with the 100% value observed in oocytes.Previous studies of human AChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicated that as structural subunits, β2 and β4 make different contributions to the pharmacological as well as ion channel properties of α3 AChRs (16Wang F. Gerzanich V. Wells G. Anand R. Xiao P. Keyser K. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17656-17665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 17Gerzanich V. Peng X. Wang F.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimera constructs between rat β2 and β4 subunits proved that N-terminal extracellular domains of the two subunits are responsible (at least partially) for the different behaviors of α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs upon activation by agonists (51Chavez-Noriega L.E. Crona J.H. Washburn M.S. Urrutia A. Elliott K.J. Johnson E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 346-356PubMed Google Scholar).Differences in cytoplasmic domains between β2 and β4 subunits may also be important. It has been reported that both β2 and β4 subunits can substitute for β1 subunits in muscle AChRs. Only β4 and not β2, however, can associate with the muscle 43-kDa protein Rapsyn which interacts with the cytoplasmic domain to aggregate AChRs into patches and anchor them to the cytoskeleton (52Maimone M. Merlie J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 53-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 53Wheeler S. Jane S. Cross K. Chad J. Foreman R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We observed that α3β4 AChRs were aggregated into a dense array of patches on the surface of transfected cell lines, whereas α3β2 AChRs were not. It may well be that some Rapsyn-like proteins are expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line used here and account for the selective aggregation (and thus perhaps stabilization on the cell surface) of α3β4 AChRs. The selective expression of some α3 AChRs at post-synaptic locations and others in patches at peri-synaptic regions in ciliary ganglion neurons (54Horch H. Sargent P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7778-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may reflect differences in composition of β2, β4, and α5 subunits and in their consequent ability to interact with various AChR-associated proteins and cytoskeletal elements.We provide further evidence that β2 and β4 subunits play unique roles in α3 AChR subtypes by demonstrating different responses of α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs to chronic nicotine exposure. α3β2 AChRs can be up-regulated by nicotine up to 24-fold in tsA201 cell lines, but no significant change was observed for α3β4 AChRs. The same is also true when other agonists and antagonists were used to regulate the α3 AChRs. We have tested several different clones for each AChR subtype, with both higher and lower levels of expression, to demonstrate that the regulation of α3β2, but not α3β4 AChRs, by nicotinic ligands is a general phenomenon (data not shown). The up-regulation of α3β2 but not α3β4 AChRs in SH-SY5Y cells by nicotine also argues that the subunit dependence of the up-regulation response of α3 AChRs is not an artifact of the transfected cell lines.Nicotine-induced up-regulation of α3β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells can be detected as early as 15 min after the AChRs have been exposed to the drug. We suggest that the quick increase of α3β2 AChRs results from enhanced assembly of AChRs from existing stocks of subunits in the cell rather than from increased de novo synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by the experiments depicted in Fig. 9. Nicotine treatment during the first 30 min is shown to induce a large increase of assembled β2-containing AChRs (more than 5-fold) but not of total β2 subunits in the cell. The amount of α3β2 AChRs (measured by [3H]epibatidine binding) in the cells was increased (6-fold) upon nicotine exposure even without protein synthesis. In SH-SY5Y cells, neither increased mRNA synthesis for α3 AChR subunits nor decreased turnover rate of α3 AChRs was detected upon nicotine treatment (18Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Wang F. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that nicotine-induced up-regulation of α3 AChRs in SH-SY5Y cells can also be explained, at least partially, by enhanced subunit maturation or assembly. Consistent with what has been found for α4β2 AChRs in M10 cells, where nicotine caused a decrease in the rate of AChR turnover (34Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar), we also noted that α3β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells were stabilized by nicotine for at least 24 h. Thus, when exposed to nicotine in the tissue culture medium, at least two mechanisms are working in the cells to cause an increase in α3β2 AChRs.Phosphorylation of nAChRs has been implicated in the process of AChR up-regulation (46Blount P. Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Benowitz N. Porchet H. Jacob P. Wonnacott S. Russell M. Stolerman I.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 469-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). cAMP, through activation of protein kinase A, has been shown to up-regulate muscle type nAChRs by increasing the efficiency of subunit assembly and preventing AChR degradation (55Green W.N.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 469-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In studies not shown, we found that H-7, a protein kinase inhibitor, can block at least half of the up-regulation effect of nicotine on α3β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells. Whether H-7 blocks the up-regulation effect of nicotine on α3β2 AChRs by a direct effect on AChRs or on some protein which interacts with them is unknown.There are both common aspects and differences between human α3 AChRs in the transfected tsA201 cells and the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y with respect to regulation by ligands. α3β2 AChRs in both cell lines increased upon exposure to nicotine and carbamylcholine, which means that in both cases, the binding of agonists to α3β2 AChRs on the cell surface is enough to trigger the up-regulation process. But the maximum increase of α3β2 AChRs induced by nicotine or carbamylcholine is less in SH-SY5Y cells compared with tsA201 cells (6-versus 24-fold). Most of the increased AChRs in tsA201 cells were detected on the cell surface, whereas those from SH-SY5Y cells were all inside the cell (however, there was evidence that the increased AChRs had been transiently on the cell surface before they were internalized (18Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Wang F. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). It may be that SH-SY5Y cells lack an AChR-associated protein similar to Rapsyn which can stabilize α3β2 AChRs on the cell surface. Chronic treatment of the cells with the competitive antagonist curare or DHβE did not change the amount of α3 AChRs in SH-SY5Y cells but did cause an increase of α3β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells. The channel blocker mecamylamine did not cause nicotine-induced up-regulation of α3 AChRs in SH-SY5Y cells but did inhibit the up-regulation of α3β2 AChRs by nicotine. Supposing the up-regulation is mediated through signaling proteins inside the cells, the intrinsic differences among those proteins from two cell types with distinct origins might influence the up-regulation of the AChRs.

In this report, we describe the characterization of zinc-responsive elements (ZREs) in the promoters of the ZRT1, ZRT2, and ZAP1 genes.

The variety of roles that zinc plays in cellular processes is a prime example of the utility of metal ions in biology. Zinc is required for the activity of more than 300 enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, carbonic anhydrase, and many proteases (1Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Zinc is also important for the correct folding of specific domains in many proteins. The largest class of proteins that require zinc as a structural cofactor are transcription factors that contain zinc-dependent DNA-binding motifs, such as zinc fingers and zinc clusters (2Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, almost 2% of the genes in the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain zinc-dependent DNA binding domains (3Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4Bohm S. Frishman D. Mewes H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When zinc-dependent enzymes are also considered, perhaps as many as 5% of all yeast proteins require zinc for their function. Although an essential nutrient, zinc can be toxic if excess amounts are accumulated. The precise cause of zinc toxicity is unknown, but the metal may bind to inappropriate intracellular ligands or compete with other metal ions for enzyme active sites, transporter proteins, and so forth. Therefore, in the face of fluctuating extracellular zinc availability, cells must maintain an adequate intracellular zinc level to meet cellular requirements while preventing metal ion overaccumulation. Mechanisms of regulating the amount or availability of intracellular zinc include binding of the metal by metallothioneins (5Hamer D.H. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), storage in intracellular compartments (6Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and transport of zinc out of the cell (7Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the regulation of zinc homeostasis is mediated primarily through the control of zinc uptake across the plasma membrane (8Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has two separate uptake systems to obtain zinc from its environment. One system has a high affinity for zinc, and theZRT1 gene encodes the transporter protein of this system (9Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The second system is encoded by the ZRT2 gene and has lower affinity for zinc (8Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Both ZRT1 and ZRT2are regulated by zinc availability; zinc limitation inducesZRT1 and ZRT2 transcription, whereas growth under zinc-replete conditions represses their expression (9Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This zinc-responsive transcriptional regulation requires the activity of theZAP1 gene (10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). From our initial characterization of ZAP1, we proposed that this gene encodes a transcriptional activator, the function of which is repressed by zinc. This hypothesis was based on several observations. First, deletion of theZAP1 gene resulted in zinc-deficient phenotypes and abolished zinc-responsive expression of the ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes. Second, a semidominant mutation in ZAP1, called ZAP1–1 up, caused expression of these target genes in both zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells. Third, sequence analysis of ZAP1 indicated that the encoded protein shares similarity with many transcriptional activators; the C-terminal region contains five C2H2 zinc finger domains and the N terminus contains two acidic regions that could act as transcriptional activation domains. Finally, we found that ZAP1 was required to increase its own transcription in response to zinc, potentially through a positive autoregulatory mechanism. These observations established that ZAP1 plays a central role in zinc ion homeostasis by regulating transcription of the zinc uptake systems. As compelling as these data were, however, they failed to show whether ZAP1 plays a direct or an indirect role in the response. For example, an equally plausible alternative model was that ZAP1 is part of a signal transduction pathway that communicates the cellular zinc status to another protein, which then regulates transcription. In this report, we demonstrate that ZAP1 is in fact the transcriptional activator that directly controls zinc-responsive gene expression in yeast and identify its binding sites in the promoters of the ZRT1, ZRT2, and ZAP1 genes. Strains used were DY1457 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) and ZHY7 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 ZAP1–1 up) (10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown in standard culture media (synthetic defined and yeast extract-peptone media) (11Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% glucose and auxotrophic supplements. A low zinc medium (LZM)1 was prepared in a similar manner as LIM (12Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and had the following composition: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, (NH4)2SO4, or zinc (BIO101); 0.5% (NH4)2SO4; 10 mmNa3 citrate pH 4.2; 2% glucose; 1 mmNa2EDTA; and 0.01% each adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. The MnCl2 and FeCl3 concentrations in LZM were adjusted to final concentrations of 25 and 10 μm, respectively. Cell number in liquid cultures was determined by measuring the optical density of cell suspension at 600 nm (A 600) and converting to cell number with a standard curve. Cells were grown for 15–20 h to mid-exponential phase (A 600 = 0.5–1) in LZM or synthetic defined medium supplemented with different amounts of ZnCl2. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Guarente (13Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and is expressed in Miller units calculated as follows: (ΔA 420 × 1000)/(min × ml of culture used × absorbance of the culture at 600 nm). Control plasmids for β-galactosidase assays were pHIS4-UAS (14Hinnebusch A.G. Lucchini G. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and pLGΔ312 (15Pfeifer K. Prezant T. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Measurement of cell-associated zinc levels was performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Cells were washed twice with an equal volume of distilled deionized water, twice with an equal volume of 1 μm EDTA, resuspended in one-fifth volume 6 mnitric acid, and incubated at 95 °C for 24 h. The acid-digested samples were then assayed for zinc content on a Varian Spectra AA-30 atomic absorption spectrometer. Escherichia coliand yeast transformations were performed using standard methods (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The fusion and deletion junctions for all plasmids constructed were confirmed using the TaqTrack DNA sequencing method (Promega). Insert DNA fragments used for the 5′ deletion analysis of theZRT1 promoter were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using primers containing either a BamHI site (upstream primer) or an EcoRI site (downstream primer) added to their 5′-ends. These fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into similarly digested integrating vector YIp353 (18Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene. 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) to fuse the ZRT1 promoter region and translation initiation codon to the lacZ open reading frame. The numbering system used throughout this report to describe subcloned promoter regions is relative to the first base of the translation initiation codon, which is designated as +1. The resulting plasmids were linearized with NcoI to allow integration of the plasmid at the chromosomal URA3 locus after transformation (19Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Insert fragments for the plasmids containing internal deletions were generated by two-step overlapping polymerase chain reaction (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar), such that the 11-bp zinc-responsive element (ZRE) sequences were precisely removed. The resulting fragments were inserted into either YIp353 (forZRT1 analysis) or YEp353 (18Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J.

A fragment containing the full ZAP1 open reading frame was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using primers with eitherClaI or SacI sites added to their 5′-ends. The resulting fragment was inserted intoClaI-SacI-digested pBluescript SK+(Stratagene) to generate pSK+ZAP1. A 540-bpEcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding ZAP1 amino acids 687–880 was inserted into pBluescript SK+ to generate pSK+ZnF. Two plasmids were also generated for in vitro DNase I footprint analysis. Plasmid pSK+FPF is pBluescript SK+ with an inserted 362-bp ZRT1promoter fragment (from −361 to +1) and pSK+ZRT2 is pBluescript SK+ containing a 250-bp insert derived from theZRT2 promoter (i.e. position −375 to −74). Plasmids pBluescript SK+, pSK+ZAP1, and pSK+ZnF were linearized withSalI and used as templates for an in vitrotranscription/translation system (TnT, Promega). Annealed oligonucleotides were end-labeled using Klenow fragment DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) binding reactions were carried out in 15-μl volumes containing 10% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mmTris-Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnCl2, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 ng of annealed and32P-labeled oligonucleotides, and the stated volume of in vitro transcription/translation product. This mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels run at 4 °C, and visualized by autoradiography. The electrophoresis running buffer (50 mm Tris base, 400 mmglycine, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was supplemented with 20 μm ZnCl2 to ensure activity of the ZAP1 zinc finger domains. Plasmid pSK+FPF was linearized with EagI and end-labeled with Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. Subsequent digestion of the plasmid with BamHI generated a 360-bp fragment that was used as a probe for in vitro DNase I footprint analysis. Probes for the ZRT2 and ZAP1promoters were generated in a similar fashion from pSK+ZRT2 (8Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and pKO-ZAP1 (10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), respectively. These plasmids were linearized with EcoRI, end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP, and then digested with KpnI. Five μl of in vitro transcription/translation product was mixed with the labeled probe in the same binding reaction mixture used for EMSAs. Two μl of DNase I (1U/μl) was then added to each binding reaction and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by adding 30 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2m NaCl, and 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA). Samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol FF, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 10 mmEDTA), and resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel prior to autoradiography. Our previous studies indicated that the promoter of ZRT1 was completely contained within the upstream region extending from −706 to the translation initiation codon (+1) (9Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To map the ZREs that control expression of the ZRT1 gene, a progressive series of 5′ deletions was generated such that increasingly smaller fragments of theZRT1 promoter were fused to a lacZ reporter gene on an integrating plasmid vector (Fig. 1 A). These plasmids were transformed into a wild type strain and assayed for expression in cells grown under zinc-limiting and zinc-replete conditions. Deletion of 5′-flanking sequences from −706 to −521 had no effect on the zinc responsiveness of the reporter gene (data not shown). Deletion of the region from −521 to −361 reduced β-galactosidase activity in zinc-limited cells by approximately 20% with little effect on expression in zinc-replete cells. When sequences from −332 to −305 were deleted, an additional loss of zinc-limited expression was observed, again with no change in the zinc-replete expression. Finally, deletion from −221 to −201 completely eliminated expression in both media conditions. Initiation of transcription of ZRT1 was found by primer extension analysis to occur at a single site, position −45 (data not shown), indicating that the ZRT1 TATA box is unlikely to be affected by these deletions. The results obtained with the 5′ deletion series described in Fig. 1 A are consistent with there being at least three different ZREs in the ZRT1 promoter. Analysis of the DNA sequence of this promoter revealed the presence of a conserved 11-bp sequence (5′-ACC(C/T)(C/T)(A/G/C)AAGGT-3′) in each of the three regions implicated by the deletion series. These sequences are located at positions −319 to −309, −204 to −194, and, in the opposite orientation, −454 to −444, and we refer to them as ZRE1, ZRE2, and ZRE3, respectively. Deletion of any single ZRE from the full-length promoter had little or no effect on zinc-responsive gene expression, whereas deletion of two elements (e.g. ΔZRE1 ΔZRE2) greatly reduced expression. Deletion of all three elements completely eliminated expression. These data demonstrate that ZRE1, ZRE2, and ZRE3 are necessary to confer zinc-responsive gene expression on theZRT1 promoter. Moreover, the results show that these elements are required for the low level of ZRT1 expression observed in the zinc-replete conditions used in these experiments. We suggest that this expression is due to incomplete repression by zinc under these growth conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, higher concentrations of zinc (2 mm) completely repressed a full-length ZRT1-lacZ reporter gene (data not shown). To determine whether ZRE1, ZRE2, and/or ZRE3 are sufficient to confer this regulation, oligonucleotides containing these elements or portions thereof (Table I) were inserted into the promoter of a lacZ reporter gene bearing the CYC1TATA boxes but lacking an upstream activation sequence (i.e.a “minimal” CYC1 promoter). First, three overlapping clones containing all or portions of the ZRE1 sequence were tested for ZRE function. When assayed for β-galactosidase activity in zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells, the oligonucleotide insert containing the intact 11-bp sequence (i.e. Dg2) conferred zinc-responsive expression on the minimal CYC1 promoter, whereas the two flanking inserts (Dg0 and Dg3) did not. Mutant variants of the Dg2 oligonucleotide were also constructed such that the sequences of either the 5′ flanking 8 bp, the central 11 bp (i.e. ZRE1), or the 3′ flanking 11 bp (designated M1, M2, and M3, respectively) were altered by transversion mutations. Mutation of the conserved 11-bp sequence eliminated ZRE function, whereas mutation of DNA flanking either side of the sequence did not decrease the zinc responsiveness of the reporter gene. These results demonstrate that ZRE1 is sufficient as well as necessary to confer zinc-responsive regulation and indicate that sequences flanking the conserved 11-bp element are not required for this activity. These data also demonstrate that a single ZRE is active; multiple elements are not required for function. Oligonucleotide insertions containing the ZRE2 and ZRE3 elements were also sufficient to confer zinc-responsive gene expression. Moreover, ZRE3 was inserted in its normal orientation,i.e. opposite that of ZRE1 and ZRE2, indicating that these elements are functional in either orientation relative to the start site of transcription. The promoter region of the ZRT2 gene from −1047 to +1 was sufficient to confer wild type zinc-responsive expression on alacZ reporter (10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). An examination of this region for sequences similar to the ZREs of ZRT1 identified two potential elements located at positions −310 to −300 and, on the opposite strand, from −261 to −251. We refer to these sites as ZRE1 and ZRE2. To determine whether these are functional ZREs, we deleted ZRE1 and/or ZRE2 from the ZRT2-lacZ reporter. Deletion of each single element reduced zinc responsiveness, and deletion of both ZREs abolished the regulation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast with the ZRT1 promoter, the “ZRE-less” ZRT2-lacZreporter retained an almost normal level of expression in zinc-replete cells, suggesting that other factors may activate transcription of this gene under these conditions. Oligonucleotides containing the ZRE1 and ZRE2 elements of ZRT2 also conferred zinc-responsive gene expression on the minimal CYC1 promoter (Table I). Therefore, the two ZRT2 ZREs are both necessary and sufficient to confer zinc-responsive gene expression. Analysis of the ZAP1 promoter sequence identified a single potential ZRE at −143 to −133. Deletion of this sequence from theZAP1 promoter (−1111 to +1) eliminated expression of aZAP1-lacZ reporter (Fig. 1 C), and insertion of an oligonucleotide containing the ZAP1 ZRE conferred zinc-responsive regulation on the minimal CYC1 promoter (Table I). The data in Fig. 1 and Table I establish the identity of six different ZREs in the promoters of the ZRT1, ZRT2, and ZAP1 genes. Alignment of the sequences of these elements allowed the derivation of a consensus ZRE sequence, 5′-ACCYYNAAGGT-3′ (Fig. 2). No conserved bases were identified outside the central 11-bp element. This observation is consistent with our results from the mutational analysis of ZRT1 ZRE1, indicating that flanking sequences were not required for zinc responsiveness. Therefore, we propose that this 11-bp consensus sequence is the complete element responsible for zinc-responsive gene expression in yeast. The ZAP1 gene encodes a potential transcriptional activator protein. Previously, we hypothesized that ZAP1 directly controls the expression of the ZRT1, ZRT2, and ZAP1 genes in response to zinc. This hypothesis was based in part on the isolation of a semidominant mutation in the ZAP1 gene, calledZAP1–1 up, that causes high level expression of these genes under zinc-replete conditions (10Zhao H. Eide D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). If our hypothesis concerning the function of ZAP1 is correct, the increased expression caused by the ZAP1–1 up allele in zinc-replete cells should be exerted through the ZRE sequences. Therefore, we measured the effect of the ZAP1–1 up allele on several of the ZRE-lacZ fusion constructs described in Table I. Prior to assay for β-galactosidase activity, cells were grown in a zinc-replete medium in which the ZAP1–1 up allele effects are observed. In each case, expression of the ZRE lacZ reporter was elevated in the ZAP1–1 up mutant relative to wild type cells (Table I). We also examined the effect of theZAP1–1 up allele on the vector alone, on aHIS4-lacZ fusion (pUAS-HIS4), and on a fusion containing the entire CYC1 promoter fused to lacZ (pLGΔ312).ZAP1–1 up had no effect on expression of any of these promoters (Table I), indicating that this allele does not cause global changes in gene expression. Thus, the effects of theZAP1–1 up allele are mediated specifically through the ZRE sequences. An additional prediction of the hypothesis that ZAP1 is the direct regulator of zinc-responsive gene expression is that the ZAP1 protein binds directly to ZREs. To test this prediction, the full-length ZAP1 protein or a truncated ZAP1 polypeptide containing the five C-terminal zinc fingers (ZnF1–5) (Fig. 3 A) was produced with anin vitro transcription/translation system and used in EMSAs. The ZnF1–5 polypeptide comprises amino acids 687–880 of the full-length protein, and the probe used contained the ZRE1 sequence of ZRT1 (i.e. oligonucleotide Dg2, Table I). Protein/DNA complexes were not observed in reactions containing either no protein or increasing amounts of vector-programmed transcription/translation product (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). Protein/DNA complexes were observed when either the full-length ZAP1 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–7) or the ZnF1–5 fragment (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–10) was used in the assay. Whereas ZnF1–5 formed only a single complex, the full-length protein formed three distinct complexes. The multiple bands detected using full-length ZAP1 may be due to the formation of homomultimeric ZAP1 complexes or are an artifact of the in vitrotranscription/translation system. We favor the latter hypothesis because shift assays performed with yeast whole cell extracts showed only a single ZAP1-dependent complex. 2D. R. Winge, personal communication. Perhaps alternative translational start sites are being utilized during in vitroprotein synthesis or heteromultimers are forming with components of thein vitro system. The experiment described in Fig. 3 indicated that ZAP1 is a DNA-binding protein and that binding is conferred by one or more of the five C-terminal zinc fingers. To test whether binding is specific for ZREs, we performed a competitive EMSA analysis (Fig. 4). The probe used was the Dg2 fragment (Table I); competitor oligonucleotides were added in 100-fold molar excess. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, oligonucleotides that retained ZRE function (i.e. Dg2, M1, M3, and the other intact ZREs) were effective competitors of all three labeled"

Here we demonstrate that nuclear cataract is associated with the extensive hydroxylation of protein-bound amino acid residues, which increases with the development of cataract by up to 15-fold in the case of DOPA. The relative abundance of the oxidized amino acids in lens protein (assessed per parent amino acid) is DOPA > o- and m-tyrosine > 3-hydroxyvaline, 5-hydroxyleucine > dityrosine. Nigrescent cataracts, in which the normally transparent lens becomes black and opaque, contain the highest level of hydroxylated amino acids yet observed in a biological tissue: for example, per 1000 parent amino acid residues, DOPA, 15; 3-hydroxyvaline, 0.3; compared with dityrosine, 0.05. The products include representatives of the hydroperoxide and DOPA pathways of protein oxidation, which can give rise to secondary reactive species, radical and otherwise. The observed relative abundance corresponds closely with that of products of hydroxyl radical or metal-dependent oxidation of isolated proteins, and not with the patterns resulting from hypochlorite or tyrosyl-radical oxidation. Although very little light in the 300–400-nm range passes the cornea and the filter compounds of the eye, we nevertheless also demonstrate that photoxidation of lens proteins with light of 310 nm, the part of the spectrum in which protein aromatic residues have residual absorbance, does not give rise to the hydroxylated aliphatic amino acids. Thus the post-translational modification of crystallins by hydroxyl radicals/Fenton systems seems to dominate their in vivo oxidation, and it could explain the known features of such nuclear cataractogenesis.

Cataract is a major problem worldwide. At present the etiology of the cataract is poorly understood and the only treatment involves surgical removal of the opaque lens. In the developing world, access to ophthalmic facilities is a limiting factor; it is estimated that there are 4 million newly blind each year in India alone (1Minassian D.C. Mehra V. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1990; 74: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cost of surgical procedures is now a considerable proportion of the health budget of most developed nations (2Javitt J.C. Wang F. West S.K. Ann. Rev. Public Health. 1996; 17: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). There are two main types of age-related cataract, nuclear and cortical. In cortical cataract the opacity, localized in the outer region of the lens, is associated with an ionic imbalance (3Maraini G. Mangili R. The Human Lens in Relation to Cataract. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 79-95Google Scholar). Nuclear cataract is characterized by a high degree of light scattering in the center of the lens. In the vast majority of cases this opacity is colored (4Duncan G. Duncan G. Mechanisms of Cataract Formation in the Human Lens. Academic Press, London1981: 1-5Google Scholar). In most cases the lens in such patients is yellow or brown, but in rare cases the normally transparent and colorless lens can be transformed into a black opaque “nigrescent” cataract. Much of what is known about the biochemical changes associated with age-related cataract has come from studies in which cataractous lenses have been classified as types I–IV on the basis of an increase in nuclear color as first proposed by Pirie (5Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1968; 7: 634-642Google Scholar). Type I cataract is characterized mainly by cortical changes without significant nuclear alterations. It has been shown that the increase in nuclear color is closely linked with progressive increases in the amount of protein methionine sulfoxide, urea-insoluble protein, and crystallin cross-linking (6Buckingham R.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1972; 14: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Truscott R.J.W. Augusteyn R.C. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1980; 77: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). One of the earliest changes is the loss of protein sulfhydryl groups, and these decrease progressively with the development of cataract such that in type IV nuclear cataract less than 5% of the original sulfhydryl groups remain (8Truscott R.J.W. Augusteyn R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations it was postulated that the reaction of the lens proteins with H2O2 derived from superoxide may be responsible for the changes associated with nuclear cataract formation (7Truscott R.J.W. Augusteyn R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Peroxide is known to oxidize cysteine and methionine efficiently (11McNamara M. Augusteyn R. Exp. Eye Res. 1984; 38: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). H2O2 may be derived from the aqueous humor which bathes the anterior segment of the lens (13Spector A. Garner W.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and is the primary source of nutrients and oxygen, although the lens is remarkable in its ability to detoxify external peroxide (14Giblin F.J.

Sci. 1989; 30: 2195-2199PubMed Google Scholar). Since the human lens grows throughout life by the addition of fiber cells, and since the crystallins in the lens nucleus undergo little turnover (16Harding J.J. Cataract—Biochemistry, Epidemiology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, London1991Google Scholar), the proteins in the central region of the lens are as old as the individual. Thus post-translational modifications to these crystallins may accumulate over a person's lifetime. It is also possible that protein modifications linked with cataract could be the result of a reaction of lens crystallins with other oxidizing agents such as the hydroxyl radical (17Wolff S.P.

In this study we analyzed the nuclei and cortices of individual cataractous lenses to assess the involvement of the hydroxyl radical in the etiology of the nuclear cataract. We show that the development of human nuclear cataracts is associated with a pronounced increase in the levels of modified amino acids in the lens proteins, including representatives of the hydroperoxide and DOPA pathways. The observed results are consistent with hydroxyl radical damage, and not with photoxidation. We therefore propose that the hydroxyl radical may play a role in the development of the nuclear cataract in man. o-Phthaldialdehyde (OPA) crystals and OPA diluent (containing 3% potassium hydroxide and 3% boric acid at pH 10.4) were from Pickering Laboratories (Mountain View, CA). 2-Mercaptoethanol was from Sigma. Mercaptoacetic acid was from Merck (VIC, Australia). Other chemicals, solvents, and chromatographic materials were of analytical reagent or HPLC grade. Cataractous lenses were classified on the basis of nuclear color as described by Pirie (5Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1968; 7: 634-642Google Scholar). Nigrescent lenses were treated as a subcategory of type IV (nigrescent type IV). Lenses were stored at −20 °C and thawed immediately prior to dissection. Some nigrescent lenses, removed from patients attending eye camps in India, were shipped in alcohol and then stored at −20 °C. Analyses we performed on type I and IV cataractous lenses showed that storage in alcohol does not affect the content of the hydroxylated amino acids. Lenses were dissected using a 4-mm cork borer to obtain the central core, and the ends of the core were then removed. The average wet weight of the nucleus thus obtained was 20.3 mg. Cortices were obtained by taking a sample of the outer lens ring remaining after coring and removing the lens capsule. No reagents were added to the cortices, and no dialysis step was necessary. Lens samples were frozen individually in liquid nitrogen and powdered in an Eppendorf tube by using a Teflon hand homogenizer. After freeze-drying, the samples were hydrolyzed individually for analysis of oxidized amino acids, as follows. The issue of artifactual formation of oxidized amino acids during tissue homogenization has been studied extensively with human plaque tissue (31Fu S. Davies M.J. Stocker R. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). No formation of oxidized amino acids was observed when standards of tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, and leucine were added to the sample prior to mechanical homogenization. A gas phase and acid- catalyzed method described previously (23Gieseg S.P. Simpson J.A. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Dean R.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4780-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was adopted, in which mercaptoacetic acid (5% v/v) and phenol (1% w/v) were added to the HCl (6m) solution as reductant and antioxidant, respectively, to permit the optimal recovery of DOPA (95–100% as judged by the recovery of free DOPA). We also achieved 95–100% recovery of freeo- and m-tyrosine and dityrosine. The recovery of 3-hydroxyvaline (Val.OH1) was c.80% and of 5-hydroxyleucine (Leu.OH2) c.70%, as detailed previously (24Fu S. Hick L.A. Sheil M.M. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Dean R.T. Fu S. Gieseg G. Armstrong S.G. Punchard N.A. Kelly F.J.

The known quantity (approximately 4 mg) of dried lens powder was used for each hydrolysis. The hydrolysate was lyophilized and dissolved in about 200 μl water (such that the final sample concentration was 20 mg/ml hydrolysate) for HPLC analysis. Artifactual formation of m- and o-tyrosine (from free phenylalanine), and DOPA (from free tyrosine) during protein hydrolysis, in the presence or absence of protein, has also been investigated in detail in the study relating to human atherosclerotic plaques (31Fu S. Davies M.J. Stocker R. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The maximum artifactual formation ranges from 10 μmol of m-tyrosine/mol of phenylalanine, 20 μmol of o-tyrosine/mol of phenylalanine, to 100 μmol of DOPA/mol of tyrosine, which are low values compared with those reported in this study for either the normal or cataractous lenses. Artifactual formation of hydroxyvaline and hydroxyleucine was not observed during such protein hydrolysis. In comparable experiments in which these four amino acids were added to lens samples prior to freezing and powdering, and then taken through the hydrolysis procedure, indistinguishable results were obtained, confirming that artifactual oxidation was very limited. All HPLC analyses were carried out on a LC-10A HPLC system (Shimadzu) consisting of two pumps, a high pressure mixer, an autosampler, and a sample cooler. System operation and peak integration was driven by Class LC-10 software (Shimadzu) operated under a PC-based Windows environment. A column oven (Waters) set at 30 °C was also used for each analysis. Detection of Val.OH1 and Leu.OH2 requires two steps of HPLC. In the first step, the hydrolysate was fractionated on a LC-NH2column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, Supelco). The purified fraction was then analyzed by a second HPLC step on a Zorbax ODS column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, Rockland Technologies) following pre-column derivatization with OPA reagent. The detailed experimental conditions have been described previously (24Fu S. Hick L.A. Sheil M.M. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,27Fu S. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This second HPLC procedure was also used to measure unmodified valine, leucine, and phenylalanine in the hydrolysate (without any prior fractionation). For detection of DOPA, m-tyrosine,o-tyrosine, and dityrosine, the hydrolysate was separated on a Zorbax ODS column with a Pelliguard column (2 cm, Supelco). Elution at 1 ml/min was performed with a gradient of solvent A (100 mm sodium perchlorate in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.5) and solvent B (80% methanol in water) as described previously (32Fu S. Fu M.-X. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The eluent was monitored by both UV (Shimadzu, at 280 nm) and fluorescence (Hitachi F-1080) detectors in series. The excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm for all components, while the emission wavelength was set at 320 nm for DOPA, m-tyrosine,o-tyrosine, and 410 nm for dityrosine through the built-in time program of the detector. Quantitation of (unmodified)p-tyrosine was based on UV detection due to its off-scale response in the fluorescence channel. Pooled lens protein samples (10 mg) were hydrolyzed and then redissolved in water (500 μl). The samples were then fractionated using the standard HPLC methodology described above. DOPA and o-Tyr fractions were collected and combined from 25 injections of the hydrolysate (20 μl for each injection). The collected samples were freeze-dried and rechromatographed on the same HPLC column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, replacing the standard mobile phase solvent A (which contains 100 mmsodium perchlorate and 10 mm sodium phosphate). The desalted fractions were dissolved in 80 μl of 1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) and subjected to mass spectroscopic analysis. The electrospray mass spectrometry was conducted on a VG Platform mass spectrometer (Fisons, Homebush, NSW, Australia). The solvent (50% acetonitrile in water) was delivered by a Phoenix (Fisons) syringe pump at a flow rate of 100 μl/min; 10 μl of each sample solution were injected for analysis. Dry nitrogen gas at atmospheric pressure was employed to assist evaporation of the electrospray droplets. A positive electrospray mode was used with electrospray probe tip potential at 2.19 kV, counter-electrode potential at 0.5 kV, and cone potential at 20 V. Two human lenses (normal and nigrescent type IV) were used for determination of the proportion of free native and oxidized amino acids in lens compared with their population in lens proteins. Lens samples were powdered with the aid of liquid nitrogen and solubilized in water by sonicating. Proteins were precipitated out by means of trichloroacetic acid. Both the protein portion after amino acid hydrolysis and the supernatant portion were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. As summarized in Table I, the free amino acids comprised less than 1% of the total amino acids in proteins in lens, in agreement with published literature (7Truscott R.J.W. Augusteyn R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Truscott R.J.W. Augusteyn R.C. Exp.

There were no detectable oxidized amino acids in the supernatant portion of the samples, confirming that any oxidized amino acids found in the lens are protein-bound.Table IFree amino acids as percentages of total amino acids in human lensesAmino acidNormal lensNigrescent type IV lensTyr0.210.30Phe0.370.52Val0.830.89Leu0.400.47Dried and powdered human lens samples (4 mg, one normal and one nigrescent type IV) were dissolved in water (200 μl) by sonicating at 4 °C for 5 min.

After separation from the supernatant the protein pellet was hydrolyzed with the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” HPLC analyses for oxidized as well as native amino acids were carried out on both the supernatant and protein hydrolysate fractions.

Fig. 1 shows typical HPLC traces of hydrolysates of normal as well as cataractous lens proteins. Oxidized amino acids were identified on the basis of their coelution with spiked standards. The identification of the hydroxy-aliphatic amino acids is very strong, since they undergo two successive HPLC chromatography steps, in each of which they behave characteristically. Indeed, in Fig. 1 B, Leu.OH2 (peak 6) is essentially base-line resolved; similarly, Val.OH1 is well resolved from a smaller preceding peak, although the spiking material used in Fig. 1 B, ii, contains very large proportions of such an adjacent molecule, which gives a slightly misleading impression. Again the identification of the individual oxidized species is very strong, with dityrosine distinguished not only by its elution position, but also by its characteristic fluorescence spectrum. o-Tyrosine (peak 3) is closely followed by a smaller peak, not present in the spiking material (Fig. 1 A, ii versus i). All these individual chromatographic peaks could be readily integrated and well resolved, giving precise measurements of the oxidized species, which were quite reproducible (see below). Nevertheless, we used mass spectrometry of some such peaks isolated from pooled normal or pooled diseased lens proteins, to confirm their identity. Fig. 1 Cshows for the cases of DOPA and o-tyrosine that the relative abundance of the appropriate molecular ion in the two samples was similar to that observed by HPLC in the same samples, and in the later data for individual lenses. Mass spectrometry thus confirmed the identity of the species under study, although it cannot readily distinguish o-, m-, or p-tyrosine from each other. To obtain information on interassay variation for each oxidized amino acids, repeat analyses of the same lens sample were performed on different days. As summarized in Table II, the interassay variation for oxidized amino acids was generally larger (around 10%) than that for native amino acids (around 5%), which might be due to either the modest artifactual formation of oxidized moieties during hydrolysis (in the case of DOPA, dityrosine, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine) or to the need for two steps of HPLC with the extra inherent variability this entails (in the case of hydroxyvaline and hydroxyleucine).Table IIInterassay variation in the determination of oxidized and parent amino acidsOxidized amino acidsVariationnParent amino acidsVariationn%%DOPA14.54Tyr4.44Dityrosine10.14m-Tyr9.44Phe2.74o-Tyr9.44Val.OH110.03Val4.13Leu.OH214.33Leu4.73Repeat analysis of a type III lens sample was performed on different occasions using the same analytical procedure described under “Materials and Methods.” The interassay coefficients of variation were calculated according to the mean values and standard deviations as percentages (S.D. × 100/mean). Open table in a new tab Repeat analysis of a type III lens sample was performed on different occasions using the same analytical procedure described under “Materials and Methods.” The interassay coefficients of variation were calculated according to the mean values and standard deviations as percentages (S.D. × 100/mean). The levels of all six amino acid derivatives have been quantified in the separated nuclear and cortical proteins of normal and cataractous human lenses (Fig. 2). Statistical analysis by analysis of variance indicated no significant variation between nuclear and cortical material in any of the lens samples. But there was a marked dependence on cataract type for every oxidized amino acid (p < 0.001 in every case). When unpaired t tests were undertaken, nigrescent type IV and type III values were significantly different from normal lens values for each oxidized amino acid (p < 0.05 in every case). Statistical differences at p < 0.05 were observed in most cases for type II and in one case for type I versusnormal lens cortices and nuclei. The contents of the modified amino acids present in the normal lens are similar to those found in apoprotein B of freshly prepared (33Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal.

Since type I lenses are characterized by cortical cataract, this finding indicates that the development of such cortical opacity is not associated with a general increase in the levels of such modified amino acids, suggesting that the hydroxyl radical is not involved in the etiology of this form of cataract.Table IIIOxidized amino acids in fresh human plasma low density lipoproteinDOPA630 μmol/mol TyrDityrosine2 μmol/mol Tyrm Tyr260 μmol/mol Pheo-Tyr470 μmol/mol PheVal.OH125 μmol/mol ValLeu.OH213 μmol/mol LeuApoprotein B of freshly isolated human plasma low density lipoprotein was prepared as previously described (33Kritharides L.

The function of the nervous system depends on the highly specific pattern of connections formed between neurons during development. The specificity of these connections requires neurite extension toward the correct targets guided by the growth cone and remodeling of the initial pattern of connections in response to environmental signals (1Goodman C.S. Shatz C.J. Cell. 1993; 10 (suppl.): 77-98Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases (Rac, Cdc42, and Rho) has been demonstrated to play critical roles in the regulation of the cytoskeleton required for neurite extension and retraction. Studies on neuronal cell lines have shown that Rac and Cdc42 are required for the outgrowth of neurites, whereas Rho is required for their retraction (2Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Here we have demonstrated that constitutively active forms of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq, but not Gαi2, can trigger neurite retraction and cell rounding in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. These morphological changes were similar to those induced by a constitutively active form of RhoA, RhoAV14 (Fig. 2); and C3 exoenzyme, which specifically ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho (28Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited both neurite retraction and cell rounding induced by Gα12QL, Gα13QL, and GαqQL (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that activation of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq induces neurite retraction and cell rounding through the Rho-dependent signaling pathway in differentiated PC12 cells.Gα12 and Gα13, the members of the G12 class of heterotrimeric G proteins, show 67% amino acid identity to each other and often cause similar responses in various cell types, including transformation of fibroblasts, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascade, and stimulation of stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (31Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both Gα12 and Gα13 can trigger Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding. These findings suggest that Gα12 and Gα13 may interact with a common effector. In this study, however, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 blocked the Gα13QL-induced neurite retraction and cell rounding, whereas the Gα12QL-induced effects were not influenced by this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating that a tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in the signaling of Gα13, but not in that of Gα12. This finding strongly suggests that Gα12 and Gα13interact with different effectors to regulate neuronal cell morphology. The differences in the sensitivity to tyrphostin between Gα12 and Gα13 were also shown in the signaling of Gα12- and Gα13-stimulated stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (19Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was previously reported that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate Na+-H+ exchangers through different mechanisms in COS-7 cells (32Dhanasekaran N. Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Wadsworth S.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28829-28832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Gα12 and Gα13 activate different pathways to regulate their cellular functions.Activation of Gαq can stimulate the phospholipase C-β family, which results in stimulation of PKC activity and elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In this study, depletion of endogenous PKC by both TPA and the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 specifically diminished the amount of neurite-retracted cells induced by GαqQL, whereas the Gα12QL- and Gα13QL-induced morphological changes were not influenced (Figs. 7 and 9). In addition, elimination of extracellular Ca2+ also inhibited the effects of GαqQL, but not those of Gα12QL and Gα13QL (Figs. 8 and 9). It has been shown that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, products of phospholipase C activation pathways, activate Ca2+-permeable channels in plasma membranes (34Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 35Irvine R.F. Moor R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Recently, Gαq was reported to activate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-operated Ca2+-permeable channels (36Mochizuki-Oda N. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. Ito S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9651-9658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of extracellular Ca2+ for the Gαq-induced morphological changes could be interpreted by this Gαq-mediated Ca2+-permeable channel activation. Therefore, both PKC activation and Ca2+ influx are essential elements in the signaling of Gαq upstream of Rho. We also examined the involvement of phospholipase C in the GαqQL signaling using the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122, but this compound was cytotoxic for differentiated PC12 cells, and treatment with U-73122 alone caused cell detachment. 2H. Katoh, J. Aoki, Y. Yamaguchi, Y. Kitano, A. Ichikawa, and M. Negishi, unpublished observation. Interestingly, both PKC activity and Ca2+ influx as a result of phospholipase C activation appeared to be required for LPA-induced neurite retraction in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (7Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök Á. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that a Gq-coupled LPA receptor stimulates phospholipase C activity, and the resultant activation of PKC and Ca2+ influx induces Rho-dependent neurite retraction in PC12 cells. In contrast, prostaglandin EP3 receptor-induced neurite retraction was mediated through a PKC-independent pathway (9Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that G12 or G13 mediates the action of the EP3 receptor.Interestingly, the GαqQL-induced neurite retraction and cell rounding were also blocked by treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating that a tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in the signaling from Gαq to Rho. This study did not show whether this tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase acts upstream or downstream of Ca2+ and PKC in the signaling from Gαq to Rho. Since activation of Gαq can directly stimulate phospholipase C, which results in stimulation of PKC activity and elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, this tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase may act downstream of Ca2+ and PKC. Recently, the novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 has been shown to mediate Gq-coupled receptor-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in PC12 cells, and the activity of this tyrosine kinase appears to be regulated by elevation of the intracellular Ca2+concentration as well as by PKC activation (38Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Therefore, PYK2 can be speculated to be a candidate for the tyrosine kinase, which links the signal of Gαq to Rho for the induction of neurite retraction and cell rounding. A tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase was of course involved in the signaling of Gα13 to Rho. However, in contrast to Gαq, Gα13 did not require either PKC activation or Ca2+ influx. Two potential explanations for the difference between the signaling pathways of Gα13 and Gαq can be presented. One explanation is that an identical tyrosine kinase mediates the signals of Gα13 and Gαq to Rho, but the pathways of both α subunits to activate the tyrosine kinase are different; Gαq activates the kinase through PKC and Ca2+influx, whereas Gα13 activates the kinase independent of PKC. The other explanation is that different tyrosine kinases are involved in the pathways of both α subunits. We have summarized these possible pathways of signal transduction of three α subunits for Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding (Fig. 10).Expression of a GTPase-deficient form of Gαq in undifferentiated PC12 cells was recently shown to induce neurite outgrowth during 2–3 weeks using the retrovirus-mediated infection procedure (39Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, our results showed that expression of GαqQL in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells triggered neurite retraction within 3 h after microinjection. Therefore, these opposite effects of Gαq on the regulation of neurites may be due to different conditions of cells in differentiation or to a different time scale for examination of morphological effects.The data presented here demonstrated that constitutively active mutants of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq can induce neurite retraction and cell rounding through different signaling pathways, which, however, finally converge at activation of Rho (Fig. 10). Rho, like other small GTPases, functions as a molecular switch; it is active in its GTP-bound state and inactive in its GDP-bound state. Upstream activation of the cycle is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP (40Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A number of putative guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho and other Rho family GTPases have been identified, and some of these demonstrate Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor activityin vitro, including Lbc, Lfc, and Lsc (3Gebbink M.F.B.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, they appear to be expressed in the same cell type (42Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility for the existence of multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho in the same cell type may be related to the existence of different signaling pathways from Gα subunits to Rho activation.Recent studies have shown the involvement of the Rho family of small GTPases in the regulation of neurite outgrowth in primary neurons (37Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar,44Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion, inhibition of Rho with C3 exoenzyme stimulated the outgrowth of neurites (44Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of Rho suppresses neurite outgrowth in primary neurons. Therefore, Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq may play a negative regulator for neurite outgrowth through activation of Rho in primary neurons.In conclusion, we have here shown that activation of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq can trigger Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding in differentiated PC12 cells through different signaling pathways. This study will contribute to the understanding of the signal transduction between heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors and Rho in neuronal cells. The function of the nervous system depends on the highly specific pattern of connections formed between neurons during development. The specificity of these connections requires neurite extension toward the correct targets guided by the growth cone and remodeling of the initial pattern of connections in response to environmental signals (1Goodman C.S. Shatz C.J. Cell. 1993; 10 (suppl.): 77-98Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases (Rac, Cdc42, and Rho) has been demonstrated to play critical roles in the regulation of the cytoskeleton required for neurite extension and retraction. Studies on neuronal cell lines have shown that Rac and Cdc42 are required for the outgrowth of neurites, whereas Rho is required for their retraction (2Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 3Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. Horck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J.

Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The downstream effectors involved in these GTPase-mediated neuronal morphological effects have been elucidated. The p21-activated kinase PAK1 was shown to act downstream of Rac and Cdc42 to induce neurite outgrowth (4Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we recently revealed that the p160rhoA-binding kinase ROKα induces neurite retraction acting downstream of Rho (5Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signaling pathways upstream of these Rho family small GTPases in neuronal cells. The activation of a certain heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor, such as the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),1 sphingosine 1-phosphate, thrombin, and prostaglandin EP3 receptors, was shown to cause Rho-dependent neurite retraction in several neuronal cell lines (6Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 7Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök Á. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the heterotrimeric G proteins, which are coupled to those receptors for induction of neurite retraction, have not yet been identified. Previous studies demonstrated that pertussis toxin did not inhibit receptor-mediated neurite retraction (9Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), indicating that this action is not mediated by Gi or Go. Furthermore, the activation of Gs by cholera toxin or an elevation of cAMP by forskolin failed to induce neurite retraction, but rather suppressed the receptor-mediated neurite retraction (9Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök Á. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gs activation is not linked to induction of neurite retraction. The G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins, defined by Gα12 and Gα13, is the most recent family to be identified using a homology-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy (12Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although immediate downstream effectors have not yet been identified, studies with the constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 have resulted in the identification of several novel functions regulated by these Gα subunits, including transformation of fibroblasts (13Xu N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9651-9658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of extracellular Ca2+ for the Gαq-induced morphological changes could be interpreted by this Gαq-mediated Ca2+-permeable channel activation. Therefore, both PKC activation and Ca2+ influx are essential elements in the signaling of Gαq upstream of Rho. We also examined the involvement of phospholipase C in the GαqQL signaling using the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122, but this compound was cytotoxic for differentiated PC12 cells, and treatment with U-73122 alone caused cell detachment. 2H. Katoh, J. Aoki, Y. Yamaguchi, Y. Kitano, A. Ichikawa, and M. Negishi, unpublished observation. Interestingly, both PKC activity and Ca2+ influx as a result of phospholipase C activation appeared to be required for LPA-induced neurite retraction in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (7Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök Á. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that a Gq-coupled LPA receptor stimulates phospholipase C activity, and the resultant activation of PKC and Ca2+ influx induces Rho-dependent neurite retraction in PC12 cells. In contrast, prostaglandin EP3 receptor-induced neurite retraction was mediated through a PKC-independent pathway (9Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that G12 or G13 mediates the action of the EP3 receptor.Interestingly, the GαqQL-induced neurite retraction and cell rounding were also blocked by treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating that a tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in the signaling from Gαq to Rho. This study did not show whether this tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase acts upstream or downstream of Ca2+ and PKC in the signaling from Gαq to Rho. Since activation of Gαq can directly stimulate phospholipase C, which results in stimulation of PKC activity and elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, this tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase may act downstream of Ca2+ and PKC. Recently, the novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 has been shown to mediate Gq-coupled receptor-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in PC12 cells, and the activity of this tyrosine kinase appears to be regulated by elevation of the intracellular Ca2+concentration as well as by PKC activation (38Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Therefore, PYK2 can be speculated to be a candidate for the tyrosine kinase, which links the signal of Gαq to Rho for the induction of neurite retraction and cell rounding. A tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase was of course involved in the signaling of Gα13 to Rho. However, in contrast to Gαq, Gα13 did not require either PKC activation or Ca2+ influx. Two potential explanations for the difference between the signaling pathways of Gα13 and Gαq can be presented. One explanation is that an identical tyrosine kinase mediates the signals of Gα13 and Gαq to Rho, but the pathways of both α subunits to activate the tyrosine kinase are different; Gαq activates the kinase through PKC and Ca2+influx, whereas Gα13 activates the kinase independent of PKC. The other explanation is that different tyrosine kinases are involved in the pathways of both α subunits. We have summarized these possible pathways of signal transduction of three α subunits for Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding (Fig. 10).Expression of a GTPase-deficient form of Gαq in undifferentiated PC12 cells was recently shown to induce neurite outgrowth during 2–3 weeks using the retrovirus-mediated infection procedure (39Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, our results showed that expression of GαqQL in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells triggered neurite retraction within 3 h after microinjection. Therefore, these opposite effects of Gαq on the regulation of neurites may be due to different conditions of cells in differentiation or to a different time scale for examination of morphological effects.The data presented here demonstrated that constitutively active mutants of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq can induce neurite retraction and cell rounding through different signaling pathways, which, however, finally converge at activation of Rho (Fig. 10). Rho, like other small GTPases, functions as a molecular switch; it is active in its GTP-bound state and inactive in its GDP-bound state. Upstream activation of the cycle is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP (40Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A number of putative guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho and other Rho family GTPases have been identified, and some of these demonstrate Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor activityin vitro, including Lbc, Lfc, and Lsc (3Gebbink M.F.B.G.

Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility for the existence of multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho in the same cell type may be related to the existence of different signaling pathways from Gα subunits to Rho activation.Recent studies have shown the involvement of the Rho family of small GTPases in the regulation of neurite outgrowth in primary neurons (37Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar,44Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion, inhibition of Rho with C3 exoenzyme stimulated the outgrowth of neurites (44Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of Rho suppresses neurite outgrowth in primary neurons. Therefore, Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq may play a negative regulator for neurite outgrowth through activation of Rho in primary neurons.In conclusion, we have here shown that activation of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq can trigger Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding in differentiated PC12 cells through different signaling pathways. This study will contribute to the understanding of the signal transduction between heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors and Rho in neuronal cells. Activation of a certain G protein-coupled receptor has been reported to induce Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding in neuronal cell lines (6Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 7Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök Á. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that constitutively active forms of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq, but not Gαi2, can trigger neurite retraction and cell rounding in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. These morphological changes were similar to those induced by a constitutively active form of RhoA, RhoAV14 (Fig. 2); and C3 exoenzyme, which specifically ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho (28Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited both neurite retraction and cell rounding induced by Gα12QL, Gα13QL, and GαqQL (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that activation of Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq induces neurite retraction and cell rounding through the Rho-dependent signaling pathway in differentiated PC12 cells. Gα12 and Gα13, the members of the G12 class of heterotrimeric G proteins, show 67% amino acid identity to each other and often cause similar responses in various cell types, including transformation of fibroblasts, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascade, and stimulation of stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (31Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both Gα12 and Gα13 can trigger Rho-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding. These findings suggest that Gα12 and Gα13 may interact with a common effector. In this study, however, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 blocked the Gα13QL-induced neurite retraction and cell rounding, whereas the Gα12QL-induced effects were not influenced by this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating that a tyrphostin-sensitive tyrosine kinase is involved in the signaling of Gα13, but not in that of Gα12. This finding strongly suggests that Gα12 and Gα13interact with different effectors to regulate neuronal cell morphology. The differences in the sensitivity to tyrphostin between Gα12 and Gα13 were also shown in the signaling of Gα12- and Gα13-stimulated stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (19Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was previously reported that Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate Na+-H+ exchangers through different mechanisms in COS-7 cells (32Dhanasekaran N. Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wadsworth S.J. Gebauer G. van Rossum G. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28829-28832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Gα12 and Gα13 activate different pathways to regulate their cellular functions. Activation of Gαq can stimulate the phospholipase C-β family, which results in stimulation of PKC activity and elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In this study, depletion of endogenous PKC by both TPA and the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 specifically diminished the amount of neurite-retracted cells induced by GαqQL, whereas the Gα12QL- and Gα13QL-induced morphological changes were not influenced (Figs. 7 and 9). In addition, elimination of extracellular Ca2+ also inhibited the effects of GαqQL, but not those of Gα12QL and Gα13QL (Figs. 8 and 9). It has been shown that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, products of phospholipase C activation pathways, activate Ca2+-permeable channels in plasma membranes (34Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 35Irvine R.F. Moor R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2024437197,"Apoptosis involves the proteolysis of specific cellular proteins by a group of cysteine proteases known as caspases. Many of these cellular targets are either functionally inactivated (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) or activated (e.g. other caspases, gelsolin) by such processing, thereby facilitating the cell death process. Caspase 3 is involved in the processing of many of these proteins. Recently, however, it was reported that caspase 3 is dispensable for the cleavage of a large number of cellular caspase substrates during apoptosis. Among these substrates is DFF-45/ICAD, a subunit of the heterodimeric DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), otherwise known as caspase-activated DNase (CAD), that mediates genomic DNA degradation during apoptosis. Conversely, others have reported that caspase 3 is essential for the cleavage and activation of DFF-45/ICAD. To resolve this controversy we examined DFF-45/ICAD processing during apoptosis in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells that lack functional caspase 3 and in MCF-7 cells expressing caspase 3. We found that DFF-45/ICAD is cleaved by two distinct caspases, one of which is caspase 3. Furthermore, cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal region of DFF-45/ICAD, which is necessary for activation of the enzyme, requires functional caspase 3. In the absence of caspase 3 cleavage of the amino-terminal region of DFF-45/ICAD by another caspase occurs, but the DFF-45 enzyme remains inactive.

Apoptosis is an essential process in many eukaryotes that controls, among other things, cell number during development and the removal of cells that have undergone irreparable genotoxic damage (1Kerr J.F.R. Wylie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12993) Google Scholar,2Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The physical and biochemical events that control cellular suicide are remarkably well conserved. A group of at least 13 cysteine proteases, collectively known as caspases, function as effectors of apoptotic signaling pathways (3Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Many of these caspases are activated by a number of disparate apoptotic signals, including death receptor ligands, genotoxic damage, and environmental stress. Caspases exist in cells as inactive proenzymes that are believed to be activated by one of two mechanisms, autocatalytic activation induced by their aggregation or through the activity of another caspase (4Yang X. Chang H. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be further subdivided by the nature of their pro-domains: those containing longer pro-domains (e.g. caspases 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10) and those with much smaller pro-domains (e.g. caspases 3, 6, 7, and 11) (3Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). The longer pro-domains are made up of two distinct protein-protein interaction motifs known as death effector domains and caspase recruitment domains (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V.

Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Both motifs allow these caspases to be recruited into aggregates when the appropriate signal is received by the cell, allowing their autocatalytic activation. Conversely, caspases with shorter pro-domains are acted upon by the activated forms of these death effector domain- and caspase recruitment domain-containing caspases (3Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Thus, a proteolytic cascade has been established in cells as an important effector pathway for the induction of cell death. The activity of these caspases has been linked to many of the well characterized morphological changes associated with apoptosis, including cytoskeletal changes, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (12Bellamy C.O.C. Malcomson R.D.G. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr.

Nonetheless, it has been shown that not all caspases are required for cell death to occur (3Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). For instance, mice that lack either caspase 1 or 11 remain viable, but they demonstrate partial, tissue-specific resistance to certain death stimuli (15Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 16Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J.

Miuyra M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the caspase 2 gene exhibit both pro- and anti-apoptotic defects that are tissue-specific (18Bergeron L. Perez G.I. McDonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C.M. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A.H. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), whereas those in which caspase 3 is absent die perinatally and exhibit central nervous system hypercellularity (19Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In addition, some mammalian cell lines no longer express functional caspases (e.g. caspase 3 in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (20Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar)), yet they remain responsive to certain apoptotic stimuli. These results might suggest that inherent functional redundancies of caspases occur, allowing one enzyme to substitute for another in instances of its loss or inactivation. It is therefore of some interest to determine whether there is an absolute requirement for specific caspases in the processing of apoptotic substrates. Recently, Janicke et al. (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) reported that caspase 3 is required for the cleavage of α-fodrin but that it is dispensable for the cleavage of a number of additional substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, pRb, PAK2, DNA-PKcs, gelsolin, and DNA fragmentation factor 45-kDa subunit (DFF-45).1 These results are somewhat controversial because others have clearly shown that the DFF-45 and gelsolin require caspase 3 for proper cleavage and activation (22Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 23Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Peng L. Widlak P. Zou X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 25Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to re-examine these results using the same experimental system, the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, which lacks functional caspase 3 (20Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that gelsolin is, in fact, not cleaved or functionally activated in these cells unless functional caspase 3 is concomitantly expressed. Furthermore, we found that only one of two known caspase cleavage sites in DFF-45, an amino-terminal site, is cleaved in the absence of caspase 3. Cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal caspase cleavage site in DFF-45 occurs only when caspase 3 is expressed, and the resulting product is capable of inducing chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. These results point out the rather complex nature of caspase processing of apoptotic substrates and support the conclusion that caspase 3 is required for proper cleavage and activation of both gelsolin and DFF-45. Human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For TNF-induced cell death analysis, cells at a density of 90% confluency were treated with TNFα at 30 ng/ml and cycloheximide (CHX) at 10 μg/ml for 16 h. Stuarosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis was accomplished by incubating cells with 1.0 μm STS for 16 h, unless otherwise indicated. Apoptotic cells were examined by a light microscope for appearance of the plasma membrane blebbing and by TUNEL assay (26Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9180) Google Scholar). The MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cell lines were generated by resuspending 107 MCF-7 cells in 0.8 ml of PBS containing 20 μg of either PCDNA3.0 or PCDNA3.0/CPP32 (kindly provided by Dr. V. Dixit), which were then electroporated using a 4 mm gap cuvette at 0.325 kV, 960 microfarads. Cells were then cultured for 48 h before addition of G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml. After 4 weeks selection in the G418 medium, a subpopulation of transfected cells expressing a moderate-high level of CPP32 was generated. Bulk populations of transfected, neo-resistant MCF-7 cells, as well as clonal cell lines, were used in many of the same experiments. By Western blot analysis, the MCF-7/CPP32 cells were found to express levels of wild type CPP32 equivalent to the levels expressed in other cell lines (e.g. HeLa) that normally express this caspase. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm AEBSF (Boehringer Mannheim). 50 μg of cell lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The resulting membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk and incubated with a designated primary antibody, and the signals were detected by use of an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The caspase 3 (Transduction Laboratories), Bcl-xL(Transduction Laboratories), DFF45/C5 (Santa Cruz), DFF45/NT (Millennium Biotechnology), and gelsolin (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies were obtained commercially. TNFα/CHX and STS-induced caspase activation in MCF-7 cells was monitored by cleavage of gelsolin, DFF-45, and the transfected CPP32 using Western blot analysis. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (27Tang D. Gururajan R. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16601-16607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment 106 cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.2 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 15 h. DNA was then extracted with phenol and chloroform and ethanol- precipitated. 2 μg of total DNA was then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose-1X TBE gel. Apoptotic cells were examined by light microscopy for morphological changes and quantified by either trypan blue uptake for STS-initiated cell death or by the standard TNF cytotoxicity assay (28Andus T. Heinrich P.C. Bauer J. Tran-thi T.-A. Decher K. Mannel D. Northoff H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Janicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and stained for viable cells with 20% methanol containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% crystal violet for 15 min at room temperature. After removing excess dye with PBS, the staining dye was solubilized in 33% acetic acid and measured atA 550 with a spectrophotometer. The percentage of dead cells was defined as (1 -A 550(tested)/A 550(control)) × 100. A human CPP32/caspase 3 cDNA expression construct was stably introduced into the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, which lacks this enzyme because of small interstitial deletions within the corresponding gene (20Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the vector-transfected control cells versus those transfected with the CPP32 construct demonstrates that CPP32 is expressed at moderate levels in these cells (Fig. 1 A). Because pro-CPP32 is normally expressed in viable cells, we reasoned that many of the reports of enhanced cell death induced by transient expression of this protein might reflect extremely high levels of expression in these cells (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that within 24 h of transfection cell populations stabilized and remained stable until 1–2 weeks post-G418 addition. To determine whether CPP32 expression sensitized MCF-7 cells to apoptotic signals we compared the ability of MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cells to undergo apoptosis in response to either 1 μm STS or TNFα/CHX. We found that ∼92–95% of the MCF-7/CPP32 cells apoptosed when exposed to these agents for 16 h as compared with ∼85–92% of the MCF-7/neo controls, suggesting that expression of CPP32 does not greatly enhance the ability of these cells to die (Fig. 1 B). To ensure that the pro-CPP32 expressed in these cells was being processed appropriately following treatment with either STS or TNFα/CHX, we examined the CPP32 protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C). As expected, CPP32 was processed appropriately to generate the 17-kDa fragment that is characteristic of the active enzyme and little, if any, of the proenzyme remained. One striking difference between the MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cells was the morphologic changes that occurred once the cells were treated with either STS or TNFα/CHX. Neither of these agents induced the MCF-7/neo cells to detach, whereas both stimuli were capable of inducing this phenotype in the MCF-7/CPP32 cells (data not shown). Recently, it has been shown that this characteristic morphologic change occurs in vivo during apoptosis as a result of the cleavage of gelsolin, which when activated by CPP32 cleavage severs actin filaments in a Ca2+-independent manner in vitro (25Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to examine whether gelsolin was cleaved in either the MCF-7/neo or MCF-7/CPP32 cells stimulated to apoptose by the addition of either STS or TNFα/CHX. Western blot analysis with a gelsolin antibody, which recognizes both the intact protein and the enzymatically active 41-kDa caspase cleavage product, revealed that the 41-kDa protein is not produced in CPP32−/− cells treated with STS or TNFα/CHX (Fig. 1 C). However, when CPP32 is expressed in the same cells and they are treated with STS or TNFα/CHX, the 41-kDa gelsolin cleavage product is generated (Fig. 1 C). These results are consistent with those reported by Kothakota et al. (25Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), but they do not agree with the conclusions reached by Janicke et al. (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Because we demonstrated that gelsolin was cleaved appropriately to produce the active 41-kDa fragment only in the presence of CPP32, we decided to examine another known substrate of this enzyme, DFF-45 (22Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 23Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Peng L. Widlak P. Zou X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that DFF-45 is correctly processed in MCF-7 cells lacking functional CPP32 by Janicke et al.(21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To perform these experiments we stimulated either MCF-7/neo or MCF-7/CPP32 cells to undergo cell death with 1 μm STS. In addition, we decided to monitor the effects of STS treatment in a time-dependent manner to allow comparison of the onset of CPP32 cleavage and activation with the onset of DFF-45 cleavage and activation. This would allow us to determine whether a correlation between CPP32 activation and DFF-45 activation exists. We found that CPP32 cleavage and generation of its p17 subunit occurred within 4 h of STS treatment and that the CPP32 proenzyme was depleted from these cells within 6–8 h of STS treatment (Fig. 2 A). When we examined DFF-45 processing using a carboxyl-terminal DFF-45 antibody we found that, as reported by Janicke et al. (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), the level of intact DFF-45 diminished in the MCF-7/neo cells starting at about 4 h post-STS treatment (Fig. 2 B). Concomitantly, a ∼30-kDa DFF-45 reactive product that apparently reflects a partially processed intermediate was also produced. However, the release of a carboxyl-terminal 11-kDa fragment (p11), which is absolutely required for activation of the DNA fragmentation factor activity (23Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Peng L. Widlak P. Zou X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), was not observed. Conversely, when we examined DFF-45 in MCF-7/CPP32 cells undergoing STS-mediated apoptosis we found that the ∼30-kDa intermediate fragment appeared by 2 h, followed by the appearance of the p11 species (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the 30-kDa DFF-45 intermediate most likely results from the release of the amino-terminal portion of DFF-45, leaving intact the middle and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein. To demonstrate that protein loading was equivalent and that nonspecific proteolysis was not occurring, the same lysates from both the MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cells were Western blotted with a Bcl-xL antibody (Fig. 2 B). These results also suggest that the amino-terminal caspase site in DFF-45 can be cleaved by a caspase other than CPP32in vivo and that its carboxyl-terminal caspase cleavage site can only be processed by CPP32. Is the release of the 11-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment from DFF-45 required for DNA fragmentation activity? To demonstrate that the CPP32-processed DFF-45, but not the DFF-45 intermediate generated through cleavage by an unknown caspase, was functional, we examined nuclei and DNA from both STS-treated MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cells (Fig. 2 C). As expected, nuclei containing condensed chromatin (data not shown), as well as fragmented, laddered DNA was found only in the MCF-7/CPP32 cells treated with STS. In addition, DNA fragmentation started to appear within ∼4 h after STS treatment, consistent with the appearance of the DFF-45 11-kDa fragment. This confirms that CPP32 activity and the release of the carboxyl-terminal p11 species are required for apoptotic nuclease activity. To conclusively demonstrate that the ∼30-kDa DFF-45 intermediate observed in MCF-7/neo cells undergoing STS-mediated apoptosis was the result of the removal of the amino-terminal region of DFF-45, we examined these same cell lysates by Western blotting with a DFF-45 amino-terminal-specific antiserum (Fig. 3). As expected, a ∼17-kDa fragment (DFF45(NT)) was observed starting at 4 h post-STS treatment. Additionally, the DFF-45 amino-terminal antiserum detects two distinct polypeptides, ∼38 and 45 kDa in size (Fig. 3), whereas the carboxyl-terminal antiserum detects only the larger of these two protein species (Fig. 2 B). This is consistent with the presence of two alternatively spliced forms of human DFF-45, much like what has been reported in the mouse (19Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In the mouse, alternative splicing removes the carboxyl-terminal portion of the larger protein, creating a shorter polypeptide that is no longer recognized by the carboxyl-terminal antiserum; however, both forms are recognized by the amino-terminal antiserum because this region is present in both proteins. Both the 38- and 45-kDa forms of DFF-45 appear to be processed in a similar manner in both MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/CPP32 cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in the STS-treated MCF-7/CPP32 cells the DFF-45 (NT) species appeared at the same time as the p11 species. However, although the DFF-45 (NT) species was detected up to 8 h post-STS treatment in the MCF-7/neo cells, it quickly disappeared from the STS-treated MCF-7/CPP32 cell lysates (Fig. 3). This might suggest that the 17-kDa DFF-45 amino-terminal fragment is rapidly turned over in the presence of CPP32 but not in its absence. The significance of this observation is not known at this time. Here we have shown that 1) DFF-45 is cleaved by two distinct caspases during STS-induced apoptosis in vivo, 2) CPP32/caspase 3 processes the carboxyl-terminal caspase cleavage site of DFF-45, and 3) cleavage of DFF-45 and gelsolin by CPP32/caspase 3 is absolutely required for their activation in vivo. We have also shown that careful examination of the cleavage products of caspase substrates is required to reach definitive conclusions regarding the requirements of specific caspases for processing of substrates. In several instances Janicke et al. (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) used the diminished level of an intact caspase substrate as an indicator of its processing, but clearly this is not sufficient. Diminished levels of a particular substrate could be because of a number of physical changes that coincide with cell death, including its partitioning into an insoluble cellular fraction. Such partitioning, most likely because of substrate association with the nuclear matrix or its components, would seem reasonable for DFF-45. Recently, MEKK1 was shown to partition into a soluble cellular fraction from the insoluble cellular fraction once it underwent caspase processing, suggesting that these types of changes may be relevant to the function of certain caspase-cleaved substrates (30Deak J.C. Cross J.V. Lewis M. Qian Y. Parrott L.A. Distelhorst C.W. Templeton D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5595-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, reagents that detect the caspase-processed, active (or inactive) forms of these substrates must be employed in these types of experiments. In addition, careful examination of morphologic changes that are known to accompany changes in substrate processing (e.g. activation of gelsolin) should also be incorporated into any analyses. As demonstrated in this study, MCF-7 cells lacking CPP32/caspase 3 not only retain intact nuclei, but they also fail to detach. The latter is a hallmark of the severing of actin filaments by activated gelsolin (25Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), and it should have alerted Janicke et al. (21Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) to possible discrepancies in their study. Finally, analysis of the cleavage of caspase substrates in cell lines deficient in a particular functional caspase (e.g.CPP32/caspase 3) may also help to reveal that many are processed by more than one caspase in vivo. In many instances this might go unnoticed unless such caspase−/− cell lines are utilized. Several groups have recently concluded that DFF-45 is cleaved only by the CPP32/caspase 3 protease (23Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Peng L. Widlak P. Zou X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Clearly, we have shown here that whereas the carboxyl-terminal site requires CPP32/caspase 3 for its cleavage, processing of the amino-terminal site requires another, currently unidentified caspase. We thank Dr. V. Dixit for the CPP32/caspase 3 expression construct."

Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane components in eukaryotic cells and in a few bacteria (1Karlsson K.-A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic moiety is a long chain base (LCB1; 2-amino-1,3-dihydroxyalkane) carrying N-acylated fatty acids of 14–26 carbon atoms to form a ceramide. Depending on the source, this basic structure can be modified by differences in chain length, degree of unsaturation, methyl branching, and insertion of additional hydroxy groups. Complex sphingolipids such as cerebrosides and phytoglycolipids are generated by the addition of various sugar residues and other polar head groups to the ceramide. In animal cells, these membrane lipids and in particular their catabolites serve as intra- and intercellular second messengers regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and pathogenic defense (2Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 3Karlsson K.-A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 309-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). On the other hand, far less is known about the role of sphingolipids in plants and fungi. However, the lethality of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in LCB biosynthesis (4Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the toxicity of compounds interfering with their synthesis in plants suggest that they are essential also in these organisms (5Gilchrist D.G. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Very recently, genes for the ceramide hydroxylation were identified (6Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol.

Enzymatic studies with animal systems showed that the Δ4-trans double bond is inserted into free ceramide (N-acylated sphinganine) and that this conversion is catalyzed by a desaturase and not by a dehydrogenase or an oxidase (8Kok J.K.

In contrast to animal and yeast cells, plant sphingolipids contain additional C-8-unsaturated LCB of cis- and trans-configuration, which might be involved in chilling resistance (10Imai H. Ohnishi M.

Biol. 1997; 33: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used for PCR amplification of a 571-bp DNA fragment with the degenerated primers 5′-G(G/C)(A/T/G/C)TGGTGGAA(AG)TGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GG(A/G)AA(A/T/G/C)A(A/G)(A/G)TG(A/G)TG-3′ (reverse). The 5′-end was amplified with the T3 primer (Stratagene) and the specific reverse primer 5′-TTATGCGTCCATTTCCACCA-3′. cDNA isolated from mRNA of developing B. napus (cv. Drakkar) embryos was used to amplify the 3′-end with the specific forward primer 5′-TTCTTTGGCGGGTTGCAGTT-3′ and a poly(dT) primer. Specific primers (5′-AACCATCTCTGTTTCAAC-3′ and 5′-CAAGTGATGATGAGTTAC-3′) derived from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were used in PCR experiments, and a full-length clone of 1502 bp was isolated and sequenced. mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and tailing, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing were carried out as described (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A BLAST search (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D. J. Mol.

F13717 (reverse) 5′-TTAGCCATGAGTATTCAAAGC-3′ were used for the PCR amplification of a 1269-bp DNA fragment from a λ ZAP cDNA library of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia), which was received from the Genetic Stock Center of the Max-Planck Institute (Köln, Germany). PCR with the above mentioned primers in combination with T7 or T3 primer (Stratagene), respectively, amplified the corresponding 5′- and 3′-ends. All fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described before (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kilobase pair FAD2 sequence was amplified from cDNA of developing B. napus cv. Drakkar embryos by PCR with oligonucleotide primers (5′-CCGGTACC ATGGGTGCAGGTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTC TCATAACTTATTGTTGTACCA-3′) designed from the FAD2 cDNA sequence of A. thaliana (15Okuley J. Lightner J. Feldmann K. Yadav N. Lark E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The 1.4-kilobase pair sphingolipid desaturase sequences were amplified by PCR from cDNA of developing B. napus (cv. Drakkar) embryos with the primers 5′-CCGGTACC ATGTCGGAGCAGACAAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTC CTAGCCATGAGTATTCAGA-3′ and from theA. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) λ ZAP cDNA library mentioned above with the primers 5′-CCGGTACC ATGGCGGAAGAGACGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTC TTAGCCATGAGTATTCAAAGC-3′. For ligation into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen), these primers were extended by a KpnI or EcoRI restriction site (underlined). The amplified DNAs were ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and verified by sequencing (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI PRISM Dye Primer and Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits (Perkin-Elmer). The excisedKpnI–EcoRI fragments were inserted into theKpnI–EcoRI site of the expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmids (pBnDES8 and pAtDES8) were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen) using the polyethylene glycol method (16Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W.M. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cultures of transformedS. cerevisiae were grown at 30 °C for 24 h in complete minimal-dropout-uracil medium containing 2% (w/v) raffinose (17Asubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). During early logarithmic growth, test cultures were induced with 1.8% galactose (final concentration) and grown aerobically to saturation for another 24 h. Harvested yeast cells were used to prepare fatty acids from glycerolipids for subsequent analysis as bromophenacylesters by HPLC as described (18Haschke H.P. Kaiser G. Martinoia E. Hammer U. Teucher T. Dorne A.J. Heinz E. Bot. Acta. 1990; 103: 32-38Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Induced yeast cells (350 mg, fresh weight) were directly subjected to strong alkaline hydrolysis (10% aqueous Ba(OH)2/dioxane, 1:1 (v/v), 24 h, 110 °C), and the liberated LCBs were extracted with chloroform/dioxane/water (6:1:5, v/v/v) (19Morrison W.R. Hay J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 202: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The LCB fraction was converted to dinitrophenyl derivatives, extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (8:4:3, v/v/v) (11Karlsson K.-A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1970; 5: 6-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and purified by TLC on silica gel plates in chloroform/methanol (90:10, v/v). Derivatized LCB were detected by their yellow color, eluted from the silica gel with methanol, and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. Separation was achieved on an ODS Hypersil RP18 column (5 μm, 25 × 4.6 cm; Bischoff) with linear gradient elution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min from 80% methanol/acetonitrile/2-propanol (10:3:1, v/v/v) and 20% water to 0% water in 40 min. Elution was monitored at 350 nm. For a structural analysis, LCB from transgenic yeast cells and A. thaliana leaves (5.7 g, fresh weight) liberated by alkaline hydrolysis were separated by TLC in chloroform/methanol/ammonia (40:40:1, v/v/v) (20Ohnishi M. Ito S. Fujino Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 416-422Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The trihydroxybase fraction (RF = 0.33) was extracted by phase partitioning with chloroform/methanol/1m KOH (2:1:0.75; v/v/v). The peracetylated trihydroxybases (pyridine/acetic anhydride) were isolated by preparative TLC developed in diethylether. Bands were detected after spraying with 0,2% methanolic 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid under UV light and extracted from the silica gel by phase partitioning withn-hexane/water (1:1, v/v) yielding a mixture of peracetylated phytosphinganine and phytosphingenines (730 μg). The cis- and trans-isomers of phytosphingenine were separated from the phytosphinganine by preparative argentation TLC with chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v) at 4 °C. Plates were impregnated by spraying with a solution of AgNO3 (10%, w/v) in acetonitrile (21Siebertz H.P. Heinz E. Joyard J. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peracetylated LCBs were visualized with 0.2% methanolic dichlorofluorescein under UV light, extracted withn-hexane/water (1:1, v/v) from the silver nitrate silica gel, and used for 1H NMR analysis. One aliquot (360 μg) of the peracetylated mixture of phytosphinganine and phytosphingenine isomers was de-O-acetylated (0.02 m sodium methoxide, 1 h at room temperature) prior to lead tetraacetate oxidation (22Lemieux R.U. von Rudloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1955; 33: 1710-1713Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting aldehydes were extracted with chloroform, reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, and separated into two aliquots; one (200 μg) was used to produce the nicotinates (22Lemieux R.U. von Rudloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1955; 33: 1710-1713Crossref Google Scholar), and the other (140 μg) was subjected to potassium permanganate oxidation (22Lemieux R.U. von Rudloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1955; 33: 1710-1713Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting fatty acids were transformed to methyl esters by etheral diazomethane. GC-MS analysis was performed as described (23Zähringer U. Wagner F. Rietschel E.T. Ben-Menachem G. Deutsch J. Rottem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26262-26270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a 600-MHz spectrometer (Bruker Avance DRX600) in capillary microtubes (2.5-mm OD, Wilmad, Buena, CA) using a microprobe head (PH TXI 600SB). One- and two-dimensional homonuclear (1H, 1H COSY) experiments were performed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, version 1.3). Methyl esters of total fatty acids, obtained by acid methanolysis of cell pellets (about 300 mg) from wild type (pYES2) and transgenic yeasts (pBnDES8 and pAtDES8) were purified by preparative silica gel TLC in petroleum ether/diethylether (9:1, v/v;R F = 0.4), yielding about 1 mg of purified fraction. Part of it (about 0.2 mg) was subjected to a modified von Rudloff oxidation (22Lemieux R.U. von Rudloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1955; 33: 1710-1713Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the fatty acid methyl esters were dissolved in methanol (0.5 ml) and oxidized with 0.5 ml of a solution of 10 mg of KMnO4 in 2 ml of 0.1 mH2SO4. After 30 min at 37 °C, 8 ml of water were added, and organic products were extracted twice with 2 ml of chloroform. After concentration to dryness, 0.5 m NaOH in methanol/water (1:1 (v/v), 1.0 ml) was added followed by 5 mg of NaBH4. After extraction, the resulting dihydroxy fatty acids were treated with diazomethane in diethylether for reconversion to methyl esters. Following removal of solvents, bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (30 μl; Sigma) was added, and the mixture was kept for 16 h at 60 °C for formation of trimethylsilyl derivatives of bis-hydroxylated fatty acid methyl esters. Fatty acid pyrrolidides were prepared from another aliquot of the original fraction (0.2 mg) following an established procedure (24Andersson B.A. Holmann R.T. Lipids. 1974; 9: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In previous experiments, we had cloned a cDNA from sunflower that codes for a fusion protein between an N-terminal cytochrome b 5 and a putative membrane-bound desaturase domain, but so far a biochemical function had not been assigned to this C-terminal domain (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In continuation of these investigations, we carried out additional PCR experiments with cDNA from developing B. napus embryos and detected another cDNA closely related to the previously cloned sunflower sequence (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 3The nucleotide sequence for the cytochromeb 5 fusion protein from sunflower can be accessed through the EMBL Data Base under EMBL accession number X87143(13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We isolated a full-length clone of 1594 bp corresponding to an open reading frame of 449 amino acids. Estimates of gene copy number indicated 6–8 gene copies/haploid genome of B. napus. This number corresponds to the copy numbers found for other lipid desaturases in B. napus, which all are present as small gene families (25Scheffler J.A. Sharpe A.G. Schmidt H. Sperling P. Parkin I.A.P. Lühs W. Lydiate D.J. Heinz E. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1997; 94: 583-591Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Based on substantial similarity of some EST clones of A. thaliana (EMBL accession numbers T42569 (36–102), N37558(42–204), F13728 (122–210), T42806 (375–405), F13717 (430–458) (numbers in parentheses refer to the amino acid positions given in Fig. 1) to the B. napus sequence, we also carried out PCR experiments with an A. thaliana λ ZAP cDNA library. A full-length clone of 1678 bp was obtained, which corresponds to an open reading frame of the same length as theB. napussequence. 4The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the sphingolipid desaturases from B. napus and A. thaliana have been deposited in the EMBL Data Base under EMBL accession numbers AJ224160 and AJ224161. At the N terminus, both open reading frames are nine amino acids shorter than the sunflower protein, but they also show seven highly conserved amino acid residues characteristic for cytochrome b 5 (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The two predicted polypeptides of 51–52 kDa showed 76% identity to each other and 65% identity to the sunflower protein (Fig. 1). Acyl lipid desaturases catalyze the oxygen- and electron donor-dependent insertion of double bonds into fatty acid residues. The immediate electron donor for many microsomal desaturases is cytochrome b 5. Therefore, a fusion between cytochrome b 5 and a desaturase as found in these new sequences may have a functional advantage. A fused cytochromeb 5 was detected in the Δ9-acyl-CoA desaturase from yeast (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and a red alga (27Itoh R. Toda K. Takahashi H. Takano H. Kuroiwa T. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in the Δ6-acyl lipid desaturase from plants (28Sayanova Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R.

Plant J. 1998; 15: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (30Napier J.A. Hey S.J. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), as well as in the sphingolipid α-hydroxylase of yeast (7Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and in the TU-36Bgene of Drosophila melanogaster (31Levin J.R. Boychuck P.L. Croniger C.M. Kazzaz J.A. Rozek C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6349-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the desaturase-like proteins encoded by the two above mentioned sequences represent new members of the cytochrome b 5superfamily (Fig. 2). The hemoprotein nature of the N-terminal domain from the homologous sunflower fusion protein has been confirmed by redox absorbance difference spectra of the recombinant cytochrome b 5 expressed in Escherichia coli (13Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the characteristic histidine boxes conserved in all lipid desaturases (32Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) are also present in this new class of desaturases. The highest similarity (58–60% identity) was found for the Δ6-desaturase from borage 5The nucleotide sequence for the Δ6-acyl lipid desaturase from borage is available in the EMBL Data Base under accession number U79010 (28Sayanova Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). (28Sayanova Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), but only limited resemblance (≤22% identity) exists to the Δ6-desaturase from the moss Physcomitrella patens (29Girke T. Schmidt H. Zähringer U. Reski R. Heinz E. Plant J. 1998; 15: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the nematode C. elegans (30Napier J.A. Hey S.J. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the catalytic function of these new fusion proteins, they were expressed in yeast cells, which provide a membrane-bound redox system suitable for functional cooperation with heterologous desaturases (33Kajiwara S. Shirai A. Fujii T. Toguri T. Nakamura K. Ohtaguchi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, we inserted a full-length cDNA clone for the microsomal Δ12-desaturase fromB. napus into a yeast-E. coli shuttle vector under the transcriptional control of the inducible yeastGAL1 promotor. Galactose-induced cultures of transformed yeast cells were used to prepare fatty acids from membrane lipids for subsequent analysis (18Haschke H.P. Kaiser G. Martinoia E. Hammer U. Teucher T. Dorne A.J. Heinz E. Bot. Acta. 1990; 103: 32-38Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae clones harboring theB. napus FAD2 gene were capable of forming 11% of Δ9,12-C16- and Δ9,12-C18-dienoic fatty acids, proving and confirming the capability to express a microsomal Δ12-desaturase of plant origin (33Kajiwara S. Shirai A. Fujii T. Toguri T. Nakamura K. Ohtaguchi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the two newly isolated cDNAs coding for the fusion proteins of A. thaliana and B. napus were ligated into the same site of the vector described above, and the derived plasmids pBnDES8 and pAtDES8 were transformed into S. cerevisiae. Fatty acid analysis of transformed cells harboring pBnDES8, pAtDES8, or uncut pYES2 (negative control) showed identical wild-type patterns for all three cultures. To confirm that the monoenoic fatty acids (16:1, 18:1) observed in the two transgenic strains are in fact the same regioisomers as formed in wild type yeast, i.e. palmitoleate and oleate with Δ9 double bonds, we carried out a detailed localization of the double bond in each of these two fatty acids from these strains. For this purpose, the fatty acid methyl ester fraction was subjected to a modified von Rudloff oxidation converting the original double bond into a pair of vicinal trimethylsilyloxy groups. Upon GC-MS, the derivatives of the two monounsaturated fatty acids in all three strains were identified as methyl 9,10-di-(trimethylsilyloxy)-hexadecanoate (retention time 20.15 min) and methyl 9,10-di-(trimethylsilyloxy)-octadecanoate (retention time 23.73 min). Fragmentation between the vicinal trimethylsilyloxy groups results in characteristic fragments for the carboxyl ends (C-1–C-9 atm/z = 259 from both Δ9-16:1 and Δ9-18:1) and for the methyl ends (C-10–C-16 atm/z = 187 for 16:1; C-10–C-18 at m/z = 215 for 18:1). The negative result of a single ion monitoring experiment to detect corresponding fragment ions for carboxyl and methyl ends resulting from Δ6-16:1 (m/z = 217 and 229) and Δ6-18:1 (m/z = 217 and 257) excluded the formation of these particular regioisomer (for discussion, see below). The analysis of pyrrolidides also showed only Δ9-16:1 regioisomers (fragments m/z = 168, 182, 196, 208, 222, and 236 (24Andersson B.A. Holmann R.T. Lipids. 1974; 9: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)) and no fragments diagnostic for the Δ6-16:1 isomer (m/z = 166, 180, 194, 208, 222, and 236). The same holds true for the Δ9-18:1 derivative. Furthermore, transformed and wild-type cells, which incorporated exogenously added linoleic acid (Δ9,12-18:2) into their membrane lipids (34Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not show any Δ15- or Δ6-desaturation activity with a polyunsaturated substrate. These results indicated that the new fusion proteins are not involved in the desaturation of fatty acids. To investigate a possible modification of sphingolipid LCB, yeast cells were directly subjected to strong alkaline hydrolysis to liberate the free LCB from their complex sphingolipids (19Morrison W.R. Hay J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 202: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The extracted LCB were converted to dinitrophenyl derivatives (11Karlsson K.-A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1970; 5: 6-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 3). The main LCB of S. cerevisiae is C18-phytosphinganine (d-ribo-2-amino-1,3,4-trihydroxyoctadecane), whereas sphinganine and C20-phytosphinganine are only minor components under nonstressed growth conditions (35Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 36Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed with the empty vector (control) showed the wild-type LCB pattern (Fig. 3 B). Transformants expressing pAtDES8 and pBnDES8 accumulated in addition to phytosphinganine new LCB in yields of 59 and 31%, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). Their shorter retention times in reversed-phase HPLC suggested that they may be unsaturated derivatives of C18-phytosphinganine. Unequivocal proof for the presence of phytosphingenines was achieved by GC-MS (23Zähringer U. Wagner F. Rietschel E.T. Ben-Menachem G. Deutsch J. Rottem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26262-26270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Peracetylated LCBs were resolved into three components and identified as 2-N-acetamido-1,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1,3,4-trihydroxyoctadecane (retention time 15.72 min) and two isomeric 2-N-acetamido-1,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1,3,4-trihydroxyoctadecenes (retention times 15.30 and 15.45 min; both with m/z = 483 [M+] and m/z = 423 [M-60]+). For the localization of the double bond,N-acetylated trihydroxybases were subjected to two different degradation protocols, i.e. to lead tetraacetate and to von Rudloff oxidation (22Lemieux R.U. von Rudloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1955; 33: 1710-1713Crossref Google Scholar). Lead tetraacetate fragmentation/reduction resulted in alcohols, which were separated by GC-MS as their nicotinates into three peaks. The first (retention time 16.30 min) was a saturated alcohol, the second was identified as a derivative of 6-pentadecenol (retention time 15.80 min, m/z = 331 [M+] and fragments at m/z = 192, 206, 218, and 232), and the third was nicotinate of 5-pentadecenol (retention time 15.95 min, m/z = 331 [M+] and fragments at m/z = 192, 204, 218, and 232). The von Rudloff oxidation, which yields aliphatic acids from the alkyl portion between the double bond and the terminal methyl group, resulted in methyl esters of nonanoic (7.5 min) and decanoic (9.0 min) acid in relative proportions of 1:3. These two independent sequences prove the formation of two regioisomeric phytosphingenines with a Δ8 or a Δ9 double bond in relative proportions of 3:1. For assignment of the double bond stereochemistry (cis/trans), the peracetylated LCB fraction was separated by preparative silver nitrate TLC into three components with RF values of 0.46 (125 μg), 0.44 (300 μg), and 0.38 (100 μg), which were used for recording 1H NMR spectra. The component with the highest RF value of 0.46 turned out to be the acetylated phytosphinganine (data not shown). The spectrum (Fig. 4) of the fraction with RF = 0.44 displayed nonresolved multiplet signals for olefinic protons at 5.308 ppm, which showed cross-peaks in the COSY experiment to the α-methylene protons at 1.879 ppm characteristic fortrans-configuration. In the fraction with RF = 0.38 the olefinic signals were shifted to higher field (5.275 ppm), whereas the α-methylene protons appeared at lower field (1.927 ppm) as typical for a cis-double bond (37Frost D.J. Gunstone F.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1975; 15: 53-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In view of these data, it is obvious that HPLC separates thecis/trans-stereoisomers, but not the Δ8/Δ9-regioisomers of phytosphingenines (Fig. 3, C–E). The smaller peak with shorter retention time contains the twocis-Δ8/Δ9-phytosphingenines, whereas the larger peak following closely behind contains the twotrans-Δ8/Δ9-phytosphingenines. The cis/trans ratios of phytosphingenine, calculated from HPLC analysis, are 1:3 in transformants harboring pAtDES8 and 1:6.7 in pBnDES8 transformants (Fig. 3, C and D). Considering all data, the relative proportions of the different phytosphingenines (Δ8-trans/Δ9-trans/Δ8-cis/Δ9-cis) resulting from the expression of the heterologous desaturase of A. thaliana in yeast were approximately 9:3:3:1. In view of the fact that only one additional heterologous gene is expressed in the transformed yeast cells, obvious questions arising concern the origin of both thecis/trans-stereoisomers and the Δ8/Δ9-regioisomers. The presence of cis- and trans-double bonds in the newly formed products could be ascribed either to the activity of a genuine yeastcis/trans-isomerase similar to fatty acid isomerases found in other organisms (38Wise M.L. Rossi J. Gerwick W.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2985-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or to the lack of absolute stereospecificity of the desaturase itself as known from some monooxygenases (39Gallagher S.C. Cammack R. Dalton H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reinvestigation of the trihydroxybases fromA. thaliana sphingolipids by HPLC and GC-MS confirmed thatcis- and trans-isomers are present in Δ8-phytosphingenines and that the double bond is restricted to C-8. In addition, the cis/trans ratio of A. thaliana phytosphingenines (Fig. 3 E) is similar to that found in each of the Δ8- and Δ9-phytosphingenines extracted from pAtDES8 transformants (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that formation of both stereoisomers may be catalyzed by a single desaturase of plant origin, which does not show absolute stereospecificity as typical for all the fatty acid desaturases cloned so far. The presence of two regioisomeric Δ8- and Δ9-double bonds in phytosphingenine can be explained as follows. The plant LCB desaturase has a regioselectivity comparable with that of a fatty acid desaturase, which introduces a double bond in the Δ6-position. The acyl desaturase measures this distance from the oxygen-functionalized carbon atom (Δ-desaturase) of the acyl group, which is usually the carboxyl carbon (C-1) of the fatty acid. On the other hand, this carbon atom does not necessarily have to carry an additional carbonyl oxygen. Desaturation of alkenyl glycerol ethers has shown that the oxygen of an ether bridge is sufficient to identify C-1 of the 9-cis-alkenyl chain for correct alignment and regioselective insertion of the second double bond by the Δ12-desaturase (40Sperling P. Linscheid M. Stöcker S. Mühlbach H.-P. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26935-26940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that the LCB desaturase measures the Δ6-position from the oxygen-carrying carbon atom next to the alkyl chain in the LCB (Fig. 5). In plants “C-1” can only be C-3 of sphinganine and sphingosine (4-trans-sphingenine), resulting in the new double bond at C-8, whereas formation of Δ8-phytosphingenine by hydroxylation at C-4 can only occur subsequent to C-8 desaturation of sphinganine. The reason for this order of events is at present not understood. On the other hand, in the transformed yeast, the strict sequence of C-8 desaturation followed by C-4 hydroxylation does not exist, and the heterologous plant LCB desaturase also has access to phytosphinganine. In this case, C-4 and not C-3 of the LCB is used as “C-1” for alignment of the alkyl chain. Insertion of the double bond in the fixed distance gives Δ9- instead of Δ8-phytosphingenine. This picture (Fig. 5) explains the sequence similarity between the LCB Δ8-desaturase and the fatty acid Δ6-desaturase (28Sayanova Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the fatty acid desaturases, the LCB desaturase lacks stereospecificity. Therefore, this desaturase is the first trans-desaturase to be cloned. Furthermore, its activity does not depend on the presence of an additional cis-double bond in allylic position as required by most other acyl lipid desaturases including the Δ6-desaturase. Because of the sequence similarity of the LCB desaturase to Δ6-acyl group desaturases and the possibility that a Δ6-hexadecenoyl-CoA could be used by the yeast serine palmitoyl transferase for a direct formation of an unsaturated Δ8-LCB, we carried out a detailed analysis of the location of double bonds in monounsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids of the two transgenic yeast strains. Both strains contained only the Δ9-regioisomers as found in wild type and thus rule out the possibility that the Δ8-double bond in LCB is carried over from the Δ6-unsaturated fatty acid precursor. Despite the fact that the sphingolipid desaturase accepts a saturated substrate, it is not related to the other desaturase groups that use saturated substrates (acyl-ACP-, acyl-CoA-, desC-, and the senescence-induced desaturase (41Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar)). Its similarity to the Δ6-acyl group desaturase suggests that structural features controlling regioselectivity rather than those allowing proton abstraction from saturated substrates were more suitable for evolutionary modification. On the other hand, in plants, LCBs with Δ8-double bonds are far more widespread than the rare introduction of Δ6-double bonds into acyl groups. Therefore, the evolutionary correlation between these two groups of desaturases (i.e. whether one evolved from the other or whether both represent independent lines from a common ancestor) is an interesting but open question."

Thus, we used degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the sequence of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> protein kinase Ste20p to amplify related sequences from the rat. One of these sequences was used to clone a rat Ste20p homolog, which we called TAO1 for its one thousand and one amino acids. Northern analysis shows TAO1 is highly expressed in brain, as is a homolog TAO2.

TAO1 activated MEK3 but not MEK4 or MEK6 in transfected cells. MEK3 coimmunoprecipitated with TAO1 when they were expressed in 293 cells. In addition, immunoreactive MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells copurified with TAO1 produced from a recombinant baculovirus. The activation of and binding to MEK3 by TAO1 implicates TAO1 in the regulation of the p38-containing stress-responsive MAP kinase pathway."

A protein of 58,000 Da that reacts with antibody to γ-PAK from rabbit is present in high amounts in frog oocytes and is greatly diminished following fertilization, suggesting γ-PAK is involved in maintaining oocytes in a nondividing state (16Rooney R.D.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: A1369Google Scholar). In the studies described herein, the requirements for activation of recombinant γ-PAK via cleavage with recombinant CPP32 have been analyzed. Cleavage produces 2 peptides, p27 containing the majority of the regulatory domain and p34 containing part of the regulatory domain and the entire catalytic domain, both of which become autophosphorylated. A comparison of autophosphorylation and activity of wild type and mutant γ-PAK shows autophosphorylation is a bipartate mechanism, with the regulatory domain (p27) autophosphorylated at multiple residues, while activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain (p34) at Thr-402.DISCUSSIONActivation of γ-PAK can be initiated under different conditions, by binding of small G proteins, in particular Cdc42(GTPγS) (11Jakobi R. Chen C-J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), by association with histone 4 (17Jakobi R. Huang Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and by cleavage with the caspase CPP32. Cleavage by CPP32 produces two peptides, one containing the majority of the regulatory domain (p27) and the other containing the entire catalytic domain and 34 amino acids of the regulatory domain (p34). Following cleavage, both peptides become highly autophosphorylated, which results in a shift of migration of p27 from 27 to 32 kDa upon SDS-PAGE, as shown by Coomassie Blue staining, Western blotting, and radiolabeling. Autophosphorylation of p34 does not alter the migration pattern on SDS-PAGE but is required for activity, as shown with the peptide S3 (AKRESAA).Prior to cleavage, autophosphorylation of γ-PAK with ATP(Mg) alone or with Cdc42 in the absence of GTPγS results in a similar shift in p27 during SDS-PAGE; however, no autophosphorylation of p34 is observed. Under these conditions, there is little protein kinase activity. Incubation in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) stimulates autophosphorylation of γ-PAKp58 by 2.5-fold, and the phosphate is found in both p27 and p34 following cleavage. With Cdc42(GTPγS), protein kinase activity as determined with peptide S3 is observed both before and after cleavage. There is a 3-fold stimulation of p58 activity and a 10-fold stimulation following caspase cleavage. Similar results are obtained following autophosphorylation of p58 and the two cleavage products in the presence of histone 4. These data indicate that the cleaved enzyme has a higher level of activity than the Cdc42-activated enzyme.Autophosphorylation of the regulatory domain is the priming step in activation, and autophosphorylation of p34 on Thr-402 is critical for phosphorylation of peptide substrates. Autophosphorylation is a bipartate mechanism; autophosphorylation of multiple sites in the regulatory domain is a priming step and can occur in the absence of any effectors. Upon caspase cleavage or addition of Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone 4, Thr-402 in the catalytic domain is autophosphorylated, resulting in stimulation of protein kinase activity with exogenous substrates. Based on a comparison of sequences of γ-PAK with the highly studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cell division kinase 2 (Cdk2), Thr-402 corresponds to the highly conserved threonine, which is located in the p + 1 loop adjacent to the activation loop, as determined by x-ray crystallography (22Hanks S.H. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 23Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In PKA and Cdk2, phosphorylation of this threonine is required for activation, as is shown herein for γ-PAK.Autophosphorylation of the regulatory domain of the holoenzyme p58 can occur independently of phosphorylation of Thr-402, but autophosphorylation of Thr-402 is required for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. Following caspase cleavage, autophosphorylation of p27 becomes dependent on a phosphothreonine at position 402, because p27 is now an exogenous substrate.Previously Rudel and Bokoch (6Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) showed that γ-PAK cleavage was correlated with the onset of apoptosis and that the inhibitor of CPP32 cleavage (DEVD-ald) inhibited cleavage of γ-PAK in Jurkat T cells undergoing apoptosis. The site of cleavage, aspartate 212, was identified using recombinant CPP32 or apoptotic cell lysates which cleaved γ-PAK into two fragments, but did not cleave the mutant D212N. That data was confirmed herein by direct sequencing of the CPP32 cleavage site generated in vitro.In other studies, γ-PAK activity was shown to be high in the cytosol of quiescent and serum-starved cells and to be diminished in dividing cells.2 Thus regulation of γ-PAK under conditions of growth and quiescence is different from regulation of γ-PAK during apoptosis. Cleavage by CPP32 allows γ-PAK to be constitutively active leading to cell death, whereas regulation by Cdc42(GTP) produces γ-PAK cycling between active and inactive forms. In response to a variety of death stimuli, the caspase family of cysteinyl aspartate-directed proteases becomes activated. The caspases play integral roles in apoptosis or programmed cell death, which include a number of morphological changes such as nuclear condensation, membrane and cytoskeletal rearrangement, and formation of apoptotic bodies (for review, see Ref. 1Nagata S.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: A1369Google Scholar). In the studies described herein, the requirements for activation of recombinant γ-PAK via cleavage with recombinant CPP32 have been analyzed. Cleavage produces 2 peptides, p27 containing the majority of the regulatory domain and p34 containing part of the regulatory domain and the entire catalytic domain, both of which become autophosphorylated. A comparison of autophosphorylation and activity of wild type and mutant γ-PAK shows autophosphorylation is a bipartate mechanism, with the regulatory domain (p27) autophosphorylated at multiple residues, while activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain (p34) at Thr-402. DISCUSSIONActivation of γ-PAK can be initiated under different conditions, by binding of small G proteins, in particular Cdc42(GTPγS) (11Jakobi R. Chen C-J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), by association with histone 4 (17Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A.

Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and by cleavage with the caspase CPP32. Cleavage by CPP32 produces two peptides, one containing the majority of the regulatory domain (p27) and the other containing the entire catalytic domain and 34 amino acids of the regulatory domain (p34). Following cleavage, both peptides become highly autophosphorylated, which results in a shift of migration of p27 from 27 to 32 kDa upon SDS-PAGE, as shown by Coomassie Blue staining, Western blotting, and radiolabeling. Autophosphorylation of p34 does not alter the migration pattern on SDS-PAGE but is required for activity, as shown with the peptide S3 (AKRESAA).Prior to cleavage, autophosphorylation of γ-PAK with ATP(Mg) alone or with Cdc42 in the absence of GTPγS results in a similar shift in p27 during SDS-PAGE; however, no autophosphorylation of p34 is observed. Under these conditions, there is little protein kinase activity. Incubation in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) stimulates autophosphorylation of γ-PAKp58 by 2.5-fold, and the phosphate is found in both p27 and p34 following cleavage. With Cdc42(GTPγS), protein kinase activity as determined with peptide S3 is observed both before and after cleavage. There is a 3-fold stimulation of p58 activity and a 10-fold stimulation following caspase cleavage. Similar results are obtained following autophosphorylation of p58 and the two cleavage products in the presence of histone 4. These data indicate that the cleaved enzyme has a higher level of activity than the Cdc42-activated enzyme.Autophosphorylation of the regulatory domain is the priming step in activation, and autophosphorylation of p34 on Thr-402 is critical for phosphorylation of peptide substrates. Autophosphorylation is a bipartate mechanism; autophosphorylation of multiple sites in the regulatory domain is a priming step and can occur in the absence of any effectors. Upon caspase cleavage or addition of Cdc42(GTPγS) or histone 4, Thr-402 in the catalytic domain is autophosphorylated, resulting in stimulation of protein kinase activity with exogenous substrates. Based on a comparison of sequences of γ-PAK with the highly studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cell division kinase 2 (Cdk2), Thr-402 corresponds to the highly conserved threonine, which is located in the p + 1 loop adjacent to the activation loop, as determined by x-ray crystallography (22Hanks S.H.

In PKA and Cdk2, phosphorylation of this threonine is required for activation, as is shown herein for γ-PAK.Autophosphorylation of the regulatory domain of the holoenzyme p58 can occur independently of phosphorylation of Thr-402, but autophosphorylation of Thr-402 is required for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. Following caspase cleavage, autophosphorylation of p27 becomes dependent on a phosphothreonine at position 402, because p27 is now an exogenous substrate.Previously Rudel and Bokoch (6Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) showed that γ-PAK cleavage was correlated with the onset of apoptosis and that the inhibitor of CPP32 cleavage (DEVD-ald) inhibited cleavage of γ-PAK in Jurkat T cells undergoing apoptosis. The site of cleavage, aspartate 212, was identified using recombinant CPP32 or apoptotic cell lysates which cleaved γ-PAK into two fragments, but did not cleave the mutant D212N. That data was confirmed herein by direct sequencing of the CPP32 cleavage site generated in vitro.In other studies, γ-PAK activity was shown to be high in the cytosol of quiescent and serum-starved cells and to be diminished in dividing cells.2 Thus regulation of γ-PAK under conditions of growth and quiescence is different from regulation of γ-PAK during apoptosis. Cleavage by CPP32 allows γ-PAK to be constitutively active leading to cell death, whereas regulation by Cdc42(GTP) produces γ-PAK cycling between active and inactive forms. Activation of γ-PAK can be initiated under different conditions, by binding of small G proteins, in particular Cdc42(GTPγS) (11Jakobi R. Chen C-J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2012252040,"A multitracer study of a small aquifer in northern Switzerland indicates that the atmosphere in central Europe cooled by at least 5 degreesC during the last glacial period. The relation between oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O) and recharge temperatures reconstructed for this period is similar to the present-day one if a shift in the delta18O value of the oceans during the ice age is taken into account. This similarity suggests that the present-day delta18O-temperature relation can be used to reconstruct paleoclimate conditions in northern Switzerland. A gap in calculated groundwater age between about 17,000 and 25,000 years before the present indicates that during the last glacial maximum, local groundwater recharge was prevented by overlying glaciers."
https://openalex.org/W2030954770,"The murine fatty acid transport protein (FATP) was identified on the basis of its ability to facilitate uptake of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) when expressed in mammalian cells. To delineate FATP domains important for transport function, we cloned the human heart FATP ortholog. Comparison of the human, murine, and yeast amino acid sequences identified a highly conserved motif, IYTSGTTG<i>X</i>PK, also found in a number of proteins that form adenylated intermediates. We demonstrate that depletion of intracellular ATP dramatically reduces FATP-mediated LCFA uptake. Furthermore, wild-type FATP specifically binds [α-<sup>32</sup>P]azido-ATP. Introduction of a serine to alanine substitution (S250A) in the IYTSGTTG<i>X</i>PK motif produces an appropriately expressed and metabolized mutant FATP that demonstrates diminished LCFA transport function and decreased [α-<sup>32</sup>P]azido-ATP binding. These results are consistent with a mechanism of action for FATP involving ATP binding that is dependent on serine 250 of the IYTSGTTG<i>X</i>PK motif."
https://openalex.org/W1975353423,"We have isolated a cDNA clone for a novel glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase from a rat liver cDNA library in λgt11 by immunoscreening. The authenticity of the clone was confirmed as follows: first, the antibody that had been purified through affinity for the protein expressed by the cloned λgt11 phage recognized only the enzyme in a crude extract from rat liver; and second, two internal amino acid sequences of purified enzyme were identified in the protein sequence predicted from the cDNA. The predicted protein consists of 213 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24,929, which is smaller by ∼3,000 than the value obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This discrepancy of the molecular weight was explained by post-translational modification because the recombinant protein expressed by a mammalian system (Chinese hamster ovary cells) was of the same size as rat liver enzyme but larger than the protein expressed by a bacterial system (Escherichia coli). Chinese hamster ovary cells, originally devoid of glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity, was made to elicit the enzyme activity (1.5 nmol/min/mg of cytosolic protein) by expression of the recombinant protein. Additionally, the cells expressing the enzyme were found to accumulate 1.7 times as much ascorbate as the parental cells after incubation with dehydroascorbate. This result points to the importance of the dehydroascorbic acid reductase in maintaining a high concentration of ascorbate in the cell.

These physiological functions of AA are associated with its univalent or divalent oxidation. The univalent oxidation of AA leads to the formation of monodehydroascorbate that is converted to the divalent oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) through spontaneous disproportionation or further oxidation. Because DHA is unstable at physiological pH and temperature (1Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), regeneration of AA from DHA could be a beneficial process even for many organisms that can synthesize AA themselves. Especially for humans and primates that cannot synthesize it, dietary intake of AA is the only way to supply this vitamin; therefore, a system for regeneration of AA from its oxidized forms would be important for the cell to maintain a normal cellular level of AA. Many reactions potentially contributing to the regeneration of AA in animal cells have been reported. Monodehydroascorbate is reduced to AA by an NADH-dependent enzymatic reaction occurring on subcellular membranes of mitochondria (2Ito A. Hayashi S. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and microsomes (3Hara T. Minakami S. J. Biochem. 1971; 69: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Green R.C. O'Brien P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As for the conversion of DHA to AA, nonenzymatic reduction by GSH has been suggested for a long time (5Borsook H. Davenport H.W. Jeffreys C.E.P. Warner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1937; 117: 237-279Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, because of the slowness of the reaction, much attention has been directed to enzyme-catalyzed reduction of DHA in recent years. Wells et al. (6Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that porcine liver thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) and bovine thymus and human placenta protein disulfide isomerase catalyze the reduction of DHA to AA using GSH as a hydrogen donor. Park and Levine (7Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) also reported that the same enzymatic activity purified from human neutrophils was attributable to glutaredoxin. Besides these enzymes belonging to a family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (8Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and thioredoxin reductase (9May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), both from rat liver, have recently been demonstrated to catalyze the same reaction using NADPH as a hydrogen donor. The reduction of DHA to AA by all of these enzymes appears to take place as a secondary reaction because of their broad substrate specificity. In addition to these enzymes, Maellaro et al. (10Maellaro E. Del Bello B. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported a novel enzyme that catalyzes GSH-dependent reduction of DHA in rat liver. The enzyme shows no thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity and has enzymatic properties different from any of the above-mentioned enzymes. More recently, Xu et al. (11Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Sun G.P. Wells W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have also indicated the occurrence of GSH-dependent DHA reductase with no thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity in human erythrocytes. To characterize this kind of DHA reductase at the molecular level, we have decided to clone a cDNA for the former enzyme. A study of expression of an obtained cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in Escherichia coli revealed that the molecular weight of the primary translation product is increased by certain modification in the former cells. It was also shown that accumulation of AA is increased in the CHO cells that had been made to express DHA reductase, indicating the importance of this enzyme in maintaining a high intracellular concentration of AA. A rat liver cDNA library in λgt11 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with antiserum against rat DHA reductase. The antiserum used was the same that had been raised in a rabbit in our previous study (12Paolicchi A. Pezzini A. Saviozzi M. Piaggi S. Andreuccetti M. Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Casini A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After three rounds of screening, positive clones were isolated. The insert in one of the positive clones was excised from the phage DNA and subcloned into pUC19. The resulting plasmids were analyzed by digestion with restriction enzymes and then sequenced completely on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using an automatic DNA sequencer (373A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed with 5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from rat liver by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The 5′ end portion of DHA reductase-encoding cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using a primer located at nucleotides 330–352 of the cDNA sequence. The subsequent polymerase chain reaction was carried out using an anchor primer and a primer (corresponding to nucleotides 289–312) which is located 5′ to the primer used for the cDNA synthesis, and the resulting product was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Synthesis of the recombinant protein in E. coli cells harboring a positive λgt11 clone was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and proteins in the phage plaques were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes. The resulting membranes were used to purify the antibody that was specific for the recombinant protein expressed by the λgt11 clone, as described by Weinberger et al. (14Weinberger C. Hollenberg S.M. Ong E.S. Harmon J.M. Brower S.T. Cidlowski J. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Science. 1985; 228: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GSH-dependent DHA reductase was purified from rat liver as described previously (12Paolicchi A. Pezzini A. Saviozzi M. Piaggi S. Andreuccetti M. Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Casini A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The DHA reductase was partially digested by Achromobacter lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h. The proteolytic fragments generated were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels) after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol according to the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and were blotted electrophoretically onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was washed extensively with water, stained with 0.06% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol for 5 min, and destained with 30% (v/v) methanol/7% (v/v) acetic acid for 10 min. The portions of the membrane stained for the fragments of interest were excised with a razor blade, and the N-terminal sequence was determined using a gas phase protein sequencer (model 492, Applied Biosystems). The purified preparation of DHA reductase was dialyzed against distilled water and was mixed with a sinnapinic acid matrix solution. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed in positive linear mode with pulsed ion extraction on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Reflex II, Bruker Japan Co. Tsukuba, Japan). Chemical deglycosylation of the purified DHA reductase was performed using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid as described previously (16Horvath E. Edwards A.M. Bell J.C. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of the dry sample was resuspended in 10 μl of anisol (Sigma). After 90 μl of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid was added, the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The sample was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and washed five times with ice-cold diethyl ether. The precipitate was vacuum dried and analyzed by immunoblot analysis according to the procedure described below. To amplify the enzyme-coding region of the cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, we used an oligonucleotide (5′-CCGAGTCTACCATATGAGGTTCTG-3′) containing an NdeI site followed by nucleotides 136–159 of the DHA reductase cDNA as an upstream primer and an oligonucleotide (5′-CTGAGGGATCCTGCCCCTCAGAGC-3′) containing a BamHI site followed by nucleotides 784–807 of the same cDNA as a downstream primer. The polymerase chain reaction was performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing a 1.0 μm concentration of each of the primers, 1.25 units of Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 200 μm dNTPs, and 1 × Ex Taqbuffer supplied by the manufacturer (Takara). The polymerase chain reaction cycle consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified DNA fragment was isolated and subcloned into pGEM-T and then into theNdeI-BamHI site of pET-3a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequence of the insert region in the pGEM-T vector was verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli cells of the strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were transformed with the resulting plasmid, pET/DHAR, and grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 400 μm, and the cells were grown further at 37 °C for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and disrupted by sonication for preparation of cell lysate. To amplify the enzyme-coding region of the cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, we used an oligonucleotide (5′-GTTCTAGAGGCCAGATCCGAGTC-3′) containing anXbaI site followed by nucleotides 120–142 of the DHA reductase cDNA as an upstream primer and an oligonucleotide (5′-CTGAGGGCCCTTGCCCCTCAGAGC-3′) containing an ApaI site followed by nucleotides 784–807 of the same cDNA as a downstream primer. The polymerase chain reaction was performed under the same conditions as described above except that the temperature of the annealing step was 60 °C. The amplified DNA fragment was isolated and subcloned into pGEM-T and then into theXbaI-ApaI site of pRc/CMV. The resulting plasmid, designated pRc/DHAR, is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Exponentially growing cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were electroporated with 10 μg of pRc/DHAR at 200 V and 950 microfarads with a time constant of 30–40 ms using an electroporation apparatus (Gene Pulser II). The transfected cells were subsequently selected in the same medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 by exchanging the medium every 3 days for 2 weeks, and individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders. Thereafter, the cloned cells were maintained in the medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane with the transfer buffer of Towbin et al. (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) at 15 V for 1 h in a semidry electroblot apparatus (Taitec, Saitama, Japan). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-DHA reductase antibody and then visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Organon Pharmaceuticals) as secondary antibody and 4-methoxy-1-naphthol (Aldrich) as a chromogenic substrate. Cells were suspended in ice-cold 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml pepstatin A and sonicated meticulously in an ice water bath by three 2-s bursts with 30-s cooling intervals. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Then, GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity in the supernatant obtained was measured as described previously (10Maellaro E. Del Bello B. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, the formation of AA was followed by an increase in absorbance at 265 nm (ε = 14,700 m−1 cm−1) when the supernatant (40 μg of protein) was added to a mixture (0.2 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.25 mm DHA, and 1 mm GSH. Total RNA was isolated from various organs by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNA (5 μg) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose-glyoxal gel, blotted onto GeneScreen Plus membrane (Dupont NEN), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled DHA reductase cDNA prepared by random priming. Hybridization was carried out in 5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the membrane was washed at 60 °C for 1 h in 0.1 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. For standardization of the amount of RNA in each lane, after hybridization with DHA reductase cDNA, the blots were stripped by incubation in 0.01 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and 0.01% SDS at 95 °C for 1 h and reprobed with mouse β-actin cDNA (18Tokunaga K. Taniguchi H. Yoda K. Shimizu M. Sakiyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) that had been labeled with 32P. Cells were seeded in T-25 tissue culture flasks and grown until semiconfluency. After the culture medium was removed, the cells were once rinsed with incubation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, 1.1 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mmglucose, 0.3 mm MgSO4, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated in 5 ml of the same fresh buffer at 30 °C for various times after addition of 150 μm DHA that had been prepared immediately before use by bromine oxidation of AA. The AA in the cells was determined by HPLC after conversion to its dinitrophenyl hydrazine derivative as described by Kodaka et al. (19Kodaka K. Inagaki S. Ujiie T. Ueno T. Suda H. Vitamins (Kyoto). 1985; 59: 451-455Google Scholar). Briefly, collected cells were sonicated in 3% metaphosphoric acid, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Ten microliters of 0.2% dichlorophenol indophenol, 150 μl of 2% thiourea, and 30 μl of 2% dinitrophenylhydrazine and 9 N sulfuric acid were successively added to 165 μl of the supernatant, and the resulting mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 90 min. Then, the reaction product was extracted into 200 μl of ethyl acetate. The sample was subjected to HPLC on a Shodex SIL-5B silica column (4.6 × 250 mm; Showadenko, Tokyo, Japan) with a mobile phase of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/acetic acid (3.5:5.5:1) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the detection was carried out spectrophotometrically at 495 nm. For this analysis a LaChrom HPLC apparatus (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used. A total amount of vitamin C (a sum of AA and DHA) is determined by this procedure. By skipping the addition of dichlorophenol indophenol, one can measure the amount of DHA only, and the amount of AA is obtained as the difference between the two measurements. To isolate a cDNA encoding rat liver DHA reductase, we screened a rat liver cDNA library in λgt 11 using antiserum directed against the enzyme as a probe. Four positive plaques were obtained from ∼1 × 106 phages from the library. The cDNA inserts in these clones were almost the same in length (∼850 bp), and their restriction patterns were the same in fragment sizes (data not shown); however, their first nucleotides at 5′ ends were different from each other, indicating that all the clones were independent ones. The cDNA of the longest clone was 847 bp in length, and a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment led us to isolate a cDNA with an additional 37-bp sequence at its 5′ end. As shown in Fig. 1, the determined cDNA sequence, 884 bp in length, consists of a 5′ untranslated region of 148 bp, a 3′ untranslated region of 97 bp, and an open reading frame of 639 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 213 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 24,929. There is no standard polyadenylation sequence in the vicinity of the poly(A) tail. The start of the coding sequence should be the first ATG, because an in-frame stop codon (TGA) is located upstream of it (at nucleotides 8–10 of the cDNA). The sequence (ACAGCATGAG) surrounding the ATG essentially conforms to a consensus sequence for the translation initiation site (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). The molecular weight calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (24,929) is considerably smaller than the value (31,000) obtained previously by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purified DHA reductase (10Maellaro E. Del Bello B. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine the actual molecular weight of the enzyme, we carried out MALDI-TOF mass analysis and found a peak atm/z = 27,920 in positive ion mode (data not shown). The result indicated that the molecular weight of the enzyme estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is anomalously larger than that obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It is noted that the molecular weight of the deduced amino acid sequence is still smaller (by ∼3,000) than the actual one. Because of the definitive discrepancy of the molecular weights, we carefully investigated the authenticity of the isolated clone. First, a possibility was excluded that the antibody reacting with the recombinant protein expressed by the cloned λgt11 was an autoantibody that was fortuitously present in the antiserum used. The antibody reacting with the recombinant protein was selected from the antiserum with the protein of plaques formed by the cloned λgt11, as described by Weinberger et al. (14Weinberger C. Hollenberg S.M. Ong E.S. Harmon J.M. Brower S.T. Cidlowski J. Thompson E.B. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Science. 1985; 228: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and used for immunoblotting of a crude extract from rat liver tissue. This analysis showed only a single band at the same position as that of rat liver DHA reductase (data not shown), indicating that the antibody reacted only with the reductase protein in the liver. Second, the authenticity of the cDNA clone was further confirmed by sequence analysis of purified DHA reductase. The sequences of two peptide fragments produced by partial digestion of the enzyme with Achromobacter lysyl endopeptidase were found to be identical to the deduced amino acids at positions 73–99 and 83–103, respectively (Fig. 1). A peptide sequence determined previously for this enzyme by Maellaro et al. (10Maellaro E. Del Bello B. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) also agreed, albeit not completely, with the deduced amino acids at positions 13–32. Thus, it is clear that the obtained cDNA clone does encode GSH-dependent DHA reductase. We hypothesized that the above-mentioned discrepancy of the molecular weight is attributable to post-translational modification of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we prepared bacterial and eukaryotic expression plasmids, pET/DHAR and pRc/DHAR, respectively, containing the cloned cDNA and used them to express recombinant protein in E. coli and CHO cells. Immunoblot analysis disclosed that the recombinant protein produced in CHO cells had the same molecular weight as that of purified DHA reductase (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the molecular weight of the recombinant protein produced in E. coli cells was smaller and comparable to the value predicted from the cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). These results clearly indicate that the increase in molecular weight observed for the protein produced in the mammalian system is caused by a certain post-translational modification that does not take place in the bacterial system. In the deduced amino acid sequence, no potential N-glycosylation site (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) is present. Moreover, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid treatment, which removes both N- and O-linked carbohydrates, did not reduce the molecular weight of purified DHA reductase (data not shown), excluding the possibility of glycosylation as a means of the modification. The means of the modification remains to be elucidated. Computer-assisted comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rat DHA reductase with sequences in the database revealed that the enzyme had 81.2 and 76.5% amino acid sequence identity with hypothetical proteins from mouse and human lymphoma cells, 2The database information used is: GenBank accession no. U80819, hypothetical protein from mouse lymphoma cells; and GenBank accession no. U90313, hypothetical protein from human lymphoma cells.respectively (Fig. 3). Because the homologies are relatively low for the phylogenetically near species, whether they have GSH-dependent DHA reductase is an interesting point. On the other hand, there is no significant sequence homology with either glutaredoxin or protein disulfide isomerase.Figure 3Alignment of amino acid sequence of rat liver GSH-dependent DHA reductase and its homologs.

A single major band was observed at ∼0.9 kilobase for all the organs examined, and this result agreed with the broad distribution of the DHA reductase among organs, as previously revealed by activity measurement and immunoblot analysis (12Paolicchi A. Pezzini A. Saviozzi M. Piaggi S. Andreuccetti M. Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Casini A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether the recombinant protein expressed with the cloned cDNA was catalytically active. Because CHO cells had no detectable level of GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity, we used this cell line for this test. An appreciable degree of the enzyme activity was observed in the cytosolic fraction from CHO cells that had been stably transfected with the expression vector pRc/DHAR. The activity was 1.5 nmol/min/mg of protein, a value similar to that in the cytosol from rat liver (10Maellaro E. Del Bello B. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Paolicchi A. Pezzini A. Saviozzi M. Piaggi S. Andreuccetti M. Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Casini A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to test a physiological function of the enzyme expressed, we measured the level of AA accumulated in cells that had been incubated with DHA, because this could be a cumulative parameter that would reflect DHA reductase expression. DHA has been recognized as a source of AA because it is imported into cells more readily than AA via glucose transporters (21Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 22Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

In fact, the rate of DHA accumulation by various kinds of cells was reported to increase in proportion to the activity of DHA reductase in their cytosol (24Bigley R. Riddle M. Layman D. Stankova L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and human neutrophils (7Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6088-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), both of which contain high concentrations of AA, have recently been shown to possess DHA reductases such as glutaredoxin and GSH-dependent DHA reductase. pRc/DHAR-transfected CHO cells expressing the recombinant DHA reductase and the nontransfected CHO cells both contained no appreciable amount of AA when cultured in the usual medium, which is deficient in vitamin C. When these cells were incubated with 150 μm DHA, they accumulated total vitamin C (AA plus DHA) to steady-state levels within 1 h. The cells expressing the recombinant enzyme accumulated 32.2 nmol of total vitamin C/mg of cell protein, whereas the nontransfected cells accumulated 18.6 nmol of total vitamin C/mg of cell protein; thus the DHA reductase-expressing cells accumulated 1.7 times the amount of total vitamin C compared with nontransfected cells (Fig. 5). More than 95% of the accumulated vitamin C was found to be in the reduced form. Because the nontransfected CHO cells contained no protein immunoreactive to anti-DHA reductase antibody (Fig. 2), it should be that the increase in the accumulation of AA is effected by the DHA reductase expressed by pRc/DHAR; thus the present study points to the importance of DHA reductase in maintaining a high concentration of AA in cells.

The serum response element (SRE)1 (1Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar) is present in the upstream regulatory sequences of a number of immediate early genes such as c-fos (2Treisman R.

The SRE is constitutively occupied by a complex of two proteins, serum response factor (SRF) (4Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R.

Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). SRF belongs to the MADS box family of proteins (6Shore P. Sharrocks A.D.

Biochem. 1988; 173: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TCF does not bind autonomously to the element, but requires the assistance of SRF to efficiently contact the DNA (8Schroter H.

The sequence recognized by TCF, located upstream of the CArG box, is in the form of CAGGA, a sequence that binds proteins from the Ets family. Several Ets proteins display a TCF activity on the c-fos SRE: ELK-1 (10Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A.

In addition, the SRE is recognized by oncogenic fusion proteins such as EWS-FL1 (14Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Masutani H. Robin P. Lipinski M. Harel-Bellan A.

Transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors depends primarily upon a ligand-dependent activation function, AF2, located in the C terminus and predicted to undergo an allosteric change upon ligand binding (40Mangelsdorf D.J.

From these results it was suggested that chromatin remodeling by cofactors may contribute, through histone acetylation-deacetylation, to transcription factor-mediated transcriptional regulation. In light of the fact that SRC-1 is capable of forming a complex with CBP and p300 that in turn coactivates the c-fos SRE through TCF (38Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and SRF (39Ramirez S. Ali S.A.S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we tested whether SRC-1 itself participates in the SRE-mediated transactivations as well. Herein, we show that 1) SRC-1 specifically binds to SRF, 2) SRC-1 coactivates the SRE-mediated transactivations, and 3) p300 synergizes with SRC-1 in this coactivation. These results suggest that at least two distinct classes of coactivator molecules (i.e. SRC-1 and CBP/p300) may cooperate to regulate SRF-dependent transactivationsin vivo.

Because CBP and p300 were also found to coactivate the c-fosSRE through interactions with TCF (38Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and SRF (39Ramirez S. Ali S.A.S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we tested whether SRC-1 itself functionally interacts with SRF by using the in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull down assays. GST alone and GST-fusion to SRF were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with in vitro translated luciferase and SRC-1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the radiolabeled SRC-1 readily interacted with GST/SRF, but not with GST alone, whereas the radiolabeled luciferase didn't bind any of the GST proteins, as expected. In addition, SRC-B, SRC-D, and SRC-E, among various SRC-1 fragments, specifically interacted with GST/SRF, but not with GST alone (Fig. 1 B). To independently prove these interactions in vivo, we exploited the mammalian two-hybrid tests (62Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Consistent with the existence of a strong transcriptional repressive domain at the N-terminal sequences (16Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Gal4 fusion protein to a full-length SRF (Gal4-SRF) significantly repressed the basal level of transcription directed by Gal4 alone (data not shown). The Gal4-SRF-mediated transactivation, however, was stimulated by coexpression of VP16-SRC-1, but not VP16 alone, in a dose-dependent manner with cotransfection of 100 ng of VP16/SRC-1 increasing the fold activation approximately 3-fold, indicating that SRC-1 specifically interacts with SRF in vivo (Fig. 1 C). In addition, these interactions were also confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid tests (57Na S.–Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.–S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 58Lee S.–K. Kim H.–J. Na S.–Y. Kim T.–S. Choi H.–S. Im S.–Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16651-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Table I). Coexpression of a B42 fusion to the full-length SRF further stimulated the LexA/SRC-D- and LexA/SRC-E-mediated LacZ expressions, whereas coexpression of a B42 alone was without any effects (Table I). Consistent with thein vitro results, the LacZ expressions mediated by LexA fusions to SRC-A or -C were not stimulated by coexpression of B42-SRF. However, the interaction of SRF with SRC-B, which was readily detected in the GST-pull downs (Fig. 1 B), was not observed in yeast. This discrepancy is not currently understood but may reflect the fundamental differences between two different assay systems. These results, along with the mammalian two-hybrid and GST pull-down results, suggest that SRC-1 directly associates with SRF through multiple subregions of SRC-1.Table IInteractions of SRC-1 with SRF in yeastLexA fusions to(−)SRC-ASRC-BSRC-CSRC-DSRC-EB42/−−−−−+−B42/SRF−−−−+++++The indicated B42 and LexA plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate LacZ reporter gene.

To assess the functional consequences of these interactions, SRC-1 was cotransfected into HeLa cells along with a reporter construct SRE-c-fos-TK-LUC. This reporter construct, previously characterized to efficiently mediate the SRE-mediated transactivations in various cell types, consists of a minimal promoter from the c-fos gene and a single upstream consensus SRE (60Johansen F.F. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Serum shock with 20% fetal calf serum resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in transactivation of this reporter construct, relative to the level with non-shocked cells (data not shown). Increasing amounts of cotransfected SRC-1 enhanced the reporter gene expressions in an SRC-1 dose-dependent manner, with cotransfection of 200 ng of SRC-1 increasing the fold activation approximately 8-fold (Fig. 2). Consistent with the reports that CBP and p300 are transcription coactivators of SRF and TCF (38Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Ramirez S. Ali S.A.S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31016-31021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), increasing amounts of cotransfected p300 also had stimulatory effects on the reporter gene expressions, with cotransfection of 50 ng of p300 increasing the fold activation approximately 2-fold. Consistent with an idea that SRC-1 and p300 synergize to coactivate the SRE-mediated transactivations, coexpression of p300 and SRC-1 dramatically increased the reporter gene expressions above the levels observed with SRC-1 or p300 alone, with cotransfection of 50 ng of p300 and 200 ng of SRC-1 increasing the fold activation approximately 80-fold (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, cotransfection of SRC-1 did not affect the LacZ reporter expression of the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal either in the presence or absence of serum shock (data not shown). In summary, we have shown that SRC-1 interacts with SRF and coactivates SRE-mediated transactivations in synergy with p300, which was also shown to be a coactivator of SRF and TCF (38Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Ramirez S. Ali S.A.S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol.

This synergy is believed to reflect a cooperative recruitment of two different coactivator molecules (i.e. SRC-1 and CBP-p300) by SRF and TCF. It's possible that these two distinct histone acetyltransferases (46Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Thus, SRC-1 may regulate yet other transcription factors, particularly ones already found to be regulated by CBP and p300.

Type 1 IGF receptor and the insulin receptor are members of the tyrosine kinase receptors family and mediate most of the biological effects of IGF-II (1Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Physiol.

Genetic evidence suggests that the IGF2R gene encodes a negative regulator of growth. Many human tumors show loss of heterozygosity at the IGF2R locus frequently accompanied by mutations in the remaining allele (3Hankins G.R. De Souza A.T. Bentley R.C. Patel M.R. Marks J.R.

IGF2R is a multifunctional protein that participates in the activation of TGF-β1, regulates lysosomal enzymes trafficking, and binds a number of ligands including proliferin, herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, thyroglobulin, and retinoic acid (9Kornfeld S.

A soluble form of IGF2R (sIGF2R) is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the membrane form of the receptor and is present in the serum, amniotic fluid, and urine of rodents and humans. sIGF2R binds IGF-II with high affinity in vivo and can bind mannose 6-phosphate in vitro, suggesting that it shares at least some of its ligand specificity with the membrane IGF2R (15Kiess W.

First, sIGF2R can inhibit DNA synthesis induced by IGF-II and epidermal growth factor in cultured rat hepatocytes (20Scott C.D. Ballesteros M. Madrid J. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Second, we have obtained transgenic mice expressing a soluble IGF2R by deletion of the transmembrane domain sequence (sΔIgf2r) and fused to the regulatory sequence of the keratin 10 promoter to target expression to the alimentary canal, skin, and uterus (K10sΔIgf2r transgene). Two lines of K10sΔIgf2r transgenic mice (Kipps and Krishna) showed a 9–20% reduction of wet weight, dry weight, and water content in the alimentary canal. The effects of sΔIGF2R expression were mainly local, because the organs negative for transgene expression were only marginally affected (21Zaina, S., Newton, R. V. S., Paul, M. R., and Graham, C. F. (1998) Endocrinology, in pressGoogle Scholar). The interpretation of the biological activity of sIGF2R is complicated by the heterogeneity of its ligands. To understand to what extent the biological activity of sΔIGF2R is due to interaction with IGF-II, we crossed K10sΔIgf2r transgenics by the following genetically modified mice: 1) transgenics expressing aK10Igf2 minigene and showing local organomegaly (Blast line; Ref. 22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). If sΔIGF2R acts by reducing the activity of IGF-II, double transgenics Blast and K10sΔIgf2r should show an attenuation of organomegaly compared with Blast. 2) mice in which the paternal (active) allele of the Igf2 gene is disrupted (Igf2 +/p− ).Igf2 m+/p− mice show a growth deficiency phenotype and are fertile (23DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). If sΔIGF2R acts exclusively by interacting with IGF-II, organ size should not be affected in K10sΔIgf2r transgenics that are alsoIgf2 m+/p− compared withIgf2 m+/p− mice. The results of the present work provide insights into the mechanism of organ size reduction by the soluble IGF2R. K10sΔIgf2r (linesKipps and Krishna) transgenic mice express a mutant mouse Igf2r cDNA in which the sequence encoding the transmembrane domain has been deleted to encode a soluble polypeptide (sΔIGF2R). The mutant cDNA is under the transcriptional control of the keratin 10 promoter (K10).Kipps is the line expressing theK10sΔIgf2r transgene at highest levels, and Krishna is the second best expressing line; their phenotype has been described in detail (21Zaina, S., Newton, R. V. S., Paul, M. R., and Graham, C. F. (1998) Endocrinology, in pressGoogle Scholar). K10Igf2(Blast) and Igf2 m+/p− mice have been described elsewhere (22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). All mice used in this study were heterozygotes (indicated as K10sΔIgf2r/+, K10Igf2/+ and Igf2 m+/p−) in a mixed genetic background as the integrated transgenes were bred from a F1(C57Bl/6 × CBA) onto a 129J/Sv genetic background. In both crosses the K10sΔIgf2r transgene was transmitted maternally, because Blast females are usually not fertile, and the disrupted copy of the imprinted Igf2 gene has to be transmitted paternally (22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that the phenotype of K10sΔIgf2r/+ mice is altered by the sex of the parent, which transmits the transgene. Genotyping was performed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from blood by using Isocode Stix (Schleicher & Schuell) according to manufacturer's instructions or from tail tissue (24Gemmell N.J. Akiyama S. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 338-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The following protocols were used. 1) K10sΔIgf2r(Kipps and Krishna lines): forward primer, 5′-ACGAGACCGCTGACTGCCAGTACC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGCCATTCTGTCTCATTCTCATCTGTCTCC-3′. These two primers amplify the region of the Igf2r cDNA containing the deletion. The K10sΔIgf2r transgene produced a unique 256-bp fragment. The conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. 2) K10Igf2(Blast line): forward primer, 5′-TTCAAAACCAAACATATTGGGGCTGG-3′ (corresponding to a sequence 140 bp 5′ to the TATA box of the keratin 10 promoter), and reverse primer, 5′-TGAAGTAGAAGCCGCGGTCCGAACAG-3′ (corresponding to the 3′ end of exon 4 in the Igf2 gene). The conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, 53 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. TheBlast transgene produced a unique 357-bp fragment. 3)Igf2 m+/p−: forward primer, 5′-GTGTTCCGGCTGTCAGCGCA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTCCTGATAGCGGTCCGCCA-3′, both corresponding to sequences in the neo r gene. The conditions were 94 °C for 1 min and 70 °C for 4 min for 35 cycles. Theneo r gene produced a unique 555-bp fragment. Analysis of organ weights was performed in 90-day-old mice produced by crossing heterozygotesK10sΔIgf2r/+ (Kipps orKrishna line) by K10Igf2/+ orIgf2 m+/p− mice. Live weight was recorded, and then anesthetized mice were bled by decapitation and dissected, and the total wet weight of organs was measured after removal of fat and mesenteries. The contents of the alimentary canal were removed by gentle scraping in phosphate-buffered saline followed by blotting in tissue paper. Organs were always dissected in the same order to normalize wet weight loss due to evaporation. Each organ was cut in two or three parts, and the parts were weighed. This made it possible to calculate the total organ dry weight, water content, DNA, and detergent-soluble protein content after assaying different parts. For dry weight measurement, tissue fragments were dried at 65 °C for 6 days. Detergent-soluble protein was measured by the Coomassie Blue method (Bradford reagent, Sigma) after tissue homogenization in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl. DNA content was measured in the same extract usingt the Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome, following addition of NaCl to 2m final concentration and brief sonication (25Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). For all measured parameters, relative values (e.g. per mg wet weight) were first obtained by dividing the value obtained for a given tissue part by the weight of that tissue part. This relative value was then multiplied by the total organ wet weight to obtain the total value (e.g. for the whole organ). Total water content was calculated by subtracting the total dry weight from the total wet weight. Total water content was divided by the total dry weight to obtain the water content/unit dry weight. All comparisons were by paired t test of pairs of mice matched for litter, age, and sex. The number of paired comparisons used in each t test was in some cases lower than the total number of animals displayed in each column of genotypes (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV). The reason was that in comparing two given groups, only mice that could be matched were used, and this was frequently a subset of one of the two groups. Thus the description of the phenotype for each genotype given in the tables does not always indicate the mean value of the phenotype character that was involved in paired t tests.Table ICrosses K10Igf2/+ × K10sΔIgf2r/+: body weights and parameters of organs coexpressing the K10Igf2 and K10sΔIgf2r transgenesABCWild typeK10Igf2/+ (Blast)K10Igf2/+/K10sΔIgf2r/+KippsKrishnaBody weight1-aWeight expressed in grams.25.6 ± 0.7 (13)28.3 ± 0.8w* (13)26.2 ± 0.5 (11)31.1 ± 1.4 (9)Stomach Wet weight158.9 ± 5.6 (13)185.4 ± 5.7w** (12)146.5 ± 5.2w*/B** (13)152.7 ± 8.3B* (6) Dry weight32.9 ± 1.3 (12)41.8 ± 0.9w** (10)32.4 ± 1.6B* (12)32.6 ± 1.7B* (6) Water content1-bWater content/unit dry weight.3.7 ± 0.2 (12)3.5 ± 0.1 (7)3.6 ± 0.2 (12)3.7 ± 0.1 (6) DNA0.24 ± 0.05 (10)0.27 ± 0.04 (10)0.20 ± 0.06 (7)0.20 ± 0.05 (8) Protein1-cDetergent-soluble protein.4.3 ± 1.7 (11)4.8 ± 1.2 (11)5.3 ± 1.4 (7)7.4 ± 1.5 (8)Small intestine Wet weight964.9 ± 30.7 (13)1141.4 ± 27.5w** (9)982.1 ± 48.5B** (11)998.2 ± 36.9 (6) Dry weight207.1 ± 10.0 (12)252.8 ± 11.6w* (11)194.7 ± 8.1B* (12)211.6 ± 10.6B* (6) Water content1-bWater content/unit dry weight.3.7 ± 0.3 (12)3.8 ± 0.1 (8)3.9 ± 0.2 (11)3.7 ± 0.1 (8) DNA3.2 ± 0.7 (10)4.3 ± 0.9 (10)2.6 ± 0.9 (7)1.8 ± 1.2B* (8) Protein1-cDetergent-soluble protein.29.2 ± 3.9 (11)28.5 ± 7.2 (11)32.0 ± 6.2 (7)41.1 ± 2.3 (8)Cecum Wet weight158.7 ± 6.3 (14)282.4 ± 20.6w*** (10)202.0 ± 9.1w***/B** (12)205.0 ± 5.1w***/B* (6)Colon Wet weight447.3 ± 24.2 (14)969.1 ± 59.9w*** (10)641.1 ± 46.9w***/B* (12)834.9 ± 36.1w***/B* (7) Dry weight87.0 ± 3.3 (12)168.1 ± 7.5w*** (11)121.7 ± 3.4w***/B** (12)145.2 ± 4.5w***/B* (6) Water content1-bWater content/unit dry weight.4.1 ± 0.1 (11)4.3 ± 0.1 (7)4.3 ± 0.4 (12)4.6 ± 0.2 (6) DNA0.9 ± 0.2 (10)2.0 ± 0.4w* (10)1.4 ± 0.6 (7)0.8 ± 0.4B* (8) Protein1-cDetergent-soluble protein.21.4 ± 3.7 (11)28.7 ± 2.0 (11)31.7 ± 8.9 (7)28.5 ± 2.6 (8)Skin Wet weight1-aWeight expressed in grams.2.7 ± 0.21 (13)4.3 ± 0.36w*** (9)3.8 ± 0.28w**/B** (11)3.2 ± 0.23w* (5)Uterus Wet weight91.2 ± 10.2 (6)433.3 ± 24.1w*** (6)404.6 ± 95.2w* (6)502.4 ± 59.8w** (5)Values are mean weights (mg) ± S.E. in wild type (column A), heterozygotes overexpressing a K10Igf2 transgene (K10Igf2/+, Blast line, column B), and double transgenics overexpressing both the K10Igf2and the K10sΔIgf2r(K10sΔIgf2r/+, Kipps, and Krishna lines, column C) transgenes.

For values and symbols see legend of Table III. Igf2 RNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. 1 μg of total RNA was reversed transcribed by using the Reverse Transcription System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GAAGTCGATGTTGGTGCTTCTCATCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAAGCCTGGCGCCGAAGATGAAGT-3′ (reverse). These primers recognize sequences in exon 4 of the Igf2 gene and produce a 139-bp product (Ref. 22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and references therein). To control for errors in pipetting and RNA quantitation, primers specific for the mouse G3PDH cDNA were included in the same PCR tube (CLONTECH). The conditions for amplification were 94 °C for 3 min, 53 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. Products were separated in a 1.6% TBE-agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To find out whether the soluble receptor could reduce growth stimulated by excess local IGF-II, two transgenes were crossed into the same mice. The transcription of both transgenes was driven by the same keratin 10 promoter, and their patterns of organ expression overlapped. The matings to produce these double transgenics also generated mice with one or the other of the transgenes. The phenotype of the singleK10Igf2/+ transgenic is first described to provide the base line for comparison with the double transgenic. Heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the Igf2 gene under the transcriptional control of the keratin 10 promoter (Blast line, K10Igf2/+) showed local organ overgrowth as described previously (22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Organ wet weight was significantly increased in the alimentary canal, skin, and uterus compared with controls, whereas wet weight was normal in organs negative for transgene expression (column A versus column B in Tables I and II). Total dry weight followed a very similar pattern in the organs examined (column A versuscolumn B, Tables I and II). An increase of water content relative to dry matter content (edema) has been shown in mice with elevated levels of IGF-II (8Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstradiatis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The water content relative to dry weight was unchanged in Blast in all organs examined (columns A versuscolumn B, Tables I and II). DNA and detergent-soluble protein contents did not change significantly in any of the organs examined, with the exception of the colon as reported (22Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this organ the total DNA content was increased by a similar extent as wet and dry weights (Table I, column A versus column B). The phenotype of K10sΔIgf2r/+ mice was a reduced wet weight of the alimentary canal (21Zaina, S., Newton, R. V. S., Paul, M. R., and Graham, C. F. (1998) Endocrinology, in pressGoogle Scholar). The aim of the crossK10sΔIgf2r/+ × Blast was to compare the extent of organomegaly in double transgenics with wild type and Blast/+. For these two reasons, the phenotype of K10sΔIgf2r/+ mice will be described in the context of the cross K10sΔIgf2r/+ ×Igf2 m+/p− (see the next section; column C in Tables III and IV). In the double transgenics, the extra soluble receptor transgene (K10sΔIgf2r, either Kipps orKrishna) was in the same mouse as the transgene that expressed excess IGF-II (K10Igf2, Blastline). A reduction of organomegaly was observed in most of the organs coexpressing the two transgenes. Organ wet weight was significantly reduced in double transgenics compared with Blast in the alimentary canal (column C versus column B, Table I). This reduction ranged from more than 100% in the stomach to about 50% in the cecum and colon and was more pronounced in theBlast/Kipps double transgenics (column C, Table I; Fig. 1). This result is consistent with the relative levels of the K10sΔIgf2rtransgene expression in the two lines (21Zaina, S., Newton, R. V. S., Paul, M. R., and Graham, C. F. (1998) Endocrinology, in pressGoogle Scholar). In the skin, a significant reduction of organomegaly (∼50%) was observed only in Blast/Kipps double transgenics (column C versuscolumn B, Table I). No effect of sΔIGF2R expression was observed on the wet weight of the uterus (column C versus column B, Table I). Coexpression of the two transgenes produced a decrease in organ dry weight comparable with the decrease in wet weight and did not alter DNA content or detergent-soluble protein content (column Bversus column C, Table I). The decrease in dry weight was more marked in Blast/Kipps than in Blast/Krishnadouble transgenics (column C, Table I). DNA content was significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon in Blast/Krishnamice compared with Blast (column C versus B, Table I). No major change in the organ parameters measured was observed in the organs, which did not express the transgene (column Cversus column B, Table II). Mice carrying a disruptedIgf2 paternal allele (Igf2 m+/p−) were 30% smaller than wild type at 90 days in a C57Bl/6/CBA/129J/Sv mixed genetic background and were fertile as reported (Ref. 23DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar; column B versus column A, Table III). The levels of IGF-II transcript and peptide in Igf2 m+/p− mice were below the detection limit in three independent assays. First, no IGF-II transcript was detectable in the stomach at 10 days by reverse transcription-PCR (results not shown). Second, serum obtained fromIgf2 m+/p− mice was included in a IGF-II radioimmunoassay as a negative control during the characterization of the K10sΔIgf2r/+ transgenics (21Zaina, S., Newton, R. V. S., Paul, M. R., and Graham, C. F. (1998) Endocrinology, in pressGoogle Scholar). IGF-II peptide levels were below the sensitivity of the assay. Third, in an independent study in our laboratory, the stomach and small intestine of Igf2 m+/p− mice were shown to contain no detectable Igf2 transcript when analyzed by a specific RNA in situ hybridization assay. 2B. Hassan, unpublished observations. Analysis of individual organs revealed that the wet weight of most organs was proportionate to the whole body weight (values of r close to 1, column B in Tables III and IV).

Aldosterone stimulates methylation of a 95-kDa protein in apical membrane of A6 cells, and we have previously shown that methylation of a 95-kDa protein in the immunopurified Na+ channel complex increases open probability of these channels in planar lipid bilayers. We report here that aldosterone stimulates carboxylmethylation of the β subunit of xENaC in A6 cells. In vitro translated β subunit, but not α or γ, serves as a substrate for carboxylmethylation. Carboxylmethylation of ENaC reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers leads to an increase in open probability only when β subunit is present. When the channel complex is immunoprecipitated from A6 cells and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to the three subunits of xENaC, all three subunits are recognized as constituents of the complex. The results suggest that Na+ channel activity in A6 cells is regulated, in part, by carboxylmethylation of the β subunit of xENaC.

Aldosterone-stimulated sodium channel activity has been shown to involve methylation of membrane proteins (1Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M.B. Weismann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Weismann W.P. Johnson J.P. Miura G.A. Chiang P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F43-F47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the aldosterone-induced increase in the activity of xENaC is blockable by the methylation inhibitor, 3-deaza-adenosine (3Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.L. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sariban-Sohraby has demonstrated that aldosterone stimulates the methylation of a 90–95-kDa protein in the apical membrane of A6 cells (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Abramow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that methylation of the 95-kDa subunit of an immunopurified renal sodium channel complex reconstituted in lipid bilayers results in increased sodium channel activity (5Ismailov I.I.

In both studies the identity of the methylated protein is unknown. The epithelial Na+ channel from A6 cells (xENaC) has recently been cloned and is made up of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (6Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar, 7Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When all three subunits are expressed in aXenopus oocyte expression system, a low conductance, Na+-selective, amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel typical of native cortical collecting duct is observed (7Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although expression of the α subunit is sufficient to generate Na+channel activity, co-expression of all three subunits is necessary for maximal activity (7Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, when β and γ are expressed individually or together, no Na+ channel activity is detectable (6Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar, 7Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J.

Thus β and γ subunits of xENaC demonstrate an important role in the regulation of Na+ channel activity. The observation that COOH-terminal truncations in either the β or γ subunit are responsible for the Na+ channel hyperactivity in Liddle's syndrome is also consistent with a regulatory role for these subunits (9Hansson J.H.

Cells were grown as described previously in amphibian medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of humidified air-4%CO2 at room temperature (14Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M.

To ensure high rates of basal transport, cells from American Type Culture Collection have been cloned by limiting dilution and selected for high amiloride-sensitive Isc. Cells were grown on millicell inserts (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Transepithelial potential difference, resistance, and Iscwere measured on each as described previously (14Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J.

We synthesized peptides with the amino acid sequence corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal regions of the translated protein with an amino-terminal cysteine: α, NH2-CESLDLRSVGTLSSRSSSMRSNRSYYEENGGRRN-COOH; β, NH2-CDFDHVPVDIPGTPPPNYDSLRVNTAEPVSSDEEN-COOH; and γ, NH2-CGEEDPPTFNSAlQLPQSQDSHVPRTPPPKYNTLRIQSAFGLETIDSDEDVERL-COOH. Each peptide was linked to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The α and γ peptides were injected into chickens and boosted at 1, 2, and 3 months. The β peptide was injected into rabbits and boosted on the same schedule. Antibodies from rabbit serum were immunopurified using a peptide affinity column as described (15Harlow E. Lade D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-551Google Scholar). Antibodies from chicken yolk were isolated using a gamma Yolk purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to kit instructions. The resulting suspension was then passed through the peptide column and isolated as described above. Full-length α, β, and γ xENaC were subcloned behind the T7 promoter for use in anin vitro translations. The α, β, and γ xENaC subunits used in the methylation reactions were generated using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). The product was labeled by the addition of [35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) at a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml. Labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE1 to ensure proper size. A6 cells were grown on 25-mm 0.02 μm Anopore membrane tissue culture inserts (Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL) and pre-treated as necessary prior to the biotinylation procedure. Apical membrane preparations were prepared as described previously (16Coupage-Gerard B. Kleyman T.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar). For each sample, 150 μg of protein incubated with pre-washed avidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were collected and washed in NET buffer (0.1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to Western blotting. This was performed as described previously (14Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, ULTRA-ECL) followed by autoradiography. This was performed as described previously (14Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J.

For immunoprecipitation with chicken antibodies, immobilized anti-chicken IgY (Promega, catalog number G1191) was used in place of Gamma-bind Sepharose beads. The enzyme was prepared from A6 cells grown on plastic dishes. The cells were disrupted by freeze-thawing and subjected to a 5000 ×g spin for 10 min to remove undisrupted cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture). Enzyme activity was determined by incubating 50 μl of this preparation in the presence or absence of 100 μm N-acetyl farnesyl cysteine, a synthetic substrate for carboxylmethylation (17Volker C. Miller R.A. Stock J.B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1990; 1: 283-287Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in the presence of [3H]AdoMet (10 μl of [3H]adenosyl-l-methionine; 55–85 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Enzyme activity was measured by the method of Volker et al. (18Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (15Harlow E. Lade D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-551Google Scholar) and was 2.46 ± 0.09 pmols/μg protein/30 min in the presence of GTP. A6 cells were grown to confluence and then exposed to 1 μm aldosterone or diluent for 4 h. Transepithelial short circuit current was measured prior to and 4 h after addition of aldosterone to document hormone responsiveness and cell viability (data not shown). Cells were then scraped into homogenization buffer and disrupted by repeated freeze-thaw. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation as above. Protein-matched samples were incubated with [3H]AdoMet in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS for 1 h at 27 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 4-fold concentrated sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. To determine whether proteins were carboxylmethylated, the vapor phase method of Clarkeet al. (19Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) was employed. Proteins from either whole cell lysates or methylated cell membrane immunoprecipitation with either the β or γ-xENaC antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and sliced into 1-mm sections from the top of the lane to the dye front. The slices were placed into open ended Eppendorf tubes and exposed to 1 m NaOH. The Eppendorf tubes were then carefully lowered into sealed scintillation vials containing 10 ml of liquid scintillation fluid. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the Eppendorf tubes were removed. The radioactive methanol released as a result of base-mediated breakage of carboxylmethyl esters was counted. These base labile counts are a direct measure of protein carboxylmethylation. Alternatively the radiolabeled immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by autoradiography. For the studies examining the methylation of in vitro translated xENaC full-length in vitro translated α-, β-, or γ-xENaC were incubated with [3H]AdoMet in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS and 50 μl of a carboxylmethyltransferase enzyme preparation for 1 h at room temperature. Base labile incorporation of methyl groups was assayed as described above. Planar lipid bilayers were painted with a fire polished glass rod over an aperture of 200-μm diameter in a polysterene chamber. The standard membrane forming solution consisted of a mixture of diphytanoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/diphytanoyl-phosphatidylserine, 2:1 (w/w; final lipid concentration, 25 mg/ml in n-octane). A membrane capacitance of 250–300 picofarad was considered satisfactory for experimentation. The bilayer bathing solutions contained 100 mm NaCl buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm MOPS-Tris. The current-to-voltage converter was connected to the trans side of the bilayer chamber using Ag/AgCl electrodes and 3 m KCl 3% agar bridges. Thus, the trans compartment was held at virtual ground. Reconstituted proteoliposomes containing a mixture of α-, β -, or γ-rENaC proteins were spread over the trans side of a pre-formed bilayer held at -40 mV. This protocol provides a specific sidedness to incorporation of the channels, i.e. they will be oriented with the amiloride-sensitive (extracellular) side facing the trans solution and the cytoplasmic side facing the cis solution in over 90% of the incorporations. Currents were monitored on a strip chart recorder and/or a digital storage oscilloscope and were stored unfiltered on a VCR tape. Current records were low pass filtered at 100 Hz through an 8-pole Bessel filter prior to acquisition using a Digidata 1200 interface and PCLAMP software. Single channel open probability (P o) was calculated for at least 3 min of continuous recording using the equation: P o =I/(N·i) where N is total number of channels, I is the mean current over the period of observation, and i is the unitary current. The total number of channels (N) present in bilayer in each experiment was determined by activating all of them with a hydrostatic pressure gradient. This procedure is derived from previous observations that theP o for approaches 1 when a sufficient hydrostatic pressure gradient is imposed across the bilayer ENaC (11Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S.

Only membranes with single channels were used. DTT pretreatment of ENaCs was performed as described (12Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.Gh. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M.

Paired and non-paired t tests were performed using Sigma Stat Statistical Program (Jandel Scientific). Results were considered significant if p < 0.05. Because we wished to demonstrate channel subunits in the apical membrane, membrane proteins were isolated by selective apical surface biotinylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Biotinylated apical membrane proteins were subjected to precipitation with Avidin beads, and reactive proteins were eluted into sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose, the proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis using the anti-xENaC antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the anti-β and -γ antisera recognize a 97-kDa apical membrane protein in A6 cells. By contrast the anti-α antibody recognized a 150-kDa protein. The predicted molecular mass of the glycosylated form of α xENaC is 75 kDa. This discrepancy may be due to the formation of a α-α dimer in native tissue, as has previously been suggested (11Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The migration of α-ENaC at 150 and 180 kDa has also been observed by other groups (11Ismailov I.I. Awayda M.S. Berdiev B.K. Bubien J.K. Lucas J.E. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

All three proteins in A6 cells were competed away by pre-incubating the antisera with their respective peptide before Western blotting and were not detected when pre-immune serum was used (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with Western blot of proteins from whole cell lysates (data not shown). Because these anti-xENaC subunit antibodies recognize the endogenous proteins, we next determined the ability of these antisera to immunoprecipitate xENaC from A6 cells. A6 lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β or -γ subunit antibody, and reactive proteins were eluted into sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose, the samples were probed with either the anti-β or -γ antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B the anti-β (lane 1) or -γ (lane 4) antibody, both immunoprecipitate a 97-kDa band that was detected by Western blotting using their respective antisera. The 97-kDa band was not seen when either pre-immune serum (lane 3) or antibody preincubated with immunizing peptide (lane 2) was used in the reaction. These results demonstrate that the mature forms of the β and γ subunits isolated from A6 migrate as 97 kDa. After successfully generating and characterizing the specific antisera against the three xENaC subunits, we tested the hypothesis that one or more of these subunits act as substrates for carboxylmethylation. Sariban-Sohraby (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Abramow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that a 95-kDa apical membrane protein was methylated in response to aldosterone, and this process was blocked by spironolactone. In addition, this study showed that a similar protein may be isotopically labeled in vitro in membranes from A6 cells when incubated with [3H]AdoMet in the presence of GTPγS. This apparent methylation was increased in membranes from cells pretreated with aldosterone. To determine whether these isotopically labeled proteins represent carboxylmethyl esters, the vapor phase method of Clarke (19Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) was employed. As shown in Fig. 2, a large number of proteins are carboxylmethylated, including a band at 97 kDa. To determine whether this methylated 97-kDa protein represents a Na+ channel subunit, A6 cells were methylated using [3H]AdoMet, and methylated cell membranes were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific anti-xENaC antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, the anti-β antibody immunoprecipitated a 97-kDa protein from both aldosterone-treated cells and from control cells incubated with GTPγS. In the absence of GTPγS, the anti-β antibody did not immunoprecipitate any methylated protein (data not shown). By contrast, the anti-γ antibody did not immunoprecipitate a methylated protein under any condition.Figure 3β-xENaC subunit is methylated in A6 cells. Cell membranes from A6 cells treated with either aldosterone or diluent were carboxylmethylated in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-β- or γ-xENaC. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively, methylated cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-β- or γ-xENaC antibody were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was sliced, and the gel slices were exposed to NaOH as described under “Experimental Procedures” to allow determination of base labile counts. As shown in Fig. 4, the protein that was immunoprecipitated with the anti-β-xENaC antibody has been carboxylmethylated. To confirm that β-xENaC is a substrate for methylation, full-length, in vitro translated xENaC subunits were incubated with [3H]AdoMet in the presence or absence of GTPγS. A carboxylmethyltransferase enzyme preparation, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was included in the reaction mixture. This enzyme preparation did not contain detectable amounts of any xENaC subunits when examined by Western blot (not shown). The results show that the in vitro translated β-xENaC protein was a suitable substrate for methylation in the presence of but not in the absence of GTPγS (Fig. 5). We were unable to demonstrate methylation of either in vitro translated α- or γ-xENaC. Taken together these results indicate that in A6 cells, only the β-xENaC subunit is carboxylmethylated in the response to aldosterone.Figure 5Methylation of the in vitrotranslation of the β- and γ-xENaC subunits. Full-length cDNA for α-, β-, and γ-xENaC was translated in vitro using a reticulocyte lysate system. Translated proteins were carboxylmethylated with methyltransferase prepared from A6 cell membranes from cells grown on plastic Petri dishes and analyzed for base-labile incorporation of [3H]methyl groups. Incorporation of isotope above background was seen only for β-xENaC incubated in the presence of GTP. n = 4 for each subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether methylation of ENaC subunits reconstituted in lipid bilayers altered channel activity, various combinations of rENaC subunits were incorporated into lipid bilayers and subjected to enzymatic methylation. Channel activity is shown prior (Fig. 6, left panel) and after (right panel) the addition of AdoMet, GTPγS, and carboxylmethyltransferase to the side opposite to which amiloride inhibited channel activity, i.e. the putative cytoplasmic side. As shown in Fig. 6, α-, β-, and γ-rENaC activity was increased in response to methylation (bottom panel) as was the α, β-rENaC combination (second panel from thetop). By contrast, when α-rENaC was incorporated alone (top panel) or in combination with γ-rENaC (third panel from the top), there was no increase in channel activity in response to methylation. This increase in ENaC activity was only evident when the carboxylmethylation reaction mixture was added to the presumptive cytoplasmic side. These results demonstrate that methylation of the β-ENaC subunit results in an increase of open probability of the channel complex. Because our earlier studies had demonstrated that methylation of a subunit of the immunopurified Na+ channel complex of approximately the same size as β-xENaC resulted in similar increases in channel activity when reconstituted in bilayers (5Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22193-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next sought to determine the relationship between these proteins. Immunoprecipitations of channel proteins from A6 cells were preformed using a polyclonal antibody to the immunopurified complex and the antibodies to all three xENaC subunits. All four immunoprecipitations were analyzed with the anti-xENaC antibodies. Because our α-xENaC antibody had not proved useful for immunoprecipitation (data not shown), we employed an antibody to α-xENaC developed in collaboration with Smith, Kleyman, and colleagues.2 This antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 107–125 of α-xENaC. The antibody specifically immunoprecipitates in vitro translated α-xENaC but not β- or γ-xENaC. Immunoprecipitation of α-xENaC was blocked by excess competing peptide. The anti-α-xENaC antibody specifically recognizes polypeptides of ∼150 and ∼180 kDa on Western blots of A6 apical membranes, and these bands are competed away by preincubation with excess immunizing peptide.2 The results shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that all three xENaC subunits were recognized by their respective antibodies in the immunoprecipitated channel complex. We then compared immunoprecipitation of A6 proteins with the anti-β antibody and the polyclonal antibody to the immunoprecipitated channel complex in cells metabolically labeled with Easy Tag Express [35S]. As shown in Fig. 8, a complex of proteins similar in size to those comprising the immunopurified channel complex (8Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was visualized with each antibody.Figure 8Immunoprecipitation using the anti-β-xENaC antibody recognizes the same proteins immunoprecipitated with the immunopurified Na+ channel complex. A6 cells were labeled for 3 h with Easy Tag Express [35S] and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the immunopurified complex (lane 1) or the anti-β-xENaC antibody (lane 2). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. An identical pattern of proteins with molecular masses 220, 97, 66, 45, and 30 kDa is seen. Lane 3 is a negative control. Cells were treated identically and immunoprecipitated without primary antibody (n = 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest a rationale for the concordance between our current and previous results (5Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22193-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with methylation of the two channel complexes; namely, they contain the same active channel constituents. One problem with this interpretation is that the kinetics of ENaC when reconstituted in bilayers are different from those observed for ENaC when that complex is expressed either in Xenopus oocytes or native tissues (8Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that this may be due to the conditions of reconstitution (8Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and therefore sought conditions of reconstitution where the kinetics of the reconstituted channel complex would resemble those described for ENaC. When ENaC-containing proteoliposomes are pre-treated with 50 μm DTT, the concerted gating behavior of the channel is disrupted and only a single 13 picosiemens conductance element can be incorporated into the bilayer (see Fig. 6). 3B. K. Berdiev, B. Jovov, K. H. Karlson, P.-J. Ripoll, R. Morris, D. Loffing-Cueni, P. Halpin, B. A. Stanton, T. R. Kleyman, and I. I. Ismailov, submitted for publication. Subsequent to the addition of actin, single channel conductance was reduced to 6 picosiemens, and the open and closed kinetics of the channel slowed to the second time range.3 A direct comparison between αβγ-rENaC and immunopurified renal Na+ channel behavior under these conditions is shown in Fig. 9. Moreover, determination of Na+ versus K+ permeability ratios (P Na+/P K+) from reversal potentials measured under bi-ionic salt conditions revealed that actin increasedP Na+/P K+from 8:1 to 54:1 for ENaC and from 7:1 to 40:1 for the purified Na+ channel. Addition of AdoMet, GTPγS, and carboxylmethyltransferase to the cis (or “cytoplasmic”) bathing medium activated only β-containing ENaC channels. Similar results were obtained in non-DTT-pretreated channels (data not shown). During the early phase of its action, aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption across responsive epithelia by an increase in the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC (8Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Garty H. Palmer L. Physiol.

Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the first 4 h following hormone addition, this occurs without synthesis or addition of new channel subunits to the apical membrane (8Benos D.J. Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Johnson J.P. J. Membr.

Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One hypothesis that has been proposed for the mechanism of this early channel activation involves carboxylmethylation of an apical membrane protein in response to aldosterone (1Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M.B. Weismann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Weismann W.P. Johnson J.P. Miura G.A. Chiang P.K. Am. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that carboxylmethylation of a 95-kDa subunit of the immunopurified channel results in activation of that channel complex when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers (5Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22193-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies were designed to determine whether similar results could be observed with carboxylmethylation of ENaC subunits. To carry out these studies, it was necessary to generate antibodies of ENaC subunits in our cellular model system, A6. We also sought to determine whether xENaC subunits could be carboxylmethylated in vitroand what effect this might have on kinetics of the channel reconstituted in lipid bilayers. The results of the current study demonstrate that the β-xENaC is methylated, whereas α- and γ-xENaC are not. The carboxylmethylation is stimulated by GTPγS, as previously observed (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Abramow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22193-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of ENaC reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers results in increased channel activity similar to the result obtained previously with the immunopurified channel complex (4Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Abramow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),i.e. only when the β-ENaC subunit is present. These results led us to examine the relationship between the immunopurified complex and xENaC. The antibodies that recognize the three subunits of xENaC also recognize similarly sized proteins within the immunopurified complex, and this complex of proteins may be immunoprecipitated using our antibody to β-xENaC. Both channels, when reconstituted in lipid bilayers, display activation when the 97-kDa subunit is carboxylmethylated. This evidence strongly suggests that the two preparations contain identical channel proteins. The site of the relevant methylation on β-xENaC has not been examined in this paper but is the subject of ongoing research. Because the enzyme is active from the putative cytoplasmic side in bilayer reconstitution studies, we speculate that the site may likely be located on either the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains. It is interesting to hypothesize that mutations in the region of this protein responsible for this form of regulation would result in unregulated channel activity. Inspection of the primary structure of the β-xENaC does not reveal any obvious or classical sites for regulatory carboxylmethylation, so this reaction may represent a site-specific modification similar to those described for prokaryotes (22Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Cathy Guy and Elaine New for excellent secretarial help."
https://openalex.org/W1984893770,"The wings of archaic Odonatoidea from the mid-Carboniferous of Argentina show features analogous to ""smart"" mechanisms in modern dragonflies that are associated with the agile, versatile flight necessary to catch prey in flight. These mechanisms act automatically in flight to depress the trailing edge and to facilitate wing twisting, in response to aerodynamic loading. The presence of similar features suggests that the earliest known odonatoids were already becoming adapted for high-performance flight in association with a predatory habit."

New Zealand White rabbits were injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.2 mg of soluble OB-R and an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Further boosters (days 7, 21, 35, and 56) were given with the substitution of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antibody titers were monitored by enzyme-linked immunoassay. After the third booster, 20 ml of blood was obtained from each animal. The antisera for leptin was affinity purified on a leptin-Sepharose column and then conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using a Freezyme Kit (Pierce). Samples were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex, San Diego) and then transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) overnight at 10 V in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 20% v/v methanol.

The highest expressing cells were adapted to 30 mmmethotrexate to stimulate amplification of soluble OB-R expression. After expansion in spinner flasks, roller bottles were inoculated with 2 × 107 cells in 200 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F12 supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). After the cells reached confluency (3–4 days), the medium was replaced with 200 ml of growth medium with no serum. Conditioned media were harvested after 7 days and immediately chilled on ice. CHO cell-conditioned media containing soluble OB-R were concentrated 10-fold with a Pellicon tangential flow ultrafiltration device (Amicon, Danvers, MA) fitted with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off filter (Filtron, Bearfoot, MA). The concentrate was diafiltered with 4 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 4 °C and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (80 × 140 mm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. After eluting the column with a linear NaCl gradient from 30 to 350 mm in 20 column volumes, aliquots of column fractions were applied to 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego) (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar) and run under reducing SDS-PAGE conditions. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining and a pool made of fractions containing soluble OB-R. This pool was reacted with hydroxylapatite for 4 h at 4 °C (Calbiochem) which bound contaminating proteins but very little soluble receptor. The hydroxylapatite unbound material was concentrated and applied to a Superose 12 column (35 × 600 mm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.6. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, except using Coomassie Blue to stain, and a pool consisting of more than 95% pure receptor was made. A stable complex was made by incubating soluble OB-R (100 μg) with a 2-fold molar excess of recombinant human leptin at 4 °C for 24 h. The ligand-receptor complex was purified by Superose 12 (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with 1× PBS, pH 7.8. Cross-linking was performed by treating the complex with 1 mm DSS (dissolved in Me2SO) or BS (dissolved in water) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.1m ammonium acetate. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cross-linked products were detected by both silver staining and Western blotting using an affinity purified, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, polyclonal antibody raised against human leptin. In order to obtain Cys-containing peptides, soluble OB-R (100 μg) was digested with pepsin (2 μg) in 0.02 n HCl, pH 2, for 20 h at 37 °C. Under acidic conditions, disulfide rearrangements can be avoided. The digestion was terminated by direct injection into an HPLC column. Tryptic digestion of soluble OB-R was performed in the presence of 5 mm iodoacetate in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Thermolytic or chymotryptic digestions of peptide fragments were performed in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 20 h with an enzyme:substrate ratio of approximately 1:20 (w/w). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of OB-R (100 μg) was performed with 2 mg of cyanogen bromide dissolved in 100 μl of 70% formic acid. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 25 °C in the dark and was stopped by direct HPLC injection. The cyanogen bromide peptides were treated withN-glycanase (0.5 units) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and then digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, followed by endoproteinase Glu-C in the same buffer with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Soluble OB-R was reduced and denatured by adding SDS to 0.4% and β-mercaptoethanol to 50 mm and then heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added to 1.8% before diluting the reduced and denatured receptor with an equal volume of distilled water. Aliquots of 2.5 μg were then digested with sialidase (5 milliunits), O-glycanase (0.5 units), N-glycanase (1 unit), or all three enzymes at 37 °C for 18 h. A mock reaction containing no glycosidase was treated identically to the digested samples, all of which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego) under reducing conditions. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining and Western blotting. Deglycosylation of glycopeptides was performed by treatment with N-glycanase (0.5 units) in 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 24 h. The digested material was purified by reversed phase HPLC for further analysis. Peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm) with two linear gradients from 2 to 40% solvent B over 30 min and from 40 to 60% solvent B over 10 min at a flow rate of 0.25 ml per min. Cyanogen bromide-generated peptides were separated on a Zorbax CN column (2.1 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient from 2 to 60% solvent B over 30 min. The flow rate was the same as above. N-terminal sequence analyses of peptides and proteins were performed on a model 476A or 477A ABI gas sequencer system from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). For analysis of diPTH-Cys, an ABI model 494 was used with a pulsed liquid program. Data analysis was performed with the Applied Biosystems model 610A data analysis system for protein sequencing, version 1.2.2. The peptides were loaded onto Biobrene-treated glass fiber filters for sequencing. The cyanogen bromide-generated peptide CB-1 that contained multiple disulfide bonds was partially reduced with 10 mmTris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 25 °C for 5 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The reduced peptide was alkylated with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 30 min at room temperature after adjusting to pH 6.0 with 1 m Tris base as described previously (15Agnes H. Wittmann-Liebold B. Advanced Methods in Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg1986: 244-255Google Scholar). The modified peptides were sequenced after purification by reversed phase HPLC using a Zorbax CN column (2.1 × 150 mm) as described above. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry of the peptides was performed using either a Kratos IV (Kratos Analytical) or Voyager mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Samples were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and then spotted on the sample cartridge with a 4-HCCA matrix. Cys-containing peptides were also analyzed using a Sciex API triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an ion-spray interface using a Michrom Biosource Ultrafast Michroprotein Analyzer. The carrier solvent was 50% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid flowing at 5 μl/min. The scan range was 300–2400 atomic mass unit with a step of 0.5 atomic mass unit. The mass units and standard deviation were calculated using Sciex hypermass software. Human soluble OB-R was expressed in CHO cells and purified from conditioned medium by Q-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and gel filtration. The purified soluble OB-R exhibited a single, broad band on SDS-PAGE, corresponding to approximately 145,000 daltons (Fig. 1). Deglycosylation of the purified soluble OB-R withN-glycanase reduced the molecular mass to approximately 90,000 daltons, indicating extensive N-glycosylation although treatment with sialidase and O-glycanase slightly increased its mobility, suggesting that O-glycosylation is present but not significant. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was identified to be FXLSYPITP (residues 22–30), whereas the C-terminal sequence of DIEKHQSD (residues 832–839) was identified from a pepsin-generated fragment. The observed N- and C-terminal sequences were identical to those predicted from the cDNA-deduced sequence reported by Tartaglia et al. (6Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N Culpepper J. Devos R.

Thus, the soluble OB-R purified here contained 818 amino acid residues (from residues 22 to 839) with a calculated molecular weight of 93,501, indicating that the OB-R contained approximately 36% carbohydrates of its total mass.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of soluble OB-R.

The double lined sequence shows a signal peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The leptin-OB-R complex was prepared by mixing the receptor with a 2-fold molar excess of leptin. After incubation at 4 °C for 24 h, the mixture was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 12 column (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.8. Two peaks were obtained, corresponding to complex and free leptin. From the elution position in Superose 12 column, it is likely that the complex contained only one molecule of OB-R. The complex peak was subjected to reversed phase HPLC using a Zorbax CN (2.1 × 150 mm), which indicated that it contained a 1:1 ratio of leptin and OB-R (Fig. 3). In order to examine ligand binding specificity of OB-R, the purified complex was cross-linked with 1 mm BS and DSS, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. One gel was silver-stained and other electroblotted to nitrocellulose and detected with an affinity purified, polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant human leptin. In the silver-stained gel (Fig. 4 A), a protein band just above that corresponding to free receptor is observed. Fig. 4 B shows the Western blot of this gel using an 8% gel, verifying the presence of leptin (cross-linked to the OB-R) in this band. The soluble OB-R was fragmented by peptic digestion, resulting in numerous peptide peaks separated by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 5). Therefore, sequence analysis was performed on all peptic peptides and indicated that more than 15 Cys-containing peptides were isolated. Table I shows the summary of the sequence analyses of the Cys-containing peptides including both disulfides and free cysteines. Peak 8 contained two peptides, VRX (residues 611–613) (P8a) and LTKMTXRW (residues 442–449) (P8b), in which X was expected to be a cysteine residue according to the cDNA sequence. MALDI mass spectrometry showed that these peptides (P8a and P8b) were not linked together through a disulfide bond but existed as free cysteines, Cys447 and Cys613, respectively. Although the two peptides are different in size, they co-eluted from the HPLC column under the conditions used.Table IPepsin-generated Cys-containing peptides from OB-RNo.Peptide no.Sequence1-aN denotes N-glycosylation site.

Parentheses show the residue number.1-b Mass determined after deglycosylation. Open table in a new tab Peptic peptide P16 contained the single sequence MKNDSLSX (residue 668–674), in whichX is an unidentified residue but is a Cys residue based on the cDNA sequence. Since this peptide was solely isolated, Cys674 was assigned to be in the free state. Mass spectrometry of this peptide revealed it not to be glycosylated although it contained an N-glycosylation sequence, NXS. Two peptides, P18 and P19, had the same sequence of RYVINHHTSX NGTW (residues 678–691) whereN denotes an N-glycosylation site. Mass spectrometry of the intact peptides showed a larger mass than expected. After deglycosylation with N-glycanase, these peptides showed the same mass of 1689.0, which is nearly identical to the expected mass 1687.9. The observed difference in HPLC retention time is evidently due to carbohydrate heterogeneity, and the data indicated that Cys687 was in a free state. Peptide P21 contained two peptides, HXIYKKENKIVPSKE (residues 351–365) and AVYXXNEHEXHHRY (residues 409–422), where X indicates a cysteine residue. Since these two peptides contain four cysteine residues, their co-elution suggests one inter-chain disulfide with the remaining two forming an intra-chain disulfide. Mass spectrometry of this peptide subsequently suggested that these two peptides were linked together through a disulfide bond. Fig. 6 shows mass spectral data of peptide P21, indicating the mass 3573.3 for intact peptide and a signal at 1761.7 derived from one of the components. Exact disulfide linkages were determined later from tryptic fragments. Peptide P27a contained the single sequence EDSPLVPQKGSFQMVHX N XSVHEXXEXL (residues 170–197). Since this peptide contains five cysteines according to the DNA sequence, at least one must be in the free state. Disulfide linkages in this peptide were determined after cyanogen bromide cleavage, as discussed later. Additionally,Asn187 was glycosylated since no PTH-Asn was detected at this cycle. Meanwhile, peptide 27b contained two sequences, KLSXMPPNSTY (residues 34–44) and SKTTFHXXFRSEQDRN XSLXAD (residues 83–104), containing one of three cystine knots in the receptor. However, disulfide linkages in these peptides could not be determined from this digestion. Further digestion of this peptide with thermolysin gave the three sequences,LSXMPPNSTY (residues 35–44), FHXX (residues 87–90), and RSEQDRN XSLXAD (residues 92–104).Asn41 and Asn98 were assigned to be N-glycosylation sites, as determined by sequence analysis. Table II shows sequence analysis of peptide P27b TH1. Upon PTH analysis of this peptide, the third cycle did not show significant diPTH-Cys, indirectly suggesting that Cys37 is not disulfide-linked to Cys89 but probably to Cys90. The complete disulfide structure of this Cys cluster was eventually determined by tryptic digestion as discussed later.Table IISequence analysis of peptide P27b-TH1No.Peptide 1 (PTH)2-aNumbers show PTH recovery (picomoles).

Open table in a new tab Peptide P28a corresponded to the same sequence as peptide P21 but contained another seven N-terminal amino acids. Peptide P28b showed a single peptide MCLK (residues 211–214) with one free cysteine, Cys212. Sequence analysis of peptide P29 showed two sequences, PKDXY (residues 485–489) and YEXIFQ (residues 496–501), clearly demonstrating the presence of a disulfide linkage between Cys488 and Cys498. This result was confirmed by mass spectrometry, experimental mass 1425.0versus the theoretic mass 1423.0. Similarly, peptide P33 showed two sequences, NIQXW (residues 128–132) and IXY (residues 141–143), again using mass spectrometry to confirm that Cys131 and Cys142 are linked together. Peptide P34b contained the two sequences, YXSDIPSIHPISE (residues 472–484) and DSPPTXVLPDS (residues 523–533), and similarly the molecular mass of this peptide was 2583.4, close to the theoretic mass of 2587.2, clearly demonstrating a disulfide linkage of Cys473–Cys528. A glycopeptide P36, SAYPLNSSC (residues 745–753) contained a free cysteine, Cys753, although mass spectrometry of this peptide was not successful due to its limited amount. Since peptide P37 had the single sequence VSLPVPDLXAVYA (residues 596–608), confirmed by mass spectrometry, it contained a free cysteine Cys604. Meanwhile, peptide P38 contained two cysteines in a single peptide ISXETDGYLTKMTXRWSTSTIRSLA (residues 434–458), and both Cys residues indicated by X might exist in the free state since the second cysteine was previously detected as such in the peptide P8b. In order to determine the disulfide linkages of three cystine knots present in OB-R, intact receptor was digested with trypsin in the presence of 5 mm iodoacetate. The peptide map shown in Fig. 7 gave several key Cys peptides for disulfide assignments, and sequences of selected tryptic peptides are summarized in Table III. Tryptic fragment T1 contained five cysteines in two peptides, one of which (Cys102) might be in the free state since Cys of the human receptor is substituted by Leu in both murine and rat OB receptors. Disulfide linkages were determined by PTH analysis after further digestion of this peptide with endoproteinase Glu-C, resulting in a new fragment (T1-E1). Peptide T1-E1 consisted of three sequences, LSCMPPNSTYDYFLLPAGLSK (residues 35–55), TTFHCCFRSE (residues 85–94), and QDRNCSLCADNIE (residues 95–107), respectively. When sequenced, the fifth cycle corresponding to Cys89 and Cys99 showed significant yields (∼50%) of diPTH-Cys (Table IV) (16Marti T. Rosselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,17Haniu M. Acklin C. Kenney W.C. Rohde M.F. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 43: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To confirm this result, a thermolytic digest of peptide T1 provided two sequences LSCMPPNSTYDY (residues 35–46) and HCCFRSEQDRNCS(residues 88–100) which also showed significant recovery of diPTH-Cys at cycle 3 corresponding to Cys37 and Cys90. Subsequently, these results indicated that Cys89 was linked to Cys99, supporting another linkage Cys37–Cys90. Cys102 was assigned to be a free state.Table IIISelected Cys-containing peptides from tryptic digestNo.PeptideSequence3-aN denotes the glycosylation sites.

Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The gene encoding yeast Topo III (TOP3) was identified in 1989 as a suppressor of mitotic recombination between repetitive sequences (4Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The yeast top3 mutant has a slow growth phenotype as well as a hyperrecombination phenotype. It is speculated that Topo III has a significant role in the unlinking of parental strands at the final stage of DNA replication and/or in the dissociation of structures that could lead to recombination (6Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The slow growth and hyperrecombination phenotypes of yeasttop3 mutants were suppressed by mutations in SGS1gene whose product was shown to interact functionally and physically with Topo III (7Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).

Thus it is conceivable that yeast Topo III acts in conjugation with Sgs1.

In this context, mammalian Topo III is attracting attention.A cDNA encoding human Topo III was cloned in 1996 (5Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The gene disruption study of mouse TOP3 showed mammalian topo III was essential in early embryogenesis (12Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, a genomic sequence encoding a putative Topo III homologue was found within the human immunoglobulin λ gene locus (13Kawasaki K. Minoshima S. Nakato E. Shibuya K. Shintani A. Schmeits J.L. Wang J. Shimizu N. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, the Topo III encoded by the cloned cDNA and the putative Topo III in the genomic sequence were named by Li and Wang (12Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as Topo IIIα and Topo IIIβ, respectively. However, nothing is known about Topo IIIβ.In the course of cloning the mouse homologue to humanTOP3α, we cloned cDNA encoding a mouse homologue to human Topo IIIβ. In this study, we examined both whether Topo IIIβ has DNA topoisomerase activity or not using a purified protein and also the expression of TOP3β mRNA in various mouse tissues and in the testis during postnatal development. DNA topoisomerases are classified as type I or type II enzymes (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Recently, DNA topoisomerase III belonging to the type IA subfamily, which includes Escherichia coli Topo I1 and Topo III and yeast Topo III (2Tse-Dinh Y.C. Wang J.C. J. Mol.

Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The gene encoding yeast Topo III (TOP3) was identified in 1989 as a suppressor of mitotic recombination between repetitive sequences (4Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The yeast top3 mutant has a slow growth phenotype as well as a hyperrecombination phenotype. It is speculated that Topo III has a significant role in the unlinking of parental strands at the final stage of DNA replication and/or in the dissociation of structures that could lead to recombination (6Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slow growth and hyperrecombination phenotypes of yeasttop3 mutants were suppressed by mutations in SGS1gene whose product was shown to interact functionally and physically with Topo III (7Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The sgs1 mutants also show a heperrecombination phenotype (8Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus it is conceivable that yeast Topo III acts in conjugation with Sgs1. Recently, human homologues of the SGS1 gene, BLM and WRN, have been cloned by positional cloning being the genes responsible for Bloom's syndrome (BS) and Werner's syndrome (WS), respectively (9Ellis N.A.

https://openalex.org/W2043841973,"The CorA transport system is the major Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway for bacteria and the Archaea. CorA contains three C-terminal transmembrane segments. No conserved charged residues are apparent within the membrane, suggesting that Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx does not involve electrostatic interactions. We have mutated conserved residues within the third transmembrane segment to identify sites involved in transport. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues at either end of the membrane segment to alternative aromatic amino acids did not affect total cation uptake or cation affinity. Mutation to alanine greatly diminished uptake with little change in cation affinity implying that the conserved aromatic residues play a structural role in stabilizing this membrane segment of CorA at the interface between the bilayer and the aqueous environment. In contrast, mutation of Tyr<sup>292</sup>, Met<sup>299</sup>, and Tyr<sup>307</sup> greatly altered the transport properties of CorA. Y292F, Y292S, Y292C, or Y292I mutations essentially abolished transport, without effect on expression or membrane insertion. M299C and M299A mutants exhibited a decrease in cation affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, or Ni<sup>2+</sup> of 10–50-fold without a significant change in uptake capacity. Mutations at Tyr<sup>307</sup> had no significant effect on cation uptake capacity; however, the affinity of Y307F and Y307A mutations for Mg<sup>2+</sup>and Co<sup>2+</sup> was decreased 3–10-fold, while affinity for Ni<sup>2+</sup> was unchanged compared with the wild type CorA. In contrast, the affinity of the Y307S mutant for all three cations was decreased 2–5-fold. Projection of the third transmembrane segment as an α-helix suggests that Tyr<sup>292</sup>, Met<sup>299</sup>, and Tyr<sup>307</sup> all reside on the same face of the α-helix. We interpret the transport data to suggest that a hydroxyl group is important at Tyr<sup>307</sup>, and that these three residues interact with Mg<sup>2+</sup> during transport, forming part of the cation pore or channel within CorA."
https://openalex.org/W2028230663,"The properties of Penicillium chrysogenum adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase mutated at Ser-107 were examined. Ser-107 is analogous to a serine of the E. coli enzyme that has been shown to serve as an intermediate acceptor in the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to APS. Replacement of Ser-107 with alanine yielded an active enzyme with kinetic characteristics similar to those of wild-type APS kinase. Another mutant form of the enzyme in which Ser-107 was replaced by cysteine was also active. Covalent modification of Cys-107 eliminated catalytic activity, and substrates protected against modification.

ATP sulfurylase (MgATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.4)) and APS1 kinase (MgATP:adenylylsulfate 3′-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.25)) catalyze the first two reactions in the assimilation of inorganic sulfate.MgATP+SO42−⇌MgPPi+APS (ATP sulfurylase)MgATP+APS⇌PAPS+MgADP (APS kinase)(Eq. 1) To date, the amino acid sequences of APS kinases from 15 different sources have been reported, although the actual protein has been purified and characterized from only a few. APS kinases from the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum(GenBankTM accession number U39393) and from the bacteriumEscherichia coli (GenBankTM accession numberP23846) are of particular interest because they have quite disparate properties despite having a high degree of homology. The P. chrysogenum enzyme is a homodimer (subunit molecular mass of approximately 24 kDa) that undergoes a temperature-dependent reversible dissociation into inactive monomers (1Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Knudson P. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1535-1544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism of the fungal enzyme is essentially compulsory ordered with MgATP adding before APS and with PAPS dissociating before MgADP. APS is a potent substrate inhibitor. Steady state kinetics (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protection by reversibly bound ligands against chemical inactivation (3Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Knudson P. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11903-11913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and direct binding studies (4Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) all point to the formation of a dead-end E·MgADP·APS complex as the cause of the substrate inhibition. That is, APS adds to the sulfonucleotide subsite on E·MgADP that lies vacant after PAPS dissociates from the ternary complex. (APS has little affinity for the enzyme in the absence of MgADP or MgATP.) Incubation of the P. chrysogenum enzyme with [γ-32P]MgATP in the absence of APS does not yield detectable levels of labeled enzyme (4Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E. coli enzyme follows a hybrid sequential ordered ping-pong mechanism, with MgATP adding first (5Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At low APS concentrations, MgADP can dissociate before APS adds. Substrate inhibition by APS results from formation of an E·APS complex when APS binds to the free enzyme blocking MgATP addition (5Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. FASEB J. 1990; 4: A2119Google Scholar). Incubation of the bacterial APS kinase with [γ-32P]MgATP in the absence of APS leads to the formation of a catalytically competent phosphoenzyme. The phosphorylated residue was identified as Ser-109 (5Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Satishchandran C.

Elmerich C. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is the sole exception, reported to contain an alanine residue at the position corresponding to Ser-109 of theE. coli enzyme. This could have been a DNA sequencing error, especially in light of the convincing evidence for a phosphoenzyme intermediate at Ser-109 in the E. coli enzyme.2The putative APS kinase from Azospirillum brasilense (8Vieille C. Elmerich C. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is the sole exception, reported to contain an alanine residue at the position corresponding to Ser-109 of theE. coli enzyme. This could have been a DNA sequencing error, especially in light of the convincing evidence for a phosphoenzyme intermediate at Ser-109 in the E. coli enzyme. The phosphorylatedE. coli enzyme exists primarily as a dimer, whereas dephosphorylation favors a tetrameric form of the enzyme. Despite the kinetic and structural differences noted above, it seemed reasonable to assume that the chemical mechanism of homologous APS kinases would be the same. That is, if the path of phosphoryl group transfer in the reaction catalyzed by the E. coli enzyme is from MgATP to the enzyme and subsequently to APS, then this mechanism should prevail in all cases. So, whereas theE. coli enzyme forms an isolable stablephosphoenzyme intermediate, the fungal enzyme might form atransient phosphoenzyme, but only when APS is present at the catalytic site. To explore this possibility, we examined the functional properties of P. chrysogenum APS kinase that had been mutated to contain either an alanine or a cysteine residue at position 107, i.e. at the position analogous to Ser-109 of theE. coli enzyme. The effects of substitution at other nearby OH-containing residues and in the ATP P-loop region were also examined. This research was also motivated by the observations that fungal ATP sulfurylase (a) is allosterically inhibited by PAPS (9Renosto F. Martin R.L. Wailes L.M. Daley L.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10300-10308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and (b) contains a C-terminal domain that is homologous to APS kinase (11Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A. Renosto F. Patel H. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region (which probably evolved by recombination of the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase genes) almost certainly serves as the allosteric PAPS binding site. Given the facile monomer-dimer interconversion exhibited by true APS kinase, it is not hard to imagine a similar interaction of C termini on adjacent ATP sulfurylase subunits contributing to the allosteric transition induced by PAPS and substrates. Unlike the bifunctional protein from animal systems (12Lyle S. Stanczak J. Ng K. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Rosenthal E.T. Leustec T. Gene. 1995; 165: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), fungal ATP sulfurylase has no detectable APS kinase activity. The absence of APS kinase activity in fungal ATP sulfurylase could result from several sequence modifications within the C-terminal region, one of which is the substitution of alanine for serine at position 478 (the position analogous to Ser-107 of true APS kinase). The experiments described in this present paper would help determine whether this substitution is sufficient to account for the lack of APS kinase activity in fungal ATP sulfurylase. A variation on the megaprimer method of Sarker and Sommer (14Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce site-directed mutants. In short, the method required two successive PCRs using three oligonucleotide primers, one of which contained the desired mutation. The other two were the terminal primers. DNA polymerase Pfu(Stratagene) was used for all PCR steps. In all cases, the template used was the cloned cDNA copy of the native gene (GenBankTM accession number U39393). The first PCR used the N-terminal coding primer PcASK 301 (5′-CCGGATCCCATATGTCTACCAACATCACC-3′) and the internal primer containing the desired mutation. Prior to PCR, the internal primer was phosphorylated at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The product of the first PCR was then treated with Lambda exonuclease (Boehringer Mannheim), which hydrolyzes 5′-phosphorylated DNA strands to produce an approximately 300-base single-stranded DNA fragment. This “megaprimer” was then used in a second PCR with the C-terminal coding primer PcASK 303 (5′-AGAATTCTCGAGTTACTCCTTCTTGGC-3′), producing a double-stranded DNA coding for the gene with the desired mutation. All second round PCR products were cloned asEcoRI-BamHI fragments into the Promega plasmid pGEM-7Zf(+) and subsequently sequenced to ensure that the desired mutations were made. Internal primers with their respective produced mutations were as follows: PcASK 304 (S107C), 5′-AGAATTCGATCCTTCCGGTAGGGACAGATGAAGG-3′; PcASK 305 (S107A), 5′-AGAATTCGATCCTTCCGGTAGGGCGCGATGAAGG-3′; PcASK 310 (S97A), 5′-GATGGCGTTGGAGTCGGC-3′; PcASK 307 (S99A), 5′-GTTGGAGTCGGCGAACAGC-3′; PcASK 308 (T103A), 5′-CGAGATGAAGGAAGCAATGGC-3′; PcASK 309 (S104A), 5′-CGAGATGAAGGCAGTAATGGC-3′; PcASK 313 (T109F), 5′-CGATCCTTCCGGAAGGGCGAG-3′; PcASK 311 (P-1) (L33Y/S34M/A35N), 5′-GGCTGACCGGATACATGAACTCCGGCAAGTC-3′; and PcASK 312 (P-2) (S39D/T40A), 5′-CCTCCGGCAAGGACGCTCTAGCCG-3′. Sequenced APS kinase genes were cloned asNdeI-XhoI fragments into the Novagen pET23a(+) plasmids and introduced into the expression host by electroporation.E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used to express the P. chrysogenum APS kinases described in this report. However, a separate experiment established that active S107A APS kinase was also obtained when the recA − E. colistrain HMS174(DE3) was used. About 0.2 ml of an 8-h culture was used to inoculate a 3-liter Fernbach flask containing 400 ml of LB Amp medium (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68Google Scholar). This culture was grown aerobically at 30 °C for 10–15 h to an A 600 nm of about 6. Although the E. coli strain contains a T7 RNA polymerase that is under control of the lac promoter, we found that induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was not necessary for high enzyme yields. Centrifugation of the culture at 5000 ×g for 7 min yielded approximately 3–4 ml of packed cells. These were washed by resuspending the pellets in a total of 400 ml of chilled Buffer A (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 5 °C containing 5 mm EDTA). After another centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 20 ml of Buffer A containing 1 mg × ml−1 lysozyme and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. All subsequent steps were carried out at 5 °C. The lysozyme-treated cells were centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 30 min, and the pellet was frozen by immersing the centrifuge tube in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cells were then thawed by resuspending the pellet in 35 ml of cold Buffer A. After sonication (three 30-s bursts using a Virsonic 300 microprobe on setting 3 with a 1 min ice bath incubation between bursts), the cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 16,300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant extract was saved, and the pellet was subjected to the above freeze/thaw/sonication/centrifugation sequence two more times. The supernatants were pooled. APS kinase activity of the crude extracts could be measured easily by means of the coupled spectrophotometric assay described below. For example, the cell-free extract of the E. coli expressing the wild-type (Ser-107) enzyme contained approximately 4000 total units of APS kinase activity (measured at 5 mm MgATP plus 3.5 μm APS), accounting for about 20% of the total soluble protein as estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. No activity could be detected in extracts prepared from cells that did not contain pET23a(+) or from cells containing the plasmid without the APS kinase insert. (The absence of detectable endogenous activity most likely results from repression of the E. coli enzyme by organic sulfur-containing compounds in the rich medium.) The pooled soluble fractions were applied to an Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, at 5 °C). The column was washed with Buffer B at a flow rate of 3 ml/min until the effluent had an A 280 nm of 0.005 or less. Then, protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in Buffer B (total volume, 500 ml) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml per min. Seven-ml fractions were collected, and theirA 280 nm was measured. Fractions containing enzyme activity (coincident with the major protein peak) were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer B, and then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After a brief wash, this column was eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) in Buffer B (total volume, 500 ml). Fractions containing APS kinase activity (again coincident with the major protein peak) were collected and pooled. This preparation had anA 280 nm/A 260 nm ratio of 2.0 (indicating good separation from nucleic acid fragments) and was judged to be >95% pure by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by protein staining with Coomassie Blue. The yield of enzyme at this stage generally exceeded 20 mg of APS kinase per 400 ml of culture. Except where noted, all enzyme assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 30 °C (Buffer C) containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate. One unit of activity is defined as that amount of enzyme that promotes the formation of 1 μmol of primary product in 1 min. Activity in the forward (PAPS synthesis) direction was measured by the pyruvate kinase + lactate dehydrogenase + nuclease P1-coupled spectrophotometric assay as described previously (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Segel I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Jakoby W.B. Griffith O.W. Methods in Enzymology. 143. Academic Press, San Diego1987: 334-349Google Scholar), except that the KCl concentration was 7.5 mm, and the pyruvate kinase + lactate dehydrogenase preparation was obtained from Sigma as a 50% glycerol solution instead of as a suspension in ammonium sulfate. The APS kinase levels in the assays were varied between 0.15 and 0.9 μg ml−1([E]t approximately 6–38 nm in terms of sites) in order to achieve a ΔA 340 nm of about 0.02 per min. The large excess of nuclease P1 continuously regenerates APS from the PAPS formed, thus permitting initial velocities to be measured at micromolar levels of APS. If nuclease P1 was omitted from the assay mixture, the total absorbance change at 340 nm in the presence of excess MgATP was proportional to the APS added, confirming that it was kinase activity that was being measured, not ATPase. The high (NH4)2SO4decreased the severity of the substrate inhibition by APS and also minimized ionic strength variations encountered when different formulations of the coupling enzymes were used. The reverse reaction was measured by monitoring the rate of ATP formation from PAPS and MgADP in the presence of excess ATP sulfurylase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APS kinase levels in the assays were 4 μg ml−1 (167 nm in sites). Diadenosine 5′-pentaphosphate (50 μm) was included in the assay mixture to reduce the background rate of NADPH formation promoted by traces of contaminating adenylate kinase. (NH4)2SO4 (which interfered with the action of diadenosine 5′-pentaphosphate) was omitted. Protein concentrations of the final preparation were estimated from the absorbance of the solution at 260 nm and 280 nm (17Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 334Google Scholar). The exact concentration of APS in the stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically from the end point of the reverse ATP sulfurylase reaction coupled to hexokinase plus glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (16Segel I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Jakoby W.B. Griffith O.W. Methods in Enzymology. 143. Academic Press, San Diego1987: 334-349Google Scholar). The covalent modification of S107C by DTNB was monitored directly at 412 nm as described previously for fungal ATP sulfurylase (18Renosto F. Schultz T. Re E. Mazer J. Chandler C.J. Barron A. Segel I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 674-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for measuring enzyme inactivation by DTNB or tetrathionate and protection by ligands was similar to that described by Renostoet al. (3Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Knudson P. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11903-11913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All modification-inactivation preincubations were performed in Buffer C at 30 °C in the presence of 5 mm excess Mg2+. The velocity equation describing an ordered bireactant sequence with a dead-end EBQ complex in the absence of products (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is as follows.vVmax=[A][B]KiaKmB+KmB[A]+KmA[B]+[A][B]+[A][B]2KIB(Eq. 2) For APS kinase, A = MgATP, B = APS, P = PAPS, and Q = MgADP. The last denominator term accounts for the inhibition by APS. An apparentV max, an apparent Michaelis constant for APS as the substrate, and an apparent K I for APS as an inhibitor (all at 5 mm MgATP plus 5 mm excess Mg2+) were determined by fitting the primary v versus [APS] data to Equation 3 using DeltaGraph Pro 4.01 (Macintosh).v=Vmax,app[B]KmB,app+[B]+[B]2KIB,app(Eq. 3) The combined values of K mB,appand K IB, app are related to [B]opt (the concentration of substrateB that yields the peak velocity) by the following equation.[B]opt=KmB,appKIB,app=KmB1+Kia[A]KIB(Eq. 4) Apparent Michaelis constants for MgATP (in the forward direction) and PAPS (in the reverse direction) were determined by fitting the v versus [varied substrate] curve to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation.v=Vmax,app[A]Km,app+[A](Eq. 5) In the forward reaction, [MgATP] was varied at [APS]opt, the concentration of APS that yielded the highest velocity in v versus [APS] plots at 5 mm MgATP. For varied PAPS, the MgADP concentration was 5 mm. Although the apparent constants are not necessarily equal to the limiting values, they provide a useful comparison of the mutant enzymes with the wild-type enzyme. An estimate of the E·MgATP dissociation constant (K ia) was obtained as the horizontal coordinate of the intersection point of double reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/[MgATP]) at four different low APS levels. The equation for the plot is as follows.1v=KmAVmax1+KiaKmBKmA[B]1[A]+1Vmax1+KmB[B]+[B]KIB(Eq. 6) The family of plots do not intersect at a common point but any two lines intersect at the point described by the following equation.1[A]=−1Kia1−[B]1[B]2KIBKmB(Eq. 7) Because the different fixed levels of B were all below 0.5[B]opt measured at near-saturating [A], the circle of ambiguity of the intersection points was small, and the horizontal coordinate of the circle provided a reasonable estimate of −1/K ia (Fig. IX-64 in Ref.19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). The reverse APS kinase reaction follows rapid equilibrium ordered kinetics (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, where P = PAPS and Q = MgADP, V max, app at saturating PAPS is the true V max at all fixed [MgADP] (Ref. 19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar, pp. 320–322), whereas theK mP,app is described by the following equation.KmP,app=KmP1+Kiq[Q](Eq. 8) Fig. 1 shows thev versus [MgATP] and v versus [APS] profiles for the expressed wild-type APS kinase and the recombinant mutant enzyme containing alanine in place of the serine at position 107. Although the velocity profiles of the two enzymes differ, both behave qualitatively like native APS kinase purified from P. chrysogenum mycelium (2Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2113-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most characteristic feature is the substrate inhibition exerted by APS, a property shared by APS kinases from most sources (5Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 681-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jender H.G.

(APS kinase from B. stearothermophilus has been reported not to be inhibited by high APS levels (25Onda M. Hayashi M. Suiko M. Liu M.-C. Nakajima H. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1996; 60: 134-136Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar).) Incubation of the S107A enzyme with MgATP and APS in the absence of nuclease P1 yielded a 260 nm-absorbing substance with the same retention volume as authentic PAPS upon high performance anion exchange chromatography (10MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), further confirming that the observed activity was that of APS kinase. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutant and wild-type enzymes show similar responses to changing ionic strength,viz., high salt shifts the v versus[APS] curves to the right. Because of the biphasic nature of the velocity curve, high salt “inhibits” the reaction at low APS concentrations, but appears to be an “activator” at high APS. Velocity measurements made at a single APS concentration in the region of the crossover would lead to the conclusion that ionic strength had little or no effect on activity. Kinetically, the shift in the velocity curve results mainly from changes in the two kinetic constants associated with APS. For the wild-type enzyme, the major effect of changing ionic strength is on K IB,app; for the mutant enzyme, the major effect is onK mB,app (see below and Equation 4). The structural basis of the shift is as yet unknown, but it is noteworthy that high salt and mutation at position 107 have similar effects. Table I summarizes the kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the mutant enzyme generally has higher kinetic constants. For example, under standard assay conditions at high ionic strength, the apparent Michaelis constant of the mutant enzyme and the apparent inhibition constant for APS are 12- and 1.7-fold, respectively, greater than those of the wild-type enzyme. MgATP binding (as measured byK ia) is about the same for both enzymes, although the K mA of the mutant enzyme is 3-fold higher. (K ia is the E·MgATP dissociation constant, whereasK mA is a more complex constant that includes the rate constants for catalysis plus the release of products (Ref. 19Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar, pp. 563–564). In the absence of high (NH4)2SO4,K mB,app and K IB,app of the mutant enzyme are about 2 and 5 times greater, respectively, than the corresponding constants of the wild-type enzyme, whereas theK mP,app for PAPS is 12-fold greater.Table IKinetic properties of recombinant P. chrysogenum APS kinases expressed in E. coliConstant1-aApparent kinetic constants were determined from curve-fits of the primary initial velocity data to the appropriate equation as described under “Materials and Methods.”K ia was determined from the intersection point of 1/v versus 1/[MgATP] reciprocal plots at several APS concentrations below 0.5[APS]opt.DescriptionWild-typeS107AV max, app(forward)Theoretical maximum forward velocity at 5 mm MgATP (APS varied)36.7 (64.4) units × mg of protein−158.5 (63.2) units × mg of protein−1V max, app′ (forward)Theoretical maximal forward velocity at [APS]opt (MgATP varied)28.5 (23.6) units × mg of protein−135.8 (28.8) units × mg of protein−1K mA, appMichaelis constant for MgATP at [APS]opt0.8 (0.2) mm2.4 (0.5) mmK iaEnzyme · MgATP dissociation constant1.4 (0.4) mm1.8 (1.9) mmK mB,appMichaelis constant for APS at 5 mm MgATP1 (0.8) μm12.4 (1.9) μmK IB, appApparentK I for APS as a substrate inhibitor at 5 mm MgATP14.9 (1.2) μm25 (4.7) μmv optVelocity at [APS]opt and 5 mm MgATP24.2 (22) units × mg of protein−124 (28) units × mg of protein−1[APS]optAPS concentration that yields the highest velocity at 5 mm MgATP3.7 (1) μm18 (3) μm[APS]0.5APS concentration that yields half-maximal velocity on the ascending limb of the v versus [APS] plot at 5 mm MgATP0.5 (0.2) μm3.4 (0.6) μm[APS]′0.5APS concentration that yields half-maximal velocity on the descending limb of the v versus [APS] plot at 5 mm MgATP29.5 (4.6) μm95 (16) μm1-bExtrapolated value.V max, app(reverse)Theoretical maximum reverse velocity at 5 mmMgADP (PAPS varied)ND1-cND, not determined.

Compared with the wild-type enzyme, S107A has a 60% higher theoreticalV max, app in the forward direction at high ionic strength and 5 mm MgATP. This higherV max, app does not result from differences in the K mA for MgATP. Nor does it necessarily reflect a higher rate of phosphoryl group transfer from ATP to APS, because an increase in the rate constants for the release of PAPS and MgADP would have the same effect if these steps are rate-limiting in the overall reaction. Certainly, MgADP release must be partially rate-limiting and cannot be very much faster than PAPS release, otherwise there would be no significant steady state level of E·MgADP to bind APS and produce the observed substrate inhibition. Another mutant enzyme, this one containing cysteine in place of serine at position 107, was also produced. S107C was active and displayed the usual biphasicv versus [APS] cur"
https://openalex.org/W2141650278,"Abstract Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides diphosphates into triphosphates. NDP kinase is also involved in malignant tumors and was shown to activate in vitro transcription of the c-myc oncogene by binding to its NHE sequence. The structure of the complex of NDP kinase with bound ADP shows that the nucleotide adopts a different conformation from that observed in other phosphokinases with an internal H bond between the 3′-OH and the β-O made free by the phosphate transfer. We use intrinsic protein fluorescence to investigate the inhibitory and binding potential of nucleotide analogues phosphorylated in 3′-OH position of the ribose to both wild type and F64W mutant NDP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum. Due to their 3′-phosphate, 5′-phosphoadenosine 3′-phosphate (PAP) and adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) can be regarded as structural analogues of enzyme-bound ADP. TheK D of PAPS (10 μm) is three times lower than the K D of ADP. PAPS also acts as a competitive inhibitor toward natural substrates during catalysis, with a K I in agreement with binding data. The crystal structure of the binary complex between Dictyostelium NDP kinase and PAPS was solved at 2.8-A resolution. It shows a new mode of nucleotide binding at the active site with the 3′-phosphate of PAPS located near the catalytic histidine, at the same position as the γ-phosphate in the transition state. The sulfate group is directed toward the protein surface. PAPS will be useful for the design of high affinity drugs targeted to NDP kinases."

In this study we introduced site-directed mutations at the positions of hydrophobic or basic amino acids which are conserved among various bacteria species and which are located in the putative membrane-binding region of DnaA protein (from Asp357 to Val374). All mutant DnaA proteins showed much the same ATP and ADP binding activity as that of the wild-type protein. The release of ATP bound to the mutant DnaA protein, in which three hydrophobic amino acids were mutated to hydrophilic ones, was stimulated by cardiolipin, as in the case of the wild-type protein. On the other hand, the release of ATP bound to another mutant DnaA protein, in which three basic amino acids were mutated to acidic ones, was not stimulated by cardiolipin. These results suggest not only that the region is a membrane-binding domain of DnaA protein but also that these basic amino acids are important for the binding and the ionic interaction between the basic amino acids and acidic residues of cardiolipin and is involved in the interaction between DnaA protein and cardiolipin.

These results suggest that adenine nucleotides bound to DnaA protein regulate the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in E. coli cells. In order to couple the initiation of DNA replication with cell division, the initiator protein should be inactivated soon after the initiation of DNA replication to prevent overinitiation and it should be activated after an appropriate period for the next replication cycle. The inactivation seems to be mediated by the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA protein and its activation factor based on the following evidence: (i) the induction of a mutant DnaA protein with decreased ATPase activity led to overinitiation of DNA replication in cells, resulting in a dominant lethal phenotype (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and (ii) the stimulation factor for the ATPase was found and shown to be identical to the inactivation factor for DnaA protein (11Kurokawa K. Mizushima T. Kubota T. Tsuchiya T. Katayama T. Sekimizu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which was previously suggested to play an important role in the inactivation of DnaA protein (12Katayama T. J. Biol.

As for the activation of DnaA protein for initiation of DNA replication, membrane phospholipids were reported to activate the inactive ADP-binding form of DnaA protein. Acidic phospholipids, in particular cardiolipin (CL),1 decrease the affinity of DnaA protein for adenine nucleotides (14-17), and activate the DnaA protein from the ADP-binding form to the ATP-binding form in the presence of high concentrations of ATP by stimulating the exchange of ADP with ATP (14Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that artificial membranes consisting of a mixture of anionic and cationic phospholipids which mimic biological membranes can decrease the affinity of DnaA protein for adenine nucleotides under conditions in which acidic phospholipids form cluster structures (17Mizushima T.

Garner and Crooke (18Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggested that the region around Lys372 of DnaA protein is responsible for membrane binding based on their biochemical analysis using degraded products of DnaA protein. A potential amphipathic helix (from Asp357 to Val374 of DnaA protein) located in this region may be a membrane-binding domain (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys.

A recent study using a cross-linking technique with a photoactivatable phospholipid analog provided further evidence that the amphipathic helix is a membrane-binding domain (19Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In order to better understand how DnaA protein interacts with phospholipids and how it is involved in the regulation of DNA replication, we attempted to identify the amino acids of DnaA protein that are involved in membrane binding. To do this, we examined the effects of site-directed mutations on the membrane binding to DnaA protein. A crude extract for oriCcomplementation assay was prepared from the WM433 strain of E. coli as described previously (20Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In brief, uracil-containing single-stranded DNA of M13 phage which contains the coding region of the dnaAgene (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K.

The first primer contained a mismatch sequence for replacement of Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367 with Ser, the second replaced Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372with Glu, and the third made all six of the above substitutions (i.e. Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367 were replaced with Ser and Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372 were replaced with Glu). (The changed bases are indicated by underlines). The complementary DNA strand was synthesized in vitro and the resultant double-stranded DNA was introduced into JM109 cells. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and double-stranded DNAs that contains the mutations (pMZ000-30, pMZ000-31, and pMZ000-32) were prepared. For overproduction of mutant DnaA protein, we used the pMZ001 plasmid (10Mizushima T. Nishida S. Kurokawa K. Katayama T. Miki T. Sekimizu K.

After incubation at 0 °C for 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor. The supernatant was precipitated with 0.22 mg/ml ammonium sulfate and re-suspended with buffer C. Samples were dialyzed against buffer C and the precipitates that developed were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The precipitates were washed twice with buffer C containing 0.6 m ammonium sulfate and finally resuspended in buffer C containing 4 m guanidine-HCl and 0.6m ammonium sulfate. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm in the TLA100.3 rotor. The supernatant was fractionated by gel filtration on a Superose-12 column (Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography HR10/30) equilibrated with buffer D (23Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J.

DnaA protein was preincubated with 2 μm [α-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) in 40 μl of buffer G (50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.25), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm EDTA, 7 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.007% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 15 min. CL liposome was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm) and washed by ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.25), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 17% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.005% Triton X-100). The radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. ATP and ADP binding activity of DnaA protein was determined by a filter binding assay (6Mizushima T.

DnaA protein (2 pmol) was incubated with [α-32P]ATP or [3H]ADP at 0 °C for 15 min in 40 μl of buffer G. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes and washed and counted as described above. Replication of minichromosomes in a crude extract (Fraction II) was assayed as described (20Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Template DNA (M13E10) (200 ng, 600 pmol at nucleotides), 240 μg of Fraction II from WM433 (dnaA204), and DnaA protein were mixed with reaction mixtures (20Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reaction was terminated by chilling on ice and adding 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were passed through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters. The amount of radioactivity on the filters was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, and the amount of DNA synthesized (picomoles of nucleotides) was calculated (20Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Since, in general, protein-lipid interactions are mediated by hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic moiety of lipids and hydrophobic amino acids in proteins, the amino acids most likely to be involved in the interaction of DnaA protein with phospholipids are hydrophobic ones. The potential amphipathic helix (from Asp357 to Val374 of DnaA protein) contains many hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of DnaA protein from various bacteria species revealed that Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367 of E. coli DnaA protein are well conserved as hydrophobic amino acids (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, these three leucines are considered to be important for the interaction between DnaA protein and phospholipids. It has been reported that anionic residues in phospholipids are indispensable for their interaction with DnaA protein (14Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7202-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mizushima T. Ishikawa Y. Obana E. Hase M. Kubota T. Katayama T. Kunitake T. Watanabe E. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, besides the hydrophobic interaction, there is also a possibility that ionic interaction between anionic residues of phospholipids with basic amino acids in DnaA protein are involved in the functional interaction of the protein with phospholipids. As shown in Fig. 1, the amphipathic domain contains three basic amino acids (Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372), which are well conserved among DnaA protein from various bacteria species (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, these three basic amino acids may also be involved in the interaction between DnaA protein and phospholipids. We introduced site-directed mutations into the dnaA gene to convert Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367to Ser (a hydrophilic amino acid) or Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372 to Glu (an acidic amino acid) to construct the mutant dnaA genes,dnaA430, or dnaA431, respectively. Considering the possibility that both groups of amino acids are required for the interaction of DnaA protein with phospholipids, a mutantdnaA gene (dnaA432) which has mutations of both Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367 to Ser and Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372 to Glu was also prepared. The coding region of the dnaA430, dnaA431, or dnaA432 gene was conjugated with the promoter of the arabinose operon to construct a plasmid for overproduction of the mutated DnaA protein (DnaA430, DnaA431, or DnaA432). To avoid contamination of the wild-type DnaA protein in the fraction of the mutant DnaA protein, the KA450 strain (ΔoriC1071::Tn10, rnhA199(Am),dnaA17(Am), trpE9828(Am), tyrA(Am),thr, ilv, and thyA) in which the dnaAgene on chromosomal DNA was deleted (12Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22075-22079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as host cells for overproduction. The viability is not dependent on the function of DnaA protein in KA450. Addition of 1% arabinose caused overexpression of each mutant DnaA protein (data not shown). Purification of each mutant DnaA protein was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the final step of purification (gel-filtration column chromatography) both the monomer and aggregated forms of DnaA430 and DnaA432 proteins were recovered (data not shown), as was the case of wild-type DnaA protein (Fig. 2) (23Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only the monomer form of the DnaA431 protein was recovered (Fig. 2). The recovery of DnaA 431 protein after column chromatography was not significantly different from the recoveries of the other types of DnaA protein. The aggregated form of DnaA protein has been suggested to be a complex of DnaA protein with phospholipids, based on the finding that the aggregated form of DnaA protein is activated to the level of the monomer form by phospholipase (28Hwang D.S. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19244-19248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the result in Fig. 2 suggests that DnaA431 protein does not have an affinity for phospholipids. The functional interaction of DnaA protein with phospholipids is monitored by phospholipid-dependent stimulation of the release of ATP (or ADP) from DnaA protein (23Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the ADP-binding form of DnaA protein by phospholipids is mediated by this function of phospholipids on DnaA protein (23Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mutant DnaA proteins were required to maintain their ATP binding activity in order to examine their functional interaction with phospholipids. The ATP binding activities of these mutant proteins were examined by a filter-binding assay (6Mizushima T. Sasaki S. Ohishi H. Kobayashi M. Katayama T. Miki T. Maeda M. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25178-25183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, each mutant DnaA protein (DnaA430, DnaA431, or DnaA432) showed nearly the same ATP binding activity as the wild-type protein. The K d values of DnaA430, DnaA431, DnaA432 and the wild-type protein for ATP were determined to be 28, 19, 28, and 30 nm, respectively. The numbers of ATP-binding sites per DnaA430, DnaA431, DnaA432, and wild-type proteins were calculated to be 0.40, 0.46, 0.39, and 0.42, respectively. The K d value and the number of ATP-binding sites of wild-type protein were nearly the same as reported previously (5Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We also examined the binding of ADP by the mutant DnaA proteins in the same manner. As shown in Fig. 3 B, each of the mutant DnaA proteins maintained its ADP binding activity. These results enabled us to examine their functional interaction with phospholipids. The results also suggest that these amino acids in the amphipathic helix domain are not necessary for the adenine-nucleotide binding activity of DnaA protein. To examine the functional interaction of DnaA430, DnaA431, and DnaA432 proteins with CL, we investigated the effect of CL on the release of ATP from DnaA·ATP complex. DnaA protein bound to [α-32P]ATP was incubated with CL and the remaining ATP was determined by the filter-binding assay. As shown in Fig. 4, the rates of release of ATP from each of the mutant proteins in the absence of CL were nearly the same as that of the wild type protein, suggesting that theK d values for ATP of DnaA protein were not significantly affected by these mutations (see above). On the other hand, the release of ATP in the presence of CL was greatly affected by the mutations. CL did not stimulate the release of ATP from DnaA431 protein, whereas it stimulated the release from DnaA430 to nearly the same extent that it stimulated the release from the wild-type protein (Fig. 4). CL slightly stimulated the release of ATP from DnaA432, which has mutations of both DnaA430 and DnaA431 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the basic amino acids (Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372) but not the hydrophobic amino acids (Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367) in the amphipathic helix domain of DnaA protein are involved in the functional interaction between DnaA protein and CL, and that the interaction is mediated by an ionic interaction between the anionic residues of phospholipids and the basic amino acids of DnaA protein. These results also support the hypothesis that the amphipathic helix domain (from Asp357 to Val374 of DnaA protein) is the membrane-binding domain of DnaA protein (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,19Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We measured the activities of DnaA430, DnaA431, and DnaA432 proteins for initiation of DNA replication in an oriC complementation assay (20Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, each of the mutants showed activity for DNA replication, although the activities were less than the activity of the wild-type protein. The specific activities of DnaA430 and DnaA431 were about one-third and one-fifth, respectively, the activity of the wild-type protein, whereas the activity of DnaA432 was less than one-tenth that of the wild-type protein. DnaA A184V, DnaA46, and DnaA5 required longer incubation periods for expression of their replication activity; a time lag for the DNA replication reaction has been previously reported for these mutant DnaA proteins (7Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13128-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of these mutants, the time course of DNA replication was approximately linear as in the case of the wild-type protein (data not shown). Preincubation with each of the mutant proteins with 1 μm ADP inhibited the replication activity (data not shown) as in the case of the wild-type protein (6Mizushima T. Sasaki S. Ohishi H. Kobayashi M. Katayama T. Miki T. Maeda M. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25178-25183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The relatively low specific activities of the mutant DnaA proteins seems not to be due to denaturation as a result of the purification procedures, because the specific activities of the crude extract fractions of the mutant DnaA proteins were also lower than the specific activity of the wild-type protein. The mutated amino acids may affect the higher order structure of DnaA protein, resulting in the low specific activities. We also examined the effect of CL on the replication activity of the mutant and the wild-type DnaA proteins. It was shown that CL inhibited the replication activity of the nucleotide-free form of DnaA protein through inhibition of the ATP-binding to DnaA protein (23Sekimizu K. Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7136-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the replication activity of DnaA431 was more resistant to CL than DnaA430 and the wild-type DnaA protein. The concentrations of CL needed to 50% inhibition of the replication activity of DnaA430, DnaA431, and the wild-type DnaA protein were determined to be 1.9, 6.5, and 1.8 μm, respectively. The result supports the notion that the functional interaction of DnaA431 but not DnaA430 with CL is weakened by the mutations and thus, the basic amino acids are important for the functional interaction. The replication of chromosomal DNA is initiated in coordination with cell division (membrane division). A replicon model was proposed to explain this coordination (29Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). DNA replication in bacterial cells is initiated on membranes, and the activity of the initiator protein for DNA replication is regulated by membrane components (29Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between DnaA protein and acidic phospholipids has received much attention because it may provide biochemical support for the replicon model. Acidic phospholipids, such as CL, enhance the exchange reaction of ADP bound to DnaA protein with ATP, which results in activation of DnaA protein (14Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that acidic phospholipids activate DnaA protein to initiate the chromosomal DNA replication in cells (14Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, identification of amino acids involved in the interaction is important. In this study, we showed that DnaA431, which has mutations (Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372) in the amphipathic helix (from Asp357 to Val374 of DnaA protein) did not have a functional interaction with CL. The behavior of the DnaA431 protein in gel filtration chromatography is consistent with the notion that DnaA431 protein cannot form a complex with CL. These results strongly suggest that the amphipathic helix is the membrane-binding domain of DnaA protein as suggested previously (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We also showed that DnaA430 protein, which has mutations of hydrophobic amino acids in the amphipathic helix, maintained an activity for the functional interaction with CL. Thus, the basic amino acids (Arg360, Arg364, and Lys372) but not the hydrophobic amino acids (Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367) seem to be involved in the interaction. It is natural to suppose that the positively charged basic residues interact with the negatively charged phosphates of CL through an electrostatic interaction. Fig. 6depicts a plausible form of the ionic interaction between DnaA protein and CL. The location of each amino residue is putatively defined by considering the general structural parameters for an α-helical wheel. It is noteworthy that all three of the basic residues are placed on one side of the helical wheel and thus, provide a cationic domain. This configuration allows both of the two phosphates of CL to bind all or part of the three basic residues. A multisite electrostatic interaction may perturb the affinity of DnaA protein for adenine nucleotides. Garner and co-workers (19Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently proposed a two-step interaction of DnaA protein with acidic phospholipids. At first, DnaA protein adsorbs onto the anionic lipid bilayer surface, and then some part of the protein penetrates into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane (19Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results of this study support the hypothesis that the first step of the interaction is mediated by an ionic interaction between the anionic residues of CL with the basic amino acids of DnaA protein. The second step may be achieved by an interaction between the hydrophobic region of the phospholipids with the hydrophobic amino acids of DnaA protein. However, the present study suggests that hydrophobic amino acids in the amphipathic helix are not involved in this interaction. Besides these amino acids (Leu363, Leu366, and Leu367), there are some other hydrophobic amino acids that are conserved among DnaA proteins from various bacteria spices (1Skarstad K. Boye E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Some of these amino acids may be involved in the second step of the interaction. We thank Dr. K. Sekimizu, Dr. T. Katayama, Dr. T. Miki, and S. Nishida (Kyushu University) for helpful discussions."

The nucleotide specificity sequence NKMD (residues number 153–156) was targeted for mutagenesis, and the following mutants were obtained: N153D (DKMD), N153T (TKMD), D156N (NKMN), D156W (NKMW), and the double mutant N153T,D156E (TKNE). All of the yeast strains containing the mutant eEF1As as the sole source of eEF1A were viable except for the N153D mutant.Most of the purified mutant eEF1As had specific activities in the poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine similar to wild type, although with a K m for GTP increased by 1–2 orders of magnitude.

Second, this form of eEF1A was 10-fold more accurate in protein synthesis, and its rate of GTP hydrolysis was about 20% of wild type. In total, the wild-type protein contains the most optimal nucleotide specificity sequence, NKMD, and even subtle changes in this sequence have drastic consequences on eEF1A function in vitro or yeast viability.

Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)1 binds aminoacyl-tRNAs in a GTP-dependent manner and positions the bound aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site of the ribosome. After or concomitant with the proper recognition of codon and anticodon, GTP is hydrolyzed, and eEF1A·GDP is released from the ribosome allowing for peptide bond formation with the peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosomal P site. Besides being involved in the synthesis of every peptide bond, eEF1A is an exceptionally abundant protein comprising 1–3% of the soluble protein in most eukaryotic cells. Elongation factor 1A amino acid sequences have been inferred from more than 100 different organisms including bacteria, archaebacteria, plants, and animals. The relatively slow rate of change of the sequence of EF1A as it evolved into eEF1A has made it an excellent sequence for determining phylogenetic trees. In large measure, it would seem that the overall tertiary structure has probably been maintained given the 33% identity and 56% similarity of Escherichia coli EF1A (formerly EF-Tu) with human eEF1A, and a discussion of the evolution of the EF1A into the eEF1A sequence has been published (1Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 108/I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 115-130Google Scholar). Beyond its role in protein synthesis, eEF1A has also been of interest as a member of the G protein family, as the only crystal structures known are for EF1A (2Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol.

The very high homology between EF1A and eEF1A has allowed us to use the available crystal structures for EF1A to model the changes we have made in the yeast eEF1A mutants.

To study the nucleotide specificity of eEF1A, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to alter the binding pocket for the nucleotide in domain I of eEF1A. To do this, a highly efficient chromogenic selection system on a shuttle vector was used (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have made five mutants of yeast eEF1A at asparagine 153 and aspartic acid 156, the conserved amino acids in the nucleotide specificity sequence,NKMD. Several yeast strains grow exclusively on the mutant form of eEF1A, and the NKMN mutant eEF1A, when purified, uses XTP just as well as the wild type uses GTP. Curiously, the yeast strain for the NKMW mutant was temperature-sensitive, whereas the protein itself was not. The yeast strains M214 and M213 were generous gifts from Drs. M. G. Sandbaken and M. R. Culbertson, and both had the following genotype: Mata leu2–3, 112 Dtef1::LEU2 tef2-D2 lys2–20 his4–713 met2–1 ura3–52 trp1-D1. These strains contain nonfunctional copies of both TEF1 (Translation ElongationFactor 1) and TEF2, the two genes coding for eEF1A in yeast. Strain M213 contains plasmid YCpMS29 (TEF2, URA3) and strain M214 plasmid YCpMS41 (TEF2, TRP1), each harboring a fully functional copy of TEF2 (14Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R. Genetics. 1988; 120: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University on an Applied Biosystems model DNA synthesizer, deprotected, and purified by the OPC method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The following oligonucleotides were made for site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides N153D, N153T, D156N, D156W, and D156E (using the N153T mutant as starting sequence) were all designed to make the respective indicated amino acid changes to the nucleotide binding sequence. N153D oligonucleotide, 5′CTCAGGTAGAACAGCTGTCGTTGTTAG3′; N153T oligonucleotide, 5′TAAACTGCCTCAGGTAGAACCACTGTCGTTGTTAGTTAACAG3′; D156N oligonucleotide, 5′AAGCAGGGTAAACTGCCTCAAGTAGAACAACTGTCGTTGTTA3′; D156W oligonucleotide, 5′TAAGCAGGGTAAACTGCCTGGTGTAGAACAACTGTCGTTGTTA3′; and D156E oligonucleotide (using the N153T mutant as starting sequence), 5′GGGTAAACTGCCTAAGGTAGAACCACT3′. All the site-directed mutation oligonucleotides were constructed so that they would introduce a change in the pattern of restriction sites and yet not introduce a rare codon as defined by the codon usage tables for yeast. The change in restriction sites are as follows: for N153D, gain of aSalI site; for N153T, loss of a HincII site; and for D156N, D156W, and D156E, loss of a Tth111 I site. The entire mutagenesis procedure has been published (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In short, the yeast shuttle vector PRS314-JCTEF2 (1Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 108/I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 115-130Google Scholar) was the starting material. The PRS314-JCTEF2 vectors all contain the wild-type eEF1A promoter in the wild-type settings in front of the coding region. All the cloning took place in XL1-Blue (Stratagene) cells. The single-stranded DNA is recovered from the PRS314-JCX phagemid (JCX indicates a generic mutant X; in a specific mutant, X will be substituted with a number), which can be secreted as single-stranded DNA in the presence of M13 helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene). The Sculptor IVM from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was used for mutagenesis. XL1-Blue cells were eletroporated according to Bio-Rad's Gene Pulser apparatus protocol. The mutants were identified by the desired color change of the colonies, according to the usage of the second oligonucleotide in the mutagenesis reaction (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmid preparations were made using the Promega Wizard Minipreps DNA purification system. Restriction digests were made as a first confirmation of the mutants. For the N153D mutant, digestion with the endonuclease SalI lacked a band compared with the wild-type digest when the digested plasmids were run on a standard agarose gel. For the mutants N153T and all three mutants at position 156 (D156N, D156E, and D156W), the identifications were performed using the restriction enzymesHincII and Tth111 I, respectively. Final sequencing of the mutants was performed using the DNA Sequenase kit version 2.0 (United States Biochemical) with [35S]dATP (Amersham). Sequencing gels were made with premixed Long Ranger (AT Biochem). LiCH3CO2-washed M213 yeast were prepared as described before (1Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 108/I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 115-130Google Scholar). Aliquots of 200 μl were stored at the vapor temperature of liquid nitrogen. Just before use, cells was thawed on ice and mixed with up to 5 μg of DNA and 200 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA (Sigma) in a maximum volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with agitation. Then, 1.2 ml of 40% PEG-4000, 0.1 m LiCH3CO2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA was added and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with agitation. Heat shock for 15 min was performed at 42 °C in a water bath. The cells were centrifuged for 5 s and washed twice with 0.5 ml of TE, pH 7.5. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of TE, pH 7.5, and 100 μl was plated on selective supplemented minimal medium (SMM) plates (the rest was saved at 4 °C). Normally, it took 1½ to 2 days of incubation at 30 °C until transformants appeared. The strategy for in vivo analysis of altered eEF1A genes (TEF1 and TEF2) in yeast involves the use of plasmid shuffle. The strain M213 (genotype: Mata leu2–3, 112 Dtef1::LEU2 tef2-D2 lys2–20 his4–713 met2–1 ura3–52 trp1-D1 (YCpMS29 (TEF2, URA3))) served as the recipient for transformation (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R. Genetics. 1988; 120: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain contains nonfunctional chromosomal copies of both TEF1 and TEF2. This genotype is normally lethal due to the absence of TEF function, but viability is maintained by the presence of a yeast centromeric plasmid carrying a wild-type TEF2 gene. This strain has a growth rate identical to yeast strains with chromosomal copies of TEF2. The plasmid carrying the TEF2 gene is never lost because it is required for viability. Due to the CEN (yeast centromere sequence) and ARS (autonomously replicating sequences) elements in the PRS314 vectors, they are mitotically stable (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selectable markers TRP1 and URA3 in PRS314 and YCpMS29, respectively, have the following functions. TRP1 is a tryptophan auxotrophic marker, and URA3 is a 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) marker used to select against URA3-containing plasmids in the final test of the mutagenesis productsin vivo. The plasmid shuffle was carried out as described earlier (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In short, yeast strain M213 can be transformed with plasmid PRS314-JCTEF2 to a Trp+ phenotype. The resulting transformant will harbor two plasmids, one (YCpMS29) carrying wild-type TEF2 and URA3 and the other, PRS314-JCX, carrying mutagenized TEF2 and TRP1. In the plasmid shuffle, colonies are first screened for the Trp+ phenotype, indicating the presence of the plasmid carrying the mutagenized TEF2. If the TEF2 gene product were dominant lethal (negative), no Trp+ phenotypes would be observed. This did not occur with the mutants tested. The ability of the mutagenized TEF2 gene to support viability was then tested on 5-FOA plates. In the presence of the URA3 gene product, 5-FOA turns into a potent toxin for the cell (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The M213 strain used as host in these studies harbors the plasmid YCpMS29 carrying TEF2 and URA3. By selecting on 5-FOA medium, only colonies that have lost the YCpMS29 plasmid, and thereby lost the URA3 gene, will survive. At the same time, these colonies will only survive if they have gained a viable copy of the TEF2 gene via the transfected PRS314-JCX plasmid. This procedure allows the determination of whether the mutagenized gene can support growth of yeast in the absence of wild-type eEF1A. If no Trp+ colonies are observed (which was only the case for the N153D mutant, JC2), this means that the mutagenized TEF2 gene cannot support growth and substitute for wild-type eEF1A. Purification of eEF1A was performed according to a scheme modified from Carvalho et al. (16Carvalho J.F. Carvalho M.D. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After several passages on 5-FOA plates (except for the N153D, JC2, mutant), the mutant yeast strains were grown in standard YPD media to an A 600 of 2.5, concentrated by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000 × g), and stored as a cell pellet at liquid nitrogen vapor temperature until purification was started. The JC2, N153D mutant did not support growth alone, so it was passaged on SMM (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) plates and grown in SMM medium at 30 °C. All operations were carried out at 4 °C as described earlier (13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) unless stated otherwise. In short, cell-free extracts were prepared in a glass bead blender (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) with start buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNH4Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 μl/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was added to DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 μl/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 100 mmKCl. The unbound material and the wash were added to phosphocellulose (P-11, Whatman) pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 with 100 mmKCl. The phosphocellulose slurry was washed with buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl and then made 0.5 m KCl by adding solid KCl. The released material and wash was dialyzed overnight to yield a dialyzed solution that was 50 mm with respect to KCl. The supernatant was applied to a CM-cellulose column (CM52, carboxymethyl cellulose, Whatman) pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 with 50 mm KCl. The column was eluted with a linear salt gradient (total of 10 × column volume) from 50 to 300 mm KCl in buffer 1. Purity, as checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was found to be approximately 98%. The DKMD mutant (JC2), purified as described above, was dialyzed overnight in buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMg(CH3CO2)2. The dialyzed solution was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with GTP-agarose pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMg(CH3CO2)2. The slurry was packed into a 0.9 × 14-cm column. The run-through was collected and reapplied to the column at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. The column was washed with buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMg(CH3CO2)2. The wash-through, containing the mutant JC2, DKMD, was concentrated on a phosphocellulose column pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl. Protein was eluted from the phosphocellulose in buffer 1 with 1m KCl and dialyzed in buffer 1 to give a final salt concentration of 100 mm KCl. The wild-type eEF1A was eluted off the GTP-agarose column with buffer 1 with 1 m KCl and 1 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2 and likewise dialyzed. The in vitro assays were performed as described by Carvalho et al. (18Carvalho M.D. Carvalho J.F. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Cavallius et al.(13Cavallius J. Popkie A.P. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In short, 50-μl reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 A 260 unit poly(U), 1 mm GTP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 IU pyruvate kinase, 0.7 A 260 unit salt-washed ribosomes, 10 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNA (specific activity, 479 Ci/mol), 0.8 μg of eEF2, and various amounts of purified eEF1A. For some experiments, the GTP was substituted with other nucleotides at the indicated concentration. In the assay containing [3H]Leu-tRNA, the amount of [3H]Leu-tRNA added was 10 pmol (specific activity, 179 Ci/mmol). The incubations were for 6 min at 37 °C unless indicated otherwise. [14C]Polyphenylalanine was precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid and then heated to 90 °C for 15 min, and cooled precipitates were collected by vacuum filtration onto Millipore filters (type HA). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding assays either with GTP or GDPNP (a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP) were performed under conditions similar to the poly(U) assay described above but with the following alterations. GTP or GDPNP was added at a concentration of 1 mm. Incubation was 10 min at 37 °C. Quantitation of [14C]Phe-tRNA bound to ribosomes was determined as retention on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore filters, type HA) (18Carvalho M.D. Carvalho J.F. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Use of GDPNP in this assay allowed for the determination of the number of active eEF1A molecules, as the eEF1A acts stoichiometrically, not catalytically, under these conditions. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, 100 mm KCl). The amount of [14C]Phe-tRNA retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. GTPase activity was measured as described by Merrick (19Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, 8.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 6.25% glycerol, 15 pmol of eEF1A, 100 μm GTP, and, when indicated, 10 pmol of aminoacyl-tRNA (all 20 amino acids) and/or 0.7A 260 units of sucrose cushion ribosomes and/or 0.15 A 260 units of poly(U). The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and then placed on ice; the following additions were then made in order: (a) 0.5 ml of 20 mm silicotungstate in 20 mmH2SO4; (b) 1.2 ml of 1 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0; (c) 0.5 ml of 5% ammonium molybdate in 4 mH2SO4; and (d) 0.3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid:acetone (1:1). After these additions, the free [γ-32P] was extracted with 2 ml of isobutanol:benzene (1:1), and the liquids were mixed by vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation for 3 min at 1500 rpm in a Beckman model TJ-6 centrifuge at 4 °C, a 1-ml aliquot of the organic (upper) phase was removed and mixed with CytoScint from ICN. The amount of hydrolyzed [γ-32P]GTP was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The target for site-directed mutagenesis was the NKMD sequence of eEF1A, known as the nucleotide specificity sequence. Fig. 1 A shows how in EF1A the hydrogen bonding pattern can account for the observed specificity of EF1A for GTP (2Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the 50% sequence identity of eEF1A to EF1A in the GTP binding domain, domain 1, we have assumed that a similar hydrogen bonding pattern exists in eEF1A. As with the binding of ATP, there are other hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with the ribose and phosphate moieties, but these are not shown as they do not contribute to nucleotide specificity. The numerous hydrogen bond possibilities likely account for the fact that the K d for GTP in G proteins (GTP-binding proteins associated with signal transduction) is often about 1 μm, whereas that for ATP-utilizing proteins is in the 50–500 μm range. A proof of the hydrogen bonding pattern was tested by Hwang and Miller (11Hwang Y.W. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13081-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who changed the NKXD sequence to NKXN. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, this allows for the same network of hydrogen bonds but with the nucleotide XTP, not GTP. In their studies, the EF1A NKXN mutant had the same affinity for XTP as the wild-type protein did for GTP. However, the NKXN mutant of EF1A was unable to support the growth of E. coli as the sole source of the elongation factor. We have decided to try a similar experiment in eukaryotic cells to see if it was possible to isolate and purify mutant eEF1A proteins. As a number of investigators have been unable to express eEF1A in soluble form in E. coli, we chose to use the yeast protein and purify the expressed proteins from yeast. In addition, we have attempted to alter the nucleotide specificity of the eEF1A based upon the observation of some differences in the NKXD nucleotide specificity sequence that have been reported for a number of proteins that utilize GTP (24Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These changes are indicated in Table I. The wild-type NKXD and the mutant NKXN sequences were discussed above. The NKXW sequence is found in two enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and GTP:AMP phosphotransferase. Both of these proteins will use ITP as well as GTP. The TKXE sequence is found in the enzyme guanyltransferase. Here, one could imagine that because the glutamic acid residue is one methylene group longer than aspartic acid, a compensatory shortening would have to occur at the position normally occupied by asparagine. In this instance, the threonine residue provides the hydroxyl group, and this group is one methylene group closer to the main chain. Thus, one would expect to maintain the GTP specificity, although the possible loss of one or more of the hydrogen bonds labeled G, F, or H in Fig. 1 A might result in a slight increase in the K d or K m for GTP. Finally, it was thought that the substitution of an aspartic acid in place of the asparagine would weaken the binding for GTP and perhaps even allow a hydrogen bond between the aspartic acid and the 6-amino group of ATP. Thus, these substitutions were made in yeast eEF1A, and the yeast strains were analyzed for growth on nonselective media, where both the wild-type and mutant eEF1A would be expressed, and on selective media (5-FOA), where the mutant eEF1A would be the sole source of the eEF1A.Table IAnticipated nucleotide specificityAmino acid sequenceExpected nucleotide specificityStrain nameNKMD1-aThis is the wild-type eEF1A sequence (25).GTPWild typeNKXN1-bBy analogy to the crystal structure and experiments involving EF1A (11, 12).XTPJC6NKXW1-cBy analogy to cytosolic phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (26) and GTP:AMP phosphotransferase (27).GTP or ITPJC33TKXE1-dBy analogy to reovirus guanyltransferase (28).GTPJC5 and JC32DKXDATPJC2Nucleotide binding specificity sequences from different proteins and their found or expected nucleotide specificity.

All of the yeast strains that contained both host and mutant eEF1A were viable, indicating that none of the mutant eEF1As were behaving as dominant negative mutants. When grown on selective media, only the DKMD mutant, JC2, failed to grow, although the NKMW mutant, JC33, did display a temperature-sensitive phenotype with wild-type growth rates at or below 18 °C and no growth at elevated temperatures. Within experimental error, the yeast strains containing just the mutant form of eEF1A grew in liquid media at wild-type growth rates. Similarly, growth on alternate carbon sources (glycerol, lactose, or sucrose) did not show any difference between yeast with the wild-type or mutant eEF1As (data not shown).Table IISite-directed mutants of eEF1AMutant yeast amino acid no.2-aMutant designation: wild-type amino acid-residue number-mutant amino acid.Expected nucleotide specificityIn yeast2-bTS, temperature-sensitive. “Lethal” indicates whether the presence of the mutant eEF1A causes the strain not to grow (i.e., dominant negative phenotype). “Viable” indicates whether the mutant eEF1A was able to allow growth of the yeast as the sole source of eEF1A.Doubling time as % of wild type2-cDoubling time of wild type was 135 min at 30 °C.Yeast strainLethalViableWild type[eEF1A on URA-3 YCpMS29]NoYes100M213Wild type[eEF1A on TRP-1 YCpMS41]NoYes100M214N153T, D156ENo change (NKMD to TKME)NoYes100JC32N153DGTP to ATP (NKMD to DKMD)NoNoJC2N153TNo change (NKMD to TKMD)NoYes114JC5D156WGTP to ITP/GTP (NKMD to NKMW)NoTS1132-dWild-type doubling time at 18 °C was 310 min.JC33D156NGTP to XTP/GTP (NKMD to NKMN)NoYes107JC6Site-directed mutagenesis of yeast eEF1A in the nucleotide specificity sequence NKMD.2-a Mutant designation: wild-type amino acid-residue number-mutant amino acid.2-b TS, temperature-sensitive. “Lethal” indicates whether the presence of the mutant eEF1A causes the strain not to grow (i.e., dominant negative phenotype). “Viable” indicates whether the mutant eEF1A was able to allow growth of the yeast as the sole source of eEF1A.2-c Doubling time of wild type was 135 min at 30 °C.2-d Wild-type doubling time at 18 °C was 310 min.

Using this technique to image oligomers of polysialic acid we unexpectedly find formation of filament bundles that assemble into networks. This finding suggests an explanation for the unusual properties of polysialic acid and suggests a novel molecular mechanism in the interactions of cell adhesion molecules.RESULTSOligomers of α2–8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid residues of defined polymer length, purified from colominic acid by high performance liquid chromatography, were placed on mica surfaces and allowed to dry. Atomic force microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures in samples of oligomers of 12 or more sialyl residues, whereas oligomers of 9 residues or shorter did not display these structures (Fig. 1). Individual filaments had a minimum thickness of ∼1 nm (Fig. 2) but tended to occur as filament bundles. With increasing chain length, extensive branching of the filament bundles into networks was observed. The filament networks were degraded by sialidase, showing that they consisted of sialic acid (Fig. 3).Figure 2Surface contour display of polysialic acid filaments in high resolution. Purified oligomers of polysialic acid (degree of polymerization 18) were imaged by atomic force microscopy under conditions of Fig. 1. The surface scan contour image displays the filaments as two ridges, cross-sectioned by the display program in the front and their anastomosis farther back in the image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Degradation of polysialic acid filaments by sialidase.

Similarly, a minimum of 8 residues is required for the most efficient cleavage of polysialic acid by endosialidases (14Finne J. Mäkelä P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pelkonen S. Pelkonen J. Finne J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of the unusually long segment of polysialic acid for the interaction with these proteins is suggested to be related to conformational factors (15Jennings H.J. Roy R. Michon F. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2651-2657PubMed Google Scholar, 17Häyrinen J. Bitter-Suermann D. Finne J. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A helical coil structure may be stabilized for oligomers of sufficient chain length, as supported by NMR studies (18Brisson J.-R. Baumann H. Imberty A. Pérez S. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is possible that the attaining of the helical coil epitope is also a prerequisite for the formation of the filament structure observed in the present study. Thus, only fragments of sufficient length would fulfill the physical requirements for the association with each other into filaments. With regard to the interaction mechanisms of polysialic acid with proteins, the possibility remains that the interaction in fact is with the filamentous form of polysialic acid. Alternatively, the filamentous form may represent an additional form of polysialic acid. The filamentous form could also correspond to the postulated “intermolecular epitope” of polysialic acid, implicated as a potential vaccine epitope against group B meningococci (19Jennings H.J. Gamian A. Michon F. Ashton F.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3585-3591PubMed Google Scholar).Polysialic acid occurs abundantly at the cell surface of developing neural and other cells (2Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of its biological roles has been suggested to be associated with a barrier function between cells (20Acheson A. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Due to its negative charge, polysialic acid has been viewed mainly as a repulsive element between cells and molecules (21Sadoul R. Hirn M. Deagostini-Bazin H. Rougon G. Goridis C. Nature. 1983; 304: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 22Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The potential of association into bundle networks suggests that polysialic acid could also participate in associative interactions. In developing brain, the length of the polysialic acid chains undergoes temporal and topical modulation. The observed length-dependent formation of filament bundle networks may offer a molecular mechanism for the modulation of cell interactions involved in these processes.The formation of filament networks by polysialic acid could also be a mechanism to enhance its postulated barrier function. In addition to its presence on the eukaryotic cell surface, polysialic acid forms the polysaccharide capsule of some important bacterial pathogens causing sepsis and meningitis, such as Neisseria meningitidis group B, Escherichia coli K1, and Pasteurella hemolytica A2 (6Jennings H.J.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 42: 23-25Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the stability of the surface layer of the cells would be enhanced significantly by a filamentous network.Filaments of protein and nucleic acid have been examined by atomic force microscopy (7Gale M.

J. 1991; 274: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, polysialic acid and other cell surface carbohydrates have mainly been considered as inert or repulsive molecules in cellular and molecular interactions. Although carbohydrate–carbohydrate interactions have in some cases been proposed to mediate cell adhesion (27Popescu O. Misevic G.N. Nature. 1997; 386: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Song Y. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), no data are available on the supramolecular organization of the complexes involved. The results of the present study unexpectedly suggest that carbohydrate oligomers as short as 12 residues long may associate into long filamentous structures. The filament network formation has to be considered as a novel potential mechanism by which N-CAM and other cell surface components may mediate their interactions with other molecules and cells. Polysialic acid is a unique sialic acid polymer that occurs in the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM (1Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rutishauser U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Kiss J.Z. Rougon G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). During development the polysialylated embryonic N-CAM is replaced by its adult, normally sialylated form (4Finne J. Finne U. Deagostini-Bazin H. Goridis C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Polysialic acid also occurs as the capsular polysaccharide of bacteria causing meningitis (5Finne J. Leinonen M. Mäkelä P.H. Lancet. 1983; 2: 355-358Abstract PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 6Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1984; 56: 893-905Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which polysialic acid modulates cell adhesion or participates in the pathogenesis of meningitis are not known. The main function has been thought to be to serve as a repulsive element contributing to the net negative charge of the cell surface. Atomic force microscopy has become a new method to visualize filaments of biological origin under conditions close to their native state (7Gale M. Pollanen M.S. Markiewicz P. Goh M.C. Biophys.

To varying degrees in different species, excess circulating gastrin leads to proliferation of enterochromaffin-like cells and to the development of gastric carcinoid tumors. The African rodent, Mastomys natalensis, is distinguished from other mammals by its propensity toward CCK-BR-mediated growth even in the absence of hypergastrinemia. Here, we report that theMastomys CCK-BR, when expressed in COS-7 cells, differs from the respective human, canine, and rat receptor homologs by its ability to trigger ligand-independent (i.e., constitutive) inositol phosphate formation. To define the molecular basis of this observation, a series of Mastomys-human chimeric receptors was investigated. Functional characterization of these constructs revealed that a limited segment of the Mastomys CCK-BR, transmembrane domain VI through the C-terminal end, is sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the human protein. Mutagenesis studies within this CCK-BR region defined a combination of threeMastomys amino acids that, when introduced into the human receptor, together conferred a level of ligand-independent signaling comparable with the Mastomys CCK-BR. Complementing prior observations that single point mutations can lead to ligand-independent signaling, our findings suggest that multiple naturally occurring amino acid polymorphisms and/or mutations may together result in an enhanced basal level of receptor activity.

The cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR)1 is a seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor that is widely expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and in the central nervous system (1Walsh J.H. Gut Peptides. 1st Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Stimulation of the CCK-BR by either of the endogenous peptides, CCK-8 or gastrin, triggers phospholipase C-mediated conversion of membrane phospholipids to inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol, which in turn initiates a series of downstream signaling events (1Walsh J.H. Gut Peptides. 1st Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). In the CNS, the CCK-BR is postulated to modulate anxiety as well as the perception of pain (2Ravard S. Dourish C.T.

Science. 1992; 256: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the stomach, it is well established that activation of this receptor subtype stimulates acid secretion as well as mucosal growth (1Walsh J.H. Gut Peptides. 1st Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies in which CCK-BR-deficient mice were generated by targeted gene disruption revealed that absence of the CCK-BR results in thinning of the gastric mucosa and a reduced density of both gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) and parietal cells (4Langhans N.

Conversely, receptor overactivity in rodents, induced by hypergastrinemia, leads to gastric mucosal hypertrophy marked by increased synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein (6Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987Google Scholar). Long-term stimulation of the CCK-BR by elevated circulating gastrin may ultimately result in the development of ECL cell carcinoid tumors (7Modlin I.M. Tang L.H. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 783-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Among mammals, there is a broad spectrum of susceptibility to gastrin-induced proliferation and tumor formation, with the highest sensitivity observed in the African rodent, Mastomys natalensis. During its normal course of aging, Mastomysmay develop gastric carcinoid tumors even with normal circulating gastrin levels. In this animal, hypergastrinemia potentiates the enhanced rate of gastric ECL cell tumor development (7Modlin I.M. Tang L.H. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 783-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The increased susceptibility of Mastomys to ECL cell growth, even in the absence of elevated circulating gastrin, led us to speculate that this receptor homolog was functionally different from the CCK-BR in other species. There is ample precedent that species-dependent differences in the amino acid sequence of the CCK-BR can lead to alterations in the pharmacologic properties of the receptor. We have previously shown that interspecies polymorphisms markedly alter CCK-BR interactions with synthetic ligands, i.e., a single amino acid difference between the canine and human CCK-BRs results in a reversal of the affinity rank order for non-peptide antagonists (8Beinborn M. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. Nature. 1993; 362: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study, we demonstrated that single and double amino acid differences between the mouse, human, and dog receptors led to marked alterations in drug-induced inositol phosphate formation, the primary second messenger generated in response to activation of the CCK-BR (9Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Gordon M.C. Quinn S.M. Beinborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11043-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, recombinant CCK-BRs from different species were expressed in COS-7 cells and functionally compared. Only theMastomys receptor had a significant level of ligand-independent (i.e., constitutive) signaling activity. To understand the molecular basis of this finding, we utilized a series of human/Mastomys CCK-BR chimeric receptors to map the limited domain that confers ligand-independent signaling. Point mutations were then introduced within this region of the protein to identify residues that underlie the species-dependent constitutive activity. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Iodinated cholecystokinin octapeptide (125I CCK-8; specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and [3H]myoinositol (specific activity 40–60 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled CCK-8 was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). TheMastomys CCK-BR cDNA (generously provided by Dr. T. Chiba) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA I (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Two differences in translated amino acid sequence from the originally published version (10Nakata H. Matsui T.

Of note, the 320PGPRP revision results in the introduction of an additional amino acid, thus increasing the numbering by “1” of residues C-terminal to proline 324. The revisedMastomys cDNA has been submitted to GenBank. Naturally occurring PstI sites, in the same relative position of the human (11Lee Y.M. Beinborn M. McBride E.W. Lu M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F.

Commun. 1992; 187: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) CCK-BR (corresponding to human cDNA nucleotides 607–612), were used to generate thePstI chimeras. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce XhoI and MluI sites (corresponding to human cDNA nucleotides 910–915 and 986–992) into the respective receptor cDNAs from each species (12Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TheXhoI and MluI chimeric receptor cDNAs were constructed by replacing segments of the human CCK-BR cDNA with the corresponding Mastomys sequence. Mutant receptors, in which 1–3 amino acids were replaced, were generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (12Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All chimeric and mutant receptor cDNA constructs were confirmed using the Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Utilizing the DEAE-dextran method (13Kopin A.S. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Miller L.J. Lu M. Lin H.Y. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3605-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), cells (106/10-cm dish) were transiently transfected with 5 μg of either the expression vector, pcDNA I, or the relevant CCK-BR cDNA construct. In control experiments (see Fig. 4), the amount of transfected DNA was adjusted (1–5 μg/10-cm dish) to obtain comparable receptor expression levels of the human and Mastomys CCK-BR. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and divided into 24-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well). The following day, competition binding experiments were performed in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 20 pm of 125I-CCK-8 (NEN Life Science Products) was used as the radioligand in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled CCK-8 (0–0.3 μm). After incubation for 80 min at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution and hydrolyzed in 1 n NaOH. Bound radioactivity was quantified, and receptor expression levels were calculated using computerized nonlinear curve fitting (MacLigand). In all experiments, the human wild-type CCK-BR was included as a control. Transfected COS-7 cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium containing 3 μCi of [3H]myoinositol/ml. Ligand-independent and agonist (0.3 μm CCK-8)-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate production were assessed at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. After incubation of the cells for either 0.5 or 1 h (see text), inositol metabolites were extracted with methanol/chloroform, and the upper phase was analyzed for inositol phosphates by strong anion exchange chromatography. The production of inositol phosphates was expressed as a fraction of the total cellular tritium content. To determine the receptor-mediated component of IP production, all measurements were corrected by the amount of IP formation in COS-7 cells expressing pcDNA I (the expression vector) alone. Second messenger signaling by COS-7 cells expressing the human (11Lee Y.M. Beinborn M. McBride E.W. Lu M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Kopin A.S. J. Biol.

With agonist stimulation, each receptor led to comparable levels of IP production (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, only theMastomys protein triggered ligand-independent IP formation that was significantly higher than the level observed in cells transfected with the expression vector, pcDNA I (Fig. 1 B). Increased expression of a constitutively active receptor will result in a parallel increase in both agonist-induced and ligand-independent second messenger signaling (17Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this expectation, a positive correlation was observed between CCK-8-stimulated and ligand-independent signaling in COS-7 cells expressing theMastomys CCK-BR (Fig. 2). In contrast, signaling by the human CCK-BR in the absence of ligand was always close to zero regardless of the level of CCK-8-induced IP formation. These observations confirm that the MastomysCCK-BR is constitutively active, whereas the human homolog is not. A comparison of IP production after 0.5 and 1 h provided additional support that only the Mastomys CCK-BR is constitutively active. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a time-dependent increase in basal IP production is observed in cells expressing the Mastomys CCK-BR, whereas this is not the case in cells expressing the human receptor. As a control, the maximal level of CCK-8-induced signaling was also compared at 0.5- and 1-h incubation times. Consistent with expectation, agonist-induced IP production by either the Mastomys or the human CCK-BR increased to a similar extent independent of the respective basal level of signaling (Fig. 3 B). It has been recently established that constitutive activity of G protein-coupled receptors can be attenuated by a novel class of ligands, inverse agonists (18Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Beinborn M. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14146-14151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The availability of such a compound for the CCK-BR, L-740,093 (R enantiomer), enabled us to provide additional confirmation of constitutive signaling by theMastomys CCK-BR. L-740,093 R attenuated ligand-independent IP production by the Mastomys receptor but had no effect on the basal activity of the human CCK-BR (Fig. 4 A). Half-maximal inhibition of ligand-independent signaling by L-740,093 R in cells expressing the Mastomys receptor was achieved at a concentration of 1.73 nm (Fig. 4 B). The marked difference in ligand-independent second messenger signaling by the Mastomys and human CCK-BR homologs was observed despite 92% amino acid identity between the two proteins. In an attempt to define a minimal domain of the Mastomys receptor, which conferred ligand-independent activity, a series of chimeric receptors was constructed with varying N-terminal portions of human sequence linked to complementary C-terminal portions of theMastomys protein (PstI, XhoI, and MluI chimeras, see Fig. 5). When functionally assessed in COS-7 cells, each of these chimeric receptors had a level of constitutive activity approaching that of theMastomys wild-type CCK-BR. Constitutive activity of the MluI chimera suggested that transfer of a small segment of the Mastomys receptor was sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the human protein. Sequence comparison between the Mastomys and human receptors within this limited domain, which spans transmembrane domain VI through the C terminus (see Fig. 5), revealed four candidate amino acids that could potentially confer constitutive signaling activity (Fig. 6 A). Many previously reported examples of constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors are the result of single amino acid substitutions (20Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 21Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 22Parent J.-L. LeGouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on this precedent, a series of four mutant human CCK-BRs was generated. In each receptor, one of the four human amino acids was replaced with the corresponding Mastomys residue. None of the single point mutations in the human CCK-BR was sufficient to significantly increase ligand-independent signaling relative to the human wild-type value (data not shown). The absence of ligand-independent signaling with single amino acid substitutions suggests that a combination of severalMastomys residues is required to confer constitutive signaling activity. To determine which of the four candidate Mastomys amino acids contributed to constitutive activity, an alternative strategy was utilized. With the cDNA encoding the human/Mastomys MluI chimera as a template for mutagenesis, each residue unique to theMastomys receptor (Leu344, Ile353, Asp407, Pro423) was sequentially replaced with its corresponding human homolog (Val340, Val349, Glu403, Ala419). A second series of four mutant human receptors was thus generated, each including a different combination of three Mastomys amino acids (Fig. 6 B). A decrease in constitutive signaling with replacement of the respective Mastomys amino acid indicated that the corresponding residue participated in ligand-independent signaling. Mutants 1, 2, and 3 had a significantly lower level of constitutive activity than the Mastomys wild-type receptor, suggesting that each of the Mastomys amino acids (Leu344, Ile353, Asp407), which had been substituted with the corresponding human residue, contributed to ligand-independent signaling (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, triple mutant 4 maintained constitutive activity comparable with the level of the Mastomys protein, despite substitution of Pro423 by an alanine residue. The latter finding suggests that the residue at position 423 played no appreciable role in conferring constitutive activity to the Mastomys CCK-BR. Comparison of the recombinant canine, rat, Mastomys, and human CCK-BRs expressed in COS-7 cells revealed that only theMastomys receptor triggered ligand-independent IP formation. Constitutive signaling activity of the Mastomys protein was confirmed by three additional observations: (i) the level of ligand-independent signaling correlated with respective levels of CCK-8-induced signaling, (ii) ligand-independent [3H]inositol phosphate formation increased with extended incubation time, and (iii) ligand-independent signaling could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the inverse agonist, L-740,093 R. Of note, none of these criteria applied to the human CCK-BR, which was tested in parallel. Together, these findings establish that the Mastomysreceptor is constitutively active as a consequence of interspecies variability in the CCK-BR. Since the Mastomys cDNA utilized in this study was isolated from an enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoid (10Nakata H. Matsui T. Ito M. Taniguchi T. Naribayashi Y. Arima N. Nakamura A. Kinoshita Y. Chihara K. Hosoda S. Chiba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it was important to consider whether the corresponding protein resulted from a somatic mutation in the tumor. This possibility is unlikely based on sequence identity between the cDNA used in our experiments and CCK-BR cDNAs isolated from a number of normal Mastomystissues, including isolated gastric parietal cells and cerebral cortical tissue (7Modlin I.M. Tang L.H. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 783-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The observation that species-dependent polymorphisms can result in constitutive activation of a G protein-coupled receptor suggests an important mechanism by which ligand-independent signaling can occur in nature. As such, our observation complements two previous reports which revealed that constitutive activity may be a distinguishing feature of certain G protein-coupled receptor subtypes (23Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or splice variants (24Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Study of both human and rat dopamine receptors indicated that the D1B subtype is constitutively active, whereas the D1A subtype is not (23Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, it has been found that alternative splicing of the prostaglandin E3 receptor results in a constitutively active isoform of this receptor (24Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For both the D1 and the mouse prostaglandin E3 receptor, ligand-independent signaling is a property of naturally occurring receptor variants within a given species rather than a species-dependent phenomenon as observed with the Mastomys CCK-BR. The vast majority of naturally occurring constitutively active receptors reported in the literature can be attributed to single amino acid mutations. These point mutations have been identified in extracellular (25Paschke R. Ludgate M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), transmembrane domain (21Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the corresponding G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast to this precedent, it is of note that three amino acids act in concert to confer constitutive activity to the Mastomys CCK-BR. Two of these residues (Leu344, Ile353) are located in transmembrane domain VI of the Mastomys CCK-BR, consistent with reports indicating a role of TMD VI in receptor activation. Studies with the photoreceptor rhodopsin, another member of the seven transmembrane domain receptor superfamily, suggest that movement of TMD VI is required for G protein activation (31Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). In addition, rotation of TMD VI has been demonstrated with either ligand or mutation-induced activation of the β2 adrenergic receptor (32Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Complementing these prior observations, the occurrence of activating polymorphisms in TMD VI of the CCK-BR further illustrates that this portion of the protein may be an important regulator of receptor-mediated signaling. The third activating polymorphism in the Mastomys CCK-BR (Asp407 versus Glu403 in the human receptor) is found in the carboxyl terminus. This region of G protein-coupled receptors has been hypothesized to play a role in constraining the protein through palmitoylated cysteine residues that are believed to be anchored in the cell membrane. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus can result in constitutive activity as shown for the PGE3 receptor (24Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (34Matus-Leibovitch N. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1041-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Alternately, deletion or truncation of the carboxyl terminus may leave the signaling properties of a G protein-coupled receptor unchanged (35Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The variable consequences of carboxyl-terminal truncations may indicate that this domain may act in concert with other regions of the receptor to define the basal level of signaling. Consistent with this possibility, our results suggest that a combination of transmembrane domain VI and carboxyl terminus amino acids together confer constitutive activity to the Mastomys CCK-BR. Several naturally occurring constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors, each the result of single amino acid mutations, cause alterations of physiologic function both in animals as well as in humans. Constitutively active melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor isoforms result in darkening of fur and skin color in mice (26Robbins L.S. Nadeau J.H. Johnson K.R. Kelly M.A. Roselli-Rehfuss L. Baack E. Mountjoy K.G. Cone R.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Activating mutations in the luteinizing hormone receptor lead to precocious puberty (21Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), whereas constitutively active parathyroid hormone receptors result in Jansen-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (29Schipani E. Kruse K. Juppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Constitutively active mutants of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor have been identified in patients with thyroid adenomas (20Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In contrast to constitutively active receptors that arise from single point mutations (discussed above), ligand-independent signaling by theMastomys CCK-BR results from a triple amino acid alteration. The observation that multiple naturally occurring residue changes can lead to constitutive receptor activity introduces a new consideration in the search for receptor abnormalities underlying physiologic alterations. In the case of the Mastomys CCK-BR, thein vivo consequences of receptor overactivity remain to be determined. Based on precedent with constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors resulting in tumor formation (20Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 36Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The multifunctional, virally encoded reverse transcriptase can perform all the DNA synthesis steps required in the general model of retroviral replication (1Arts E.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 339-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this model, (+)-strand synthesis is initiated from a single RNA polypurine tract primer derived from a location near the 3′-end of the viral genome (3′-PPT).1 However, in many retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS, there is also a perfect copy of the polypurine tract sequence present in a central position (cPPT) (2Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway S.R. Pearson M.R. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.A. Ghrayeb J.

Cell. 1985; 42: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The polypurine tract is believed to resist reverse transcriptase-directed RNase H action and to carry out a priming function because its sequence imparts a structure more like a DNA-DNA helix than an RNA-DNA helix (5Fedoroff O. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Having the same sequence as the 3′-PPT, the cPPT should be a second site for (+)-strand initiation (6Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Arch. Virol. 1991; 116: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Charneau P. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a step called the second strand transfer, the 3′-PPT-initiated segment is extended from upstream of the cPPT segment. This upstream segment displaces the downstream strand 88–98 nucleotides and then terminates, with reverse transcriptase dissociation mediated via a cis-acting central termination sequence (CTS) (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J.

Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Viral DNA with this overlap structure is capable of integration, but it is not found following transport to the nucleus, suggesting that it is rapidly repaired by normal cellular mechanisms (12Miller M.D. Wang B. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3938-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of either the cPPT or the CTS (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Virology. 1992; 190: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) profoundly impairs HIV replication and infectivity, even when the overlaid amino acid sequence is preserved. Thus, central initiation and termination, and presumably repair of the overlap, are critical steps in the HIV life cycle, yet reverse transcriptase lacks the DNA cleavage activity necessary to perform this repair (1Arts E.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 339-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As expected, we failed to observe specific reverse transcriptase-directed cleavage of the overlap substrate (data not shown). The retroviral integrase, a component of the preintegration complex, is another virus-encoded protein that might repair the overlap. It has been shown to cleave single stranded flap structures (13Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity is mediated through a one-step transesterification reaction and is referred to as a “DNA splicing” activity because of its similarity to RNA splicing. Although integrase activity has been observed with single-stranded flaps that mimic the terminal HIV-1 LTR sequences, there are no reported data that this enzyme can cleave the flaps generated during the central termination process. Host enzymes have been shown to play a role in HIV infection; but often these factors have not been specifically identified, and none have been shown to participate in the replication process (15Dalgleish A.G.

For example, cellular RNase H cannot substitute for reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H (18Repaske R. Hartley J.W. Kavlick M.F. O'Neill R.R. Austin J.B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the cellular factors involved in central (+)-strand processing might guide new therapeutic efforts. FEN1 (flap endonuclease-1) is a likely candidate to process the overlap region because of its substrate specificity. As reviewed by Bambara et al. (19Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), FEN1 removes initiator RNA from Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis in human cells. It may also participate in DNA repair because it can traverse and remove adducts and abasic sites (20Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

FEN1 has both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities and can cleave both RNA and DNA (23Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To make an endonucleolytic cut, it must recognize the 5′-end of an unannealed tail, apparently sliding along the single strand to the point of cleavage, near the position of annealing (20Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The enzyme also often requires an upstream primer immediately adjacent to the site of cleavage (23Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV overlap region has all of these structural characteristics. Since FEN1 is essential (29Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it will be difficult to study the effect of mutations or knockouts on HIV replication due to an overlying effect on cell viability. We therefore chose to first study the role of FEN1 in HIV replication in vitro, with the expectation that the resulting information would indicate the potential value of further analysis in vivo. Although the HIV overlap has many of the structural characteristics required by FEN1, its sequence suggests the presence of at least two stem loops. It was unclear whether FEN1 could traverse these stem loops because it is inhibited by primers that anneal to form double-stranded regions on the tail flap (20Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Additionally, the region clearly has an atypical structure since it promotes dissociation of the reverse transcriptase at the CTS after the limited displacement synthesis that creates the overlap. The overlap region contains several oligo(dA) tracts, which, along with the stem-loop structures, could create bends in the DNA, resulting in a unique structure (11Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This structure might generally exclude protein-DNA interactions, including binding of FEN1. In this study, the ability of FEN1 to process the HIV overlap was examined using a substrate that models the replication intermediate that would occur following central termination. We provide biochemical evidence that the human DNA replication enzyme FEN1 removes the overlap created by synthesis from both the 3′-PPT and the cPPT. Unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and radiolabeled nucleotides (3000 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). T4 polynucleotide kinase and Sequenase (Version 2.0) were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal phosphatase, RNase inhibitor, and snake venom phosphodiesterase were from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant human FEN1 was purified as described (21Barnes C.J. Wahl A.F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The final preparation was >95% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The final specific activity was 65,000 units/mg, with 1 unit defined as the amount of nuclease required to exonucleolytically cleave 4000 fmol of a linear oligonucleotide substrate with a DNA primer annealed to a longer DNA template in 30 min at 37 °C. HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC) was chemically synthesized by the Louisiana State University Medical Core Center Laboratories. The sequence of mature NC was that of the first 55 amino acids of the NC precursor protein described previously (31Kahn R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, we have compared this synthesized NC to biologically expressed NC obtained from Enzyco (Denver, CO). The peptide was kept under reducing conditions, and aliquots were stored in 10% 2-mercaptoethanol at −70 °C. Recombinant human replication protein A (RPA) was purified as described (32Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase ε (33Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24156-24162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described. The ligase preparation had a final specific activity of 5,000,000 units/mg, with 1 unit defined as the amount of protein that ligates 20 fmol of linear nicked oligonucleotide substrate in 5 min at 37 °C. The final specific activity of polymerase ε was 40,000 units/mg, with 1 unit defined as the amount of protein that incorporates 1 pmol of [3H]dTTP in 15 min at 37 °C. The HIV overlap substrate was made from the following oligomers: template 1, 3′-AGCGGTCCCAAAAGGGACAGTCCTGGCCCAAATAATGTCCCTGTCGTCTTTAGGA; upstream primer 1, 5′-TCGCCAGGGTTTTCCCTGTCAGGAC; downstream primer 1a, 5′-ATTGGGGGGTACAGTGCAGGGGAAAGAATAGTAGACATAATAGCAACAGACATACAAACTAAAGAATTACAAAACAAATTACAAAAA; and downstream primer 1b, 5′-TTCAAAATTTT CGGGTTTATTACAGGGACAGCAGAAATCC. Downstream primers 1a and 1b were 5′-phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP. Downstream primer 1b was radiolabeled by addition of a single nucleotide at the 3′ terminus using [α-32P]dTTP, template 1, and Sequenase (Version 2.0) and isolated via 12% denaturing gel. Downstream primer 1a was ligated to downstream primer 1b, producing downstream primer 1, which has the (+)-strand sequence from nucleotides 4380 to 4507 of the HIV provirus (2Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway S.R. Pearson M.R. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.A. Ghrayeb J. Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Staal W.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Bulk ligation was done by T4 DNA ligase using linker template 2 (3′-AATGTTTTGTTTAATGTTTTTAAGTTTTAAAAGCCCAAATA) in 60 mm BisTris (pH 7.0), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 20 pmol of each oligomer, and 10 units of enzyme in a final volume of 250 μl at 37 °C overnight. Ligated downstream primer 1 was isolated via 5% denaturing gel. The complete overlapping HIV substrate was constructed by annealing upstream primer 1 and downstream primer 1 to template 1. Upstream primer 1 fully anneals to template 1 and forms a nick with the first annealed nucleotide of downstream primer 1. The underlined sequence of downstream primer 1 above represents the region annealed to template 1, whereas the remainder forms a 5′-unannealed tail. Boldface nucleotides signify areas in the tail that could anneal to each other to form stable secondary structure. The unannealed flap is 98 nucleotides long, representing the distance from the cPPT to the major site of termination in the center of the genome. Pause sites prior to the 98-nucleotide site, particularly one at 88 nucleotides, are relatively easily overrun, suggesting that they simply reduce enzyme efficiency as it approaches the final stop site (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J.

Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the event reverse transcriptase ever did dissociate after forming a shorter tail, which would have even less secondary structure, FEN1 could still act since it can navigate the entire 98-nucleotide tail. Following DNA initiation, the cPPT is expected to be removed quickly by RNase H action (1Arts E.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 339-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), so we have not included it in our substrate. However, since FEN1 can traverse RNA (28Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), its presence should not affect cleavage. Assays of cleavage by FEN1 were performed under the same conditions as described for bulk ligation except with no ATP, using 10 fmol of substrate in a volume of 25 μl/reaction. Reactions were initiated by addition of 15 ng of FEN1/reaction and stopped at the appropriate times with an equal volume of 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.01% (w/v) each xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Zero time controls were removed from the mixture before addition of enzyme. Products were separated by 7 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide (denaturing) gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Blocking, upstream, and other primers were annealed as appropriate. Adjustments are as noted in the figure legends. Quantification was done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Snake venom phosphodiesterase ladders of unrelated DNA and comigration with related and unrelated DNAs of known size were used as size markers. Reconstitution assays were performed using standard conditions with addition of 10 mm ATP to act as cofactor for DNA ligase I. Zero, ligase, and polymerase controls were removed from the mixture before addition of FEN1. Total incubation at 37 °C was for 90 min. Incubation was for 30 min after each addition, as appropriate, of FEN1, polymerase ε and dNTPs, and DNA ligase I. Since the structure of the HIV central overlap is similar to the preferred substrates of FEN1, we hypothesized that this cellular DNA replication enzyme might function in viral overlap processing. However, we wondered whether FEN1 action might be inhibited since the enzyme had not previously been observed to traverse such a long tail containing stem loops and other secondary structure. Surprisingly, incubation of the HIV substrate with FEN1 produced highly efficient cleavage at the expected location near the junction of the single-stranded overlap with the template (Fig. 1 A). Although cleavage rates vary substantially depending on the particular substrate used, the cleavage rate of the HIV substrate was similar to that of other non-HIV sequence endonucleolytic substrates (data not shown). As with other endonucleolytic substrates, the overlap was removed as an intact segment. No intermediate products were observed between starting material and final product at any time point, including points under a minute (lanes 2–5). Lane M is shown here to illustrate that the main cleavage product of FEN1 on this substrate comigrates with a chemically synthesized 29-mer, representing the 3′-most 29 annealed nucleotides of the downstream primer. Annealing of a complementary primer to the HIV tail inhibited cleavage, whereas addition of a noncomplementary primer did not (data not shown). Evidently, the natural foldback is not a sufficiently stable double-stranded region to inhibit cleavage. Since FEN1 had not previously been shown to cleave substrates with stem loops, we wished to verify that significant secondary structure is indeed present in the HIV overlap. To do so, we first analyzed the effect of increasing salt concentrations on cleavage activity. As salt is increased, annealed regions should hybridize more tightly, making it more difficult for FEN1 to access the cleavage site. Fig. 1 Bshows that increasing salt concentrations progressively inhibit cleavage. Increased salt will, however, inhibit the enzyme directly by disrupting catalysis. With the HIV substrate, the observed inhibition is therefore likely due to a combination of effects on the enzyme directly and on the stems. To provide more direct evidence for flap secondary structure, we added oligomer a to the HIV substrate in order to favor FEN1 cleavage at one of the anticipated flap stem loops. The substrate depiction shown to the right of the 64-nucleotide band in Fig. 1 Cdemonstrates how a stem-loop structure can form the downstream double-stranded region of a flap substrate. For cleavage, FEN1 often requires an upstream primer, directly adjacent to the flap. We hypothesized that if a stem loop were present, adding the appropriate oligonucleotide would promote upstream primer-dependent cleavage. If no stem loop were present, the primer might act as a block for cleavage at the original flap annealing point, but it would be unlikely to produce cleavage on the single strand. Fig. 1 Cshows that adding the appropriate primer does promote cleavage at the expected location at the base of the proposed stem loop. Under the conditions used in this experiment, the primer did not entirely prevent cleavage at the original flap. It did, however, significantly inhibit this cleavage compared with that seen in the same experiment with no oligomer a added (compare lanes 2 and 3 withlanes 5 and 6). While serving as an upstream primer for one of the natural stems, oligomer a anneals over the other stem. This result is significant because it shows that FEN1 can be inhibited by a double strand on the flap, but the natural HIV double strand in the same location is not sufficient for extensive inhibition. In this experiment, cleavage occurred at an unexpected site near the 5′-end of the tail. Presumably, an internal sequence of the primer, probably one of the dT runs, can transiently anneal to a complementary dA tract at this location on the overlap. Such annealing could create another flap structure, as depicted. Evidently allowing upstream primer-independent cleavage, this structure produced an additional unanticipated product. The observation that FEN1 can bypass stem loops has implications for its role in Okazaki fragment processing and base excision repair. We wanted to know whether it could cleave a substrate with a stem loop both different and more stable than that in the natural HIV substrate. Fig. 1 D demonstrates that FEN1 can cleave a substrate in which the HIV overlap downstream primer has been replaced by a downstream primer with a 10-nucleotide fully complementary stem in the tail. This result supports the general ability of FEN1 to cleave substrates with flap foldbacks, but clearly much more work would be required to determine how the size, sequence, and flap location of such structures might affect cleavage. Our intention here is to focus on the suitability of the HIV substrate. We decided to explore the influence of other factors that might affect FEN1 cleavage of the HIV overlap. We hypothesized that human RPA and viral NC play a role. Both proteins have single-stranded binding and strand melting activities (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 36Tsuchihashi Z. Brown P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By binding the overlap, they might interfere with movement of the nuclease to the cleavage point. Alternatively, they might melt any existing secondary structure or otherwise promote cleavage. Fig. 2 A illustrates the influence of NC. PhosphorImager quantitation suggested that NC is neutral to slightly stimulatory up to 50% coating of substrate (lane 5), but very inhibitory by 100% coverage (lane 6). Results of three to six experiments indicated that percent cleavage was 31.7 ± 4.5% with no NC (lane 2) and 34.7 ± 2.2% at 25% coating (lane 4). By 100% coating (lane 6), cleavage fell to 13.2 ± 2.6%. Not surprisingly, NC is neutral or may even stimulate cleavage when present at low levels that can melt secondary structure. The inhibition observed at high levels is also not surprising. Protein-DNA aggregation at high concentrations has been previously observed for Escherichia coli single-strand binding protein (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) and could explain the inhibition of cleavage. RPA behaved similarly, being neutral to slightly stimulatory at low concentrations, but inhibitory at higher concentrations (Fig. 2 B). Percent cleavage was 31.7 ± 4.5% with no RPA (lane 2) and 43.4 ± 4.3% at 0.78% coverage (lane 4) and declined from there. At high concentrations, RPA destroyed the endonucleolytic substrate by completely unannealing the downstream primer from the template, a phenomenon that we have previously observed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using oligomer substrates (data not shown). Unannealing should not be a problem in vivo because the full-length provirus or integrated viral DNA would be too long for RPA to dissociate. Moreover, the normal cellular activities of FEN1 are carried out in the presence of RPA, implying that these molecules are adapted to each other. Overall, there is no evidence that either binding protein would have a major effect on the cleavage reaction in vivo. To demonstrate that FEN1 can participate in HIV metabolism, we reconstituted overlap repair to make completely double-stranded DNA. After cleavage to remove a tail, FEN1 typically leaves a nick or gap between remaining upstream and downstream primers (20Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). During normal Okazaki fragment processing or DNA repair, a polymerase would be expected to fill the gap, and a ligase would seal the primers together (28Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We surmised that completion of HIV replication would occur the same way. In Fig. 3 A, we used mammalian DNA polymerase ε and human DNA ligase I to perform these functions because both participate in DNA replication and cooperate with FEN1 (19Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 37Montecucco A. Savini E. Weighardt F. Rossi R. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A.

A. 1992; 89: 9377-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We note, however, that any one or more of at least three human polymerases and three ligases (35Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) may be involved. With the HIV substrate, FEN1 made no nicked product, but rather left mainly a one-nucleotide gap and some two-nucleotide gaps. For this reason, in lane 6, FEN1 was able to cleave the substrate, but despite the presence of DNA ligase, no ligation product appeared. Lane 8 shows that when polymerase and dCTP were added to fill in the one-nucleotide gap, ligation could occur. The next six nucleotides to be added were three dGs followed by three dTs. When dC and dG were incorporated, ligation efficiency was similar (compare lanes 8 and 9). However, FEN1 was able to cleave the tail displaced by addition of the dGs, so a new, shorter product appeared as well. When dT could also be incorporated, there was very little ligation (lane 10). FEN1 cleavage efficiency is sequence-dependent and can be either upstream primer-dependent or -inhibited. A reasonable explanation for the result in lane 10 is that the dTs extend the upstream primer to a site at which cleavage is either inefficient or upstream primer-inhibited. If FEN1 cannot cleave the tail at this site, a ligatable substrate is not formed. In vivo, ligation could occur immediately after addition of dC, with no additional strand displacement or FEN1 cleavage, or later at another cleavable site. Overall, the results presented here provide evidence that FEN1 plays an important role in HIV replication by removing the cPPT-initiated overlap and that a human DNA polymerase and ligase are involved as well. Since the central processing steps of HIV replication are critical in the viral life cycle (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Virology. 1992; 190: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but often overlooked, we feel that more focused exploration could produce new therapeutic possibilities. Generally, the structure of the HIV overlap flap is consistent with the preferred FEN1 substrate. The sequence of the tested substrate was identical to that of HIV-1, except that we changed the sequence of the upstream primer-template so that the template was not complementary to the flap. In vivo, annealing of the upstream primer and the overlapping downstream flap would be in equilibrium. We have shown previously that FEN1 can cleave 5′-flaps equilibrating in this manner because the upstream primer also promotes displacement of the downstream flap (27Huang L. Rumbaugh J.A. Murante R.S. Lin R.J.R. Rust L. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9266-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In fact, the strand displacement process may promote 5′-tail formation over a 3′-tail because the polymerase binds the 3′-end of the upstream primer. The presence or lack of upstream template complementarity should not influence cleavage at the base of the tail (28Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Many host proteins have been shown previously to play a role in HIV infection (15Dalgleish A.G.

Nature. 1995; 376: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but this is the first time a cellular enzyme has been identified with a substrate specificity appropriate for direct participation in HIV replication. In Fig. 3 B, we present a model of the steps of HIV replication likely to involve human enzymes. The presence of two (+)-strand initiation sites is believed to increase replication efficiency by allowing simultaneous synthesis of two segments, each approximately half the total (+)-strand length (6Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Arch. Virol. 1991; 116: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,7Charneau P. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the overlap serves any other function, but the strong replication advantage shown with the wild-type cPPT and CTS suggests that it may (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J.

Since the overlap is removed as an intact segment by FEN1 (Fig. 1 A), it may survive to perform other functions. For example, it may promote (+)-strand recombination by a mechanism similar to that described previously (39Junghans R.P. Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 544-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fuentes G.M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29605-29611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the released overlap would simply be degraded. We note that FEN1 is a member of a family of enzymes, with other members that might be able to remove the overlap. In particular, XPG, a nucleotide excision repair nuclease, may substitute for FEN1, a possibility requiring further study. FEN1-directed cleavage is more likely since XPG, although capable of cleaving flaps, acts in concert with the nucleotide excision repair complex of proteins. It cleaves on the 3′-side of a damaged nucleotide where the single-stranded portion of a bubble structure reanneals (41O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The possibility that retroviral integrase can cleave central termination region flaps also remains to be investigated. Previous examination of the disintegration reaction catalyzed by the HIV-1 integrase has shown that single-stranded tail structures with the HIV terminal LTR sequence at the annealing point can serve as substrates for flap cleavage (13Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, integration intermediates with single-stranded flaps are cleaved at a lower efficiency than the corresponding native double-stranded structure. Additionally, alteration of the conserved 3′-CA nucleotides at the base of the flap lowered cleavage efficiency even further. At this point, the high activity of FEN1 in the nucleus, its structure specificity, and its low sequence specificity make it a very strong candidate for this reaction. For the gap-filling step, we propose a human DNA polymerase, rather than reverse transcriptase itself, because overlap repair would presumably occur after integration, certainly after nuclear entry, as part of normal chromosomal repair mechanisms. Additionally, reverse transcriptase dissociates at the CTS (8Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 9Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B.

We have chosen to use polymerase ε in this work because it is known to cooperate with FEN1 (38Siegal G. Turchi J.J. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9377-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and probably with DNA ligase I (37Montecucco A. Savini E. Weighardt F. Rossi R. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5379-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We recognize, however, that other polymerases might substitute. Polymerase β, in particular, might be ideally suited to the role since it appears designed to fill very short gaps (42Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although our results suggest that polymerase ε can perform the function, we have not ruled out the possibility that any of the other human polymerases might participate in vivo. Even though there clearly is secondary structure in the overlap flap (Fig. 1, B–D), it does not interfere with FEN1-directed cleavage (Fig. 1 A). Although previous results have shown that primers annealed to a flap are inhibitory (20Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), FEN1 may more readily traverse a double-stranded region if it is in the form of a foldback. Alternatively, the stability of the HIV foldbacks may simply not have been sufficiently great to interfere with tracking, binding, and cleavage by FEN1. Deletion of the yeast homolog of FEN1 caused an increase in expansion frequency of trinucleotide repeats, the hallmark of several human genetic diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, several ataxias, and fragile X syndrome (43Freudenreich C.H. Kantrow S.M. Zakian V.A. Science. 1998; 279: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). FEN1 mutation may also correlate with increased risk for colorectal cancer (44Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 45Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D.

This study suggests a mechanism by which FEN1 can play a role in another human disease, AIDS. Knowledge of this mechanism may eventually provide a new target for antiviral therapy. Such therapy would be complicated because FEN1 is essential for normal cellular DNA replication. Since the cPPT-initiated overlap is very specifically defined, starting and ending at precise genomic locations, we envision approaching the problem with antisense technology. Targeting oligonucleotides to certain regions on or near the overlap might prevent binding or cleaving of the HIV substrate, without significantly inhibiting FEN1 action on normal cellular substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2147476965,"When C/EBPα was discovered by Steven McKnight and his colleagues (1Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.T. Adashi E.Y. Groves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 2: 786-800Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar), it was the first of what is now known as the leucine zipper family of transcription factors. There is currently a large and growing list of isoforms of C/EBP that have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes in virtually every mammalian tissue. In 1989, McKnight etal. (2McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Glueckshon-Waelch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) predicted, on the basis of very fragmentary evidence, that C/EBP was a “central regulator of energy metabolism.” The extent to which this prediction has been proven to be true will become apparent in several of the articles in this minireview series. C/EBP is a prototype of a “modular” transcription factor with an activation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization domain. There are currently six members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, some with several isoforms. These are reviewed in detail in the minireview by Lekstrom-Himes and Xanthopoulos (3Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) in this series. Because the various C/EBP isoforms are capable of dimerization, the possibility of an interaction between family members is greatly increased. C/EBP can also be covalently modified by phosphorylation; it is a target for both protein kinase A and protein kinase C and can bind to coactivator molecules such as CBP (CREB-binding protein) to control the level of transcription of a target gene. With this degree of molecular versatility, it is not surprising that C/EBP has the ability to regulate the expression of genes with seemingly unrelated biological function, i.e. genes whose transcription can be activated by a diverse set of signals. The ability to delete genes coding for individual C/EBP isoforms in the mouse has led to a better understanding of the scope of the biological response of C/EBP. Members of the C/EBP family control the transcription of genes involved in a broad range of physiological processes, ranging from the acute phase response to the control of glucose homeostasis. As an example, the transcription of genes that code for proteins involved in opposing metabolic pathways is often controlled by C/EBP. Therefore, the control of any individual gene requires a coordination between the action of C/EBP and that of other transcription factors to explain the pleiotropic nature of the biological effects of C/EBP. Considering the importance of C/EBP in the regulation of gene expression, it seemed timely to organize a comprehensive review of the C/EBP isoforms. This series contains five separate, in-depth reviews on specific aspects of the biological roles of C/EBP. The lead-off article by Julie Lekstrom-Himes and Kleanthis G. Xanthopoulos, entitled “Biological Role of the CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Protein Family of Transcription Factors,” provides a general overview of the biology of the C/EBP isoforms and sets the stage for the latter articles in this series that will focus on more narrow aspects of the action of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. The review by Valeria Poli on “The Role of C/EBP Isoforms in the Control of Inflammatory and Native Immunity Functions” describes the many functions of C/EBP in controlling transcription of a broad variety of genes of the liver and in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage that are involved in the inflammatory response. The role of C/EBP isoforms in the action of cytokines is reviewed and integrated with the current knowledge of signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of specific C/EBP isoforms. One of the earliest functions assigned to C/EBPα was its role in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipose tissue. As our knowledge of the complexity of the C/EBP family of transcription factors expands, studies on the function of individual isoforms of C/EBP have provided insight into the complex series of interactions between transcription factors that forms the mechanistic basis for adipocyte differentiation. Gretchen J. Darlington, Sarah E. Ross, and Ormond A. MacDougald present a review of “The Role of C/EBP Genes in Adipocyte Differentiation and Function” that details the functional interactions of the various C/EBP isoforms in preadipocyte differentiation and their role in modulating the expression of specific genes in the fully differentiated adipocyte. The minireview by Anna Mae Diehl entitled “Roles of CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Proteins in the Regulation of Liver Regenerative Growth” outlines the most recent information on the role of C/EBP isoforms in the regenerative response of the liver to injury and the involvement of hepatocyte mitogens and co-mitogens in this process. Factors that link this process to cell cycle regulation during liver regeneration are also discussed in this review. Colleen Croniger, Patrick Leahy, Lea Reshef, and Richard W. Hanson are co-authors of the final review in the series, which is entitled “C/EBP and the Control of Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Gene Transcription in the Liver.” C/EBPα and C/EBPβ have been implicated in the dietary and hormonal control of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription, most notably in the cAMP induction of transcription that occurs in diabetes and during starvation. This minireview stresses the interaction of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ with other transcription factors that coordinate the level of PEPCK gene expression and links C/EBP to hormonal signals that control the initiation of transcription of the gene for PEPCK in the liver at birth. This review provides support for the predictions of McKnight and colleagues (2McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Glueckshon-Waelch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that C/EBP is a critical regulatory factor in the control of integrated metabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2084083692,"In this study, we have examined the mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent regulation in smooth muscle myosin through the use of structural and kinetic methodologies applied to several myosin fragments. Fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements demonstrate that regulatory light chain phosphorylation significantly reduces the rotational correlation time of regulatable myosin preparations, whereas minimally regulated ones show little effect in this assay. Sedimentation equilibrium studies show that the regulatory domain can dimerize with a dissociation constant that is unaffected by regulatory light chain phosphorylation. Finally, kinetic studies on the interactions of myosin-ADP constructs with actin are also consistent with a model in which interactions occur between the two heads, which are lost with regulatory light chain phosphorylation. We propose that in the absence of regulatory light chain phosphorylation, the two heads of myosin interact with each other, due to a weak intrinsic dimerization of the regulatory domains that is significantly stabilized by the proximal rod.

Although myosin II isoforms from skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle and from non-muscle sources are all characterized by common structural features, they differ from each other in several important respects. One of these is in the mechanism of calcium-dependent regulation. Myosin II from smooth muscle and non-muscle sources is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 19 on the regulatory light chain (RLC)1 (1Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trybus K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation by the calcium-dependent enzyme myosin light chain kinase enables the myosin to interact with actin in a force-productive manner, activates the myosin MgATPase, and induces myosin II to unfold and form filaments under physiologic conditions (7Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallographic model of the myosin II head demonstrates that it consists of two domains as follows: the amino-terminal “catalytic” domain that contains the nucleotide and actin-binding sites, and the carboxyl-terminal “regulatory” domain, which contains the ELC and RLC. The RLC is located at the extreme carboxyl-terminal end of this domain (8Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). Thus, the crystallographic model does not provide a ready explanation of how phosphorylation of the RLC alters the behavior of the catalytic and actin-binding sites, located over 80–100 Å away. One possible explanation, supported by crystallographic studies of the regulatory domain from scallop myosin, is that phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in the RLC are communicated to the motor domain by the more amino-terminal ELC (9Xle X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, this is not supported by more recent studies of recombinant smooth muscle myosins lacking the ELC, which demonstrated that although the ELC is necessary for efficient chemo-mechanical transduction, its presence is not necessary for regulation (10Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Katoh T. Mortia F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative mechanism. 1) Regulation requires two heads. Single-headed soluble fragments (S-1) or single-headed myosins are unregulated (e.g. are fully active regardless of the state of phosphorylation of the RLC), whereas double-headed fragments (HMM) are fully regulated (12Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Sata M. Matsu-ura M. Ikebe M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 233: 123-131Google Scholar). 2) Regulation requires specific sequences in the carboxyl-terminal half of the RLC. Substitution with skeletal myosin RLC produces a myosin II hybrid that is locked in an off-state, suggesting that phosphorylation actively disinhibits myosin II (15Ikebe M. Reardon S. Mitani Y.

Recombinant HMMs that lack a minimum length of tail (>15 heptads) are not completely inhibited when unphosphorylated, even under conditions where they are guaranteed to be dimeric. Furthermore, the degree of regulation increases with increasing tail length, approaching that for conventional HMM when the tail is of the same length as the head (19Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that interactions between the two heads, mediated in some way through the regulatory domain and facilitated by the presence of the proximal portion of the S-2 segment, are a central component of the regulatory process. In this study, we have examined the process of phosphorylation-dependent regulation by both structural and kinetic means. Results of these studies are consistent with a model in interactions between the regulatory domain and the amino-terminal portion of the S-2 segment lead to a coupling of the motor domains that inhibits their interaction with actin. Phosphorylation of the RLC would block this interaction and allow for force generation and actin activation of the myosin MgATPase. The N-methylanthraniloyl derivatives of ADP, 2′-deoxy-ADP, and ATP were synthesized as described (21Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). 1,5 IAEDANS and N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide were obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Protease inhibitors and chemicals used for buffers were obtained from Sigma. Q-Sepharose FF, S-Sepharose FF, Sephacryl S300 HR, and prepoured Sephadex G-25 columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin was obtained from chicken gizzards (23Pereschini A. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit acetone powder as described (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMM and S-1 were prepared by digestion of myosin with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and the column was purified on Sephacryl S300 HR (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The regulatory light chain was phosphorylated as described, using myosin light chain kinase kindly supplied by Dr. J. T. Stull (25Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation status was monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea, as described (26Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The cDNA for chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin was truncated at either the codon corresponding to amino acid 866 (2 heptads of coiled-coil), to create 2HepZip, or following the codon for amino acid 901 (7 heptads of coiled-coil), to create 7HepZip, or at amino acid 1112, to create a HMM-like fragment. In the case of either 2HepZip or 7HepZip, the native coiled-coil (rod) sequence was then followed by an in-register stretch of coiled-coil (32 amino acids) derived from the leucine zipper of GCN4 (19Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A fourth construct called “motorless” was created by removal of the first 787 amino acids of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and placing an initiation methionine codon in front of the codon for amino acid 788. As in the case of the HMM-like construct, the coiled-coil (rod) was truncated at amino acid 1112. This removed the entire motor domain but left both light chain binding domains as well as approximately 37 heptads of native coiled-coil. In the case of all four of these heavy chain constructs, a Flag peptide sequence (27Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar), followed by a stop codon, was appended to the end. The Flag peptide allowed for affinity purification. For the creation of an expressed “regulatory domain,” a fragment of the myosin heavy chain cDNA encoding amino acids 788–873 was used. An initiation methionine, followed by a Flag peptide coding sequence, was placed in front of the coding sequence for the heavy chain fragment, and a stop codon was placed after amino acid 873. The Flag peptide sequence allowed for affinity purification, and it subsequently was removed using enterokinase cleavage (28Liepnieks J.J. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 245: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), followed by a second round of affinity purification to retain uncleaved peptides. All myosin heavy chain constructs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL 1393 (Invitrogen). Generation of the recombinant baculoviruses coding for the myosin heavy chain constructs followed published techniques (29Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555,Google Scholar). Expression of these constructs with the smooth regulatory and essential (LC17a) light chains and subsequent purification of the recombinant myosins followed published procedures (30Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 provides a schematic diagram of the various constructs. To generate labeled RLCs, the chicken gizzard RLC was expressed in Escherichia coli. This expression and purification followed published procedures (31Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was labeled at cysteine 374 withN-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide as described (32Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various recombinant HMM constructs as well as protease-prepared HMM were labeled in the active site with mant ADP as described (31Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of RLC with 1,5-IAEDANS was performed as described previously (31Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exchange of AEDANS-labeled RLC onto a recombinant regulatory domain construct was performed at 40 °C, as described (31Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence measurements were made on an SLM/Aminco 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer, with sample holder thermostated at 20 °C. Fluorescence lifetimes and anisotropies were measured using a picosecond laser as excitation source, as described (33Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in samples that had been equilibrated in 150 mm KCl, 25 mmHepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and ± 0.2 mm beryllium sulfate, and 5 mmNaF. Calculation of the bound mant ADP concentration, utilizing the published extinction coefficient at 356 nm (5800m−1 cm−1, see Ref. 21Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), demonstrated that for proteolytic HMM, recombinant HMM, and 2HepZip, the fractional labeling was 88, 93, and 90%, respectively. Single turnover studies were performed by mixing recombinant HMM (phosphorylated or unphosphorylated) with a 5-fold molar excess of mant ATP, followed by mixing with a 1000-fold excess of ATP. These revealed for both a small amplitude (approximately 5% of the total amplitude) phase with rate of 0.9–2.1 s−1, followed by the main phase with rate of 0.04–0.10 s−1. Measurements of the rates of mant nucleotide binding to and release from HMM, S-1, and recombinant myosin constructs were made using a Hi-Tech Scientific stopped-flow spectrometer equipped with a 150-watt xenon lamp. The instrument dead time was determined to be 1.8 ms. Fluorescence was excited using a 295-nm input from a monochrometer, and a 400-nm cut-off filter was used to measure the fluorescence emission at a right angle from the incident beam. Data were fit to a sum of exponentials. For studies using pyrene actin fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and a 405-nm interference filter was used to collect the fluorescence emission (Omega Optical). The dependence of rate constant on actin concentration was fit to a series of rectangular hyperbolas using a curve fitting procedure (Delta Graph Pro3) to get initial estimates of maximum rate and apparent affinity. Final fitting was performed with the NLIN procedure on PC SAS version 6.12. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on a Beckman XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge using a four-cell An-60-Ti rotor. The three cells were loaded with 34.0, 11.3, and 3.8 μm regulatory domain, consisting of the ELC and RLC complexed to residues 788–873 from the heavy chain. The partial specific volume of the regulatory domain was calculated from the amino acid composition (34Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura Y. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by the method of Cohn and Edsall (35McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. 2. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar) and found to be 0.729 ml g−1. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 20 °C, and data were gathered at 280 nm. Equilibrium was considered to be reached when two data sets taken every 2 h were superimposable with a root mean square difference within 0.01 absorbance units with no observable systematic deviation. The buffer used contained 150 mm KCl, 25 mmHepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT at pH 7.50. Data were taken in absorbance units at 280 nm as a function of radial distance every 0.01 mm. Equilibrium was achieved under these conditions within 36 h. The data analysis software package of the XL-A allows for a global nonlinear regression of the data obtained from the three centrifuge cells to estimate the monomeric molecular weight and the self-association constant(s). The behavior of the regulatory domain was chosen from the best-fit analysis of the data to each of the following models: ideal non-associating monomer, monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, monomer-tetramer, monomer-dimer-trimer, and monomer-dimer-tetramer association. The final model was chosen such that 1) the estimated monomer molecular weight was closest to that predicted from the amino acid sequence, 2) the value of the “goodness of fit,” defined as shown in Equation 1.(degrees of freedom)−1Σ(residual/s.e.)2(Eq. 1) was the smallest, and 3) the distribution of error was random about a zero mean (35McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. 2. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar). Proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as described (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined colorimetrically (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Our previous studies (31Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that addition of beryllium fluoride to complexes of S-1 or HMM with mant ADP significantly shortened the rotational correlation times. This suggests that formation of a pre-hydrolytic state, mimicked by the complex myosin-mant ADP-beryllium fluoride, is associated with assumption of either a more compact configuration or greater segmental flexibility (Table I). In this study, we have examined the effect of RLC phosphorylation on the anisotropy decays of fluorescently labeled HMM, S-1, and of two recombinant constructs containing shorter tail segments–2HepZip and 7HepZip (19Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These latter two constructs consist of the motor domain, the regulatory domain, and either two or seven heptads of the S-2 segment, followed by a leucine zipper sequence (Fig. 1). The 2HepZip construct shows minimal regulation (less than a 2-fold change in actin-activated activity upon phosphorylation), and the 7HepZip construct shows partial regulation (approximately a 5-fold increase in actin-activated activity upon phosphorylation, Fig. 3 of Ref. 19Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Anisotropy decay studies of these preparations, labeled in the active site with mant ADP ± beryllium fluoride could be fit to decays characterized by a long rotational correlation time, reflecting global motions of the protein, and a short correlation time (0.5–2.5 ns), reflecting local probe motions. Several observations are evident on examining the data summarized in Table I. First, phosphorylation reduces the rotational correlation times for proteolytic and recombinant HMM and 7HepZip when the active site is labeled with mant ADP + beryllium fluoride to a statistically significant degree (p < 0.01) but not when it is labeled with mant ADP. Second, the correlation times for maximally regulated HMM preparations (proteolytic and recombinant) are significantly greater than for moderately or minimally regulated HMM (7HepZip and 2HepZip) in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. Third, phosphorylation reduces the correlation times of maximally regulated HMM preparations to values similar to those for unphosphorylated 7HepZip and 2HepZip HMM. These results suggest that in the absence of RLC phosphorylation, the two heads of maximally regulated HMM preparations are less mobile, as might be expected if the heads interact with each other.Table ITransient fluorescent measurements of labeled native and recombinant myosin fragmentsSampleFluorescent probeRLC phos.A(0)τ (ns)φ (ns)Proteolytic HMMMant ADP−0.359.5 ± 0.05369 ± 17Proteolytic HMMMant ADP+0.359.3 ± 0.05386 ± 21Proteolytic HMMMant ADP + BeF−0.359.3 ± 0.05261 ± 21Proteolytic HMMMant ADP + BeF+0.359.3 ± 0.05160 ± 4Recombinant HMMMant ADP + BeF−0.278.8 ± 0.01244 ± 12Recombinant HMMMant ADP + BeF+0.278.8 ± 0.02194 ± 87HepZipMant ADP + BeF−0.268.7 ± 0.01178 ± 97HepZipMant ADP + BeF+0.259.7 ± 0.03143 ± 52HepZipMant ADP + BeF−0.288.9 ± 0.02149 ± 62HepZipMant ADP + BeF+0.258.6 ± 0.01137 ± 5S-11-aFrom ref. 31.Mant ADP + BeF−0.369.1 ± 0.02140 ± 5MotorlessAEDANS-RLC−0.2016.3 ± 0.04214 ± 144.2 ± 0.13MotorlessAEDANS-RLC+0.2016.2 ± 0.03155 ± 93.3 ± 0.07Conditions are as follows: 20–50 μm myosin fragment:mant nucleotide in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.50, 20 °C.

Xing J. Rener B. Lebowitz J. Kar S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30187-30194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the rotational correlation time of mant ADP-labeled myosin preparations varied with the nature of the ligand in the active site, with longer correlation times observed for ADP-bound states. Thus, comparisons of correlation times to previously reported values need to take into account the state of the myosin preparation. In this regard, the value of the long correlation time for RLC-phosphorylated, mant ADP-labeled proteolytic HMM is remarkably close to that reported for AEDANS-labeled skeletal HMM in the absence of nucleotide (386 ± 20 ns; Ref. 37Highsmith S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, the correlation time of phosphorylated proteolytic HMM·mant ADP·BeF is very similar to that for S-1·mant ADP·BeF (140 ± 5 ns, Table I and reference 31). The results with mant ADP-labeled myosin constructs suggest that RLC phosphorylation increases the segmental flexibility of the motor domains, where the mant probe is located. It is not clear from these results, however, if the presence of the motor domain is necessary for this effect. In order to test this, anisotropy decay studies were performed on a recombinant construct called motorless, consisting of the two regulatory domains and 37 heptads from the proximal S-2 segment (Fig. 1). Recombinant, AEDANS-labeled RLC was exchanged onto motorless, purified from unbound AEDANS-RLC by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 FPLC, and the anisotropy decay of the labeled complex was measured with and without RLC phosphorylation. RLC phosphorylation reduced the long correlation time by 38%, from 214 ± 14 to 155 ± 9 ns (Table I). The data presented above suggest that interactions occur between the two heads of myosin in the dephosphorylated state that reduce the segmental flexibility of the heads and that are disrupted by RLC phosphorylation. In order to further identify the portions of the myosin molecule that may contribute to these interactions, sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed on a recombinant myosin fragment consisting of the ELC and RLC complexed to residues 788–873 from the chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. This complex, referred to as the regulatory domain (Fig. 1), was studied in the ultracentrifuge in the presence and absence of RLC phosphorylation. Since the binding of the RLC and ELC to the recombinant heavy chain segment remains stoichiometric at these concentrations, 2H. L. Sweeney, unpublished data. essentially all of the light chain would remain bound to the heavy chain peptide in this study. This conclusion is also consistent with the measured monomer molecular weight, which closely matches the calculated molecular weight (see below). Fig. 2 presents the absorbance at 280 nm as a function of radial distance for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated regulatory domain. The upper panels in Fig. 2represent the residuals for the fit. The data were found to be adequately described by a monomer-dimer self-associating equilibrium, characterized by a dissociation constant of 7.9 μm for the unphosphorylated sample and 6.0 μm for the phosphorylated sample. Higher orders of association could not be detected in the data. The monomer molecular masses for each fit were 45,354 and 47,220 daltons for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated species, respectively, which are within 4% of the calculated monomer molecular mass of 47,143 daltons. Thus, whereas regulatory domain-regulatory domain interactions may contribute to the structural basis of regulation, other portions of the myosin molecule must modulate this process to provide for phosphorylation-dependent control. The results from fluorescence and sedimentation studies suggest that at least in ATP-like states, regulation is mediated by reversible interactions between the two heads. However, previous work on regulated skeletal muscle actomyosin has indicated that the kinetics of ADP release is also regulated, albeit to a lesser degree (38Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9984-9993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to see if head-head interactions occur in the myosin-ADP state, we have examined the kinetics of binding of the various myosin fragments with pyrenyl-labeled actin in the presence of ADP. Binding of myosin to actin, with the subsequent formation of the “strong” binding state, is associated with quenching of pyrene fluorescence when the pyrenyl probe is attached to cysteine 374 of actin. This has been used in kinetic studies of binding of skeletal S-1·ligand complexes to pyrene-labeled actin (32Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We utilized this quenching to examine the kinetics of binding of the various myosin constructs to actin in the presence of ADP and with actin in large excess over myosin. Proteolytic HMM and S-1, as well as the 2HepZip and 7HepZip constructs in the presence of 40 μm ADP, were mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of pyrene-labeled actin. The dissociation constant of ADP binding to acto-HMM under these conditions is approximately 60 μm (40Greene L.E. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4177-4181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP concentration used in this experiment was thus a compromise between the need to saturate the catalytic site of HMM and the need to prevent substantial rebinding of dissociated ligand to the acto-HMM complex. For S-1, phosphorylated HMM, and unphosphorylated 2HepZip and 7HepZip, binding to pyrenyl-labeled actin was associated with a single exponential process which followed a 3–5-ms lag. A plot of the rate constant of the major exponential process versus actin concentration fit a rectangular hyperbola for each myosin preparation (Fig. 3), defining maximum rates (λmax) and apparent dissociation constants (K d) that are summarized in Table II. By contrast, the fluorescence transient produced by binding of HMM·ADP to pyrene-labeled actin remained biph"

The intensity of the signal is governed by the rates of GTP binding (leading to subunit dissociation) and hydrolysis. Mutants that cannot hydrolyze GTP (e.g.GsαQ227L, Gi2αQ205L) are constitutively activated and can lead to cell transformation and cancer. Here we have used a genetic screen to identify intragenic suppressors of a GTPase-deficient form of the Gα in yeast, Gpa1Q323L. Sequencing revealed second-site mutations in three conserved residues, K54E, R327S, and L353Δ (codon deletion). Each mutation alone results in a complete loss of the βγ-mediated mating response in yeast, indicating a dominant-negative mode of inhibition. Likewise, the corresponding mutations in a mammalian Gi2α (K46E, R209S, L235Δ) lead to inhibition of Gβγ-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation in cultured cells. The most potent of these βγ inhibitors (R209S) has no effect on Gi2α-mediated regulation of adenylyl cyclase. Despite its impaired ability to release βγ, purified recombinant Gpa1R327S is fully competent to bind and hydrolyze GTP.

The actions of many hormones and neurotransmitters are mediated through a cell surface receptor, heterotrimeric “G protein,” and an intracellular effector that propagates the signal. Upon agonist binding to the receptor, Gα undergoes guanine nucleotide exchange and a conformational change leading to dissociation from βγ. The subunits remain in the active state until GTP is hydrolyzed, at which time they reassociate and signaling stops. Not surprisingly, disturbances in the cycle of G protein activation and inactivation can lead to disease. The severe and often fatal diarrhea associated with cholera is caused by the pathogenic exotoxin of Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin) which promotes ADP-ribosylation of Gsα in the gut epithelium. Similarly, whooping cough is caused by a toxin from Bordetella pertusssis and ADP-ribosylation of Giα (1Hewlett E.L. Pediatr. Infect. Dis.

These include both activating and inactivating mutations, which can sometimes lead to cell transformation and cancer (2Spiegel A.M. Weinstein L.S. Shenker A. J. Clin.

Another inherited disorder, known as pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia, is associated with loss-of-function mutations in Gsα (R231H, A366S). Interestingly, Gsα A366S is unstable and inactive at 37 °C but is stable and constitutively active at the slightly lower temperature of the male testis, resulting in a paradoxical combination of pseudohypoparathyroidism and testotoxicosis in affected individuals (6Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). G proteins can transform cells in at least two ways. First, mutations in Gα can lead to direct activation of certain effector enzymes, which promote cell proliferation. However, this mechanism appears to be operative in only a minority of cases (3Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Alternatively, activating mutations in Gα can lead to constitutive dissociation from Gβγ. The ability of βγ subunits to promote cell proliferation occurs through activation of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rac and Ras, which in turn lead to the activation of Jun and mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinases, respectively (3Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). A strikingly similar signaling cascade has been identified through genetic analysis of the mating response pathway in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Haploid yeast cells secrete small peptide pheromones that bind to G protein coupled receptors. The G protein α subunit (GPA1 gene product, Gpa1) does not directly activate any known effector; rather it is βγ (Ste4/Ste18) that activates a signaling cascade that includes a MAP kinase homologue, Fus3. This in turn triggers a coordinated series of events required for mating, including cell fusion, new gene transcription, and cell cycle arrest in G1 (7Hirsch J.P. Cross F.R. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A principal goal of pharmacology is to identify drugs that bypass or otherwise compensate for the molecular defects that lead to disease. One emerging strategy is to use genetics to identify protein binding partners of a dysfunctional gene product because any interacting proteins represent alternative (nonmutated) targets for drug therapy (8Hartwell L.H. Szankasi P. Roberts C.J. Murray A.W. Friend S.H. Science. 1997; 278: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Another approach has been to screen for second-site mutations that compensate for the primary defect in a gene. Genetic suppression of a disease-causing mutant provides strong presumptive evidence that pharmacological suppression can also be achieved (9Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Cell. 1994; 79: 193-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, a strategically designed genetic screen can be used to search for drugs having a similar compensatory effect. If structural information is available, it may even be possible to design drugs that mimic the effect of the second-site suppressor mutations. Past efforts to find second-site suppressors of transforming Ras or G-protein mutants have been unsuccessful (9Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Cell. 1994; 79: 193-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we have exploited the genetic tractability of yeast to identify intragenic suppressors of a GTPase-deficient mutant, Gpa1Q323L. Our goal was to find mutants that are locked in the inactive conformation, in both the absence and presence of GTP. Our expectation was that mutations that block subunit dissociation would inhibit Gβγ signaling in a dominant manner. Significantly, the mutations identified in Gpa1 have similar properties when introduced into mammalian Gα subunits. These findings illustrate the utility of the yeast system to identify G protein mutants with highly selective, and highly potent dominant negative properties. Established methods were used for the growth of bacteria Escherichia coli and the manipulation of plasmids (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Gpa1 and mammalian Gα mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites, Promega) and expressed in plasmids pRS316 and pG1501 (Gpa1).

All polymerase chain reaction amplification products and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing (Keck Biotechnology Facility, Yale University). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were: YDK499 (bar1::hisG, derived from YPH499 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

CHO cells were maintained in minimal essential medium α without nucleotides, containing 10% fetal calf serum, and transfected as described for COS-7. Plate growth inhibition (halo) assays and transcription-induction (β-galactosidase) assays were carried out as described by Dohlman et al. (24Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant Gpa1, time course measurement of [35S]γ-GTPγS binding, and measurements of steady state hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP were performed as described by Apanovitch et al. (16Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation in intact cells was assayed as described (6Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. van Dop C. Bourne H.R.

Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were replated in 24-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well and labeled with [3H]adenine (4 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional 24 h. After pretreatment with pertussis toxin (where indicated, PTX, 200 ng/ml for 4 h), cells were washed with medium and stimulated with the appropriate agonist in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine for 25 min. cAMP and ATP fractions were resolved, and cAMP accumulation was estimated by determining the ratio of cAMP radioactivity to the sum of radioactivity of cAMP and ATP. Inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in intact cells was assayed as described (26Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected in 6-well plates at 7 × 105 cells/well, placed in serum-free medium after 28 h, and assayed after an additional 20 h. After pretreatment with PTX (where indicated, 200 ng/ml for 4 h), cells were stimulated with the appropriate agonist for 8 min. HA-MAPK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (300 μl, representing 4 × 105 cells) with 2 μg of 12CA5 antibody and 35 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry). After washing once with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer, the agarose beads were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer (28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/tube, 700 cpm/pmol, NEN Life Science Products). The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 88% formic acid, and radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was determined by filtration on Whatman P81 membranes (28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our objective here was to identify dominant-negative-type inhibitors of βγ-mediated signaling. Our approach was to screen for intragenic suppressors of a GTPase-deficient allele, gpa1 Q323L. To this end, thegpa1 Q323L mutant was expressed using the galactose-inducible GAL1/10 promoter (plasmid pG1501) in cells lacking GPA1 (gpa1Δ, strain YGS5). The gpa1Δ mutation ordinarily leads to constitutive signaling and cell division arrest; however, YGS5 is viable at 34 °C because of a temperature-sensitive mutation that blocks the signal downstream of βγ (ste11 ts). Cells were initially maintained in galactose medium at 34 °C and then plated and shifted to 24 °C. Rare colonies that grew under these restrictive conditions were picked, patched, and tested for galactose-dependent growth (Fig. 1, top). Plasmids were isolated from 68 independent colonies and tested for retention of the original Q323L substitution (by restriction digestion). Ten plasmids that satisfied these criteria were sequenced across the entireGPA1 open reading frame. As expected, all retained the Q323L mutation, and all contained one additional mutation at a second position. Two of these were codon substitutions (K54E, R327S) and one was a codon deletion (L353Δ). We then examined the properties of each mutant without overexpression, in the absence or presence of the Q323L substitution. Single-site and double-site mutations were prepared and expressed using a low copy plasmid (pRS316) and the normalGPA1 promoter. In this case, single-site mutants were able to complement the gpa1Δ mutation but the Q323L and double-site mutants could not (Fig. 1, and data not shown). Complementation of gpa1Δ reflects an ability of each mutant to bind βγ in vivo. We then tested the ability of the mutants to inhibit receptor-dependent signaling in a GPA1 + strain. In this case, all three single-site mutants led to a complete inhibition of pheromone response (determined by the growth inhibition “halo assay,” Fig. 2 A). The double mutants can also inhibit pheromone signaling (and will even complementgpa1Δ) but only when overexpressed (data not shown). In comparison, a 2-fold overexpression of wild-type GPA1 led to a more modest inhibition of the pheromone response, and the double-site mutants were without effect (Fig. 2 A). The mutant and wild-type forms of Gpa1 were expressed at equal levels, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using a pheromone-induced transcription reporter assay (FUS1promoter, lacZ reporter; Fig. 2 B). The results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 reveal that all three single-site mutants will complement a gpa1Δ mutant and can inhibit signaling even in the presence of wild-type Gpa1, consistent with a dominant-negative mode of action. We then examined if the corresponding mutations in a mammalian Gα would also inhibit βγ signaling in cultured cells, using the MAP kinase phosphorylation assay as a read out. Gi2α was chosen for these experiments because it does not regulate MAP kinase activity directly, in contrast to Gq and Gs (28Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed versions of Gi2α with the K46E, R209S, and L235Δ mutations and transfected these together with the D2-dopamine receptor and an epitope-tagged version of MAP kinase (HA-MAPK). MAP kinase activity was measured after immunoprecipitation by monitoring incorporation of 32P to myelin basic protein. As shown in Fig. 3, all three Gi2α mutants reduced basal MAP kinase activity by ∼20%, as compared with control (empty vector) transfected COS-7 cells. Upon stimulation with a D2 agonist quinpirole, phosphorylation was attenuated 20–40% by the mutants, with R209S being the most potent inhibitor. In comparison, two known inhibitors of βγ binding—the βγ-binding domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARKΔ) and the transducin α subunit (αt)—inhibited basal phosphorylation by ∼30% and quinpirole-stimulated activity by 50–60%. Similar results were obtained using transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3 B). Wild-type Gi2α does not inhibit βγ signaling (data not shown), presumably because the wild-type protein responds normally to activation by the receptor. Having determined that Gi2αR209S potently inhibits βγ-mediated signaling, we also examined if the mutant has any effect on Gα-mediated signaling events. CHO cells were transfected with Gi2αR209S, the D2 dopamine receptor, and the luteinizing hormone/hCG receptor. Whereas, Gi2αR209S inhibited agonist-dependent MAP kinase activity by ∼40% (Fig. 3 B), the same mutant had no effect on hCG-mediated stimulation (via Gs) or quinpirole-mediated inhibition (via Gi) of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4 A). In comparison, signaling via Giα was potently and selectively inhibited by PTX treatment. The results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 A reveal that Gi2αR209S can inhibit signaling through βγ but not through Gα. We also examined whether the corresponding mutations in Gsα and Gqα would behave similarly, at least with respect to Gα-mediated signaling events. GsαR231S did not alter hCG-stimulated (Gsα-mediated) production of cAMP (Fig. 4 B); and GqαR207S had no effect on carbachol-stimulated (Gqα-mediated) inositol phosphate production (Fig. 4 C). Thus the Arg-to-Ser mutation does not interfere with coupling between receptors and the endogenous (wild-type) Gα, or between Gα and its downstream effectors, in all three cases tested. The Arg-to-Ser mutation leads to a dramatic, dominant-negative-type inhibition of Gβγ activity, at least in the two cases where this could be measured (Gpa1R327S, Gi2αR209S). There are at least two ways that such a mutant could block βγ signaling. First, it could alter the conformation or subunit binding affinity of Gα for βγ. Second, it could simply prevent binding to GTP. To rule out this more trivial explanation, two types of experiments were performed using purified recombinant Gpa1R327S. First, we measured the rate of pseudo-irreversible binding of [35S]GTPγS, which is limited by the rate of GDP dissociation (16Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, Gpa1R327S is able to exchange GDP for GTPγS. As a second measure of GTP binding, we determined the steady state rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gpa1, which also reflects the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange (29Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the overall rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gpa1R327S is comparable with that of wild-type. Thus there is no evidence that the R327S substitution prevents GTP binding to Gpa1. Using a genetic screening strategy in yeast, we have isolated dominant-negative mutations that potently inhibit Gβγ-effector coupling and yet do not interfere with coupling between the receptor and Gα, or between Gα and its effector. This is in contrast to previously described dominant-negative alleles (e.g.GsαG226A, GsαG49V) which do affect receptor-Gα coupling (30Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B.

Other mutants have more selective inhibitory effects on Gβγ signaling (GoαS47C, GoαN270D), but these are only modestly better than wild-type Gα at inhibiting βγ function (37Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Analogous mutations in yeast (Gpa1G322L, Gpa1N388D, Gpa1G50V) have similar, weakly dominant-negative propertiesin vivo (20Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4439-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R.

None of these mutations were found in our screen and have never been shown to suppress a GTPase-deficient allele of Gα. The highly selective nature of our mutants must stem in part from the powerful selection process used for their identification. Specifically, all three mutants were screened for their ability to suppress an activating mutation in Gα, a mutation that acts downstream of (and independently of) the receptor. These results can be interpreted in the context of the available crystal structures of Gt (transducin) (40Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Those studies revealed three regions in Gα—designated switch I, II, and III—that exhibit significant conformational differences in the active (Gα-GTPγS-bound), transition (Gα-GDP-AlF4−), and inactive (Gα-GDP-βγ) states. All three switch regions contribute to the binding of guanine nucleotides and Gβγ and are extremely well conserved among all heterotrimeric G proteins including Gpa1. On the basis of these structures, the dominant-negative activity of all three mutants can be rationalized. Thus, K54E results in a charge reversal, introducing a negatively charged side chain in the guanine nucleotide binding pocket and possibly interfering with binding to the γ phosphate of GTP (Fig. 6 A). This mutation could compensate for the loss of GTPase activity by simply binding GDP preferentially over GTP. The Leu deletion would shorten a loop that constrains the switch II helix in a conformation needed for dissociation of βγ (Fig. 6, B versus C). Finally, R327S is likely to disrupt an ion-pair interaction (in the GTP-bound state) between the guanidinium of Arg-327 and the carboxylate of Glu-364. The loss of this high energy interaction could also perturb the conformational change needed for release of βγ (Fig. 6, B versus C). Indeed, a substitution at the corresponding Arg of Gsα (R231H) is associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia and exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype in cultured cells (22Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5656-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20619-20626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A substitution of the ion-pair partner, E268A, has a similar phenotype. 2T. Iiri and H. R. Bourne, unpublished data. Several challenges remain. Currently we are co-expressing the Arg-to-Ser mutant (as Giα) with oncogenic receptors, G proteins, and effectors in cell culture to determine its ability to block MAP kinase signaling and cell transformation. A long term goal is to express these mutants in animals, to determine how inhibition of Gβγ signaling affects their growth and behavior in vivo. These experiments will help to distinguish Gα- versusGβγ-mediated signaling processes in a variety of systems, from yeast to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2129194549,"We have isolated three unique NaPi-2-related protein cDNAs (NaPi-2α, NaPi-2β, and NaPi-2γ) from a rat kidney library. NaPi-2α cDNA encodes 337 amino acids which have high homology to the N-terminal half of NaPi-2 containing 3 transmembrane domains. NaPi-2β encodes 327 amino acids which are identical to the N-terminal region of NaPi-2 containing 4 transmembrane domains, whereas the 146 amino acids in the C-terminal region are completely different. In contrast, NaPi-2γ encodes 268 amino acids which are identical to the C-terminal half of NaPi-2. An analysis of phage and cosmid clones indicated that the three related proteins were produced by alternative splicing in the NaPi-2 gene. In a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, NaPi-2 α, β, and γ were found to be 36, 36, and 29 kDa amino acid polypeptides, respectively. NaPi-2α and NaPi-2γ were glycosylated and revealed to be 45- and 35-kDa proteins, respectively. In isolated brush-border membrane vesicles, an N-terminal antibody was reacted with 45- and 40-kDa, and a C-terminal antibody was reacted with 37-kDa protein. The sizes of these proteins corresponded to those in glycosylated forms. A functional analysis demonstrated that NaPi-2γ and -2α markedly inhibited NaPi-2 activity in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes.

This mAb was selected for further study because of its high affinity (K d = 2 × 10–9m/liter) for PCP and usefulness in reversing PCP-induced central nervous system toxicity in laboratory animals. The dominant feature of the 6B5 Fab·PCP complex is the deep binding site and hydrophobic nature of the interaction. The ligand binding pocket of 6B5 Fab has numerous aromatic side chains, as compared with other known Fab structures. The most notable feature of the binding site is a Trp at position 97H (H-chain), and the side chain of this residue appears to act as a hydrophobic umbrella on the ligand in the antigen binding pocket. There are only two other known Fabs found with a Trp at the 97H position in complementarity determining region (CDR) H3, but they do not play a major role in the interaction with their respective antigens; in both Fab TE33 and R6.5 the Trp 97H side chain is positioned away from the bound antigen. Comparison of the CDR residues of 6B5 with other Fab structures with similar CDR sizes and amino acid compositions reveals a number of important patterns of residue substitutions that appear to be critical for specific PCP ligand interactions.

Crystallographic determinations of antigen binding fragments (Fab)1 derived from human and mouse immunoglobulins (Ig) have shown that the antigen binding pocket is created by six polypeptide loops or so-called complementarity determining regions (CDR) at the en face region of the Fab (1Poljak R.J.

The CDR structures are formed by the anti-parallel β-strand turns of the variable regions of light and heavy polypeptide chains. The favorable contacts between specific CDR amino acids of the antibody and the antigen epitopes accounts for the fine specificity of the interaction. Although most antibodies made against small ligand or drug antigens exhibit precise stereospecific interactions, it is not uncommon for some antibodies to bind to analogues or drug family members that are structurally related due to the position and orientation of specific intermolecular contacts. Phencyclidine (1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine, or PCP) and related arylcyclohexylamines have been shown to be potent dissociative psychotropic agents (4Burns R.S. Lerner S.E. Clin. Toxicol. 1976; 9: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Fauman M.A. Fauman B.J. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1979; 136: 1584-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PCP has direct interactions with receptors for several central nervous system neurotransmitters, including theN-methyl-d-aspartate gated ion-channel complex (6Zukin S.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and the dopamine reuptake transporter (7Vignon J. Vincent J.P. Bidard J.N. Kamenka J.-M. Geneste P. Monier S.

The molecular features of PCP-like arylcyclohexylamines which are important for binding to the PCP binding site have been studied by generation of a series of polyclonal rabbit antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to PCP-like haptens and related analogues (9Owens S.M. Zorbas M. Lattin D.L. Gunnell M. Polk M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 472-478PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hardin J.S. Wessinger W.D. Proksch J.W. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1113-1121PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the relative reactivity of various arylcyclohexylamine drugs in a [3H]PCP radioimmunoassay with their relative potencies for PCP receptor binding in central nervous system membranes and central nervous system drug discrimination assays in rats, it was determined that 5-[N-(1′phenylcyclohexyl)amino]pentanoic acid (PCHAP) was a highly suitable ligand for generating antibodies that could recognize the pharmacologically active features required for arylcyclohexylamine binding to the PCP sites (9Owens S.M. Zorbas M. Lattin D.L. Gunnell M. Polk M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 472-478PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of a Fab·PCP complex resolved at 2.2-Å resolution. The monoclonal antibody used in this study, clone 6B5, was produced against the phencyclidine-like hapten PCHAP (11McClurkan M.B. Valentine J.L. Arnold L. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1439-1445PubMed Google Scholar). The structural knowledge of this Fab·PCP complex has aided our understanding of how this mAb is able to reverse acute PCP-induced central nervous system toxicity within minutes following intravenous administration (12Valentine J.L. Mayersohn M. Wessinger W.D. Arnold L.W. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 709-716PubMed Google Scholar). PCP is a well known drug of abuse and treatment of its overdose in humans is extremely problematic because there are no known antagonists and there is an extensive extravascular distribution and slow elimination of the drug in humans (13Cook C.E. Brine D.R. Jeffcoat A.R. Hill J.M. Wall M.E. Perez-Reyes M. Di Guiseppi S.R. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1982; 31: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of mAb 6B5 have been shown to be highly effective as an antibody-based treatment protocol for acute PCP toxicity in laboratory animals (11McClurkan M.B. Valentine J.L. Arnold L. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1439-1445PubMed Google Scholar,12Valentine J.L. Mayersohn M. Wessinger W.D. Arnold L.W. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 709-716PubMed Google Scholar). The structural knowledge of the 6B5 Fab·PCP complex will provide the basis for future 6B5 Fab and single-chain Fv (fragment variable) protein engineering experiments in an attempt to modify the antigenicity and enhance the pharmacokinetics, thereby providing a basis for clinical application of this antibody in the treatment of human patients with PCP-induced psychosis and toxicity. The 6B5 Fab was produced and purified from whole IgG (G1, κ) as described previously (11McClurkan M.B. Valentine J.L. Arnold L. Owens S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1439-1445PubMed Google Scholar). It was further purified in an affinity gel column conjugated with the PCHAP hapten, from which the 6B5 Fab was eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.8. The affinity-purified Fab was concentrated and examined for purity with SDS-PAGE. At a concentration of 15 mg/ml, the 6B5 Fab was crystallized in 2.2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, by the hanging drop crystallization method. The diffraction data were collected to 2.2-Å resolution with the MAC Science DIP2030 image plate system with double-focusing mirrors coupled to a Rigaku x-ray generator, using a copper rotating anode with a 5 μm nickel filter and a 0.5-mm x-ray beam collimator. The Denzo and Scalepack programs were used to autoindex, integrate, and scale multiple frames of data (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Intensity data sets collected from two crystals gave a residualR merge of 9.1% and were assigned the space group of P1.

Open table in a new tab To obtain the molecular replacement solution for the 6B5 Fab·PCP complex, the 4–4-20 Fab (Protein Data Bank code 4fab) and HC19 Fab (Protein Data Bank code 1gig) structures were used as models in the search with the XPLOR program (15Brunger A.T. Leahy D.J. Hynes T.R. Fox R.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 239-256PubMed Google Scholar). These structures were chosen because of their common constant G1, κ chain sequences with 6B5. Using the 15.0–4.0-Å data, rotation search was performed separately for the variable and constant domain halves of the Fab. Because each variable or constant domain half consists of light and heavy chain subdomains, the Patterson correlation refinements were performed after the initial rotation search to improve their relative orientations. Top solutions from these refinements were used in the translation search. The size of the crystal lattice (Table I) indicated that there are two Fabs in the asymmetric unit with the solvent content of 45% (16Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). Because the space group is triclinic P1, no translation was necessary for the first variable domain pair, and three translation searches were performed for the remaining three Fab domain pairs of the asymmetric unit. The partial structure factors F c for the first variable domain pair were computed and used in the translation search for the corresponding constant domain pair. Then a new set of F c was computed for the translation search for the second variable domain pair. Again, a new set of F c was computed and used in the translation search for the second constant domain pair. The 4–4-20 Fab model was used to determine the positions of the first three domain pairs but did not yield a solution for the second constant domain pair. The position of the latter was determined with the HC19 Fab model. The correlation coefficient improved progressively from 0.19 with only one variable domain pair positioned to 0.38 with all four components placed in the crystal lattice. The molecular replacement search with the 15.0–4.0-Å data also lowered the R factor, from 51.5 to 46.2%. Furthermore, the same solution was also obtained with another program, AMORE (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Finally, the four Fab domain pairs were placed together in the crystal lattice and rigid body minimization was performed with the 8.0–3.0-Å data, and the R factor was further reduced to 44.7%. For the structural refinements, omit maps computed from the 4,000 K-simulated annealing calculations with XPLOR were examined to ascertain the polypeptide tracing, especially for the CDR loops. Noncrystallographic restraints were not used on the two Fabs in the asymmetric unit during any part of the structure refinements. Structure visualization and model building tasks were performed with the O program (18Jones T.A. Zou J. Kjelgaard M. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions were made in the 6B5 structure using the variable domain sequences for both L- and H-chains derived from the cDNA nucleotide sequencing of mRNA isolated from hybridoma cells (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The constant domain sequences of 6B5 were not determined by cDNA sequencing. Because the constant domain gene families were found to be the same as the anti-lysozyme antibody HyHEL-5 (20Cohen G.H. Sherfiff S. Davies D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the HyHEL-5 structure was used for the electron density maps of the 6B5 diffraction data. The position of the PCP molecule in the Fab binding site was determined with the F o − F c difference map. The initial difference map indicated the presence of PCP at the center of the binding site. As the CDR loops with their side chains were built into the Fab structure with more certainty, the difference electron density of PCP became more defined. However, because PCP consists of three cyclic substituents, there was uncertainty about its true orientation in the binding site. This question was answered when the simulated annealing computation was performed with all the highest resolution data available (to 2.2 Å) and the difference electron density map revealed the PCP orientation (Fig. 2 A). The published coordinates of the PCP crystal structure (21Argos P. Barr R.E. Weber A.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1970; 26: 53-61Crossref Google Scholar) were inserted in the model and another round of simulated annealed calculations were performed (Fig. 2 B). The potential parameters for PCP were obtained from an automatic XPLOR parameter-generating program (available on the web site: http://alpha2.bmc.uu.S.E./hicup) (22Kleywegt G.J. ESF/CCP 4 Newsletter. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar,23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Ordered water molecules in the 6B5 Fab structure refinements, which used the 6.0–2.2-Å data, were chosen from the 3 ς peaks in theF o − F c difference map with appropriate distance and interaction criteria, and symmetry consideration. After their inclusion in the model, their positions were again examined with the 2F o − F cmap; any water molecules with less than 0.7 ς peaks in this map were rejected. The final R factor was 19.9%, withR free of 28.6%. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Coordinates of the 6B5 Fab structure have been deposited in Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (identification code2PCP). The three-dimensional structure of 6B5 Fab complexed with PCP was determined to 2.2-Å resolution. 6B5 Fab possesses the typical immunoglobulin fold found in all antibody molecules, wherein the light (L) chain and heavy (H) chain form the variable (V) domain that contains the antigen-binding region, and constant (C) domain that have identical amino acid sequences within a gene class. Two Fab·PCP complexes were identified in the asymmetric unit of space group P1. They are positioned in opposite directions with the interface at the constant domain (Fig. 3). Amino acids of 1L to 211L of L-chain (216 residues) and of 1H to 226H of H-chain (215 residues) were assigned in both Fab of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). Amino acid sequence numbering scheme for Ig as described by Kabat et al. (24Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. United States DHHS. NIH, 1991Google Scholar) is used in this report. Most of the structural elements are well defined and unambiguously assigned, including the PCP ligand. The two regions of relatively weak electron densities are amino acid residues 198L-203L in the constant L-chain domain and 127H-133H in the constant H-chain domain. The structure of 6B5 was analyzed using Cα atoms of conserved β-strand residues, as indicated in Fig. 1 and shown in Table II. The Cα atoms of variable or constant domain of the heavy chain are rotated to superimpose on the corresponding Cα atoms of the light chain. The axis of this rotation between the two chains is termedpseudodyad. The elbow angle is computed with the two pseudodyads of the variable and constant domain pairs. The elbow angles are 143° for Fab 1, and 139° for Fab 2. These values deviate significantly from 180° but fall within the range of those of other Fabs surveyed, from 127 to 227° (25Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Pseudodyads are more close to 180° for V domains than for C domains (Table II). In addition, molecular surface areas were computed with the probe radius of 1.7 Å (26Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar). The buried surface area of the VL-VH interface is 1,309 Å2 for Fab 1 (663 for VL and 646 for VH) and 1,299 Å2 for Fab 2 (664 for VL and 635 for VH). These values of 6B5 are in the mid-range of those observed in other Fab structures (1,100 to 1,700 Å2) (27Stanfield R.L. Takimoto-Kamimura M. Rini J.M. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Structure. 1993; 3: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and comparable with the buried surface area of 1,375 Å2 for the anti-fluorescein 4–4-20 Fab (28Herron J.N. Terry A.H. Johnston S. He X.-M. Guddat L.W. Voss Jr., E.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2167-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the search model for 6B5. However, the elbow angle of 171° of 4–4-20 is much greater than that of 6B5.Table IIQuaternary structural analysis of 6B5 FabElbow angle Fab 1143°Fab 2139°Pseudodyad Fab 1 V176°Fab 2 V177° Fab 1 C170°Fab 2 V168°Superposition between two Fabs using Cα atoms (in Å)All residuesβ-strand residuesVariable and constant domains1.330.97VL + VH0.490.37CL + CL1.630.53VL0.450.32CL0.840.49VH0.480.36CH1.360.50 Open table in a new tab The elbow angles of 6B5 Fab reflect the uneven positions of the V- and C-domains of L-chain relative to that found in the H-chain. The distances between the centers of mass for the Cα atoms of conserved β-strand residues (Fig. 1) are 39 Å for VL and CL, and 32 Å for VH and CH. The differences of these values between the two Fabs are within 1 Å. The elongation on the L-chain side causes the 198L-203L loop of CL to be at least 16 Å away from the nearest VL residues, 12L-14L. The 198L-203L loop is usually stabilized in part with the close association with the VL residues. The orientation of the V- and C-domain interface causes this loop to be exposed to the solvent, resulting in electron densities that are relatively weaker than those of the remainder of the Fab. The disorder of this loop is reflected by the relatively large average temperature factors, 49.3 and 45.6 Å2 for Fab 1 and Fab 2, respectively. These values are twice that of the mean temperature factors for Fab·PCP 1, 21.5 Å2, and for Fab·PCP 2, 22.8 Å2 (Table I). In contrast, the compression on the H-chain portion of the molecule results in a closer interaction between VH and CH, and as a result, the 212H-217H loop of CH comes within 8 Å of the nearest residues of VH, 9H-11H. The two Fabs in the asymmetric unit point in opposite directions and have their interfaces at the C-domains (Fig. 3). It requires a near symmetric 179.4° rotation to superimpose one Fab to the other. Because noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used during any stage of refinement, the r.m.s. deviation of all Cα atoms is 1.33 Å. The r.m.s. deviation is 0.97 Å when only the Cα atoms of conserved β-strand residues are used. The r.m.s. deviations of different domain superpositions are shown in Table II. These values are less than 1 Å when only the Cα atoms of conserved β-strand residues are used, which indicate that the relative positions of the constant and variable domains are different between the two Fabs and result in different elbow angles. In addition, the larger r.m.s. deviation in the constant domains is caused, in part, by the 198L-203L loop of CL (0.72 Å), as discussed above, and the 127H-133H loop in CH, for which the r.m.s. deviation is 1.78 Å. This loop has been found to be disordered in other Fab structures (29Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 127H-133H loops from the two 6B5 Fab in the asymmetric unit face each other. Although omit map calculations allowed these loops to be traced, their electron densities are relatively weak, as indicated by high average temperature factors, 37.9 Å2 for the Fab 1 loop and 47.3 Å2 for the Fab 2 loop. The refined structure of PCP in the Fab binding site deviates little from the crystal structure of pure PCP (21Argos P. Barr R.E. Weber A.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1970; 26: 53-61Crossref Google Scholar). The phenyl ring is in axial position and the piperidine ring in equatorial position, with respect to the cyclohexane ring, thus forming a “T” formation (Fig. 2). The r.m.s. deviation is 0.168 Å for PCP in Fab 1 and 0.143 Å for PCP in Fab 2 when each is compared with the crystal PCP structure. The phenyl ring has rotated in opposite directions for the two PCP molecules, by about 10° for PCP in the Fab 1 and 5° for PCP in the Fab 2. The PCP in the binding site was refined with the default potential parameters obtained from the XPLOR parameter-generating program (22Kleywegt G.J. ESF/CCP 4 Newsletter. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar), which assigned 1,000 kcal/mol Å−2 for bond length constants and 500 kcal/mol rad−2 for bond length constants. Eighty percent reduction of these constants resulted in r.m.s. deviation of greater than 0.3 Å and showed significant distortions of the PCP cyclic substituents. In contrast, increase of these parameters by 20 times resulted in the r.m.s. deviation of 0.1 Å, though the phenyl ring rotation was still evident to a smaller extent. Between these two extremes, the default parameters were judged to be reasonable for usage in these structural refinements. The binding pocket of 6B5 Fab is about 13 Å in diameter and 13 Å deep. The PCP ligand is surrounded on all sides by aromatic and histidine residues (Fig. 4). At the bottom of the binding pocket, Phe 100H and the adjacent Phe 89L contact the cyclohexane ring of PCP. At the middle portion of PCP, the surrounding residues are Tyr 32L, His 27dL, and Tyr 96L from the L-chain and Trp 47H, His 35H, Tyr 50H, and Tyr 33H from the H-chain. The phenyl ring of PCP points toward Tyr 33H and Tyr 50H. The side chain of His 35H is perpendicularly positioned below the phenyl ring of PCP. Positioned above, and enclosing PCP in the binding site, is Trp 97H. Polar interactions include the nitrogen atom of the PCP piperidine ring (pK a 8.5), which is in close contact with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly 91L (2.9 Å) and carbonyl oxygen atom of Trp 97H (3.8 Å). The amino acid residues that surround those interacting with PCP provide a support framework. In CDR 1L the side chains of His 27dL and Tyr 32L interact with the PCP antigen, and are stabilized by forming hydrogen bonds with Asn 28L positioned between them. Tyr 32L is additionally stabilized by Asn 30L and Asp 98H. On the H-chain side, aromatic side chains of CDR 1H and 2H residues contribute to the interaction with PCP. The Tyr 33H residue, which is in contact with the phenyl ring of PCP, is stacked on the backside with the ring of Tyr 52H. The side chain of Trp 47H does not make a direct contact with PCP but is close to it and is positioned between those that are, such as Tyr 96L, His 35H, and Tyr 50H. Table III identifies the buried molecular surface areas of the PCP ligand and surrounding Fab residues. Both L and H-chain CDR 3 make significant contributions to the interaction with the ligand, in that 29% of buried surface area comes from CDR 3L and 35% from CDR 3H. CDR 3H makes the largest amount of contact with PCP, and Trp 97H is a significant contact residue with its side chain acting as an umbrella shielding PCP from the solvent. Buried surface area contributed by Trp 97H alone is 15%, more than any from the 16 residues that are in contact with PCP. Furthermore, molecular surface area of PCP complexed to Fab 1 is 252 Å2 and that complexed to Fab 2 is 254 Å2, and both are buried 97% by the surrounding Fab residues.Table IIIBuried molecular surface areas for 6B5 Fab interaction with PCPFab 1Fab 2ResidueArea (Å2)% AreaTotal CDR % areaResidueArea (Å2)% AreaTotal CDR % areaHis-27dL186.1His-27dL124.5Tyr-32L227.8Tyr-32L186.8Glu-34L41.4CDR 1L 15.3Glu-34L41.4CDR 1L 12.7Phe-89L124.2Phe-89L166.0Gly-91L3311.4Gly-91L218.1Thr-92L82.8Thr-92L52.0Tyr-96L3110.5CDR 3L 28.9Tyr-96L3312.7CDR 3L 28.8Tyr-33H175.8Tyr-33H186.7His-35H258.7CDR 1H 14.5His-35H228.2CDR 1H 14.9Tyr-50H175.9CDR 2H 5.9Tyr-50H166.2CDR 2H 6.2Ser-95H144.8Ser-95H134.9Thr-96H51.8Thr-96H72.6Trp-97H4515.5Trp-97H4015.0Asp-98H165.6Asp-98H124.6Asp-99H93.2Asp-99H145.4Phe-100H134.5CDR 3H 35.4Phe-100H134.9CDR 3H 37.4Total289Total264PCP 124597.2PCP 224797.2 Open table in a new tab From the 679 ordered water molecules modeled in the asymmetric unit of the two 6B5 Fab·PCP structures, one water molecule was found in each binding site, buried between PCP and CDR residues. This single ordered water molecule is located on the side of cyclohexane and piperidine rings of PCP and interacts with the side chain of Glu 34L (Fig. 4). The sequences and conformations of the CDR, except CDR 3H, are similar to those of other Fab structures. CDR 2L is shielded by CDR 1L and 3H from making a direct contact with PCP. CDR 1L in other Fab structures ranges from 10 to 17 amino acid residues in length. The relatively long CDR 1L of 6B5 (16 residues, Fig. 1) is often found in Fabs that bind small ligand molecules (30Vargas-Madrazo E. Lara-Ochoa F. Almagro J.C. J. Mol.

PCP, also known as “Angel Dust,” has become a widespread and dangerous drug of abuse (4Burns R.S. Lerner S.E. Clin. Toxicol. 1976; 9: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). There are numerous reports of PCP inducing violent and bizarre behaviors (32Aniline O. Pitts Jr., F.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1982; 10: 145-177Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PCP can precipitate latent psychosis and a drug-induced dementia that resembles schizophrenia. Because there are no known antagonists for PCP, the treatment of the clinical problems associated with PCP overdose is very difficult. Treatment of a drug overdose is compounded by the fact that PCP has a widespread extravascular distribution and a very slow elimination from the body. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (6B5) treatments of PCP toxicity in laboratory animals have proved successful (12Valentine J.L. Mayersohn M. Wessinger W.D. Arnold L.W. Owens S.M. J.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 class I (MHC-I) molecules are heterotrimers of a 45-kDa α-chain encoded by the polymorphic genes of the MHC, noncovalently associated invariant 12-kDa β2-microglobulin, and a short peptide of 8–10 amino acids derived from usually cellular proteins by proteolytic degradation (1Barber L.D. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 163-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The complex is presented at the cell surface for recognition by MHC-I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The peptide-binding groove is formed by two α-helices on top of a β-pleated sheet (2Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennety W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar). The peptide is bound in extended conformation, with most of its surface buried inside the groove. The interactions of the peptide with the MHC molecule can be classified as follows: first, compensation of the C- and N-terminal charges of the peptide by complementary MHC residues (3Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); second, extensive hydrogen bonding between the peptide main chain and MHC side chains that adds to sequence-unspecific binding (4Fremont D.H. Matsumura M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar); and third, polymorphic MHC side chains inside the binding pocket that determine MHC allele-specific peptide motifs corresponding to two dominant and several subdominant anchor positions with strong constraints for the peptide side chains (5Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The peptide ligand is essential for the conformational stability of the MHC molecule and thus can be seen as an integral part of the protein (6Fahnestock M.L. Tamir I. Narhi L. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The analysis of the requirements for peptide selection by MHC molecules has revealed rules that are reminiscent of the packing in the core of a typical globular protein rather than for typical receptor-ligand interactions (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Fremont D.H. Stura E.A. Matsumura M. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2479-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The tight incorporation of the peptide into the MHC molecule as a third subunit makes it very challenging and tempting to search for non-peptide ligands for this peptide receptor. Such peptide analogues can be synthesized in large varieties with diverse structural features, and the MHC heterotrimers appear to be a suitable model for exploring the possibilities and requirements for the design of non-peptidic structural elements in proteins. The complex of the ovalbumin-derived octapeptide SIINFEKL and the murine MHC-I molecule H-2Kb (9Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) has been extensively studied (10Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Pool sequencing of peptides, naturally presented by H-2Kb, has revealed a strong preference for octamers with tyrosine or phenylalanine at position 5 and leucine or methionine at position 8 (11Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). This binding motif is implemented by the steric requirements as well as by specific interactions of the anchoring side chains with the binding pockets: hydrophobic effects and π-stacking in the case of the aromatic side chain at position 5 and hydrophobic interaction in the case of the aliphatic side chain at position 8. Alanine scans confirmed the importance of these anchor positions for H-2Kb stabilization, whereby positions 4, 6, and 7 were shown to be important for T cell recognition (12Jameson S.C. Bevan M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2663-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a more comprehensive study, the influence of each amino acid in each position was examined using randomized peptide libraries in a positional scanning format (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In MHC stabilization experiments, positions 4, 6, and 7 were found to be relatively tolerant to amino acid variations, and positions 5 and 8 were found to be the most restrictive. Moreover, a preference for hydrophobic side chains was found for positions 1–3, 5, and 8. The crystal structures of H-2Kb in complex with three different peptides revealed detailed information about the interactions of peptides and MHC residues, confirming the above-mentioned functional studies (4Fremont D.H. Matsumura M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 8Fremont D.H. Stura E.A. Matsumura M. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2479-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In recent years, strategies for the automated and combinatorial synthesis of molecular libraries of different classes of organic molecules have been developed (for review, see Ref. 13Jung G. Combinatorial Peptide and Non-peptide Libraries. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a search for new compounds with desired features, e.g. therapeutic activity, such libraries allow for high throughput screening of a large number of different molecules. Library approaches are being applied to identify alternative ligands of various receptors. Combinatorial peptide libraries were used to elucidate the rules for peptide selection by MHC molecules and to determine synthetic T cell receptor epitopes (10Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Walden P. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For a vigorous test of the indicated strategy, this work has focused on the structurally most constrained C-terminal part of H-2Kb-binding peptides (positions 5–8). The peptide amide backbone was replaced by poly-N-acylated amine (PAA) elements. Many efforts have been made to generate new classes of peptidomimetics (15Cho C.Y. Moran E.J. Cherry S.R. Stephans J.C. Fodor S.P.A. Adams C.L. Sundaram A. Jacobs J.W. Schultz P.G. Science. 1993; 261: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Zuckermann R.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 580-584Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In comparison with peptides, synthetic non-peptide oligomers display new physicochemical properties. Modifications of the amide backbone can solve the problems of rapid enzymatic degradation of peptides and low bioavailability. The design and synthesis of new peptidomimetics offer the possibility to choose building blocks different from natural amino acids. Depending on the chemical class of the monomers, protocols with efficient, high-yielding coupling reactions on solid support need to be developed. These strategies have been successfully applied, for example, to the preparation of oligocarbamates, oligosulfones, and peptoids (17Moran E.J. Wilson T.E. Cho C.Y. Cherry S.R. Schultz P.G. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Simon R.J. Kania R.S. Zuckermann R.N. Huebner V.D. Jewell D.A. Banville S. Ng S. Wang L. Rosenberg S. Marlowe C.K.

Non-natural peptides involved in the stabilization of the MHC-I molecules can be considered as the starting point for the discovery of new immune modulators such as antitumor vaccines and T cell receptor antagonists (19Guichard G.

Several oligomers and five types of randomized molecular libraries were synthesized and assayed. First, the optimal binding geometry was determined by testing a series of 12 defined structures with different main chain variations (PAA1–PAA12) (Fig. 1). Second, based on the structure with the highest binding efficiency, randomized libraries with 26 different aromatic side chains in position 5 (see Table I) and four different aliphatic side chains in position 8 were tested. Finally, one library was deconvoluted to identify the best H-2Kb ligand. The objective of this study was to establish a combinatorial strategy including oligomer screening, randomized libraries, and systematic deconvolution for the determination of non-peptide ligands for the highly specialized peptide receptor MHC molecules.Table IMolecular structures of the acylating building blocks (BB) used in the synthesis of the library (SII-X–X) and of its sublibraries (SII-X–L, SII-X–I, SII-X–V, and SII-X–M), all based on the structure of compound PAA6 Open table in a new tab The synthesis of the poly-N-acylated amines was performed using two different strategies, which are illustrated in Schemes FS1 and FS2. All reagents, amino acids, and solvents were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Aldrich, Novabiochem (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Wang resin and trityl chloride resin were obtained from Rapp Polymere (Tübingen, Germany) and PepChem (Tübingen). Reagent K is a mixture of 82.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% (w/v) phenol, 5% (w/v) thioanisole, 2.5% (w/v) ethanedithiol, and 5% (w/v) water. Trityl-monoprotected diamines were prepared from triphenylmethyl chloride and 1,3-diaminopropane or 1,4-diaminobutane in dichloromethane (DCM). The ligands were synthesized manually in small syringes fitted with a frit up until the introduction of the amino acids at the N-terminal part; this was performed on a simultaneous multiple peptide synthesizer (SMPS 350, Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany; Software Syro, MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) using Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy (25Jung G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 367-383Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After cleavage from the resin and precipitation with cold diethyl ether, the compounds were lyophilized from tert-butyl alcohol/water (4:1, v/v) and characterized by analytical reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry.Figure FS2Synthesis of poly-N-acylated amines PAA4–PAA12. a, Fmoc-Leu-OH/diisopropylethylamine in DCM, 2 eq, 30 min, room temperature; 40% piperidine/DMF, 2 × 15 min, room temperature;b, Fmoc-Gly-OH or Fmoc-γ-aminobutyric acid-OH/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/DIC in DMF, 10 eq, 90 min, room temperature; 40% piperidine/DMF, 2 × 15 min, room temperature;c, γ-bromobutanoic acid or α-bromoacetic acid/DIC in DMF, 10 eq, 1 h, room temperature, twice; d, 1,3-diaminopropane in Me2SO, 40 eq, 2 h, room temperature; e, (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dicyclohexylidene)ethyl (Dde)-OH in DMF, 15 eq, 18 h, room temperature;f, benzoic acid or phenylacetic acid/DIC in DMF, 10 eq, 1 h, room temperature, twice; g, 5% hydrazine in DMF, 3 × 5 min, room temperature; h, Fmoc-AA-OH/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/DIC in DMF, 10 eq, 90 min, room temperature; (40% piperidine/DMF, 2 × 15 min, room temperature; AA = Ser(tBu), Ile (×2); i, trifluoroacetic acid/DCM/triisopropylsilane (9:2:1), 3 h, room temperature. PAA4 is based on the same structure as PAA3, but it was prepared following this scheme, coupling α-bromoacetic acid and 1,5-diaminopentane in the C-terminal part of the molecule, using isobutyric acid as the acylating agent. The synthesis of PAA9–PAA12 was performed omitting the introduction of glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid, using 6-bromohexanoic or 8-bromooctanoic acid as a spacer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The library (SII-X–X) based on the molecular structure (Ser1-Ile-Ile-spacer-Xaa8) of the ligand PAA6 was synthesized following the strategy of Scheme FS2. Four batches of trityl chloride resin were functionalized with Leu, Ile, Val, and Met, respectively. Equimolar amounts of each resin were combined, and the oligomers were elongated. For the acylation of the secondary amine, a mixture of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic carboxylic acids (see Table I), equimolar with the coupling sites on the resin, was preactivated with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min and subsequently added to the resin. After 90 min of coupling, the acylation was repeated using a 5-fold molar excess of the same mixture. The related PAA sublibraries, in which the C-terminal amino acids leucine (SII-X–L), isoleucine (SII-X–I), valine (SII-X–V), and methionine (SII-X–M) were fixed, were prepared using the same procedure described above. The mixtures were analyzed by on-line HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry (26Metzger J.W. Kempter C. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows an example of the HPLC-mass spectrometry dot plot of the SII-X–Isublibrary, which theoretically contains 26 compounds. The masses of all components are plotted as a function of retention time. One ligand is missing from the mixture because of synthesis problems, as could be revealed later after the deconvolution of the sublibrary. The HPLC-mass spectrometry analysis was applied to all the libraries we prepared with comparable results. The sublibrary SII-X–L was deconvoluted. The deconvolution was based on the individual synthesis of the 26 members of the SII-X–L mixture using the same procedure described for PAA6, as illustrated in Scheme FS2. (Each PAA was acylated with the corresponding building block (BB; see Table I).) All single compounds were completely characterized. After cleavage from the resin, the analytical reverse-phase HPLC showed a purity of the single compounds in the range 60–81%, with the exception of PAA17, with 34% purity. The synthesis of PAA30 resulted in a mixture of unidentified by-products. The crude compounds PAA17 and PAA30 were also used in the binding assays to exclude the possibility that by-products bind to and stabilize MHC molecules. For the preparation of PAA19 and PAA26, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid methyl ester and 3-indoleacetic acid methyl ester were previously protected withtert-butyl and tert-butyloxycarbonyl groups, respectively, following the procedures described in literature (27Anderson G.W. Callahan F.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 3359-3363Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar,28Franzén, H., Grehn, L., and Ragnarsson, U. (1984) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1699–1700Google Scholar). The methyl esters were then hydrolyzed with NaOH in acetone/methanol. H-2Kb binding of the oligomers was tested by a stabilization assay as described in detail elsewhere (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptide transporter-deficient RMA-S cells were incubated overnight at 26 °C to allow for accumulation of peptide-free MHC class I molecules on the cell surfaces. These “empty” MHC molecules are only stable at 26 °C and denatured at 37 °C. The peptides and PAAs were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 20 or 200 μm and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to 20 or 200 nm, respectively, and were incubated with the cells at 26 °C for 30 min. The culture was then exposed to 37 °C for 45 min to induce denaturation of unligated MHC. Stable H-2Kb expression on the cell surface as an indicator of bound oligomer was quantified by flow cytometry (FACScan®, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using the conformation-sensitive monoclonal H-2Kb-specific antibody B8.24.3 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Ligand concentrations required for half-maximal H-2Kbstabilization (C stab50) were calculated after linearization of the data by linear regression (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All assays included as a control the original peptide SIINFEKL to determine and indicate the degree of variability between different assays. The graphs in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 show the C stab50 values for the different oligomers tested. The corresponding C stab50value for SIINFEKL is given in the figure legends.Figure 4MHC binding of compound PAA6 compared with the library SII-X–X and its sublibraries SII-X–L, SII-X–I, SII-X–V, and SII-X–M.

Peptide positions 5–8 (FEKL), 4–8 (NFEKL), or 4–7 (NFEK) were replaced by different linear polyamines acylated with side chains mimicking the anchoring amino acids. First, the optimal geometry was determined using a series of 12 compounds with defined structures (Fig. 1). Then, based on the oligomer with the highest binding efficiency, randomized libraries with different side chains mimicking the anchor amino acids, phenylalanine and leucine, respectively, were tested. Finally, good binders were identified after deconvolution of the most potent sublibrary. All these compounds were tested for biological activity in MHC stabilization assays with H-2Kb-expressing peptide-deficient RMA-S cells. The synthesis of novel non-natural polymers should be designed to be suitable for solid-phase methods. The efficiency of the coupling procedures is of fundamental importance to obtain oligomers with a satisfactory purity for biological tests without extensive purification. Two different solid-phase strategies, illustrated in SchemesFS1 and FS2, have been designed and used in the synthesis of a new class of MHC-I ligands, PAAs. Initially, the oligomers PAA1–PAA3 were prepared on solid support using trityl-monoprotected diamines (Scheme FS1). Then, we modified the reaction procedures for the synthesis of PAA4–PAA12 (Scheme FS2) using free diamines and (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dicyclohexylidene)ethyl as the protecting group. This change in strategy was based on the following observations. First, the trityl group on the amines is less acid labile thanN α-trityl-amino acids; in fact, double treatment with 8% Reagent K in DCM for 20 min caused a partial cleavage of the oligomers from the resin. Second, solution synthesis of the monoprotected diamines can be avoided with the (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dicyclohexylidene)ethyl protecting group for primary amines because it can be easily coupled directly on the resin and is selective in the presence of secondary amines (29Nash I.A. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 2625-2628Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Augustyns K. Kraas W. Jung G. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 51: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both methods of synthesis are straightforward, and the compounds were obtained in good purity. The second strategy (Scheme FS2) was applied to the synthesis of randomized libraries. The design of poly-N-acylated amine libraries was based on the possibility of using commercially available building blocks, namely aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic carboxylic acids (Table I). The molecular structures of the 12 compounds designed, synthesized, and tested to determine the lead structure for the subsequent randomized libraries are given in Fig. 1. The main structures are linear polyamines with the side chains for the anchor positions introduced by condensation with organic acids that mimic the side chain functionalities of the anchor amino acids. The backbone length was varied. The main chain segment between the anchor positions contains one (PAA1–PAA4 and PAA9–PAA12) or two (PAA5–PAA8) amide bonds to promote hydrogen bonding between the ligand and MHC side chains. The spacers have a higher degree of conformational freedom compared with the peptide main chain. The length of the spacer, the position of the aromatic side chain, and the position of the additional amide bond were varied in order to determine the optimal spacing geometry. PAA1, PAA2, PAA6, PAA8, PAA10, and PAA12 have, in comparison with PAA3, PAA4, PAA5, PAA7, PAA9, and PAA11, an additional methylene group in the spacer between the carbonyl and the aromatic side chain. PAA1–PAA3 have, in comparison with PAA4, an additional methylene group in the C-terminal aliphatic side chain. Eight of the 12 poly-N-acylated amines (PAA5–PAA12) bind to the MHC molecule and stabilize its conformation, namely all compounds with the original leucine in position 8 and a total main chain length of 24 atoms (Fig. 3). The concentration required for half-maximal H-2Kb stabilization (C stab50) by the most potent compound PAA6 is 1 × 10−5m; the corresponding value for SIINFEKL is 1 × 10−8m. The oligomers with isovaleric (PAA1–PAA3) or isobutyric (PAA4) acid instead of leucine at the C terminus and a total main chain length of 25 (PAA3 and PAA4), 26 (PAA1), or 28 (PAA2) atoms do not stabilize H-2Kb. The compounds with an additional amide bond inside the spacers and the aromatic side chain at the same position as in the parent SIINFEKL peptide (PAA5–PAA8) display a higher MHC stabilization capacity than those without the additional amide bond and with the position of the aromatic side chain shifted by one atom (PAA9–PAA12). Variation of the main chain does not reveal a clear preference for the amide bond position (PAA5 versus PAA7, PAA6versus PAA8). The compounds with the position of the aromatic side chain shifted one atom toward the N terminus (PAA11 and PAA12) have a higher binding efficiency than those with a shift toward the C terminus (PAA9 and PAA10). Most of the compounds with phenylacetic acid, with a higher side chain flexibility due to an additional methylene group, have a higher binding efficiency than those with benzoic acid as the acylating agent mimicking the phenylalanine side chain (PAA5 versus PAA6, PAA7 versus PAA8, PAA11 versus PAA12). The compound with the highest binding efficiency, PAA6, which was chosen as a lead structure for the subsequent studies, has a phenylacetyl-like side chain at the central anchor position and the original leucine at the -terminal position. This oligomer is thus composed of 3 amino acids at the N terminus (serine, isoleucine, and isoleucine) and 2 amino acids (glycine and leucine) at the C terminus. The central part with the aromatic side chain has an acylated polyamine structure. Moreover, the internal amide bond that contributes to stabilize the MHC complex is in the same backbone position as in the natural SIINFEKL epitope (peptide bond between Glu6 and Lys7). Based on PAA6, libraries with randomized side chains were designed. For the central anchor position, 26 building blocks (Table I) were selected, mixed, and built in to obtain a randomized position. Similarly, random mixtures of leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine were introduced at the C-terminal position. The library randomized at both positions has the format SII-X–X and contains all possible permutations of the components, thus 104 compounds. The sublibraries SII-X–L, SII-X–I, SII-X–V, and SII-X–Meach contain only 1 of the 4 C-terminal amino acids (and thus 26 compounds each). All five libraries are slightly less potent than PAA6 (Fig. 4). The sublibrary with the highest binding efficiency, SII-X–L, was deconvoluted to give the compounds PAA6 and PAA13–PAA37 (Fig. 5). The compounds PAA13, PAA15–PAA17, PAA19, PAA22–PAA26, PAA29, and PAA32–PAA35 have similar binding efficiencies as the parent library (SII-X–L) and the original compound (PAA6). The compounds PAA18, PAA20, PAA31, and PAA36 are more potent binders, whereas PAA14, PAA21, PAA27, PAA28, PAA30, and PAA37 are less potent. Consistent with the previous results, the inferior compounds have benzoyl-like side chains, the aromatic ring being directly linked to the carbonyl group. Moreover, spacious polarpara-substitutions at the aromatic ring confer reduced binding efficiencies. The superior binders have an additional methylene group in the side chain. para-Substitution in the phenyl ring by a methoxy group (PAA22) or a fluorine atom (PAA20, best binder) results in increased binding efficiency. The pocket in the MHC peptide-binding groove for the central anchor side chain can also accommodate bulkier aromatic moieties, such as naphthyl (PAA31, PAA34, PAA36, and PAA37), benzofurane (PAA21), quinoline (PAA25), indole (PAA26), and biphenyl (PAA32). Two of the good binders (PAA31 and PAA36) have a naphthyl group. Combinatorial library approaches are applied increasingly in the development of new compounds with desired biological activities (13Jung G. Combinatorial Peptide and Non-peptide Libraries. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The general principle is based on the generation of diversity by randomization to find a lead structure and subsequent selection of specific compounds active, for instance, in receptor-ligand interaction. Randomization and subsequent deconvolution allow for systematic high throughput screening of a large number of different structures. The major steps in the generation of diverse libraries are as follows: first, the definition of a suitable parent structure and, second, the synthesis of randomized libraries. The selection of specific effector molecules is restricted on the one hand by the complexity of the randomized libraries and on the other hand by the sensitivity and the specificity of the readout system. Complex development problems might require iterative approaches with successive steps to define the parent structures scaffolds and to optimize the efficiency with different classes of molecular libraries. The success of this approach crucially depends on the right balance between the complexity of the libraries on one hand and the selectivity of the test system on the other. The number of steps for testing randomized and defined structures necessary to get clear results (and thus the optimal approach to a specific question) is dependent on the test system. Randomized peptide libraries were successfully applied to examine different questions concerning the interaction of the MHC and peptide ligand (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The very restrictive interaction of peptide and MHC molecules (31Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) makes it very challenging to search for new peptidomimetic ligands for this highly specialized peptide receptor. Replacing the peptide by polyamine structure results in more conformational freedom. The additional flexibility can aid the identification of new biologically active compounds. On the other hand, the increased numbers of conformational variants will reduce the efficiency of the screening system. This increased flexibility could be one reason for the lower binding efficiencies of the poly-N-acylated amines compared with SIINFEKL. The following approach was chosen to solve this problem. Non-peptide ligands for MHC-I H-2Kb were developed by, first, tailoring the optimal main chain spacing and, second, determining the best side chain to mimic the dominant anchors by deconvolution of randomized libraries. This approach was previously successful for peptides (7Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.-H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24130-24134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to test its applicability also for non-peptide structures. This work includes, first, the definition of a suitable oligomeric parent structure scaffold; second, the demonstration that randomized peptidomimetic structures can exhibit biological activity; and third, results showing that defined structures can be derived from the randomized libraries. Poly-N-acylated amines were designed based on the structure of a model octapeptide. The nature of the polymer backbone and the side chain functionalities are of fundamental importance in the design of new ligands. The new framework was designed in order to exploit readily available building blocks and efficient coupling reactions. The protocol for the preparation of such poly-N-acylated amines can be fully automated. The developed synthetic strategies were successfully applied to the synthesis of randomized libraries. The central dominant anchor amino acid as well as the backbone at the C-terminal or the central part of the ligand were replaced by non-peptide elements. The structural requirements were determined with two different classes of molecules: a series of defined oligomers with main chain variations and randomized libraries with side chain variations. MHC-binding and MHC-stabilizing compounds were successfully derived from the randomized libraries by deconvolution. The concept was then proven to be suitable for the development of a new class of MHC ligands. The results presented here reveal new aspects of the molecular interaction between the MHC and ligand. Increasing the main chain length and replacing the C-terminal leucine by a polyamine structure result in a complete loss of MHC stabilization. This finding emphasizes the importance of the terminal amino acids for MHC binding. Poly-N-acylated amine binding is improved by including amide bonds in the main chain, supporting earlier reports on the significance of hydrogen bonding MHC side chains and the peptide backbone. The exact position of the amide bond appears to be less important for the binding capacity. This observation might be a reflection of the crystallographic finding that some of the hydrogen bonds are indirect, mediated by incorporated water molecules (4Fremont D.H. Matsumura M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 8Fremont D.H. Stura E.A. Matsumura M. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2479-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Testing different aromatic, heteroaromatic, and pseudoaromatic side chains for the central anchor position revealed interesting new insights into the structural requirements for this position. First, a high flexibility of the side chains was found to be beneficial for the binding, as can be concluded from the comparison of the phenylacetic acid-like with the benzoic acid-like side chains. It is reasonable to assume that the steric constraints of the binding pocket can be fulfilled easier by more flexible side chains. The specific molecular interactions of the aromatic amino acid at the dominant central anchor position of H-2Kb-binding peptides with MHC side chains are of a hydrophobic and aromatic nature (4Fremont D.H. Matsumura M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 31Matsumura M. Fremont D.H. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 257: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polyamine structures containing side chains with large aromatic systems are among the best binders (PAA31 and PAA36 with a naphthyl group). Employing an alternative strategy for designing and incorporating non-peptide elements into MHC-binding peptides, Weiss et al. (24Weiss G.A. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) substituted 3–5 central amino acids of HLA A2.1-, HLA Aw68-, and HLA B27-binding nona- or decapeptides with the tricyclic aromatic compound phenanthridine. The phenanthridine was part of the main chain and incorporated into a central position of the peptide between the two dominant anchor amino acids at positions 2 and 9. These epitope variants bound to the MHC molecules and formed relatively stable crystallizable compounds. In our study, we specifically targeted one of the dominant anchor positions of H-2Kb-binding peptides, which had to fulfill much more stringent structural requirements for fitting into the corresponding pocket of the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule. Moreover, Weiss et al. incorporated the peptide variants into MHC molecules expressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted in the presence of the mixed oligomers. Binding of the compounds used in the present study was done with prefolded intact MHC molecules, leaving less room for artificial adaptation of the MHC molecules. The peptide-MHC complex plays a central role in T cell immunology (1Barber L.D. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 163-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, MHC-binding oligomers may have diverse immunomodulatory functions, e.g. as T cell antagonists or MHC blockers in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (32Franco A. Southwood S. Arrhenius T. Kuchroo V. Grey H.M. Sette A. Ishioka G.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 940-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The increased stability of non-peptide structures to enzymatic degradation should enhance bioavailability for therapeutic applications. In our study, the amino acids that are most important for T cell recognition were replaced by simple linear hydrocarbon spacers. Introduction of additional side chains in these positions could possibly lead to structures with defined effects on T cells, such as enhanced activation (as vaccines) or induction of anergy (as T cell receptor antagonists). Hereby, it is not necessary that the molecules bind tightly to MHC molecules. Besides their potent roles for immunotherapy, poly-N-acylated amines could also be developed for other applications such as design of new hormone receptor antagonists or enzyme inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2081080157,"The mammalian mitochondrial enzyme, rhodanese, can form stable complexes with the Escherichia colichaperonin GroEL if it is either refolded from 8 m urea in the presence of chaperonin or is simply added to the chaperonin as the folded conformer at 37 °C. In the presence of GroEL, the kinetic profile of the inactivation of native rhodanese followed a single exponential decay. Initially, the inactivation rates showed a dependence on the chaperonin concentration but reached a constant maximum value as the GroEL concentration increased. Over the same time period, in the absence of GroEL, native rhodanese showed only a small decline in activity. The addition of a non-denaturing concentration of urea accelerated the inactivation and partitioning of rhodanese onto GroEL. These results suggest that the GroEL chaperonin may facilitate protein unfolding indirectly by interacting with intermediates that exist in equilibrium with native rhodanese. The activity of GroEL-bound rhodanese can be completely recovered upon addition of GroES and ATP. The reactivation kinetics and commitment rates for GroEL-rhodanese complexes prepared from either unfolded or native rhodanese were identical. However, when rhodanese was allowed to inactivate spontaneously in the absence of GroEL, no recovery of activity was observed upon addition of GroEL, GroES, and ATP. Interestingly, the partitioning of rhodanese and its subsequent inactivation did not occur when native rhodanese and GroEL were incubated under anaerobic conditions. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the inactive intermediate that partitions onto GroEL is the reversibly oxidized form of rhodanese.

The chaperonin GroEL together with the co-chaperonin GroES, has been shown to facilitate protein folding in vitro and in vivo (1Richardson A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 138-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GroEL functions as a tetradecamer of identical subunits and can bind a wide variety of unfolded or partially folded proteins (for review, see Fenton and Horwich (2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar)). In the presence of GroES and ATP, the partially folded proteins dissociate from GroEL and can continue to fold either sequestered in the cavity of the transient GroEL-GroES complex or released as an intermediate committed to fold to the native state in solution (3Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the folding reaction does not necessarily have to be completed before the protein exits the GroEL-GroES complex. As the protein substrate folds, the lifetime of the GroEL-GroES complex determines whether the protein completes its folding reaction inside the GroEL-GroES cavity or outside in bulk solution. During the folding reaction, if the protein has not acquired a native state, it can either aggregate, misfold or rebind to the chaperonin complex (3Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that the lifetime of the interaction between folding protein and GroEL depends on the nature of the substrate protein. Different substrate proteins may either require very brief interaction with GroEL (glutamine synthetase, ornithine decarboxylase) or may undergo numerous rounds of rebinding and release from GroEL throughout the folding reaction (rhodanese, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase) (5Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The extensive research on different chaperonin substrates has demonstrated that substrate interactions with the chaperonin are highly variable. This may be related to the variability in the initial conformations of the binding substrate species. Since the protein folding intermediates that bind to the chaperonin are diverse, the chaperonin mechanism observed with one protein substrate may be different with other substrates. During the initial interactions between substrates and the chaperonin, it has been suggested that GroEL recognizes the “molten globule” state of the protein, a compact folding intermediate with significant amount of secondary structure and an ill-defined tertiary structure (4Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). However, other investigators have shown that for some substrates, unfolded early intermediates tend to bind more tightly to the chaperonin than do more compact late folding intermediates (10Badcoe A.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lung P. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9195-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Kuwajima and co-workers argue that the α-lactalbumin molten globule intermediates that contain primarily non-native disulfide rearrangements and bind tightly to GroEL, may not be “molten globules” in the strict sense (15Okazaki A. Ikura T. Nikaido K. Kuwajima K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 1: 439-446Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, Schmid and co-workers have demonstrated that misfolded RNase T is a good substrate for GroEL (16Walter S. Lorimer G.H. Schmid F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups have provided evidence suggesting that there is a substantial amount of native-like folding contacts that can be resolved in stable GroEL-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)1 complexes (17Gross M. Robinson C.V. Mayhew M. Hartl F.- U. Radford S.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2506-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg M.S. Zhang J. Sondek S. Matthews C.R. Fox R.O. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 12189-12194Google Scholar). From the accumulated data, it is apparent that the nature of intermediate polypeptides that can bind to GroEL is substrate dependent. Although a majority of the initial protein substrates used to bind to GroEL in vitro are initially unfolded by denaturants, Viitanen et al. were the first to show that the chaperonins can form complexes with DHFR when this protein was initially present in its native form (19Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because the complex formation was slow, they speculated that a rate-limiting step occurs between the native conformer and a DHFR intermediate that subsequently interacts with the chaperonin. A kinetic analysis by Clark and Frieden (20Clark A.C. Frieden C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 512-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicated that the GroEL-bound DHFR conformers derived from either unfolded or the native state were the same. Recently, it was found that GroEL can form a stable complex with rhodanese when this protein was also present in its native form (7Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Reid B.G. Flynn G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7212-7217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Once the GroEL-rhodanese complex is formed, rhodanese still requires GroES and ATP or ADP for reactivation, and thus remains a stringent chaperonin substrate (22Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work with rhodanese indicated that the denaturation conditions may influence the aggregation propensity of this substrate after its release from GroEL. These results suggest that different unfolded rhodanese intermediates could initially bind to GroEL (7Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data presented in this report indicate that some of the intermediates that can be recognized and bound by GroEL are reversibly oxidized rhodanese species that exist in equilibrium with the native protein. In the presence of reducing agents, the reactivation and commitment rates of the GroEL-bound oxidized conformers are identical to those of GroEL-bound protein species derived from the urea-unfolded rhodanese. Methyl viologen, titanium chloride, sodium thiosulfate, sodium cyanide, ATP, and DTT were purchased from Sigma. Urea, >99% pure, was from ICN Biochemical (Aurora, OH). Bovine liver rhodanese was purchased from Sigma. All the other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The Escherichia coli chaperonins, GroEL and GroES, were isolated from lysates of cells containing the appropriate overexpression plasmids (gift of Dr. George Lorimer and Dr. Edward Eisenstein) and were purified as described earlier (23Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13629-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Eisenstein E. Reddy P. Fisher M.T. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because GroEL or GroES do not contain tryptophan, the loss of the tryptophan indole absorption, assayed by second derivative analysis of absorption spectra, was used as a criterion for purity of the preparations, in addition to analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the final purified forms of GroEL and GroES, no contribution from tryptophan-containing contaminants were detected. Rhodanese was denatured in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mmsodium thiosulfate for 2–4 h at 0 °C. The rhodanese-GroEL complexes were formed at 37 °C after denatured rhodanese was rapidly diluted 100-fold into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate (buffer A) containing 1 μm GroEL and 2 μm GroES. The final rhodanese concentration in all experiments was 1 μm. The complex was incubated at 37 °C for 15 to 120 min before 5 mm ATP was added to initiate refolding. Rhodanese reactivation was followed by monitoring the formation of a stable ferric-thiocyanate color complex (absorbance at 460 nm) after 10 min at 25 °C (26Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of rhodanese was determined from its absorbance spectra after correction for light scattering using an extinction coefficient of 1.75 for a 0.1% solution at 280 nm (27Sorbo B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). Native rhodanese was solubilized in a small volume of buffer A and then diluted into the same buffer to a final concentration of 1 μm. The measurements of the inactivation rates were initiated by addition of 0.1–50 μm GroEL and/or 0.2–100 μm GroES followed by incubation for up to 24 h at 37 °C. The rhodanese activity was determined at regular time intervals. The presence of GroES did not affect inactivation kinetics (data not shown). For some experiments, the inactivation of rhodanese was performed in the absence of DTT and sodium thiosulfate. The reactivation of rhodanese was initiated by adding ATP to the final concentration of 5 mm. To measure the commitment rates, the activity of released rhodanese was assayed after GroEL was rapidly removed from the folding mixture by immunoprecipitation with anti-GroEL antibody (5Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All incubations were carried out in a 37 °C warm air incubator to minimize problems associated with condensation of solution on the sides of the enclosed tubes. Anaerobic solution conditions were achieved by subjecting all concentrated stock solutions to a series of degas/purge cycles with argon in an enclosed argon atmosphere. In addition, all solution buffers were repeatedly degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon. To ensure that oxygen-free conditions are maintained, titanium chloride-reduced methyl viologen was used as both an oxygen indicator and an oxygen scrubber. Final sample mixtures were degassed briefly, placed into thick-wall glass tubes and overlaid with argon-purged mineral oil to maintain anaerobic conditions and prevent the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the solution. No substantial change in sample volumes was observed during the multiple rounds of degassing and purging. In our previous work we have demonstrated that native rhodanese partitions onto GroEL and can be recovered when GroES and ATP is added to GroEL-rhodanese complex (7Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol.

Here, we compared GroEL-induced and spontaneous inactivation of rhodanese and the effect of DTT and sodium thiosulfate on this inactivation. The thiosulfate anion is a substrate of rhodanese and like DTT, its presence prevents oxidative modification of rhodanese (28Cannella C. Berni R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the presence of DTT and sodium thiosulfate, GroEL dramatically enhanced the inactivation of rhodanese (Fig. 1). When incubations were performed without DTT and sodium thiosulfate, the rates of both the spontaneous and GroEL-induced inactivation were significantly increased with the latter inactivation rate remaining the fastest (Fig. 1). However, regardless of the presence of DTT and sodium thiosulfate during inactivation, only the samples that initially included GroEL recovered full activity upon addition of GroES and ATP (Fig. 1). Solution conditions remained “nonpermissive,” i.e. both GroES and ATP were still required for renaturation of rhodanese (data not shown). No significant recovery of activity was detected in the rhodanese samples that were inactivated in the absence of DTT and sodium thiosulfate even though these samples were incubated with 10 μm GroEL for 3 h prior to addition of GroES and ATP (Fig. 1). It appears that the irreversibly inactivated rhodanese either does not interact with or cannot be released from the chaperonin suggesting that GroEL-induced inactivation involves a rhodanese intermediate different from those produced by spontaneous inactivation. It is noteworthy that an increase in native rhodanese activity observed within 30 min of incubation was due to reactivation of lyophilized enzyme upon solvation. In subsequent experiments, solubilized native rhodanese was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of GroEL to achieve a maximum level of reactivation. At 37 °C, in the presence of a molar excess of GroEL, the inactivation reaction proceeded at a defined rate showing an optimal fit to a single exponential decay (Fig. 2, inset). The rates of inactivation were dependent on the GroEL concentration and reached a constant value of approximately 1.7 × 102min−1 (Fig. 2). To test whether a small shift in the unfolding equilibrium may be sufficient to effect the inactivation rates, a nondenaturing concentration of urea (1 m) was included in the inactivation reaction. This addition resulted in an increased rate of GroEL-dependent inactivation of rhodanese (Fig. 2). A similar increase in the inactivation rates was observed when the incubation temperature was raised from 37 °C to 45 °C (data not shown). It appears that GroEL interacts with an intermediate of rhodanese that exists in equilibrium with the native state and that this interaction becomes more prominent under conditions that increase intermediate conformations of the protein. Since different folding intermediates may bind to the chaperonin, it is conceivable that the GroEL-bound rhodanese derived from the native and from the urea-unfolded protein have different conformations. In this case, different rates of renaturation may be observed. Using similar strategies employed by Buchner and co-workers (12Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), the rates of rhodanese refolding were examined at various times after either native or urea-denatured rhodanese were mixed with nucleotide-free GroEL and GroES at 37 °C. After the formation of the complex, ATP was added at various times to release and reactivate GroEL-bound rhodanese. The reactivation data were fit to a single exponential function. The reactivation rates remained constant throughout the inactivation time course (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the rates observed with native rhodanese were identical to those obtained with initially unfolded protein (Fig. 3, A and B), 0.26 ± 0.05 min−1 and 0.28 ± 0.02 min−1, respectively. Although the reactivation rates from the urea denatured or GroEL-inactivated native rhodanese were identical, the rate at which rhodanese is released from GroEL in a state committed to fold to a native protein (i.e. no longer requires the chaperonin) still may depend on the structure of the bound intermediates. Since multiple release and rebinding steps accompany GroEL-dependent rhodanese refolding, it is possible that an intermediate that can commit to the native state may rebind to the chaperonin. These prolonged interactions with the chaperonin will inhibit the folding rate (19Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the commitment rates reflect the properties of protein folding intermediates and their turnover rates with chaperonin (5Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Following the rapid removal of GroEL from the folding mixture by precipitation with anti-GroEL antibody (5Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of protein that commits to a native folded state was assayed. The commitment rates for GroEL-rhodanese complexes formed from the native state mirrored their respective renaturation rates (Fig. 4). Similar data were previously obtained for the urea-unfolded rhodanese (5Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the nature of the rhodanese intermediate that partitions onto GroEL, we have performed experiments in the absence of oxygen. Horowitz and Criscimagna (32Horowitz P. Criscimagna N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10278-10283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that rhodanese is susceptible to numerous oxidative inactivation reactions. Since oxidized rhodanese is more hydrophobic than the native form, the oxidized conformer may preferentially partition onto GroEL. Under anaerobic conditions, a partitioning and inactivation of rhodanese by GroEL no longer occurred after several hours of incubation (Fig. 5). Even after 18 h of incubation, rhodanese exhibited 80–90% of its initial activity (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the rhodanese species partitioning onto GroEL is an oxidized form of rhodanese. We have demonstrated that the rhodanese intermediate that interacts with GroEL under nondenaturing conditions is an oxidized form of rhodanese. This oxidized intermediate exists in equilibrium with native protein and binds to chaperonin even in the presence of stabilizers of native rhodanese such as DTT and sodium thiosulfate (28Cannella C. Berni R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that oxidation of rhodanese involves two steps, a fast and reversible formation of single disulfide bond and/or sulfenyl group and a kinetically slower process of formation of a second disulfide and/or further oxidation of sulfenyl group. The second step is practically irreversible even in the presence of reducing agents (33Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Horowitz P. Bulter M. McClure Jr., G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23596-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that GroEL is capable of recognizing the product of the first oxidation step. After partitioning onto chaperonin, rhodanese is protected from further oxidation and regains its full native activity upon release from GroEL into reducing environment. However, if oxidation of rhodanese is allowed to proceed further and GroEL is added after a significant delay, no activity could be recovered. The identical reactivation and commitment rates observed with either oxidized or unfolded forms of rhodanese suggest a structural similarity of these GroEL-bound forms. However, comparable reactivation and commitment rates may also result from the same kinetic barriers to the formation to the native state. In this latter situation, different intermediates may become bound to GroEL but the rate-limiting step would be the same for a wide variety of different folding intermediates. It is interesting, though, that GroES still remains an absolute requirement for chaperonin-assisted folding regardless of property of the initial state (unfolded or oxidized) of rhodanese. Buchner and co-workers found a correlation between the extent of unfolding and the requirement for GroES to facilitate folding of different oxidation states of Fab antibody fragments with GroEL (12Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,35Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16829-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By these criteria, we suggest that the overall structure of the GroEL bound intermediate derived from the oxidation of native rhodanese is at least as unfolded as the urea-derived intermediate. Previously, Horowitz and co-workers observed that rhodanese inactivation rates increased with temperature but inclusion of GroEL in its high affinity form (no nucleotide) protected the protein from irreversible inactivation (36Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the observed decrease in activity was primarily attributed to thermal inactivation of rhodanese (36Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies have conclusively shown that partitioning of native rhodanese onto GroEL is triggered by an oxidation event. Although there appears to be an increase in rhodanese inactivation with either a temperature increase or in 1 m urea, no GroEL-induced inactivation can be observed at 37 °C when oxygen is removed. Because the oxidation of native rhodanese is required prior to formation of the GroEL-rhodanese complex, the maximal inactivation rate is predicted to be sensitive to the amount of reducing agent (DTT and sodium thiosulfate) present. Indeed, removal of these components results in a much faster decline in the observed rhodanese activity. Our study suggests that oxidized rhodanese undergoes a conformational change resulting in its binding to GroEL. Although the nature of this conformational change has not been identified, it is well known that oxidized proteins in general are more sensitive to thermal denaturation (37Perry L.J. Wetzel R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fisher M.T. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1872-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3096-3100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that oxidation results in a substantial shift in the folding-unfolding equilibrium toward the unfolded species which, in turn, provides the increased source of conformers capable of partitioning onto GroEL. This partitioning may be thermodynamic in origin. Rather than cause an acceleration in unfolding rates, the chaperonins may interact with partially folded intermediates or unfolded states that exist in equilibrium with the native state (i.e. oxidized state in case of rhodanese) to form an energetically favorable substrate-chaperonin complex. Indeed, Schmid and co-workers have recently demonstrated that partitioning of modified Rnase T (which cannot fold to a native state) onto GroEL does not change the rate constants of unfolding (16Walter S. Lorimer G.H. Schmid F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). From our data and previous data by Horowitz and co-workers, we propose a model illustrated in Fig. 6. In the presence of sodium thiosulfate and DTT, increasing concentrations of the chaperonin GroEL will compete against the reactivation reaction and bind a small fraction of reversibly oxidized rhodanese (I ox1). After the oxidized protein binds to the chaperonin (EL- I ox1), the reactivation reaction may become essentially irreversible within our experimental time frame because an additional dissociation step is now required. Alternatively, following the reduction, the dissociation of the reduced intermediate (EL-I rd) may be slow. Since the inactivation rate approaches a constant maximum value at high GroEL concentrations, we suggest that the rate-limiting step in the inactivation reaction is the oxygen-dependent oxidation of native rhodanese (N ↔ I ox1). Eventually, the amount of native rhodanese decreases due to mass action effects and results in the observed inactivation rates of rhodanese in the presence of GroEL. Thus, in the presence of sodium thiosulfate and DTT, continuous oxidative inactivation and reactivation of rhodanese competes with GroEL binding. Under these conditions, we assume that rhodanese eventually partitions onto GroEL because the binding reaction between GroEL and oxidized rhodanese is faster than the re-reduction reaction and the accompanying conformational change. The observation that the removal of sodium thiosulfate and DTT from the solution accelerates the GroEL-dependent inactivation of rhodanese is consistent with this hypothesis. Once bound to GroEL, the initial oxidized conformer of rhodanese is protected from further irreversible oxidation (36Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that any oxidized rhodanese conformer that can be reversibly reactivated can bind to GroEL because rhodanese can be reactivated after GroES, ATP, DTT, and sodium thiosulfate are supplied regardless of whether or not sodium thiosulfate and DTT were initially present. GroEL-bound rhodanese can undergo further reversible reduction and at this point, the intermediates (I rd) generated by the urea unfolding may be the same as the oxidized and re-reduced conformers generated by oxidative modification of native rhodanese. In this case, the reactivation and commitment rates are identical regardless of the initial (either oxidized folded or unfolded) state of rhodanese. With respect to the overall chaperonin mechanism, it is noteworthy that a chaperonin-dependent decline in rhodanese activity was also observed in the presence of ADP-bound form of GroEL, a more physiologically relevant chaperonin capture complex, however, the inactivation kinetics were significantly slower (data not shown). It is unclear if these in vitro observations of chaperonin-dependent inactivation relate to an in vivo phenomenon. It is well known that some proteins undergo oxidative damage in vivo and these types of modification may be major marking steps prior to proteolytic clearance (41Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Since unconstrained proteins (no disulfides) that bind to GroEL are partially unfolded and are more susceptible to proteolysis (4Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 17Gross M. Robinson C.V. Mayhew M. Hartl F.- U. Radford S.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2506-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg M.S. Zhang J. Sondek S. Matthews C.R. Fox R.O. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the observations outlined in this study may illustrate how some of the oxidized thermally labile proteins could be preferentially removed from free solution, maintained in a partially unfolded state, and subsequently cleared. On the other hand, it also may be possible that during in vivo protein oxidation, some proteins could be protected against further irreversible oxidation by interacting with chaperonins or other molecular chaperones. These oxidized conformers could be then re-reduced in the presence of the proper physiological reductants. Our observations carry a cautionary note. Because oxidative damage to proteins can easily occur during protein isolation and general unfolding reactions, intermediates generated by oxidation may contribute to the interactions between protein folding intermediates and GroEL. If appropriate measures are not taken, oxidative modification may also complicate the identification of protein substrates that become bound to the chaperonin following isolation of GroEL-protein substrate complexes. Therefore, in cases where substrate proteins are susceptible to oxidative damage, care must be taken to rule out complicating covalent modifications."
