https://openalex.org/W2019821714,"In two different experiments, subjects reported on the visual direction of a flash presented during a voluntary saccade relative to the visual direction of a stimulus viewed prior to the saccade. Under the conditions of the first experiment the report given by the subject was primarily determined by the relative retinal positions of the two stimuli. In the second experiment evidence was obtained for precisely timed shifts in local signs which are due to proprioceptive compensation for changes in ocular position during the saccade."

https://openalex.org/W1992318037,"An autosomal recessive mutation, characterized by an absence of sebaceous glands, and by hyperkeratosis, alopecia, and single (rather than the usual multiple) hair-follicle units, has occurred spontaneously in the BALB/c strain of mouse. Studies in which reciprocal transplantations of skin were made between normal and mutant mice suggest that some diffusible substance(s) synthesized by normal skin can stimulate hair growth and alleviate the hyperkeratosis characteristic of the skin syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1988575162,"When cell division in barley roots is halted by treatment with aluminum, DNA synthesis continues. However, the type of DNA synthesized has an unusual base composition and is metabolically labile. A part of this labile DNA was found in the form of a hybrid composed of genetic DNA and labile DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2032066822,Unusually rugged microelectrodes for recording the activity of single nerve cells or fibers can be constructed from tapered tungsten wire on which a glass capillary is collapsed and surface bonded. Tip diameter in the range between 1 and 5 microns provides relatively low impedance detection of extracellular potentials.

https://openalex.org/W2052684778,"Inhibition of shoot elongation in dwarf and tall peas by the 1,1-dimethylhydrazide of succinic acid (B-995) was correlated with the inhibition of the oxidation of tryptamine-2-C(14) to indoleacetaldehyde-2-C(14) in homogenates prepared from epicotyls of young plants treated with B-995. The growth-retarding action of B-995 is attributed to the formation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine in vivo. This hydrazine strongly inhibited tryptamine oxidation by pea epicotyl homogenates."
https://openalex.org/W2042949110,"Radiocarbon ages of basal peats 4500 years old or younger and the thickness of salt-marsh peat in the lagoon east of Wachapreague, Virginia, are nearly the same as those of equivalent samples from New Jersey and Cape Cod. This suggests that these coasts have had similar submergence histories. Data obtained from the coasts of Connecticut and northeastern Massachusetts indicate that the Atlantic coast of the United States has been differentially warped during the later Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W1990543275,"Concordia resolution of uranium-lead analyses of zircons from rocks of the Guatemalan Cordillera indicates a period of plutonism, and perhaps metamorphism, in late Paleozoic times (345 +/- 20 million years). Gneisses of the Chuacus Series yield an age of 1075 +/- 25 million years which may be either the age of a source terrain for the original sediments, or the age of principal metamorphism. Zircons from a Paleozoic granite intruding the gneisses appear to contain inherited or contaminating material acquired during the process of magma generation or emplacement, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1968929552,"In patients (93) with either essential or renal hypertension the concentration of lactic acid in both venous and arterial blood was significantly (p .001) elevated, whereas there was no significant increase (p .127) in the concentration of blood pyruvate. Neither renal insufficiency nor various modes of therapy could be correlated with this increase in lactic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2066640460,The radio brightness temperature and radar cross section spectra of Venus are in much better accord with surface boundary conditions deduced from a combination of the Mariner V results and the radar radius than those obtained by the Venera 4 space probe. The average surface temperature and pressure are approximately 750 degrees K and 90 atmospheres.
https://openalex.org/W2035121466,"The glucose preference of four squirrel monkeys was determined by presenting 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-percent solutions according to the paired comparison method. Scaling of the data for the amounts of each solution consumed yielded a preference function which increased monotonically with the concentration of the solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2045731844,"Skin tissue, bone collagen, and vegetal clothing from a well-preserved Indian mummy from a dry cave in Nevada have been analyzed radiochemically. The age is about 2500 years; the ages obtained for the various samples were in close agreement."
https://openalex.org/W2017580139,With some knowledge of perspective and by use of a perspective chart it is possible to construct an accurate three-dimensional illustration depicting the interrelation of tissue components from electron micrographs of serial sections of biological materials. Tracings of pertinent structures from electron micrographs are overlaid with a grid plane and subsequently redrawn on a perspective grid plane. The new tracings are then connected to one another in the most logical manner to form an illustration in perspective.
https://openalex.org/W2040357211,"Rejection of homografts of rabbit skin can be delayed by treatment with either chlorpromazine, perphenazine, or promethazine. Promethazine can also delay rejection of second-set homografts. The membrane protective action of these phenothiazine derivatives appears to be the most likely mechanism of this activity."
https://openalex.org/W2033628870,"Progress is being made, undoubtedly, in the development of mechanisms for assessing federal science operations. One must conclude, however, that the Wooldridge Committee approach does not serve as a model for the future. The committee did not avoid built-in biases of interested parties in selecting its advisory panels. It did not publish the criteria it used in making assessments of research performance. It did not propose alternative actions. It did not provide adequate documentation either to support its own findings and recommendations or to enable readers to make independent assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2049531548,"A hybrid polymerase which catalyzes the synthesis only of helical polynucleotides with one DNA-like strand and one RNA-like strand can be altered by certain treatments so that it will then synthesize DNA and RNA. There is evidence that the alteration involves a separation or rearrangement of polymerase subunits of several kinds. Two types of RNA polymerase activity have been found: one produces single chains, and the other, two complementary chains simultaneously. The latter type of RNA polymerase, the hybrid polymerase, and the DNA polymerase behave as though they were bifunctional, and each may be composed of two monofunctional subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2086871536,"In a problematical fauna discovered in Australia, 152 meters below diagnostic Lower Cambrian species, are fossilized remains belonging in the phylum Coelenterata. These jellyfish-like fossils were defined as a new class(Dipleurozoa) by Harrington and Moore because of their strong bilateral symmetry and differentiated extremities. The class was not reported elsewhere before many specimens were discovered recently in the Shawangunk (Tuscarora) formation at Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania. Three new species belonging to a new genus can be recognized, the indication being that the class ranges stratigraphically from the infra-Cambrian to at least the Lower Silurian, and geographically from Australia to eastern North America."

Apparent isotopic exchange is thus very rapid at low concentrations of iodine, and previously reported values of organic ""retention,"" obtained in studies of (n, gamma) recoil in alkyl iodide, are placed in doubt."

https://openalex.org/W2075244005,A thin layer of coarse till overlies clay-rich till in northwestern North Dakota. That the thin layer is not a superglacial facies of the underlying clayey till is indicated by (i) geomorphic relations; (ii) contrasted lithologies; (iii) restricted area of exposure; (iv) absence of a similar deposit on a younger clayey till in a comparable topographic environment; (v) presence of a probable paleosol; (vi) an intervening unconformity; and (vii) occurrence of clayey facies of the upper deposit. The deposit is believed to represent a younger till.
