Upon flagellin detection, NAIP5 and NLRC4 form a hetero-oligomeric inflammasome that induces caspase-1-dependent cell death. So far, both the mechanism of formation of the NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome and its structure are poorly understood. In this study we combine inflammasome reconstitution in HEK293 cells, purification of inflammasome components, and negative stain electron microscopy to address these issues. We find that a Salmonella typhimurium flagellin fragment comprising the D0 domain and the neighboring spoke region is able to co-precipitate NAIP5 and induce formation of the NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome. Comparison with smaller fragments indicates that flagellin recognition is mediated by its C-terminal residues as well as the spoke region. We reconstitute the inflammasome from purified flagellin, NAIP5, and NLRC4, thus proving that no other cellular components are required for its formation. Electron micrographs of the purified inflammasome provide unprecedented insight into its architecture, revealing disk-like complexes consisting of 11 or 12 protomers in which NAIP5 and NLRC4 appear to occupy equivalent positions. On the basis of our data, we propose a model for inflammasome formation wherein direct interaction of flagellin with a single NAIP5 induces the recruitment and progressive incorporation of NLRC4, resulting in the formation of a hetero-oligomeric inflammasome.

In patients with T2DM, the prevalence of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency is almost twice that for nondiabetics and doubles the relative risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with diabetic patients with normal 25(OH)D. We tested the hypothesis that monocytes from vitamin D-deficient subjects will have a proatherogenic phenotype compared with vitamin D-sufficient subjects in 43 patients with T2DM. Serum 25(OH)D level inversely correlated with monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells even after adjustment for demographic and comorbidity characteristics. Vitamin D-sufficient patients (≥30 ng/ml 25(OH)D) had lower monocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a predominance of M1 over M2 macrophage membrane receptors, and decreased mRNA expression of monocyte adhesion molecules PSGL-1, β1-integrin, and β2-integrin compared with patients with 25(OH)D levels of <30 ng/ml. In vitamin D-deficient macrophages, activation of ER stress increased adhesion and adhesion molecule expression and induced an M2-predominant phenotype. Moreover, adding 1,25(OH)2D3 to vitamin D-deficient macrophages shifted their phenotype toward an M1-predominant phenotype with suppressed adhesion. Conversely, deletion of the vitamin D receptor in macrophages from diabetic patients activated ER stress, accelerated adhesion, and increased adhesion molecule expression. The absence of ER stress protein CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein suppressed monocyte adhesion, adhesion molecule expression, and the M2-predominant phenotype induced by vitamin D deficiency. Thus, vitamin D is a natural ER stress reliever that induced an antiatherogenic monocyte/macrophage phenotype.

Very little is known about the mechanisms by which insulin resistance and chronic inflammation promote vascular complications in patients with T2DM. Accumulation of monocyte-derived cells in the vessel wall is a key feature of diabetes-related complications, but it is unclear whether a shift of monocyte subtype influences this vascular inflammation. Peripheral blood monocytes are typically defined by cell surface lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 and Fcγ receptor III CD16 as CD14hi/CD16− (classical) and CD14lo/CD16+ (nonclassical) (2Passlick B. Flieger D. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Identification and characterization of a novel monocyte subpopulation in human peripheral blood.Blood. 1989; 74: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of CD14lo/CD16+ monocytes rises in patients with coronary artery disease compared with healthy controls and significantly correlates with carotid intimal medial thickness in healthy populations (3Schlitt A. Heine G.H. Blankenberg S. Espinola-Klein C. Dopheide J.F. Bickel C. Lackner K.J. Iz M. Meyer J. Darius H. Rupprecht H.J.

Heart J. 2010; 31: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, diabetic patients with coronary artery disease have no difference in the proportion of CD14lo/CD16+ monocytes compared with diabetics or healthy individuals without coronary artery disease, thus raising controversy regarding the importance of these monocyte phenotype markers in vascular disease (5Patiño R. Ibarra J. Rodriguez A. Yagüe M.R. Pintor E. Fernandez-Cruz A. Figueredo A. Circulating monocytes in patients with diabetes mellitus, arterial disease, and increased CD14 expression.Am. J.

Monocytes also express the same surface markers used to classify macrophages into the classically activated M1 or alternatively activated M2 subtype, and mounting evidence indicates the importance of these subtypes in the development of atherosclerosis (6Bouhlel M.A. Derudas B.

Helming L. Gordon S. Alternative activation of macrophages. An immunologic functional perspective.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 451-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). In obese subjects, peripheral monocytes have reduced expression of M2 markers (8Bories G. Caiazzo R. Derudas B. Copin C. Raverdy V. Pigeyre M. Pattou F. Staels B. Chinetti-Gbaguidi G. Diabetes Vasc. Dis. Res. 2012; 9: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Monocytes from obese type 2 diabetics have lower levels of IL-10 and CD163 expression compared with obese nondiabetics, suggestive of decreased M2 macrophage markers, and this phenotype correlates with increased arterial stiffness (9Satoh N. Shimatsu A. Himeno A. Sasaki Y. Yamakage H. Yamada K. Suganami T. Ogawa Y. Unbalanced M1/M2 phenotype of peripheral blood monocytes in obese diabetic patients. Effect of pioglitazone.Diabetes Care. 2010; 33: e7Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of these monocyte phenotypes to atherosclerotic development is unknown. Both the M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes are known to be present in plaques (6Bouhlel M.A. Derudas B. Rigamonti E. Dièvart R. Brozek J. Haulon S. Zawadzki C. Jude B. Torpier G. Marx N. Staels B.

M1 macrophages, induced by IFNγ, release proinflammatory cytokines and generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, accelerating additional immune cell recruitment and vascular subendothelial cell remodeling (10Tacke F. Alvarez D. Kaplan T.J. Jakubzick C. Spanbroek R. Llodra J. Garin A. Liu J. Mack M. van Rooijen N. Lira S.A. Habenicht A.J. Randolph G.J. Monocyte subsets differentially employ CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 to accumulate within atherosclerotic plaques.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). M2 macrophages, induced by IL-4, IL-10, or immunocomplex plus LPS, represent a more heterogeneous group of cells with pro- and anti-inflammatory functions (11Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S.

Current knowledge is evolving but suggests that M1 macrophages perpetuate inflammation associated with atherosclerosis, whereas M2 cells are more likely to become foam cells (8Bories G. Caiazzo R.

Monocyte infiltration as part of inflammatory responses first requires the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium through multiple cell-cell interactions. These include the interaction of circulating monocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) with P- or E-selectin to tether monocytes to the endothelium, followed by the interaction of monocyte β1- and β2-integrin with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 to promote tight adhesion (16Woollard K.J. Geissmann F. Monocytes in atherosclerosis. Subsets and functions.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2010; 7: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In patients with diabetes, high glucose conditions enhance monocyte adhesion to the endothelium by increasing integrin subunit expression on monocytes and increasing secretion of endothelial adhesion molecules (17Fasching P.

High glucose-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes in monocytic cells.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Interestingly, insulin resistance without hyperglycemia similarly up-regulates adhesion molecules and increases adhesion (21Chen N.G. Abbasi F. Lamendola C. McLaughlin T. Cooke J.P. Tsao P.S.

Metab. 1999; 84: 3485-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is also a potent inducer of prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in monocytes and macrophages (23Komura T. Sakai Y. Honda M. Takamura T. Matsushima K. Kaneko S. CD14+ monocytes are vulnerable and functionally impaired under endoplasmic reticulum stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 634-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Han S.

Macrophage insulin receptor deficiency increases ER stress-induced apoptosis and necrotic core formation in advanced atherosclerotic lesions.Cell metabolism. 2006; 3: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The ER is a dynamic membranous organelle that facilitates correct protein modification, folding, and maturation of proteins. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive intracellular signaling pathway that responds to ER stress by attenuating global protein translation and degrading unfolded proteins (25Hotamisligil G.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and atherosclerosis.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 651-658Google Scholar). In mouse models of diet-induced insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, up-regulated UPR markers are detected in intimal macrophages at early stages of vascular inflammation, prior to development of fatty streaks or atherosclerotic plaques (27Zhou J. Lhoták S. Hilditch B.A. Austin R.C. Activation of the unfolded protein response occurs at all stages of atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.Circulation. 2005; 111: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Suppression of ER stress in the same mouse models decreases vascular inflammation and prevents the development of atherosclerosis (28Erbay E. Babaev V.R. Mayers J.R. Makowski L. Charles K.N. Snitow M.E. Fazio S. Wiest M.M. Watkins S.M. Linton M.F. Hotamisligil G.S. Reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress through a macrophage lipid chaperone alleviates atherosclerosis.Nat.

Res. 2010; 107: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding whether the increased ER stress in monocytes from diabetics generates a subtype that accelerates vascular inflammation will be essential in the generation of therapeutic targets. Vitamin D deficiency is a largely unacknowledged epidemic associated with incident T2DM and cardiovascular disease (30Pittas A.G. Chung M. Trikalinos T. Mitri J. Brendel M. Patel K. Lichtenstein A.H.

Deficiency of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), the principal storage form of vitamin D, is 30% more prevalent in diabetics than in control subjects and nearly doubles the relative risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with diabetic patients with normal 25(OH)D levels (33Cigolini M. Iagulli M.P. Miconi V. Galiotto M. Lombardi S. Targher G.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its converting enzyme, 25(OH)D3-1α-hydroxylase, are present in monocytes and macrophages. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the active form of vitamin D, facilitates adhesion in monocytic cell lines and stimulates differentiation of myeloid progenitors into macrophages in vitro through the VDR (35Polla B.S. Healy A.M. Amento E.P. Krane S.M. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 maintains adherence of human monocytes and protects them from thermal injury.J. Clin.

In freshly isolated monocytes from type 2 diabetics or nondiabetic patients, vitamin D prevents production of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6) after stimulation with LPS through inhibition of nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation and p38 phosphorylation (37Du T.

Vitamin D inhibits monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory cytokine production by targeting MAPK phosphatase-1.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 2127-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). During monocyte differentiation, the ER reorganizes both structurally and functionally to carry out new cell functions, leading to ER stress (39Dickhout J.G. Lhotak S. Hilditch B.A. Basseri S. Colgan S.M. Lynn E.G. Carlisle R.E. Zhou J. Sood S.K. Ingram A.J. Austin R.C. FASEB J. 2011; 25: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Schaefer A. Magócsi M. Stöcker U. Kósa F.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8786-8791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses ER stress in macrophages from diabetic patients and prevents foam cell formation, indicating that active vitamin D modulates macrophage atherogenic properties through an ER stress-dependent mechanism (41Oh J. Weng S. Felton S.K. Bhandare S. Riek A. Butler B. Proctor B.M. Petty M. Chen Z. Schechtman K.B. Bernal-Mizrachi L. Bernal-Mizrachi C. 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D inhibits foam cell formation and suppresses macrophage cholesterol uptake in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Circulation. 2009; 120: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the suppression of ER stress shifts M2-predominant macrophages to M1-predominant cells and decreases foam cell formation, suggesting that regulation of ER stress by vitamin D could be a potential therapy for atherosclerosis. To determine whether vitamin D has ER stress-dependent effects on innate immune cell properties that influence the proinflammatory state seen in patients with diabetes, we collected peripheral blood monocytes from patients with and without T2DM with varying levels of serum 25(OH)D. We evaluated whether vitamin D level is associated with markers of monocyte subtypes, the relative balance of M1 and M2 cells, and monocyte/macrophage adhesion to fibronectin and human endothelial cells. We also explored the effects of vitamin D on ER homeostasis in regulation of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and proatherogenic properties in type 2 diabetic patients. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 43 patients with T2DM and 25 patients without diabetes with varying levels of 25(OH)D. The subjects were voluntarily recruited from the outpatient clinics at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO). Subjects underwent a single venous blood draw for monocyte isolation, and the 25(OH)D level was measured by radioimmunoassay through DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN). Peripheral monocytes were isolated by standard Ficoll isolation techniques and selected by CD14 marker positivity (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Monocytes were stabilized for 3 h in 100% serum from the original patient to mimic in vivo conditions prior to any procedures. To induce differentiation of monocytes into vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient macrophages, monocytes were cultured for 5 days in vitamin D-deficient medium (deficient in both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D; obtained by DMEM plus 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS) supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Sigma) with or without 1,25(OH)2D3 at 10−8 mol/liter. ER stress was inhibited by adding phenyl butyric acid (PBA; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 16 h to macrophages cultured in vitamin D-deficient medium. ER stress was induced by adding thapsigargin (Sigma) for 24 h to macrophages cultured in vitamin D-supplemented medium. Peripheral blood and bone marrow monocytes were derived from 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice lacking CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and WT C57BL/6 mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet for 4 weeks. The monocytes were selected by CD11b marker positivity (Miltenyi Biotec). The monocytes were stabilized for 3 h in DMEM plus 10% serum from the original mouse to mimic in vivo conditions prior to any procedures. 96-well plates were coated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Lonza, Atlanta, GA; 3 × 105 cells/well) or with fibronectin (Sigma) overnight. The monocytes and macrophages (0.1 × 105 cells/plate) were added to HUVEC or to fibronectin-coated plates and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Adhered cells were then washed, fixed in formaldehyde, and stained with crystal violet. Well absorbance was read at 585 nm. Reverse transcription-qPCR analyses were performed by Sybrgreen methodologies (supplemental Table S1). The results were normalized to the housekeeping gene L32. Western blot analyses from macrophage protein extracts were normalized to β-actin expression. Monocytes derived from patients were incubated with antibodies for markers of monocyte differentiation (CD16-FITC and CD14-PE; E-Bioscience, San Diego, CA), M1 macrophage differentiation (CCR7-APC and CD86-PE; E-Bioscience), and M2 macrophage differentiation (CD163-PE and mannose receptor (MR)-PE-CyTM5; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) (supplemental Fig. S1). Antibody specificity for M1 and M2 markers was validated using stimulated macrophages differentiated from vitamin D-sufficient human monocytes to induce the M1 or M2 phenotype (IFNγ/LPS to stimulate M1 and IL-4, IL-10, or immunocomplex plus LPS to stimulate M2; supplemental Fig. S1). Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACStar Plus. The macrophage phenotype ratio (MPR) was calculated as (CCR7 + CD86 expression)/(CD163 + MR expression), all expressed as a percentage of cells positive, to determine the relative abundance of M1 and M2 cell subtypes (see further details in supplemental methods and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Human monocytes were cultured for 5 days to induce macrophage differentiation in vitamin D-sufficient conditions and then infected with lentivirus containing either VDR-siRNA or control-siRNA. Assays were performed 72 h after recovering from viral infection. SPSS and GraphPad Prism software were used for statistical calculations. Descriptive variables were expressed as the means ± S.D. for continuous data and as a ratio for categorical data. Experiments were carried out with duplicate or triplicate samples. Analytic data were expressed as the means ± S.E. for continuous variables. Normal distribution of continuous variables was verified graphically. Pearson correlations were used to compare continuous variables. Statistical significance of differences was calculated using a t test for parametric data involving two groups or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test for parametric data involving three or more groups. The differences were considered statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05. To address possible confounders of the associations between 25(OH)D level and monocyte phenotype caused by demographic characteristics or comorbidities, we performed simple and multiple linear regression models for each monocyte outcome, including adhesion to fibronectin, adhesion to HUVEC, and macrophage phenotype ratio. Demographic information included gender, race, and age. The comorbidity data were first divided by comorbidity type (T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, and obesity) to select the factor from each category with the strongest association with the monocyte outcomes or, if none were significant, that which we judged most likely to be reflective of current disease. For each demographic and comorbidity characteristic, we performed a simple linear regression model with each monocyte outcome and then expanded each model by force-entering 25(OH)D level to determine improvement in the model. For the final model for each monocyte outcome, we performed a multiple linear regression model with two force-entered blocks, the first including the measures of comorbidities (A1c, systolic blood pressure, statin use, any tobacco use, and body mass index (BMI)) and demographics (gender, race, age) and the second including 25(OH)D level to determine the improvement in the model with the addition of vitamin D. We recognize that the final nine factors included in the regression models are greater than typically used for this sample size, but because the 25(OH)D level consistently showed a significant improvement in each individual model, we included both comorbidity and demographic data in the final models. The initial population consisted of 25 healthy, nondiabetic subjects who were predominantly female and Caucasian. This population had a mean age of 36 ± 12 years, BMI of 26 ± 7 kg/m2, blood pressure of 124/80 ± 17/10 mm Hg, and 25(OH)D level of 26 ± 12 ng/ml. Only 16% had hypertension, 4% had dyslipidemia, and 16% had a current or past history of tobacco use. We also studied 43 obese adult subjects with T2DM, 51% female with race distribution 51% African American and 49% Caucasian. This population had a mean age of 56 ± 8.8 years, BMI of 38 ± 7.7 kg/m2, blood pressure of 135/80 ± 16/10 mm Hg, and 25(OH)D level of 25 ± 12 ng/ml. 41% had a well controlled T2DM with A1c level ≤7.0%, 16% were on insulin therapy, and almost half (48%) had T2DM for more than 5 years. Most were on treatment for hypertension (74%) and/or dyslipidemia (57%), and 18% were active smokers. To determine whether vitamin D status is associated with inf"

One is a selective MC4R agonist.The analogues retain the native kalata B1 scaffold and introduce a designed pharmacological activity, validating cyclotides as protein engineering scaffolds.A novel type of melanocortin agonist has been developed, with potential as a drug lead for treating obesity. Obesity is an increasingly important global health problem that lacks current treatment options. The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is a target for obesity therapies because its activation triggers appetite suppression and increases energy expenditure. Cyclotides have been suggested as scaffolds for the insertion and stabilization of pharmaceutically active peptides. In this study, we explored the development of appetite-reducing peptides by synthesizing MC4R agonists based on the insertion of the His-Phe-Arg-Trp sequence into the cyclotide kalata B1. The ability of the analogues to fold similarly to kalata B1 but display MC4R activity were investigated. Four peptides were synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl peptide chemistry with a C-terminal thioester to facilitate backbone cyclization. The structures of the peptides were found to be similar to kalata B1, evaluated by Hα NMR chemical shifts. KB1(GHFRWG;23-28) had a K(i) of 29 nm at the MC4R and was 107 or 314 times more selective over this receptor than MC1R or MC5R, respectively, and had no detectable binding to MC3R. The peptide had higher affinity for the MC4R than the endogenous agonist, α-melanocyte stimulation hormone, but it was less potent at the MC4R, with an EC(50) of 580 nm for activation of the MC4R. In conclusion, we synthesized melanocortin analogues of kalata B1 that preserve the structural scaffold and display receptor binding and functional activity. KB1(GHFRWG;23-28) is potent and selective for the MC4R. This compound validates the use of cyclotides as scaffolds and has the potential to be a new lead for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1976290763,"A search for a surviving companion star of the progenitor of type Ia supernova 1006 indicates that fewer than 20 per cent of such supernovae result from the accretion onto the progenitor star of material from a companion that survives the process rather than being destroyed. Type Ia supernovae are thought to occur in binaries containing a white dwarf and a companion that is a red giant, subgiant, main-sequence star or another white dwarf. In the last of these options, the 'double-degenerate' case, the two white dwarfs would merge before the explosion and no companion would be left. In a single-degenerate system the former companion star would survive. Previous searches for remnant companions have revealed one contested case for the Tycho Brahe supernova SN 1572. More recently, observations have restricted surviving companions to small, main-sequence stars, ruling out giant companions. Jonay González Hernández et al. report the result of a search for surviving companions to the progenitor of SN 1006 and find no sign of a former companion. Together with previous results, this suggests that fewer than 20% of type Ia supernovae occur through the single-degenerate channel, the slow accumulation of mass from a large star. The more common trigger, it seems, is the rapid break-up of a smaller orbiting white dwarf. Type Ia supernovae are thought to occur when a white dwarf made of carbon and oxygen accretes sufficient mass to trigger a thermonuclear explosion1. The accretion could be slow, from an unevolved (main-sequence) or evolved (subgiant or giant) star2,3 (the single-degenerate channel), or rapid, as the primary star breaks up a smaller orbiting white dwarf3,4 (the double-degenerate channel). A companion star will survive the explosion only in the single-degenerate channel5. Both channels might contribute to the production of type Ia supernovae6,7, but the relative proportions of their contributions remain a fundamental puzzle in astronomy. Previous searches for remnant companions have revealed one possible case for SN 1572 (refs 8, 9), although that has been questioned10. More recently, observations have restricted surviving companions to be small, main-sequence stars11,12,13, ruling out giant companions but still allowing the single-degenerate channel. Here we report the results of a search for surviving companions of the progenitor of SN 1006 (ref. 14). None of the stars within 4 arc minutes of the apparent site of the explosion is associated with the supernova remnant, and we can firmly exclude all giant and subgiant stars from being companions of the progenitor. In combination with previous results, our findings indicate that fewer than 20 per cent of type Ia supernovae occur through the single-degenerate channel."

Briefly, harvested NCCIT cells were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linked cells were then lysed in SDS lysis buffer, and DNA was sonicated.

A gene body region was defined as the region spanning the transcriptional start site (TSS) to the end site, according to the Refseq identifiers. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (43Suganuma T. Kawabata M. Ohshima T. Ikeda M.A. Growth suppression of human carcinoma cells by reintroduction of the p300 coactivator.Proc.

The cell pellets were resuspended in 5× volumes of extraction buffer I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) containing protease inhibitor, mixed well, vortexed for 15 s, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Then 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.9%, and the cells were vortexed for 15 s and incubated on ice for 5 min. Each sample was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to precipitate the cell nuclei, and the supernatant was completely removed. The pelleted cell nuclei were washed twice with extraction buffer I, mixed well with extraction buffer II (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor, vortexed for 20 s, and incubated on ice for 40 min. The nuclear suspension was then vortexed for 10 s, homogenized by being passed through a 23-gauge syringe needle 4–6 times, and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken as the nuclear extract and was incubated overnight with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma; A2220). The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with extraction buffer II, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The samples were then separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibodies. The peptide pulldown assay was performed as previously described (44Li B. Howe L. Anderson S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Workman J.L. The Set2 histone methyltransferase functions through the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.J. Biol.

The synthetic unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Ser-5 and Ser-2 CTD peptides were kindly provided from Drs. Bing Li and Jerry Workman, and the synthetic 6PC (a scrambled CTD-like peptide with phosphoserine) and phosphorylated Ser-5/2 CTD peptides were synthesized by AnaSpec (Fremont, CA). The biotinylated CTD peptides (∼1.5 μg) were bound to 0.1 mg of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M280 in 100 μl of CTD coupling buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 h. The peptide-bound beads were washed once with CTD coupling buffer and twice with peptide pulldown buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40) and were finally resuspended in 50 μl of peptide pulldown buffer. Proteins (500–1000 ng) were mixed with the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a Dyna-Mixer (Dynal). Following three washes with peptide pulldown buffer, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. Sequences that could effectively silence the expression of hDot1l were selected as follows: 5′-AGAAGCUGUUGAAGGAGAAUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUCUCCUUCAACAGCUUCUUU-3′ (antisense). The control siRNA sequences against Egfp were 5′-GUUCAGCGUGUCCGGCGAGUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-CUCGCCGGACACGCUGAACUU-3′ (antisense). The 21-nucleotide synthetic siRNA duplexes were prepared by Samchully Pharm (Seoul, Korea). NCCIT cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded to 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with hDot1l or control siRNA using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection by Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR. The ChIP-seq data from this study are available from NCBI GEO under accession number GSE26598. To investigate whether hDOT1L binds to RNAPII, we subjected nuclear extracts from HEK293T and NCCIT cells to co-immunoprecipitation analyses using specific antibodies. Interestingly, the immunoprecipitation of full-length hDOT1L followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Ser5-P, Ser5/2-P, and Ser2-P CTD resulted in the detection of RNAPIIo form, with phosphorylated CTD, in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). hDOT1L did not co-immunoprecipitate with the negative control, hSNF5/INI1, which is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Enl/MLLT1, a component of the hDOT1L complex, was used as a positive control. Furthermore, cells that had been depleted of hDOT1L by siRNA transfection did not show co-immunoprecipitation of RNAPIIo (Fig. 1B, compare lane 5 (Egfp) with lane 6 (hDOT1L knockdown)). These results suggest that hDOT1L physically associates with the RNAPII with phosphorylated CTD in cultured cells. To further support the assertion that hDOT1L interacts with phosphorylated RNAPII, we employed α-amanitin-resistant human RNAPII large subunit (hRpb1) mutants (45de la Mata M. Kornblihtt A.R. RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain mediates regulation of alternative splicing by SRp20.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that hDOT1L interacted with the phosphorylated form of RNAPII (52R and 19R) but not the mutant without a CTD (0R) (Fig. 1C). Integrity of CTD length also appeared to play a role in the interaction because the ratio of the IP band of the phosphorylated RNAPII over that of the input of 19R (0.37 for Rpb1 and 0.10 for Ser(P)-5/2) was lower than that of 52R (1.00 for Rpb1 and 0.46 for Ser(P)-5/2). These data strongly reinforce the notion that there is a physical interaction between hDOT1L and the phosphorylated CTD of RNAPII. Previous studies using defined biotinylated synthetic CTD peptides in yeast showed that the H3K36 histone methyltransferase, ySet2p, directly binds to CTD peptides phosphorylated at Ser-5 and Ser-2 (44Li B. Howe L. Anderson S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Workman J.L. The Set2 histone methyltransferase functions through the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We adopted a similar system using CTD peptides that consisted of three repeats of the heptad sequence (YSPTSPS). hDOT1L bound to singly phosphorylated CTD peptides (CTD-Ser(P)-5 and CTD-Ser(P)-2), as well as the doubly phosphorylated CTD peptide (CTD-Ser(P)-5/2) (Fig. 2, upper panel). In contrast, hDOT1L did not bind to a scrambled CTD-like peptide with phosphoserine (6PC) (Fig. 2, upper panel), indicating that amino acid context as well as phosphoserine was important for the binding. As a positive control, yeast Set2 also bound to the phosphorylated CTD peptides as expected (Fig. 2, bottom panel) (48Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. A novel domain in Set2 mediates RNA polymerase II interaction and couples histone H3 K36 methylation with transcript elongation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that hDOT1L directly binds to the phosphorylated CTD of actively transcribing RNAPII. Because our data indicate that hDOT1L interacts with RNAPII in cultured cells, we hypothesized that the genome-wide localization of hDOT1L would correlate with that of RNAPII during active transcription. To examine this point, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of hDOT1L and RNAPII in undifferentiated human embryonic carcinoma NCCIT cells. We also compared the ChIP data of hDOT1L and RNAPII with our previous results about H3K79 mono-, di-, and trimethylation and H2Bub1 ChIP data and mRNA-seq data from NCCIT cells downloaded from the GEO database (accession number GSE25882) (32Jung I.

Our results revealed that hDOT1L and RNAPII manifested strong signals at and around the TSSs (5 kb upstream/downstream) (Fig. 3A, left panel), whereas the relative signal rapidly decreased along transcribed regions near the transcription end sites (5 kb upstream/downstream) (Fig. 3A, right panel). The signal patterns for H2Bub1 displayed a strong 5′ bias along the transcribed regions, as did those for all three H3K79 methylations (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2). In all cases, highly expressed genes (black lines) displayed stronger signal intensities compared with lowly expressed genes (green lines) (Fig. 3A). Among the 3,757 hDOT1L-targeted genes we identified, 3,170 were also targeted by RNAPII (Fig. 3B). Importantly, 89% of the hDOT1L peaks overlapped with those of RNAPII at the promoter regions, and 54% of the hDOT1L peaks overlapped with those of RNAPII at the 5′-UTR regions, suggesting that the specific functions of hDOT1L in association with RNAPII are concentrated in these regions (Fig. 3C).

In addition to a high affinity binding site, SERT possesses a low affinity allosteric site for antidepressants. Binding to the allosteric site impedes dissociation of antidepressants from the high affinity site, which may enhance antidepressant efficacy. Here we employ an induced fit docking/molecular dynamics protocol to identify the residues that may be involved in the allosteric binding in the extracellular vestibule located above the central substrate binding (S1) site. Indeed, mutagenesis of selected residues in the vestibule reduces the allosteric potency of (S)-citalopram and clomipramine. The identified site is further supported by the inhibitory effects of Zn2+ binding in an engineered site and the covalent attachment of benzocaine-methanethiosulfonate to a cysteine introduced in the extracellular vestibule. The data provide a mechanistic explanation for the allosteric action of antidepressants at SERT and suggest that the role of the vestibule is evolutionarily conserved among neurotransmitter:sodium symporter proteins as a binding pocket for small molecule ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2092452187,"Haterumalides are halogenated macrolides with strong antitumor properties, making them attractive targets for chemical synthesis. Unfortunately, current synthetic routes to these molecules are inefficient. The potent haterumalide, oocydin A, was previously identified from two plant-associated bacteria through its high bioactivity against plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. In this study, we describe oocydin A (ooc) biosynthetic gene clusters identified by genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and chemical analysis in four plant-associated enterobacteria of the Serratia and Dickeya genera. Disruption of the ooc gene cluster abolished oocydin A production and bioactivity against fungi and oomycetes. The ooc gene clusters span between 77 and 80 kb and encode five multimodular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase cassette and three flavin-dependent tailoring enzymes. The presence of two free-standing acyltransferase proteins classifies the oocydin A gene cluster within the growing family of trans-AT PKSs. The amino acid sequences and organization of the PKS domains are consistent with the chemical predictions and functional peculiarities associated with trans-acyltransferase PKS. Based on extensive in silico analysis of the gene cluster, we propose a biosynthetic model for the production of oocydin A and, by extension, for other members of the haterumalide family of halogenated macrolides exhibiting anti-cancer, anti-fungal, and other interesting biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W2033781934,"Cataracts are caused by clouding of the eye lens and may lead to partial or total loss of vision. The mechanism of cataract development, however, is not well understood. It is thought that abnormal aggregates of lens proteins form with age, causing loss of lens clarity and development of the cataract. Lens proteins are composed of soluble α-, β-, and γ-crystallins, and as long lived proteins, they undergo post-translational modifications including isomerization, deamidation, and oxidation, which induce insolubilization, aggregation, and loss of function that may lead to cataracts. Therefore, analysis of post-translational modifications of individual amino acid residues in proteins is important. However, detection of the optical isomers of amino acids formed in these proteins is difficult because optical resolution is only achieved using complex methodology. In this study, we describe a new method for the analysis of isomerization of individual Asp residues in proteins using LC-MS and the corresponding synthetic peptides containing the Asp isomers. This makes it possible to analyze isomers of Asp residues in proteins precisely and quickly. We demonstrate that Asp-58, -76, -84, and -151 of αA-crystallin and Asp-62 and -96 of αB-crystallin are highly converted to lβ-, dβ-, and dα-isomers. The amount of isomerization of Asp is greater in the insoluble fraction at all Asp sites in lens proteins, therefore indicating that isomerization of these Asp residues affects the higher order structure of the proteins and contributes to the increase in aggregation, insolubilization, and disruption of function of proteins in the lens, leading to the cataract."

Mass spectrometry demonstrated that cleavage predominantly followed residue Phe-8 of the CSP-1 isoform of the peptide within its central hydrophobic patch, and in competition assays, both CSP-1 and CSP-2 interacted with HtrA with similar efficiencies. More generally, analysis of β-casein digestion and of digestion within HtrA itself revealed a preference for substrates with non-polar residues at the P1 site. Consistent with a specificity for exposed hydrophobic residues, competition from native BSA only weakly inhibited digestion of CSP, but denaturation converted BSA into a strong competitive inhibitor of such proteolysis. Together these findings support a model in which digestion of CSP by HtrA is reduced in the presence of other unfolded proteins that serve as alternative targets for degradation. Such competition may provide a mechanism by which HtrA functions in a quality control capacity to monitor the frequency of biosynthetic errors that result in protein misfolding.

https://openalex.org/W2088852581,"The Min proteins (MinC, MinD, and MinE) form a pole-to-pole oscillator that controls the spatial assembly of the division machinery in Escherichia coli cells. Previous studies identified that interactions of MinD with phospholipids positioned the Min machinery at the membrane. We extend these studies by measuring the affinity, kinetics, and ATPase activity of E. coli MinD, MinE, and MinDE binding to supported lipid bilayers containing varying compositions of anionic phospholipids. Using quartz crystal microbalance measurements, we found that the binding affinity (K(d)) for the interaction of recombinant E. coli MinD and MinE with lipid bilayers increased with increasing concentration of the anionic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. The K(d) for MinD (1.8 μM) in the presence of ATP was smaller than for MinE (12.1 μM) binding to membranes consisting of 95:5 phosphatidylcholine/cardiolipin. The simultaneous binding of MinD and MinE to membranes revealed that increasing the concentration of anionic phospholipid stimulates the initial rate of adsorption (k(on)). The ATPase activity of MinD decreased in the presence of anionic phospholipids. These results indicate that anionic lipids, which are concentrated at the poles, increase the retention of MinD and MinE and explain its dwell time at this region of bacterial cells. These studies provide insight into interactions between MinD and MinE and between these proteins and membranes that are relevant to understanding the process of bacterial cell division, in which the interaction of proteins and membranes is essential."
https://openalex.org/W1983822030,"To investigate the potency of the topoisomerase II (topo II) poisons doxorubicin and etoposide to stimulate the DNA damage response (DDR), S139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX) was analyzed using rat cardiomyoblast cells (H9c2). Etoposide caused a dose-dependent increase in the γH2AX level as shown by Western blotting. By contrast, the doxorubicin response was bell-shaped with high doses failing to increase H2AX phosphorylation. Identical results were obtained by immunohistochemical analysis of γH2AX focus formation, comet assay-based DNA strand break analysis, and measuring the formation of the topo II-DNA cleavable complex. At low dose, doxorubicin activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) but not ATM and Rad3-related (ATR). Both the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin and the Rac1-specific inhibitor NSC23766 attenuated doxorubicin- and etoposide-stimulated H2AX phosphorylation, induction of DNA strand breaks, and topo II-DNA complex formation. Lovastatin and NSC23766 acted in an additive manner. They did not attenuate doxorubicin-induced increase in p-ATM and p-Chk2 levels. DDR stimulated by topo II poisons was partially blocked by inhibition of type I p21-associated kinases. DDR evoked by the topoisomerase I poison topotecan remained unaffected by lovastatin. The data show that the mechanisms involved in DDR stimulated by topo II poisons are agent-specific with anthracyclines lacking DDR-stimulating activity at high doses. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 signaling counteracts doxorubicin- and etoposide-stimulated DDR by disabling the formation of the topo II-DNA cleavable complex. Based on the data we suggest that Rac1-regulated mechanisms are required for DNA damage induction and subsequent activation of the DDR following treatment with topo II but not topo I poisons."

Early reports suggested that PCa stem/progenitor cells might have the potency to promote prostate tumorigenesis (24Maitland N.J. Collins A.T. Prostate cancer stem cells. A new target for therapy.J.

Metastasis. 2009; 26: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The linkage of AR methylation status in PCa stem/progenitor cells to PCa therapy, however, remains unclear. We report here that the epigenetic control might govern AR expression differentially in three types of stem/progenitor cells (embryonic, mesenchymal, and prostatic). We revealed potential mechanisms by which differential methylation patterns in AR promoters might contribute to the prostate tumorigenesis, suggesting that a new therapeutic approach via targeting AR methylation status in PCa stem/progenitor cells to better battle PCa might be generated. The mouse embryonic stem cell line, ESD3, was established from 129/Sv blastocysts and purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The mesenchymal stem cell line, D1, was also purchased from ATCC. The mPrE cell line, a normal mouse progenitor cell line, was a kind gift from Dr. Ming Jiang (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). The immortalized prostate cancer stem cell (PCSC) line was purchased from Celprogen (San Pedro, CA). All cell lines were maintained in appropriate culture conditions. The LNCaP stem/progenitor cells were isolated by a magnetic sorting method using an antibody of the human stem cell marker, CD133, and confirmed using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. When necessary, cells were treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) (Invivogen), ASC-J9® (5 μm), or DHT (0, 1, and 10 nm) for the indicated time. Total RNAs were extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs (1 μg) were subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript III transcriptase (Invitrogen). The obtained cDNAs were used for qPCR using a Bio-Rad CFX96 system with SYBR Green. Primers used were as follows: AR sense, 5′-TATCCTGGTGGAGTTGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGAGTCATCCCTGCTTC-3′; and GAPDH sense, 5′-AATGTCACCGTTGTCCAGTTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGGCTGGGGCTCTACTTC-3′. Expression levels were normalized to the expression of GAPDH RNA. Harvested cells were washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm okadaic acid, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Individual samples (40 μg of protein) were separated on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked in a PBS-Tween 20 solution with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h at room temperature, and then the membranes were incubated with appropriate dilutions of specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The blots were developed in ECL mixture (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized by Imager. Genomic DNAs were isolated from D1, ESD3, mPrE, and PCSC cells using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Bisulfite modification of DNA was performed using the EpiTect® bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's directions. With this treatment, all unmethylated cytosine residues are converted to thymine, but those that are already methylated (5-methylcytosine) are resistant to this treatment and remain as cytosine residues. Bisulfite-treated DNAs were amplified by a nested PCR protocol using the primers described in the supplemental Table 1. PCR was performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 5× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 0.32 μm of each primer, and 1 unit of Hot Start Taq Plus DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The BSP conditions used were as follows: 95 °C for 600 s, 95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C 0.5 °C/cycle for 45 s, 72 °C for 60 s for 16 cycles; 95 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 60 s for 30 cycles, and 72 °C for 4 min. MSP PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 300 s, 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s for 15 cycles, and 72 °C for 180 s. BSP products were purified using the QiaquickTM gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 1:1000 diluted samples were used as MSP template. After the reaction, PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. In these reactions, DNAs of DU145 and LNCaP cells were used as positive (methylated) and negative (unmethylated) controls, respectively; as blank controls of MSP reactions, water and unmodified DNAs were used as templates. PCR products were purified from the gels after electrophoresis using the QiaquickTM gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), ligated into pGEM®-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and then introduced into JM109 high efficiency competent cells (Promega, Madison, WI). Transformed cells were then plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. 5–10 individual colonies were selected, and each was inoculated into 3 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Invitrogen) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The insert containing plasmid DNA was extracted from the cells using the Eppendorf FastPlasmid Mini-prep® kit (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Each DNA sample was sequenced using the automated DNA Sequencer using the vector's forward primers (T7). DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the DNA dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and ABI3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ChIP assay was performed using the Methyl-CpG Binding Domain Protein2 (MBD2) ChIP kit (EpiQuikTM, Biokits, Brooklyn, NY). DNA cross-linking was performed by adding 1% formaldehyde into the cell cultures at room temperature for 10 min, and glycine was then added (0.125 m final concentration) for 5 min to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were lysed with a lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and sonicated to shear genomic DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. One-tenth of the cell lysate was used for input control, and the rest was used for immunoprecipitation using MBD2 antibody. After collecting the immunoprecipitates using protein G-agarose columns, protein-DNA complexes were eluted and heated at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. After digestion with proteinase K, DNA fragments were purified using spin columns and analyzed using PCR for 35 cycles in a sequence of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Specific primer sets were designed to amplify a target sequence within the mouse and human AR promoter as follows: mAR-F, 5′-TTAGGGCTGGGAAGGGTCTAC-3′; mAR-R, 5′-GTCTCCTGCCTCTGCTGTAAAC-3′; hAR-F, 5′-CGACAGCCAACGCCTCTTG-3′; hAR-R, 5′-CCTTGCTTCCTCCGAGTCTTTAG-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. Cells were plated onto 24-well plates. At various time points indicated, MTT solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added onto cells for 2 h, and then media were removed, DMSO was used to dissolve the MTT salt, and OD values were measured at 570 nm. Cells were seeded on the 4-well chamber slides and fixed with iced methanol. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS three times for 5 min each, and then cells were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-AR (N20, 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CK5 (1:250; Covance, Princeton, NJ), anti-CK8 (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and anti-sca-1 (1:250; eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were then incubated with 1:200 diluted biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and with fluorescent secondary antibodies for IF (either Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-tagged). IF intensity was quantified by ImageJ software. Sphere formation assays were performed as described earlier (27Xin L. Lukacs R.U. Lawson D.A. Cheng D. Witte O.N. Self-renewal and multilineage differentiation in vitro from murine prostate stem cells.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2760-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, single cell suspensions (1 × 103, in 60 μl of medium) were mixed with 60 μl of cold Matrigel, and the mixture was placed along the rim of the 24-well plates with a minimum of triplicate experiments. The culture plates were placed in a 37 °C incubator for 10 min to let the mixture solidify, and 500 μl of medium was then added into the well. Sphere numbers were counted after 7–14 days under an Olympus light microscope, and size differences were also examined. LNCaP stem/progenitor cells were resuspended in 0.4% Bactoagar (BD Biosciences), layered on top of 1 ml of 0.8% agarose in 6-well culture plates, and incubated with 1 ml of RPMI complete medium. After 3 weeks, the colonies were visualized by staining with 0.5% crystal violet. The experiment was analyzed in triplicate, and colonies larger than 100 mm in diameter were counted. For the infection of GFP-containing lentivirus carrying either vector or AR, 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of DNAs (lentiviral vector pWPI) containing AR siRNA (scramble vectors were used as control), pAX2 packaging plasmid, and pMD2G envelope plasmid (at a 4:3:2 ratio) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After infection, media containing the virus were replaced with normal culture media. Fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the infection efficiency via checking the green fluorescence signal. PCSCs that had been treated with 5-AZA (5 μm) for 6 days were directly injected into mice. Briefly, after anesthesia, the abdomens of 8-week-old male athymic nude mice were surgically opened in sterile environments. PCSCs (5 × 105/site) in 20 μl of medium mixed with Matrigel 1:1 (v:v) were injected into lobes of anterior prostate by a 25-gauge needle, and the abdomens were closed by silk sutures. Five mice were used per group. Because DNA hypomethylation is time-dependent and requires 2–3 cell cycles to be effective and 5-AZA is known to have a short half-life in serum, mice received either control (DMSO) or 5-AZA continuously twice a week after the injection (intraperitoneal injections, 0.05 mg/kg 5-AZA and DMSO as vehicle control). Tumors were harvested at 3 weeks, and tumor sizes were compared. The tumor tissues were stained using AR antibodies of AR, Oct4, and CK8. All mice experiments were under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Rochester Medical Center. Values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's t test and analysis of variance were used to calculate p values. p values were two-sided and were considered statistically significant when they were <0.05. We investigated AR expression in three different types of stem/progenitor cells (embryonic, mesenchymal, and prostatic) using the cell lines ESD3 (established embryonic) (28Chang C.Y. Hsuuw Y.D.

We also analyzed these cells and found that they are homogenous and positive for stem cell markers, such as Oct4 and Nanog (data not shown). The LNCaP stem/progenitor cells were isolated by magnetic sorting method using an antibody of the human stem cell marker, CD133 (34Vander Griend D.J. Karthaus W.L. Dalrymple S. Meeker A. DeMarzo A.M.

Interestingly, we found little AR expression in the mPrE and PCSCs at both mRNA and protein levels as compared with the ESD3 and D1 stem cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Little AR expression was also detected in LNCaP stem/progenitor cells as compared with LNCaP non-stem/progenitor cells (Fig. 1, C and D).

To test whether the low expression of AR in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells is responsive to androgen treatment, luciferase activity was determined using an MMTV-luciferase assay, and results showed that LNCaP stem/progenitor cells had a low response to DHT (1 and 10 nm, the human prostate DHT concentration before and after castration, respectively) (40Titus M.A. Schell M.J.

We tested whether the differences in AR expression in different stem/progenitor cell types (using mPrE, PCSCs, and LNCaP stem/progenitor cells) is due to the proteosomal degradation. We treated cells with MG132, an inhibitor of proteosomal degradation, and tested whether AR expression profiles in the three types of stem/progenitor cell are changed but found no significant differences (data not shown). We next investigated whether the AR expression difference is due to the methylation difference in the AR promoter-associated CpG island region because numerous studies demonstrated that the methylation of these CpG islands interferes with transcription, resulting in an absence of mRNA and protein expression (41Mishra D.K.

https://openalex.org/W2158316596,"The human family of ELMO domain-containing proteins (ELMODs) consists of six members and is defined by the presence of the ELMO domain. Within this family are two subclassifications of proteins, based on primary sequence conservation, protein size, and domain architecture, deemed ELMOD and ELMO. In this study, we used homology searching and phylogenetics to identify ELMOD family homologs in genomes from across eukaryotic diversity. This demonstrated not only that the protein family is ancient but also that ELMOs are potentially restricted to the supergroup Opisthokonta (Metazoa and Fungi), whereas proteins with the ELMOD organization are found in diverse eukaryotes and thus were likely the form present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The segregation of the ELMO clade from the larger ELMOD group is consistent with their contrasting functions as unconventional Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors and the Arf family GTPase-activating proteins, respectively. We used unbiased, phylogenetic sorting and sequence alignments to identify the most highly conserved residues within the ELMO domain to identify a putative GAP domain within the ELMODs. Three independent but complementary assays were used to provide an initial characterization of this domain. We identified a highly conserved arginine residue critical for both the biochemical and cellular GAP activity of ELMODs. We also provide initial evidence of the function of human ELMOD1 as an Arf family GAP at the Golgi. These findings provide the basis for the future study of the ELMOD family of proteins and a new avenue for the study of Arf family GTPases."

Protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits RhoA signaling and thereby induces a characteristic morphological change, cell rounding.

https://openalex.org/W2107802380,"The α-galactosidase AgaA from the thermophilic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus has great industrial potential because it is fully active at 338 K against raffinose and can increase the yield of manufactured sucrose. AgaB has lower affinity for its natural substrates but is a powerful tool for the enzymatic synthesis of disaccharides by transglycosylation. These two enzymes have 97% identity and belong to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family GH36 for which few structures are available. To understand the structural basis underlying the differences between these two enzymes, we determined the crystal structures of AgaA and AgaB by molecular replacement at 3.2- and 1.8 Å-resolution, respectively. We also solved a 2.8-Å structure of the AgaAA355E mutant, which has enzymatic properties similar to those of AgaB. We observe that residue 355 is located 20 Å away from the active site and that the A355E substitution causes structural rearrangements resulting in a significant displacement of the invariant Trp336 at catalytic subsite −1. Hence, the active cleft of AgaA is narrowed in comparison with AgaB, and AgaA is more efficient than AgaB against its natural substrates. The structure of AgaAA355E complexed with 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin reveals an induced fit movement; there is a rupture of the electrostatic interaction between Glu355 and Asn335 and a return of Trp336 to an optimal position for ligand stacking. The structures of two catalytic mutants of AgaAA355E complexed with raffinose and stachyose show that the binding interactions are stronger at subsite −1 to enable the binding of various α-galactosides. The α-galactosidase AgaA from the thermophilic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus has great industrial potential because it is fully active at 338 K against raffinose and can increase the yield of manufactured sucrose. AgaB has lower affinity for its natural substrates but is a powerful tool for the enzymatic synthesis of disaccharides by transglycosylation. These two enzymes have 97% identity and belong to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family GH36 for which few structures are available. To understand the structural basis underlying the differences between these two enzymes, we determined the crystal structures of AgaA and AgaB by molecular replacement at 3.2- and 1.8 Å-resolution, respectively. We also solved a 2.8-Å structure of the AgaAA355E mutant, which has enzymatic properties similar to those of AgaB. We observe that residue 355 is located 20 Å away from the active site and that the A355E substitution causes structural rearrangements resulting in a significant displacement of the invariant Trp336 at catalytic subsite −1. Hence, the active cleft of AgaA is narrowed in comparison with AgaB, and AgaA is more efficient than AgaB against its natural substrates.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing α-d-galactose residues from α-d-galactosides, including galactose oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, galactolipids, and glycoproteins. They are also known to catalyze transgalactosylation reactions at high concentrations of substrate (1Spangenberg P. André C. Dion M. Rabiller C. Mattes R.

Members of the families GH27, GH36, and GH31 (α-glucosidases and α-xylosidases) share a common catalytic mechanism and structural topology and form the glycoside hydrolase clan GH-D (6Henrissat B.

These structures are composed of two domains: the catalytic domain with a conserved (β/α)8 barrel topology and similar active sites and the C-terminal domain. Their hydrolytic mechanism, which is common to GH36 members, proceeds with retention of the stereochemistry at the anomeric center of the substrate through a double displacement mechanism. Catalysis is mediated by two aspartate residues acting in concert as a nucleophile and a proton donor (14Comfort D.A. Bobrov K.S. Ivanen D.R. Shabalin K.A. Harris J.M. Kulminskaya A.A. Brumer H.

The crystal structures of the α-galactosidases from the hyperthermophilic microorganism Thermotoga maritima (Protein Data Bank code 1zy9; 564 residues) and the microorganism Lactobacillus brevis (Protein Data Bank code 3mi6; 745 residues) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank without accompanying publications. Those two enzymes exhibit different oligomeric states and share low sequence identity (14%). They display the same (β/α)8 barrel topology and a supplemental N-terminal domain, which is absent in the GH27 family. More recently, the crystal structures of two GH36 α-galactosidases from Lactobacillus acidophilus (Protein Data Bank code 2xn2; 732 residues) and Ruminococcus gnavus (Protein Data Bank code 2yfn; 720 residues) were determined (16Fredslund F.

They exhibit the same tetrameric organization as the L. brevis α-galactosidase, and the structure provides insight into the recognition of monosaccharides at the active site. The two α-galactosidases presented herein are encoded by the genes agaA and agaB from the thermophilic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus strain KVE39, which was isolated from Icelandic hot springs (4Ganter C. Böck A. Buckel P. Mattes R. Production of thermostable, recombinant α-galactosidase suitable for raffinose elimination from sugar beet syrup.J. Biotechnol. 1988; 8: 301-310Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AgaA and AgaB are composed of 729 amino acids each, share an identity of 97% (22 amino acids are different), and belong to the GH36 family. Despite their high sequence similarity, the AgaA and AgaB isoenzymes exhibit different catalytic properties. AgaA is of great interest for industrial applications because it is highly stable and active at 338 K (industrial processes require high temperatures) and has high affinity and hydrolytic activity against raffinose. AgaB has a lower affinity toward raffinose and reaches maximum activity at 323 K. Nevertheless, AgaB displays a better transglycosylation activity and is of interest for the enzymatic synthesis of disaccharides, which are difficult to obtain in large scale via classical organic synthesis (1Spangenberg P. André C. Dion M. Rabiller C. Mattes R. Comparative study of new α-galactosidases in transglycosylation reactions.Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 329: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Oligosaccharide synthesis by glycosynthases.Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a single mutant of AgaA, AgaAA355E, exhibits catalytic properties that are similar to those of AgaB, whereas the E355A substitution in AgaB restores the catalytic properties of AgaA (19Fridjonsson O. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Thermoadaptation of α-galactosidase AgaB1 in Thermus thermophilus.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3385-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We solved the crystal structures of AgaA and AgaB and determined the structures of the mutant AgaAA355E alone and in complex with 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin, a competitive inhibitor of α-galactosidases. The crystal structures of two catalytic mutants of AgaAA355E complexed with raffinose (Gal(α1–6)Glc(α1–2β)Fruf) and stachyose (Gal(α1–6)Gal(α1–6)Glc(α1–2β)Fruf) were also determined. Site-directed mutagenesis at position 336 of AgaA and kinetic studies show that the mutant W336F exhibits distinct enzymatic characteristics that are close to those of AgaB. These structural and molecular results explain the differences regarding activity efficiency and temperature tolerance between AgaA and AgaB. The structures also provide novel insights into substrate recognition at the sugar subunits −1 to +3 as defined in the nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycoside hydrolases (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The α-galactosidases AgaA, AgaAA355E, and AgaB were overexpressed in Escherichia coli RM448 cells harboring the pBTac plasmid derivatives pAMG21, pHWG8, and pAM22 as described elsewhere (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The truncated form of AgaA, which lacks the first nine residues, was constructed by PCR amplification of the agaA gene using the oligonucleotides S7573 (gcgaattcatatgAAGCAGTTTCATTTGCGGGC) introducing an EcoRI linker and S7574 (gcctgcagTTATTGTTGAACAGCTTTC) with a PstI linker from the template plasmid pAMG21. After digestion with EcoRI and PstI, the 2178-bp fragment was inserted into pBTac1 to create the plasmid pHWG915. The active site AgaAA355E mutants D478A and D548N were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis following the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The mutations were generated using two synthetic oligonucleotides: D478A: S7746 (5′-GTGAAATGGGCTATGAACCGCCACATGACG-3′) and S7747 (5′-TCATGTGGCGGGTTCATAGCCCATTTTCACG-3′); D548N: S7362 (5′-AAACGTGGACTAGTAACAACACCGATGCCG-3′) and S7363 (5′-GCATCGGTGTTGTTACTAGTCCGCGTTTGC-3′) where the mutations are in bold face, and the silent mutations are indicated in italics. The silent mutations introduced a recognition site for the restriction enzyme SpeI in the D548N oligonucleotides and a deletion for an NdeI site in the D478A oligonucleotides. The linear amplified mutant plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells and yielded pHWG910 (D548N) and pHWG933 (D478A). These sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression of the genes, the plasmids were transformed in E. coli RM448. Expression and purification of both native α-galactosidases and mutant enzymes followed the protocol described (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In short, after disruption of the E. coli cells, the cell-free extracts were fractioned by anion-exchange chromatography on an EMD dimethylaminoethyl (DMAE) (Merck) and a Mono Q-HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare). A final purification step was performed with a Superdex 200 column. The purified proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and kept in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The α-galactosidase activity was determined as described (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 298 K. The rate of raffinose hydrolysis was determined by assessing the amount of galactose released using HPLC as described (18Perugino G. Trincone A. Rossi M. Moracci M. Oligosaccharide synthesis by glycosynthases.Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetic parameters (apparent Michaelis constant Km and kcat) were determined for the substrates para-nitrophenyl-α-galactopyranoside (pNP-αGal) and raffinose and were obtained by curve fitting analysis using KalaidaGraph (version 4.1 Synergy software). The inhibition of enzyme activity by 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin was measured at various concentrations of inhibitor (0.5–5 μm) using pNP-αGal as substrate. Lineweaver-Burk plots were performed for determination of the inhibition mode, and Dixon plots were used to calculate Ki. Transglycosylation reactions of Aga enzymes were performed by following the autocondensation reaction with the substrate pNP-αGal as described (1Spangenberg P. André C. Dion M. Rabiller C. Mattes R. Comparative study of new α-galactosidases in transglycosylation reactions.Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 329: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Products of hydrolysis (pNP) and transglycosylation (pNP-αGal(α1–6)Gal) were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized under UV light at 254 nm. The amount of transglycosylation product obtained was judged qualitatively (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 2).TABLE 2AgaA/B wild-type enzymes and AgaAW336X mutant kinetic data for pNP-αGal and raffinose hydrolysis and their activity on α-glucopyranoside (αGluc)aa 336pNP-αGal, 25 °CpNP-αGluc activityaLimit of detection, 0.0007 ± 0.0002.Raffinose, 25 °CTransglycosylation, visibility of autocondensation productKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1mm−1 s−1units/mgmms−1mm−1 s−1AgaA WTTrp0.21 ± 0.03105.6 ± 7.85020.0003.8 ± 0.6180 ± 1764.3NoPhe0.24 ± 0.04375 ± 21.415620.000250 ± 32832 ± 943.3+++++Asn0.84 ± 0.0738.2 ± 2.845.50.000205 ± 3810.3 ± 2.10.05+++Asp1.33 ± 0.110.97 ± 0.10.70.001NDNDNDNDAla0.44 ± 0.057.9 ± 0.517.90.019252 ± 3348.1 ± 6.30.19++++Ser8.7 ± 248 ± 75.50.00036.6 ± 4.25.2 ± 0.30.14+++++AgaB WTTrp0.83 ± 0.092382 ± 5028700.000200 ± 271205 ± 1766.0+++a Limit of detection, 0.0007 ± 0.0002. Open table in a new tab AgaAA355E and AgaB were crystallized in different space groups as described previously (21Foucault M. Watzlawick H. Mattes R. Haser R. Gouet P. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction studies of two thermostable α-galactosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 36.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We tried to grow new AgaB crystals but were not successful. We recently obtained crystals of a truncated form of AgaA starting at residue 10 (AgaA-Δ9). The crystals of truncated AgaA (6.9 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) were obtained using the vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 80 mm sodium acetate, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), and 6.4% isopropanol (w/v) at a temperature of 292 K with a 1:1 ratio of protein to reservoir solution. Although the crystallization condition was similar to that of AgaAA355E, the AgaA crystals were extremely small and fragile and diffracted poorly. Only one crystal gave data to 3.2-Å resolution. Complexes were observed for the AgaAA355E type crystals, which were easily reproducible and diffracted routinely to 2.6-Å resolution. The 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin complex was obtained by soaking a crystal of AgaAA355E for 2 min in a 2-μl stabilizing solution (a reservoir solution in which the polyethylene glycol was increased to 30%) containing 5 mm inhibitor and 10% ethylene glycol (v/v) as cryoprotectant. The crystals were cooled to 100 K in liquid nitrogen before data collection. AgaAA355E is active within a large pH range (22Gote M.M. Khan M.I. Gokhale D.V. Bastawde K.B. Khire J.M.

All attempts to obtain the crystal structures of enzyme-substrate complexes at a high or low pH where the enzyme is inactive were unsuccessful. A raffinose complex was obtained with the inactive catalytic mutant AgaAA355E,D548N. The crystallization conditions were similar to those of AgaAA355E, and large crystals of AgaAA355E,D548N (9.2 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) were grown from a solution containing 200 mm potassium acetate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v) at a pH of 8.1, a temperature of 289 K, and a 2:1 ratio of protein to reservoir solution. A crystal was soaked for 15 min in a 2-μl stabilizing solution containing 150 mm raffinose and 10% ethylene glycol (v/v). With the ligand stachyose, the best diffracting crystal (3.6-Å resolution) was obtained by co-crystallization with the catalytic mutant AgaAA355E,D478A. This crystal (AgaAA355E,D478A, 9.8 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) was obtained from a solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), and 20 mm stachyose at a temperature of 292 K with a 1:1 ratio. It was rapidly soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash frozen. Synchrotron data were collected at 100 K on the MX beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France and the PXIII beamline at the Swiss Light Source in Villigen, Switzerland. The programs XDS and XSCALE were used for data reduction and scaling (24Kabsch W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). The high resolution data set collected from an AgaB crystal in 2006 (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) was recently reprocessed, and the resolution could be extended to 1.8 Å with satisfactory statistics. The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Molecular replacement with MOLREP.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar) using L. brevis α-galactosidase as the search model. Five percent of the randomly selected reflections were kept apart for cross-validation, and the crystallographic refinement was performed with Phenix (26Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Jain S. Kapral G.J. Grosse Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R.D. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. The Phenix software for automated determination of macromolecular structures.Methods. 2011; 55: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). After each cycle, the model was manually improved using the graphic program Coot (27Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17187) Google Scholar). The structures of 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and raffinose were extracted from the Protein Data Bank. A structure for stachyose is absent from the Protein Data Bank, and a model was generated with the program eLBOW (28Moriarty N.W. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were maintained throughout the refinement in Phenix of the low resolution structure of AgaAA355E,D478A complexed with stachyose. The quality of the final crystal structures was assessed with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) prior to deposition at the Protein Data Bank under the codes 4fnp (AgaAA355E), 4fnq (AgaB), 4fnr (AgaA-Δ9), 4fns (AgaAA355E with 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin), 4fnt (AgaAA355E,D548N with raffinose), and 4fnu (AgaAA355E,D478A with stachyose). A pairwise structure comparison was accomplished with the program SUPERPOSE from the CCP4 suite (30Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B.

Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9246) Google Scholar). Images were generated with PyMOL. The refinement statistics of the final models are presented in Table 1. The final AgaB 1.8-Å electron density map was of excellent quality, but the segment 46–49, which is located at the protein surface, was not visible. The loop 46–49, despite having high temperature factors, was visible and built in AgaA and AgaAA355E. Residues 1–9, which form the first β-strand and were visible in AgaB due to crystal packing, were not observed in AgaAA355E.

Huntingtin, a 350-kDa protein, has defined roles in the nucleus, as well as a CRM1/exportin-dependent nuclear export signal; however, the NLS and exact pathway of import have remained elusive. Here, using a live cell assay and affinity chromatography, we show that huntingtin has a karyopherin β2-dependent proline-tyrosine (PY)-NLS in the amino terminus of the protein. This NLS comprises three consensus components: a basic charged sequence, a downstream conserved arginine, and a PY sequence. Unlike the classic PY-NLS, which has an unstructured intervening sequence between the consensus components, we show that a β sheet structured region separating the consensus elements is critical for huntingtin NLS function. The huntingtin PY-NLS is also capable of import through the importin/karyopherin β1 pathway but was not functional in all cell types tested. We propose that this huntingtin PY-NLS may comprise a new class of multiple import factor-dependent NLSs with an internal structural component that may regulate NLS activity.

Like several medically important bacteria, B. anthracis lacks glutathione but encodes many genes annotated as thioredoxins, thioredoxin reductases, and glutaredoxin-like proteins. We have cloned, expressed, and characterized three potential thioredoxins, two potential thioredoxin reductases, and three glutaredoxin-like proteins. Of these, thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) and NrdH reduced insulin, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and the manganese-containing type Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from B. anthracis in the presence of NADPH and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1), whereas thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) could only reduce DTNB.

https://openalex.org/W2036900657,"Regulation of integrin activation has important implications for tumor cell invasion and metastasis.EGF activates ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho kinase signaling in A431 and DiFi colon cancer cells, leading to phosphorylation of filamin A (FLNa) and inactivation of the α5β1 integrin receptor.EGF promotes α5β1 inactivation through the p90RSK-dependent phosphorylation of FLNa.We have identified a novel EGF-dependent mechanism controlling the α5β1 integrin activation state. Cell adhesion, motility, and invasion are regulated by the ligand-binding activity of integrin receptors, transmembrane proteins that bind to the extracellular matrix. Integrins whose conformation allows for ligand binding and appropriate functional activity are said to be in an active state. Integrin activation and subsequent ligand binding are dynamically regulated by the association of cytoplasmic proteins with integrin intracellular domains. In this study, we evaluated the role of EGF in the regulation of the activation state of the α5β1 integrin receptor for fibronectin. The addition of EGF to either A431 squamous carcinoma cells or DiFi colon cancer cells resulted in loss of α5β1-dependent adhesion to fibronectin but no loss of integrin from the cell surface. EGF activated the EGF receptor/ERK/p90RSK and Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathways. Blocking either pathway inhibited EGF-mediated loss of adhesion, suggesting that they work in parallel to regulate integrin function. EGF treatment also resulted in phosphorylation of filamin A (FLNa), which binds and inactivates β1 integrins. EGF-mediated FLNa phosphorylation was completely blocked by an inhibitor of p90RSK and partially attenuated by an inhibitor of Rho kinase, suggesting that both pathways converge on FLNa to regulate integrin function. A431 clonal cell lines expressing non-phosphorylated dominant-negative FLNa were resistant to the inhibitory effects of EGF on integrin function, whereas clonal cell lines overexpressing wild-type FLNa were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of EGF. These data suggest that EGF-dependent inactivation of α5β1 integrin is regulated through FLNa phosphorylation and cellular contractility."

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The HDAC1-containing NuRD complex is generally considered as a corepressor complex and is required for GATA-1-mediated repression. However, recent studies also show that the NuRD complex is involved in GATA-1-mediated gene activation. We tested whether the GATA-1-associated NuRD complex loses its deacetylase activity and commits the GATA-1 complex to become an activator during erythropoiesis. We found that GATA-1-associated deacetylase activity gradually decreased upon induction of erythroid differentiation. GATA-1-associated HDAC1 is increasingly acetylated after differentiation. It has been demonstrated earlier that acetylated HDAC1 has no deacetylase activity. Indeed, overexpression of an HDAC1 mutant, which mimics acetylated HDAC1, promotes GATA-1-mediated transcription and erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, during erythroid differentiation, acetylated HDAC1 recruitment is increased at GATA-1-activated genes, whereas it is significantly decreased at GATA-1-repressed genes. Interestingly, deacetylase activity is not required for Mi2 remodeling activity, suggesting that remodeling activity may be required for both activation and repression. Thus, our data suggest that NuRD can function as a coactivator or repressor and that acetylated HDAC1 converts the NuRD complex from a repressor to an activator during GATA-1-directed erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2087270666,"Integrin activation on hematopoietic cells is essential for platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, and transmigration through endothelium and extracellular matrix into inflamed tissues. To migrate through matrix, leukocyte integrin adhesion complexes undergo dynamic changes. Here we show that Kindlin-3, a main activator and binding partner of integrins in hematopoietic cells, can be cleaved by calpain in an activation-dependent manner. This calpain-mediated cleavage occurs in platelets and leukocytes as well as in endothelial cells. We determined the calpain I cleavage site in Kindlin-3 at tyrosine 373 in the N-terminal part of Kindlin-3 pleckstrin homology domain. Expression of the calpain-resistant Y373N mutant of Kindlin-3 promotes stronger cell adhesion to extracellular matrix under flow as well as to activated endothelium. In contrast, Y373N mutation in Kindlin-3 hinders cell migration. Mechanistically, calpain-resistant Y373N mutant of Kindlin-3 exhibited an activation-independent association with β integrin cytoplasm domain. Thus, cleavage of Kindlin-3 by calpain controls the dynamics of integrin-Kindlin-3 interaction and as a result, integrin-dependent adhesion and migration of hematopoietic cells. This represents a novel mechanism regulating reversibility of integrin adhesion complexes in leukocytes, which, in turn, is critical for their successful transmigration through the extracellular matrix."

On this basis, elastin represents an important component of marine organic nitrogen, and its degradation cannot be ignored for marine nitrogen recycling.

Tropoelastin is the precursor of elastin whose sequence contains two major types of domains, hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The hydrophobic domains are rich in nonpolar residues, Gly, Val, and Pro, whereas the classical hydrophilic domains participate in cross-linking and are mostly composed of Lys and Ala (1Wise S.G.

The metalloproteases of family M23 are divided into two subfamilies, M23A and M23B.

The metalloproteases of family M23 are all endopeptidases that are synthesized as precursors and are activated extracellularly. Because they are not autoprocessed during maturation, it is difficult to heterogeneously express the M23 proteases, which somewhat limits their biochemical analysis. These proteases contain a zinc ion, and the active site residues occur in HXXXD and HXH motifs. They are all β proteins containing two stacked half-β-barrels, and the active site is at the end of the larger C-terminal barrel (27Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. MEROPS. The peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D227-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). All the M23 proteases have a preference for cleavage of glycyl bonds (23Ahmed K. Chohnan S.

For this reason, elastin is recognized as a preferred substrate for the M23 proteases because there are ∼33% glycine residues in the tropoelastin sequence (33Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R. Extracellular matrix 4. The elastic fiber.FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the elastolytic mechanism of the M23 proteases is largely unclear.

It was reported that β-lytic endopeptidase could cleave the Val-18–Cya-19 bond in oxidized insulin B chain and the N-acylmuramoyl-l-Ala bond between the cell wall glycoproteins (35Whitaker D.R. Roy C. Tsai C.S. Jurásek L. Lytic enzymes of Sorangium sp. A comparison of the proteolytic properties of the α- and β-lytic proteases.Can. J.

CF6-2 is a protease-producing bacterium isolated from the deep-sea sediment in the Jiulong methane reef area off the southwest of the island of Taiwan (36Zhou M.Y. Chen X.L. Zhao H.L. Dang H.Y.

Moreover, the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin was studied in detail by biochemical experiments and through SEM observations, thus revealing that pseudoalterin digests elastin effectively by a mechanism that is distinct from the reported M23 proteases. The results help to clarify the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin. Pseudoalteromonas sp. CF6-2 was isolated from the deep-sea sediment at a water depth of 2441 m at site 119° 30.060′E, 22° 0.316′N in the Jiulong methane reef area off the southwest of the island of Taiwan during the South China Sea Open Cruise of R/V Shiyan 3 (36Zhou M.Y.

Escherichia coli DH5α was purchased from Novagen and cultivated at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) for selection of transformants. Insoluble type I collagen fiber (bovine achilles tendon) was purchased from Worthington. α-casein, gamma globulin, elastinorcein, BS3, and bovine neck ligament elastin isoform 1 (SwissProt accession number P04985–1) (hereafter called bovine elastin) were purchased from Sigma, and gelatin was from Boston Biomedical Inc. DES was purchased from Merck. Pseudoalteromonas sp. CF6-2 was cultured at 15 °C for 48 h in the fermentation medium containing 0.2% (w/w) yeast extract, 0.3% (w/w) bovine elastin, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, and artificial seawater (pH 8.0). The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)) for desalination. The dialyzed sample then was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), and bound proteins were eluted with an increasing gradient NaCl (0–0.3 m). Fractions with protease activity were collected. The purified protease was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and was named pseudoalterin. The purified pseudoalterin electrophoresed into SDS-polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The N-terminal sequence of pseudoalterin was obtained by Edman degradation with PROCISE491 (Applied Biosystems) at Beijing University (China), and the resulting sequence was ATFTMNLPWSQGYYY. This sequence was subjected to NCBI Blastp, which showed that it has a relatively high identity with staphylolysin, a protease in family M23A. Two degenerate primers were designed, based on the N-terminal sequence of pseudoalterin and the conserved sequence in the catalytic domain of peptidases in family M23. The genomic DNA of Pseudoalteromonas sp. CF6-2 was extracted using a genomic extraction kit (Bioteke, China). Using the genomic DNA of Pseudoalteromonas sp. CF6-2 as template, PCR amplification was performed using EasyTaq DNA polymerase (TransGen Biotech, China) for 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. A 303-bp fragment was amplified and sequenced by Biosune Inc. (China). The thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR was then performed as described by Chen et al. (37Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y. A novel type of subtilase from the psychrotolerant bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913. Catalytic and structural properties of deseasin MCP-01.Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the remainder of the gene was amplified. Through assembly, a 1212-bp open reading frame encoding pseudoalterin was obtained. Following verification by PCR, the sequence of this gene was submitted to GenBankTM under the accession number HQ005379. The proteolytic activity on casein was determined at 25 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm (pH 9.0)) as described by He et al. (38He H.L. Chen X.L. Li J.W. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Taste improvement of refrigerated meat treated with cold-adapted protease.Food Chem. 2004; 84: 307-311Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One unit of caseinolytic activity was defined as the amount of 1 μg of tyrosine that formed by enzyme catalysis in 1 min. Collagenolytic and elastolytic activities were assayed at 25 °C (39Zhao G.Y.

(1972) Worthington Enzyme Manual, pp. 43–45, Freehold, NJGoogle Scholar). One unit of elastinolytic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that increased 0.01 unit of absorbance at 590 nm/min. For collagen and gelatin, 1 unit is defined as the release of 1 μmol of l-leucine equivalents from collagen in 5 h and from gelatin in 1 min. Fibrin degradation was determined electrophoretically (41Datta G. Dong A. Witt J. Tu A.T. Biochemical characterization of basilase, a fibrinolytic enzyme from Crotalus basiliscus basiliscus.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To assay the activity of pseudoalterin on gamma globulin, 50 μg of the substrate was treated with 0.6 μg of pseudoalterin at 25 °C for 0–120 min, and then the digested samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteolytic activity using the substrates furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu-NH2 and furylacryloyl-Gly-Phe-NH2 was detected using Feder's method (42Feder J. A spectrophotometric assay for neutral protease.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Bradford assays were used to determine protein concentrations (43Kruger N.J. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 15-20Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. Pseudoalterin was incubated with oxidized insulin B chain (1:40, by mass) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C for 5, 10, and 15 min. 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to terminate the reaction. The products were separated on a C18 column (Venusil MP C18, China) using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Shimadzu system with two LC-20AT pumps and an SPD-M20A spectrometer (44Authier F. Metioui M. Fabrega S. Kouach M. Briand G. Endosomal proteolysis of internalized insulin at the C-terminal region of the B chain by cathepsin D.J. Biol.

Molecular masses of the hydrolytic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) Ion Trap 6340 (Agilent), and the sequences of the peptides were obtained with MASCOT MS/MS Ion Research tools. Bovine elastin (10 mg) was incubated with pseudoalterin (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring. Bovine elastin in the same buffer without pseudoalterin served as negative controls. After treatment for either 1 or 2 h, samples were assessed by inverted microscopy (Olympus IX71, Japan) at room temperature. Soluble products from pseudoalterin digestion of 10 mg of elastin were boiled for 10 min to terminate the reaction and loaded onto LC-MS to analyze the molecular masses of the released peptides. The sequences of these peptides were analyzed by MASCOT MS/MS Ion Research tools and ExPASy tools. To confirm these cleavage sites, peptides GVGVAP, IGGGAGG, GIGLGP, PGAGARF, AAAKAA, and AAAAAKAAAK were synthesized by ChinaPeptides Co., Ltd. (China). Each of these peptides (5 μg) was mixed with 5 μg of pseudoalterin in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). After incubation at 25 °C for 600 min for GVGVAP, IGGGAGG, GIGLGP, and PGAGARF and 110 min for AAAKAA and AAAAAKAAAK, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Molecular masses and sequences of all peptides were then determined as described above. Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 20 μg of pseudoalterin in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 36 h followed by addition of 500 μl of 4% sulfosalicylic acid to terminate the reaction and precipitate long peptides. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was lyophilized and redissolved in 50 μl of 0.01 m hydrochloric acid. DES and its derivatives in the sample were desalinated and detected using Ion Trap 6340 LC-MS (Agilent). DES standard was prepared in 0.01 m HCl at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. The same treatment with BSA instead of bovine elastin served as controls. Recombinant human tropoelastin isoform SHELdelta26A was purified as described previously (12Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S.

Tropoelastin was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Chemical cross-linker BS3 (10 mm) was added to the solution, which was spread thinly on aluminum foil and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to cross-link. The cross-linked tropoelastin was washed with the PBS repeatedly, followed by hydrolysis with 0.1 mg/ml pseudoalterin for 10 and 15 min at 25 °C. The residual cross-linked layer was washed and dehydrated (10Tu Y. Wise S.G. Weiss A.S. Stages in tropoelastin coalescence during synthetic elastin hydrogel formation.Micron. 2010; 41: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The samples on the aluminum foil were spatter-coated with 5 nm of platinum and examined with a Hitachi FE-S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 5.0 kV. Five milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 10 μg of pseudoalterin in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring for different times. The same reaction system without pseudoalterin served as the negative control. After washing twice with deionized water, the insoluble mass was lyophilized, mounted on stubs, and examined by SEM as described above. The most abundant protease secreted by strain CF6-2 was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant, which resulted in 1.5-fold purification and a final yield of 33.7% (supplemental Table S1 and supplemental Fig. S1). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated an apparent molecular mass of about 19 kDa (supplemental Fig. S2). This purified protease was designated pseudoalterin.

https://openalex.org/W2011142470,"The adherence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the host urothelial surface is the first step for establishing UPEC infection. Uroplakin Ia (UPIa), a glycoprotein expressed on bladder urothelium, serves as a receptor for FimH, a lectin located at bacterial pili, and their interaction initiates UPEC infection. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is known to be expressed on mucosal surfaces in various tissues besides the lung. However, the functions of SP-D in the non-pulmonary tissues are poorly understood. The purposes of this study were to investigate the possible function of SP-D expressed in the bladder urothelium and the mechanisms by which SP-D functions. SP-D was expressed in human bladder mucosa, and its mRNA was increased in the bladder of the UPEC infection model in mice. SP-D directly bound to UPEC and strongly agglutinated them in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Co-incubation of SP-D with UPEC decreased the bacterial adherence to 5637 cells, the human bladder cell line, and the UPEC-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, preincubation of SP-D with 5637 cells resulted in the decreased adherence of UPEC to the cells and in a reduced number of cells injured by UPEC. SP-D directly bound to UPIa and competed with FimH for UPIa binding. Consistent with the in vitro data, the exogenous administration of SP-D inhibited UPEC adherence to the bladder and dampened UPEC-induced inflammation in mice. These results support the conclusion that SP-D can protect the bladder urothelium against UPEC infection and suggest a possible function of SP-D in urinary tract."

Although mutations that abrogate Jak3 functions cause different immunological disorders, its constitutive activation leads to various types of cancer. Previously, we demonstrated that Jak3 interacted with actin-binding protein villin, thereby facilitating cytoskeletal remodeling and wound repair. In this study, we characterize the structural determinants that regulate the interactions between Jak3 and cytoskeletal proteins of the villin/gelsolin family. Functional reconstitution of kinase activity by recombinant full-length (wt) Jak3 using Jak3-wt or villin/gelsolin-wt as substrate showed that Jak3 autophosphorylation was the rate-limiting step during interactions between Jak3 and cytoskeletal proteins. Determination of kinetic parameters showed that phosphorylated (P) Jak3-wt binds to P-villin-wt with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 23 nm and a Hill's coefficient of 3.7. Pairwise binding between Jak3 mutants and P-villin-wt showed that the FERM domain of Jak3 was sufficient for binding to P-villin-wt with a Kd of 40.0 nm. However, the SH2 domain of Jak3 prevented P-villin-wt from binding to the FERM domain of nonphosphorylated protein. We demonstrate that the intramolecular interaction between the FERM and SH2 domains of nonphosphorylated Jak3 prevented Jak3 from binding to villin and that tyrosine autophosphorylation of Jak3 at the SH2 domain decreased these intramolecular interactions and facilitated binding of the FERM domain to villin.

https://openalex.org/W2005522391,"Sequencing of entire bacterial genomes has led to the identification of many membrane-associated transporters, including several multidrug resistance transport proteins, in recent years. However, the regulators and signaling pathways involved in the expression of these genes remain largely unknown. In this study, we have identified Ms2173, a GntR/FadR family transcription factor, as a novel global regulator in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Ms2173 was found to specifically recognize a 15-bp palindromic motif and to broadly regulate expression of 292 genes, including 37 genes that encode membrane-associated transport proteins. Copper ions induced Ms2173 to form inactive proteins lacking DNA-binding activity. Ms2173 was shown to function as a repressor of its target genes. Interestingly, we found that the function of Ms2173 was linked to mycobacterial drug resistance. Compared with the substantially enhanced drug resistance in the Ms2173-deleted mutant strain, the strains overexpressing Ms2173 were more sensitive to anti-tuberculosis drugs than the wild-type strain. Additionally, copper ions could partially counteract the in vivo function of Ms2173. We have thus characterized the first mycobacterial GntR/Fad-like transcription factor that functions as a copper ion-responsive global repressor that we have renamed GfcR. These findings further enhance our understanding of membrane-associated transporter regulation and drug resistance in mycobacteria.

Compared with the substantially enhanced drug resistance in the Ms2173-deleted mutant strain, the strains overexpressing Ms2173 were more sensitive to anti-tuberculosis drugs than the wild-type strain. Additionally, copper ions could partially counteract the in vivo function of Ms2173. We have thus characterized the first mycobacterial GntR/Fad-like transcription factor that functions as a copper ion-responsive global repressor that we have renamed GfcR. These findings further enhance our understanding of membrane-associated transporter regulation and drug resistance in mycobacteria. In recent decades, the appearance and spread of bacterial drug resistance has become a major health issue worldwide. Important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative microbe for tuberculosis, have now acquired multi-drug resistance (MDR) 3The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug resistanceINHisoniazidRIFrifampicin.

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of bacterial drug resistance is therefore an important and urgent goal with significant implications for human health and disease worldwide. multidrug resistance isoniazid rifampicin. Several studies have shown that bacterial drug resistance occurs by numerous mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation, drug target alteration or protection, and reduced uptake (2Davies J.E.

Among them, increase in active membrane-bound efflux pumps that transport toxic antibacterial drugs from the cell is a major concern, especially because individual MDR pumps are capable of exporting a number of structurally dissimilar drugs (4Walsh C.

In recent years, a number of bacterial regulatory proteins that govern the expression of drug transporters have been characterized (3Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Regulation of bacterial drug export systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 671-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Such proteins encompass both repressors and activators such as the Escherichia coli TetR and EmrR (6Hillen W. Berens C. Mechanisms underlying expression of Tn10-encoded tetracycline resistance.Annu.

Interestingly, several global regulators such as MarA, Rob, and SoxS have been shown to enhance the expression of the E. coli acrAB MDR locus (10Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Alteration of the repressor activity of MarR, the negative regulator of the Escherichia coli marRAB locus, by multiple chemicals in vitro.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4669-4672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have provided a basic picture of the regulatory pathways controlling the expression of drug efflux genes in bacteria. However, additional MDR transporter homologs have been identified by sequencing the entire bacterial genome, and their regulators and underlying regulatory mechanisms remain to be explored (11Paulsen I.T. Chen J. Nelson K.E. Saier Jr., M.H. Comparative genomics of microbial drug efflux systems.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar). Mycobacterium smegmatis is a fast-growing model mycobacterium and has been widely used to study the gene regulatory mechanism of virulent and slow-growing species like M. tuberculosis (12Yang M.

The genomes of both M. smegmatis (GenBanktm accession number CP000480) and M. tuberculosis encode at least two dozen putative drug efflux transporters (14Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T.

Several of these transporters have been shown to contribute to mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), tetracycline, and other toxic compounds (15Li X.Z. Zhang L. Nikaido H.

The large number of putative drug efflux systems and their potential regulators, therefore, underscore the complexity of the mechanisms involved in regulation of drug resistance in M. smegmatis (18Li X.Z. Nikaido H. Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria. An update.Drugs. 2009; 69: 1555-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, potential regulators involved in broad regulation of expression of membrane-associated transporter genes have not been successfully isolated to date. GntR, named after a repressor of the B. subtilis gluconate operon (19Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. A new family of bacterial regulatory proteins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 79: 291-295Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar), is a large, poorly characterized transcriptional regulation family both in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (20Vindal V. Ranjan S.

Suma K. Ranjan A. GntR family of regulators in Mycobacterium smegmatis. A sequence and structure based characterization.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 289Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GntR family proteins possess a highly conserved N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix domain for DNA-binding and a diverse C-terminal ligand-binding domain for effector-binding/oligomerization (19Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. A new family of bacterial regulatory proteins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 79: 291-295Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The variable C-terminal domain provides a basis for their classification into subfamilies such as FadR, HutC, MocR, YtrA, AraR, and PlmA (22Rigali S. Derouaux A. Giannotta F. Dusart J.

FadR is the largest subfamily, comprising ∼40% of all GntRs, and most of them are involved in the regulation of oxidized substrates such as pyruvate (PdhR), gluconate (GntR), glycolate (GlcC), and L-lactate (LldR) (22Rigali S.

However, no GntR/Fad family regulator has been functionally identified and characterized in mycobacteria to date. In this study, we have successfully isolated and characterized the first GntR/FadR-like transcription factor, Ms2173, in M. smegmatis. Ms2173 acts as a novel master regulator that responds to copper ions and regulates expression of a diverse set of genes that includes 37 membrane-associated transporters. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that Ms2173 functions as a global repressor and negatively affects mycobacterial drug resistance. Thus, we have identified a new regulatory pathway for bacterial drug resistance that is mediated by a unique copper ion-responsive GntR/FadR-like regulator in mycobacteria. E. coli BL21 strains and the pET28a plasmid were purchased from Novagen. All restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, Pyrobest DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and all antibiotics were purchased from TaKaRa Biotech. PCR primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (supplemental Tables S1–S4). About 500 predicted regulatory genes in the genome of M. smegmatis mc2155 (GenBankTM accession number CP000480) were cloned downstream of the tetracycline-inducible promoter tetO in pMind (30Blokpoel M.C. Murphy H.N. O'Toole R. Wiles S. Runn E.S. Stewart G.R. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Tetracycline-inducible gene regulation in mycobacteria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e22Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into M. smegmatis. Transformant strains were spotted on Middlebrook 7H10 medium (complemented with 0.2% glycerol) containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml tetracycline. The INH-sensitive transformants were screened on the above medium with or without 10 μg/ml INH. The used INH concentration (10 μg/ml) for screening was chosen according to multiple experiments in which condition the INH-sensitivities of transformants were easily observed. The recombinant plasmids were isolated from the INH-sensitive M. smegmatis transformants and, therefore, the negative regulator genes could be characterized. Ms2173 and its mutant genes were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of M. smegmatis mc2155 and were cloned into the pET28a vector to produce recombinant vectors. After being transformed with the recombinant plasmid (supplemental Table S5), E. coli BL21 cells were grown in 200 ml Luria Bertani medium up to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were collected, and proteins were purified using an affinity column as described previously (31Wang Y. Huang Y. Xue C. He Y. He Z.G.

A common SDS-PAGE was used to determine the protein molecular weight. The structure of Ms2173 was modeled computationally using the automated comparative protein modeling web server SWISS-MODEL (32Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace. A web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6033) Google Scholar). The E. coli FadR family of proteins (27van Aalten D.M.

DNA fragments for the DNA-binding activity assays were amplified by PCR from M. smegmatis mc2155 genomic DNA or directly synthesized by Invitrogen (supplemental Table S5). The DNA substrates were labeled and prepared as described previously (31Wang Y. Huang Y. Xue C. He Y. He Z.G.

EMSA experiments with labeled DNA fragments were performed as described previously (12Yang M. Gao C. Wang Y. Zhang H. He Z.G. Characterization of the interaction and cross-regulation of three Mycobacterium tuberculosis RelBE modules.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). The 150-bp promoter regions of the Ms2173 gene (coding strand and non-coding strand) (supplemental Table S3) were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (supplemental Tables S1 and S3). The amplified products were purified with a DNA purification kit (BioFlux) and then subjected to similar binding reaction as in EMSA. DNaseI footprinting was performed as described previously (13Li Y. Zeng J. Zhang H. He Z.G.

The ladders were produced using the Sanger dideoxy method. Knockout of the Ms2173 gene from M. smegmatis was performed as described previously (31Wang Y. Huang Y. Xue C. He Y. He Z.G.

Allelic exchange mutants in which the Ms2173 gene had been deleted were identified by restriction digestion and subsequent PCR analysis using the primers on each side of Ms2173 and the hygromycin gene. Deletion of Ms2173 was further verified by a previously described Southern blot analysis procedure (31Wang Y. Huang Y. Xue C. He Y. He Z.G.

Genomic DNA was digested overnight with an excess of BsrBI, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose gels. The probe consisted of a 239-bp fragment from the downstream region of the Ms2173 gene amplified using appropriate primers (supplemental Table S1). Isolation of mRNA and cDNA preparation of the Msm/pMindD and Msm/pMmindD-Ms2173 (Msm and Msm/Ms2173::hyg) strains was performed, and real-time PCR analysis was subsequently carried out according to procedures described previously (31Wang Y.

Briefly, exponentially growing M. smegmatis cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and fixation was stopped by adding 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. Cross-linked cells were harvested and resuspended. Samples of those cells were sonicated on ice and incubated with 10 μl of antibodies against Ms2173 or preimmune serum under rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. The complexes were immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose for 1 h. Cross-linking was reversed for 6 h at 65 °C. DNA samples of the input and the immunoprecipitates were purified and analyzed by PCR using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). The amplification protocol included one denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C and then 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Growth patterns of the wild-type (Msm), Ms2173-deleted mutant (Msm/ΔMs2173), and overexpression (Msm/pMindD-Ms2173) mycobacterial strains were determined according to procedures described previously (12Yang M. Gao C. Wang Y. Zhang H. He Z.G. Characterization of the interaction and cross-regulation of three Mycobacterium tuberculosis RelBE modules.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with some modifications. M. smegmatis was grown in 100 ml of 7H9 medium when needed, and 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 ng/ml Tet or 30 μg/ml INH were added. Each mycobacterial strain was also freshly grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin if needed. When cells reached a stationary growth phase with an A600 of 1.5 to 2.0, the cultures were diluted in Middlebrook 7H9 medium to an A600 of 0.2 and split for induction with or without 2.5 μm metal ions (Cu2+ or Zn2+) or drugs (30 μg/ml INH or 2 μg/ml RIF). The cultures were conducted with an additional growth in 7H10 medium at 37 °C at 200 rpm for 3–4 days. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times, and A600 was measured. At the same time, a small aliquot of the culture was plated on 7H10 medium for determining colony forming units. To identify potential transcription factors that regulate drug resistance in M. smegmatis, we screened the transcriptional regulator library by spotting these recombinant strains on plates containing INH (10 μg/ml). A hypothetical transcription factor named Ms2173 was isolated as a potential contributor to INH sensitivity in M. smegmatis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mycobacterial strain transformed with pMind-Ms2173 and, thus overexpressing Ms2173, grew very slowly on the screening plate and was more sensitive to 10 μg/ml of INH than the wild-type strain. In contrast, recombinant strains overexpressing two unrelated genes, Ms0895 and Ms1117, under the same condition had similar growth as the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Ms2173 is potentially involved in regulating INH drug resistance in M. smegmatis. A further sequence BLAST assay found that Ms2173 contained an N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a typical FadR-like C-terminal domain, indicating that Ms2173 encodes a GntR/FadR-like regulator (Fig. 1B). We measured the regulatory effects of several metal ions on the DNA-binding activity of Ms2173 (supplemental Fig. S1), and only copper ions (Cu2+) could inhibit the DNA-binding activity of Ms2173. We further examined the Cu2+ concentration-dependent inhibition on the DNA-binding activity of Ms2173. As shown in Fig. 2A, 6 μm of the Ms2173 protein alone could shift the mobility of DNA substrates in the reactions. However, a stepwise decrease in the formation of DNA/protein complexes was clearly observed with the addition of increasing amounts of Cu2+ into the reactions (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the DNA-binding activity of Ms2173 is inhibited by Cu2+. In contrast, zinc ions had no similar role under the same conditions (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, when Ms2173 was first preincubated with DNA substrates for 30 min and the same amount of Cu2+ as above was then added into the reactions, the inhibitory effect of Cu2+ was significantly lower (Fig. 2A, right panel). This indicates that the binding affinity of Cu2+ to Ms2173 is weak compared with that of Ms2173 to DNA. Several truncated DNA substrates covering the promoter region of Ms2173, designated as S1–S3 (Fig. 3A), were produced to characterize the DNA motif recognized by the Ms2173 protein. An obvious DNA-binding activity was observed with the 67-bp substrate S1, but not with S2 or S3 in EMSA assays (Fig. 3A). A competition assay confirmed the specificity of the binding of Ms2173 with the S1 DNA fragment (Fig. 3B). When unlabeled S1 or S2 DNA substrates were tested for their ability to compete with the labeled S1 DNA, only S1, but not S2, could inhibit the binding of Ms2173 to the labeled S1 DNA substrate (Fig. 3B). The binding motif for Ms2173 was mapped by further DNase I footprinting assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, the region around GTGAACCAGTGGAGCACTGGCCTAG was protected on the coding strand when increasing amounts of Ms2173 protein (0–6 μm) were coincubated with DNaseI. Similarly, the region around CTAGGCCAGTGCTCCACTGGTTCAC was protected when the non-coding DNA strand was used as the substrate (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, Cu2+ (100 μm) was able to reduce the protection of these DNA regions by Ms2173 (Fig. 4C, lane 5), which is consistent with the inhibitory effect of Cu2+ on the DNA-binding activity of Ms2173 described above (Fig. 2B). The protected DNA region extended from positions −127 to −113 (relative to the translational start codon) in the coding strand and from positions −46 to −32 in the non-coding strand (Fig. 4D). A palindromic motif formed by two inverted repeats (5′-CCAGTG-3′) separated from each other by three nucleotides (Fig. 4D) was found in this protected sequence. Further EMSA assays confirmed the significance of this motif for specific recognition by Ms2173 (Fig. 4E). Ms2173 was incapable of binding with the S6 and S7 fragments, in which the two inverted repeats were mutated. In contrast, Ms2173 bound well with the S5 DNA substrate in which only the three nucleotides between the two inverted repeats were replaced (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that Ms2173 recognizes and binds to an essential palindromic sequence motif. A total of 292 potential target genes were identified when the intergenic regions of the M. smegmatis genome were searched on the basis of the sequence motif identified above (supplemental Table S6). We then analyzed the classification and number of these target genes in the context of clusters of orthologous groups (COG) categories. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, among several defined COG categories, strikingly, the potential targets included promoters of 37 membrane-associated transporter genes (supplemental Table S7). Using the WebLogo tool (35Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo. A sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8291) Google Scholar), a more general conserved motif sequence for Ms2173 binding was characterized, as shown in Fig. 5C. Furthermore, target promoters of all 37 of these genes could be specifically recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation using the Ms2173 antibody (Fig. 5D). Importantly, the Ms2173 antibody could not recover Ms0103p, a negative control. Further EMSA experiments also confirmed that Ms2173 could bind with many upstream DNA regions of these ta"

We found that C1orf61 is up-regulated in hepatic cirrhosis tissues and is further up-regulated in primary HCC tumors. Moreover, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive patients exhibited significantly higher levels of C1orf61 expression than HBV-negative patients. The evaluation of highly malignant HCC cell lines revealed high protein expression levels of C1orf61. Furthermore, the C1orf61 protein was found to be predominantly distributed within the cytoplasm. The ectopic expression of C1orf61 in the nonmalignant L02 cell line promoted cellular proliferation and colony formation in vitro, as well as cell cycle progression via the regulation of the expression of specific cell cycle-related proteins. In addition, the overexpression of C1orf61 in L02 cells facilitated cellular invasion and metastasis. The down-regulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and occludin) and the up-regulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, and snail) suggested that the overexpression of C1orf61 induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is linked to metastasis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, the roles of C1orf61 in HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1971418768,"Phospholipase A(2) activity plays key roles in generating lipid second messengers and regulates membrane topology through the generation of asymmetric lysophospholipids. In particular, the Group VIA phospholipase A(2) (GVIA-iPLA(2)) subfamily of enzymes functions independently of calcium within the cytoplasm of cells and has been implicated in numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, and membrane transport steps. However, mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal regulation of these enzymes have remained mostly unexplored. Here, we examine the subset of Caenorhabditis elegans lipases that harbor a consensus motif common to members of the GVIA-iPLA(2) subfamily. Based on sequence homology, we identify IPLA-1 as the closest C. elegans homolog of human GVIA-iPLA(2) enzymes and use a combination of liposome interaction studies to demonstrate a role for acidic phospholipids in regulating GVIA-iPLA(2) function. Our studies indicate that IPLA-1 binds directly to multiple acidic phospholipids, including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, and phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol. Moreover, the presence of these acidic lipids dramatically elevates the specific activity of IPLA-1 in vitro. We also found that the addition of ATP and ADP promote oligomerization of IPLA-1, which probably underlies the stimulatory effect of nucleotides on its activity. We propose that membrane composition and the presence of nucleotides play key roles in recruiting and modulating GVIA-iPLA(2) activity in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2013924665,"The K7L gene product of the smallpox virus is a protease implicated in the maturation of viral proteins. K7L belongs to protease Clan CE, which includes distantly related cysteine proteases from eukaryotes, pathogenic bacteria, and viruses. Here, we describe its recombinant high level expression, biochemical mechanism, substrate preference, and regulation. Earlier studies inferred that the orthologous I7L vaccinia protease cleaves at an AG-X motif in six viral proteins. Our data for K7L suggest that the AG-X motif is necessary but not sufficient for optimal cleavage activity. Thus, K7L requires peptides extended into the P7 and P8 positions for efficient substrate cleavage. Catalytic activity of K7L is substantially enhanced by homodimerization, by the substrate protein P25K as well as by glycerol. RNA and DNA also enhance cleavage of the P25K protein but not of synthetic peptides, suggesting that nucleic acids augment the interaction of K7L with its protein substrate. Library-based peptide preference analyses enabled us to design an activity-based probe that covalently and selectively labels K7L in lysates of transfected and infected cells. Our study thus provides proof-of-concept for the design of inhibitors and probes that may contribute both to a better understanding of the role of K7L in the virus life cycle and the design of novel anti-virals."
https://openalex.org/W2058902107,"We have shown previously that endogenous flotillin-1 and -2, closely related proteins implicated in scaffolding of membrane microdomains, are rapidly recruited to the uropods of chemoattractant-stimulated human neutrophils and T-cells and are involved in cell polarization. Coexpressed flotillin-1 and -2, but not singly expressed proteins, are also targeted to the uropod of T-cells and neutrophils. Biochemical studies suggest formation of flotillin homo- and hetero-oligomers in other cell types, but so far knowledge is lacking on in situ flotillin organization in leukocytes. We have now analyzed flotillin organization in human T-cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Coexpressed C-terminally tagged flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) show significant FRET when analyzed in intact human T-cells in the absence and presence of chemokine. In contrast, little FRET was observed between coexpressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP before or after chemokine addition, indicating predominant formation of heterodimers and/or -oligomers. Interestingly coexpression of untagged flotillin-2 strongly enhanced FRET between differently tagged flotillin-1 molecules in resting and chemokine-stimulated cells, indicating that close contacts of flotillin-1 molecules only occur in flotillin-2-containing hetero-oligomers. Comparable results were obtained for tagged flotillin-2. We further show that disruption of the actin network, depletion of intracellular calcium, and inhibition of phospholipase C all result in suppression of chemokine-induced polarization and flotillin cap formation, but do not abolish FRET between tagged flotillin-1 and -2.

Chemotactic migration of the highly motile T-cells is indispensable for fulfillment of their functions such as rapid recognition of foreign antigens, stimulation of antibody production, and destruction of virally infected cells or tumor cells. T-cell polarization and directional migration is a complex, not yet well understood process. Certainly it involves a functional cytoskeleton, reversible actin polymerization in the front, and myosin-dependent contractility in the rear of a migrating, polarized cell (1Krummel M.F. Macara I. Maintenance and modulation of T cell polarity.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Friedl P. Weigelin B. Interstitial leukocyte migration and immune function.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Polarization of leukocytes requires segregation and activation of specific signaling and cytoskeletal molecules in the retracting rear (uropod) and motile forward moving part (front) of the cells. Localized positive feedback loops and inhibitory effects of front signaling pathways on rear signaling and vice versa are thought to reinforce this structural and biochemical polarization (3Bagorda A. Parent C.A. Eukaryotic chemotaxis at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2621-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane microdomains (“rafts”) have been implicated to stabilize polarity of migrating leukocytes (4Mañes S. Viola A. Lipid rafts in lymphocyte activation and migration.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have studied reorganization of reggie/flotillins, putative raft-scaffolding proteins, in polarizing leukocytes. Flotillin-1 and -2 are two highly homologous proteins whose enrichment in membrane microdomains has been ubiquitously observed. Flotillins are thought to be involved in structuring membrane microdomains and have been implicated in the delivery of membranes and membrane proteins to cell contact sites, regenerating axons, growth cones, etc. (5Banning A. Tomasovic A. Tikkanen R. Functional aspects of membrane association of reggie/flotillin proteins.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2011; 12: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that flotillin-1 and -2 interact and, upon stimulation with chemotactic agents, rapidly form membrane caps and at later time points accumulate in the uropods of polarized primary human neutrophils and T-lymphocytes. Capping of endogenous flotillins in human neutrophils and T-cells depends on actin dynamics but does not require Rho-kinase or myosin II activity. Capping of ectopically expressed flotillins requires cotransfection of flotillin-1 and-2, suggesting that uropod expression requires heterodimer or hetero-oligomer formation (6Rossy J. Schlicht D. Engelhardt B. Niggli V.

However, data on the organization of flotillins in T-cells, and the impact of cell stimulation on oligomerization, are not yet available. Transfection of T-cells with a dominant negative mutant of flotillin-2 impaired cell polarization and uropod capping of endogenous flotillin-1 and the adhesion receptor P-selectin glycoprotein-1, indicating a functional role of flotillins in cell polarization (7Affentranger S.

These findings are in line with those obtained by Ludwig et al. (8Ludwig A. Otto G.P. Riento K. Hams E. Fallon P.G. Nichols B.J. Flotillin microdomains interact with the cortical cytoskeleton to control uropod formation and neutrophil recruitment.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), who studied neutrophils from flotillin-1 knock-out mice. Their data showed that the lack of flotillin-1, which leads to a reduction of flotillin-2 and its displacement from rafts, results in impairment of murine neutrophil uropod formation and migration through Matrigel (8Ludwig A.

Biochemical studies in HeLa cells and Neuro2a cells, using cross-linking and sucrose gradient centrifugation of cell lysates, suggest that endogenous as well as ectopically expressed flotillins form homo- and hetero-oligomers (9Neumann-Giesen C.

C-terminal regions (as 184–321) in flotillin-2 have been implicated in oligomerization (11Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A.

Most of these data have been obtained with in vitro or invasive methods involving cell solubilization, in cells of low motility. We have now studied in situ organization of the flotillin scaffolds in human T-cells before and after addition of chemokine using FRET assays. We provide evidence for significant FRET between C-terminally tagged flotillin-2-EGFP and flotillin-1-mCherry in resting and chemokine-stimulated human T-cells, which is not abolished by treatments that suppress T-cell polarity and flotillin cap formation such as disruption of F-actin, depletion of cytosolic calcium, or inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC). 2The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinPFAparaformaldehydeROIregion of interestSDF-1stromal cell-derived factor 1.

Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) was from Peprotech. Latrunculin A, U73343, and U73122 were from Alexis Biochemicals. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Serva. Gey's solution contained 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 100 μm EGTA, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), without or with 1 mm MgSO4, 1.1 mm CaCl2, as indicated in the figure legends. If not mentioned otherwise in the figure legends, experiments were carried out in Gey's solution without calcium and magnesium. Monoclonal murine antibodies directed against flotillin-1 (F65020) and flotillin-2 (E35820) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories/BD Pharmingen. Polyclonal anti-flotillin-2 (sc-25507) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. C-terminally tagged flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP constructs were prepared as described (6Rossy J. Schlicht D. Engelhardt B. Niggli V. Flotillins interact with PSGL-1 in neutrophils and, upon stimulation, rapidly organize into membrane domains subsequently accumulating in the uropod.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Untagged flotillin-1 and -2 constructs were prepared by amplifying flotillin-1 and -2 from the plasmids coding for the tagged flotillins by PCR using Phusion polymerase. The specific primers contained XhoI excision sites (forward primers) and NotI (flotillin-2) or HindIII (flotillin-1) excision sites (reverse primers), while also restoring the stop codons of the flotillins. PCR products were double-digested using XhoI/HindIII or XhoI/NotI, purified by gel extraction and cloned into phCMV1 vectors digested with the same restriction enzymes. Resting T-lymphocytes were isolated from buffy coats using the Pan T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec) and separation on LD columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, mononuclear cells obtained from buffy coats as described previously (11Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Reggie/flotillin proteins are organized into stable tetramers in membrane microdomains.Biochem.

Cells binding these antibodies were subsequently depleted from the cell suspension using anti-biotin MicroBeads. The resulting cell suspension contained >95% T-lymphocytes as assessed using anti-CD3 staining. The cells were used after overnight incubation in RPMI with 10% FCS at 37 °C and 5% CO2. T-cells were incubated as described in the figure or table legends, followed by fixation with TCA and staining for flotillin-1 and -2, as described (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For transfections, 3–6 × 106 freshly isolated T-lymphocytes were resuspended in 100 μl of human T cell nucleofector solution (Amaxa) diluted 1:2 with PBS, and 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA per vector was added. Then, the cell suspension was transferred to a cuvette, and nucleofection was carried out (Amaxa Nucleofector, program U-14). Immediately, 500 μl of medium with 20% FCS was added, and the cells were transferred to a prewarmed 12-well plate containing 2.5 ml of medium with 20% FCS, followed by incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 6 h. Transfected cells were subsequently washed, resuspended in Gey's solution, and used for experiments. Transfected cells were treated without or with inhibitors and SDF-1, as described in the figure legends, followed by fixation with paraformaldehyde (PFA) as described (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Imaging was performed on fixed samples with a confocal laser scanning microscope Olympus Fluoview FV1000-IX81, 60× oil immersion objective, using the acceptor photobleaching module. The acceptor (mCherry) signal was bleached in defined regions of interest (ROIs) with 559 nm light at 100% laser power to ∼15% of the initial acceptor fluorescence intensity. The change in donor (EGFP) fluorescence induced by acceptor photobleaching was quantified by comparing prebleach and postbleach images obtained by excitation at 473 nm (0.5% laser power). FRET efficiency was calculated as (Ipost − Ipre)/Ipost × 100 where Ipre is the intensity of EGFP before the bleach and Ipost is the intensity of EGFP after the bleach in defined ROIs. The background was determined by outlining a ROI in a region containing no cells. This background value was subtracted from each value obtained in the cells. The mean FRET intensities obtained in at least 30 ROIs from at least three different transfections were measured for each protein pair and cell treatment. Endogenous flotillin-1 and -2 showed marked colocalization in resting and chemokine-stimulated freshly isolated human T-cells (Fig. 1A), comparable with data obtained for human expanded T-lymphoblasts (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Resting cells were mainly spherical, with a punctate, membrane-associated location of both flotillin-1 and -2, and occasional flotillin caps. Upon stimulation of cells with the chemokine SDF-1 for 15 min, the majority of the cells polarized, correlating with exclusive location of both flotillins at the plasma membrane at the tips of the uropods (Fig. 1A and Table 1). All of these data are comparable with our previous findings for human T-lymphoblasts (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ectopically expressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP showed comparable locations and extensive colocalization in resting and stimulated T-cells and did not modify chemokine-induced shape changes (Fig. 1B). As shown previously in T-lymphoblasts (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), singly expressed flotillins did not cap in the uropod of freshly isolated T-cells (see below). A possible explanation is that there are not enough free endogenous uncomplexed flotillins available for hetero-oligomer formation between tagged singly expressed flotillins and endogenous flotillins. Our previous results suggested that formation of flotillin heterodimers or hetero-oligomers occurs in T-cells and that this process is a prerequisite for uropod targeting (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 1 also indicate that the C-terminal tags do not disturb the normal location of flotillins. As flotillin heterodimer formation appears to be a functionally important process, we applied FRET to study its occurrence and regulation in human freshly isolated T-cells.TABLE 1Impact of calcium depletion or phospholipase C inhibition on T-cell polarization and flotillin cappingTreatmentPolarized cellsFlo1 capsFlo2 caps%%%Buffer7 ± 39 ± 58 ± 3SDF-185 ± 985 ± 1087 ± 8EGTA/SDF-11 ± 11 ± 11 ± 1Buffer14 ± 911 ± 614 ± 8SDF-189 ± 1492 ± 597 ± 2U73343/SDF-191 ± 689 ± 796 ± 3U73122/SDF-11 ± 12 ± 12 ± 2 Open table in a new tab We studied in situ interactions of ectopically expressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP with a FRET approach in fixed cells. As the C-terminally tagged flotillins assume the same location as endogenous flotillins in T-cells (Fig. 1), they are well suited for this technique. According to Albertazzi et al. (14Albertazzi L. Arosio D. Marchetti L. Ricci F. Beltram F. Quantitative FRET analysis with E0GFP-mCherry fluorescent protein pair.Photochem. Photobiol. 2009; 85: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), EGFP and mCherry show a good spectral overlap and allow reproducible quantification of energy transfer. A Förster radius of 51 Å for FRET was determined for these two fluorescent proteins (14Albertazzi L. Arosio D. Marchetti L. Ricci F. Beltram F. Quantitative FRET analysis with E0GFP-mCherry fluorescent protein pair.Photochem. Photobiol. 2009; 85: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We used bleaching of the acceptor mCherry in fixed cells, which results in an increase in donor (EGFP) fluorescence in case of close proximity of the two fluorescent protein tags, for FRET determinations. For resting cells, part of the membrane-associated flotillins were bleached; for the SDF-1-stimulated cells, part of the uropod cap was bleached. Substantial FRET efficiency (15 ± 4%, 50 ROIs) was obtained for coexpressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP already in the absence of chemokine, which was increased (p < 0.0001) to 25 ± 3% (120 ROIs), by chemokine stimulation of T-cells (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3B). We explain this small increase in FRET induced by stimulation of cells by SDF-1 by accumulation of more binary FRET pairs within the analyzed area due to coalescence of preexisting oligomers in caps rather than by changes in the extent of oligomerization.FIGURE 3FRET between flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP in human T-cells: impact of chemokine, disruption of F-actin, depletion of calcium, or inhibition of PLC; quantitative evaluation of data. A, for controls, T-cells were transfected with either mCherry and EGFP or flotillin-1-EGFP (flo1-EGFP) and flotillin-2-EGFP (flo2-EGFP). B–F, T-cells were transfected with flotillin-1-mCherry (flo1-mCherry) and flotillin-2-EGFP (flo2-EGFP) and treated as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2 without or with SDF-1 (B), without or with latrunculin A followed by addition of SDF-1 (C), without or with EGTA followed by the addition of SDF-1 (D), without or with of U73343 or U73122 followed by the addition of SDF-1 (E). For F, transfected cells were incubated without or with latrunculin A, EGTA, U73343, or U73122 in the absence of SDF-1. FRET images were acquired on fixed cells using acceptor photobleaching as described in the legend of Fig. 2. Data are represented as FRET efficiency (percentage) (mean ± S.D. (error bars)) determined in 30–120 ROIs derived from 3–12 independent experiments for each condition. Significance of differences between data was calculated using the unpaired two-tailed Students t test for A–D or, for E and F, the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As controls we also studied FRET in cells transfected with the tags alone, that is, mCherry and EGFP. Here we obtained a value of FRET efficiency slightly above background values obtained outside of cells, that is, 1 ± 1% (Fig. 3A). In cells transfected with flotillin-2-EGFP and flotillin-1-EGFP, apparent FRET efficiency also was very low (2 ± 3%, Fig. 3A). We showed previously that disruption of the F-actin network by latrunculin A completely prevents SDF-1-induced formation of endogenous flotillin uropod caps in T-lymphoblasts, whereas the caps are resistant to inhibition of Rho-kinase or myosin II (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We obtained comparable results for capping of endogenous flotillins and ectopically expressed flotillins in freshly isolated human T-cells (data not shown and Fig. 2C for latrunculin A). Moreover, we previously showed, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in T-lymphoblasts, that flotillins are partially immobilized already in resting cells, and that almost complete immobilization occurs upon stimulation of cells with SDF-1. Mobility of flotillins is increased markedly in resting and chemokine-stimulated cells by latrunculin A, indicating immobilization of flotillins by F-actin (7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We now wanted to know whether F-actin also modulates flotillin oligomerization. Treatment of T-cells with latrunculin A prior to addition of SDF-1 completely suppressed cap formation and prevented the small chemokine-induced apparent FRET increase (Figs. 2C and 3C) without, however, affecting FRET in resting cells (Fig. 3F). We further observed that incubation of T-cells with 6.1 mm EGTA (minimal concentration required for full effects) to deplete intracellular calcium completely disrupts SDF-1-induced formation of endogenous flotillin caps and suppresses cell polarity (Table 1). Inhibition of PLC, which induces formation of inositol 3-phosphate and a subsequent increase in intracellular calcium, by U73122, but not the inactive control substance U73343, also completely suppressed endogenous flotillin cap formation and cell polarization, even in the presence of millimolar extracellular calcium, confirming a requirement for intracellular calcium transients for these events (Table 1). We then studied the impact of calcium depletion or PLC inhibitors on FRET between flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP in SDF-1-stimulated T-cells. Calcium depletion as well as PLC inhibition prevented the chemokine-induced small apparent FRET increase (Figs. 2, D–F, and 3, D and E). EGTA or PLC inhibition did not further reduce FRET in resting cells (Fig. 3F). In summary, treatments that prevent flotillin cap formation do not affect flotillin-1 and -2 FRET in resting cells, indicating that they do not modify hetero-oligomer formation. According to the literature, flotillins form homo- as well as heterodimers (9Neumann-Giesen C. Falkenbach B. Beicht P. Claasen S. Lüers G. Stuermer C.A. Herzog V. Tikkanen R.

We now assessed possible formation of flotillin homodimers in resting and stimulated T-cells. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, coexpressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP do not form caps dependent on stimulation with SDF-1, but rather show a linear plasma membrane association both in resting and chemokine-stimulated cells. They also show a low FRET value in the absence of SDF-1 of 6 ± 2% (30 ROIs), which was not increased by SDF-1 (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5A). Cotransfection of untagged flotillin-2 with flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP induced SDF-1-dependent capping of tagged flotillin-1 and interestingly markedly induced FRET between flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP. In resting cells values of 23 ± 2% (60 ROIs) and in SDF-1-stimulated cells values of 26 ± 3% were obtained (Figs. 4, C and D, and 5A). Our data strongly suggest that flotillin-1 molecules are only brought into close proximity by interacting with flotillin-2 molecules, indicating predominant formation of flotillin hetero-oligomers in resting and activated T-cells. Comparable results were obtained for flotillin-2-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP expressed in the absence or presence of untagged flotillin-1 (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5FRET between flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP or flotillin-2-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP in human T-cells is significantly enhanced by cotransfection with untagged flotillin-1: quantitative evaluation of data.

Biochemical data, using the yeast two-hybrid system, or cross-linking, or coimmunoprecipitation, or size analysis of flotillin complexes in cell lysates, suggest formation of both homo- and hetero-oligomers in other cell types (9Neumann-Giesen C.

Most of these data were obtained in HeLa cells, cells with low motility. However, the detergents used for solubilization of cellular flotillins in these studies may modify flotillin interactions. Moreover, solubilization of flotillin complexes, which reside at least partly in detergent-insoluble fractions, may be incomplete. We now have used in situ FRET to directly study flotillin organization in human T-cells, circumventing these problems. We observed substantial FRET between the randomly membrane-associated flotillin-1 and -2 already in resting cells. SDF-1 stimulation induced a small FRET increase accompanied by coalescence of the flotillin molecules into a sharply defined membrane-associated cap at the tip of the uropod (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). These data strongly suggest that flotillin heterodimers or hetero-oligomers are formed already in resting cells, giving rise to small mobile membrane-associated platforms, corresponding to the punctate appearance of flotillins in resting cells (Fig. 1). Coalescence of flotillin platforms in stimulated cells is accompanied by an apparent increase in FRET, which is probably mainly due to coalescence of preexisting oligomers into a smaller area, although a small increase in FRET pair formation cannot be excluded. These data are comparable with those obtained in HeLa cells (13Babuke T. Ruonala M. Meister M. Amaddii M. Genzler C. Esposito A. Tikkanen R. Hetero-oligomerization of reggie-1/flotillin-2 and reggie-2/flotillin-1 is required for their endocytosis.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1287-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The question arises how flotillin hetero-oligomerization is regulated. As shown previously, flotillin capping in T-cells and neutrophils is independent of Rho-kinase or myosin II activity but requires actin dynamics (6Rossy J. Schlicht D. Engelhardt B. Niggli V. Flotillins interact with PSGL-1 in neutrophils and, upon stimulation, rapidly organize into membrane domains subsequently accumulating in the uropod.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Affentranger S. Martinelli S. Hahn J. Rossy J. Niggli V. Dynamic reorganization of flotillins in chemokine-stimulated human T-lymphocytes.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prevention of actin polymerization suppresses flotillin capping and prevents immobilization. We now observed that suppression of actin polymerization does not affect FRET between flotillin-1 and -2 in resting cells and conclude that hetero-oligomerization occurs independently of a direct or indirect actin interaction of flotillins. We have now also studied the role of calcium and PLC in regulating T-cell polarization as well as flotillin capping and hetero-oligomerization. PLC isoforms are important downstream targets of chemokine-mediated signaling in T-lymphocytes. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 3-phosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 3-phosphate then induces the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Depletion of intracellular calcium stores results in activation of calcium release-activated calcium channels resulting in calcium influx into the cells, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Both PLC activity and increases in cytosolic calcium have been implicated in T-cell migration (15Svensson L. McDowall A. Giles K.M. Stanley P. Feske S. Hogg N. Calpain 2 controls turnover of LFA-1 adhesions on migrating T lymphocytes.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15090Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Bach T.L. Chen Q.M. Kerr W.T. Wang Y. Lian L.

In none of these studies has the role of calcium and PLC in T-cell polarization and flotillin capping been addressed. We now show that both calcium depletion and PLC inhibition completely prevent SDF-1-induced T-cell polarization and flotillin capping (Table 1). In resting cells, flotillin FRET was not affected by calcium depletion or PLC inhibition (Fig. 3F). Hetero-oligomerization is thus not regulated by levels of intracellular calcium or PLC activity. To obtain further insight into organization of T-cell flotillin membrane microdomains, we investigated whether homodimers/oligomers also are formed. Homodimer formation has been suggested by data obtained for flotillin-2 with the yeast two-hybrid system (9Neumann-Giesen C. Falkenbach B. Beicht P. Claasen S. Lüers G. Stuermer C.A. Herzog V. Tikkanen R. Membrane and raft association of reggie-1/flotillin-2: role of myristoylation, palmitoylation, and oligomerization and induction of filopodia by overexpression.Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2007; 86: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, little FRET was observed between coexpressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-1-EGFP or flotillin-2-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP in our work (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Interestingly, marked FRET of these tagged proteins, in the range of that obtained for coexpressed flotillin-1-mCherry and flotillin-2-EGFP, was induced by coexpression of untagged flotillin-2 or -1, respectively. The presence of flotillin-2 in the flotillin oligomers is thus essential for FRET between flotillin-1 molecules, and vice versa. The interaction with flotillin-2 in these complexes brings two flotillin-1 molecules within distance for substantial FRET to occur (<70 Å). These data strongly suggest almost exclusive formation of flotillin hetero-oligomers in both resting and chemokine-stimulated T-cells (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). We cannot, however, completely exclude that flotillins also form homodimers in T-cells, but that the fluorescent tags are in an angle unfavorable for FRET in these complexes. We would then have to postulate a conformational change induced by hetero-oligomerization that now allows closer interaction and as a consequence FRET between differently tagged flotillin-1 or flotillin-2 molecules. This is, however, rather unlikely based on the proposed dimensions of the C-terminal flotillin oligomerization domains (approximately 5 × 1.5 nm) (17Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A.. Málaga-Trillo E. Ancient origin of reggie (flotillin), reggie-like and other lipid-raft proteins: convergent evolution of the SPFH domain.Cell. Mol.

After cross-linking, cell lysates were analyzed with immunoblotting. 200-kDa bands could be detected corresponding to homotetramers and/or heterotetramers of the endogenous flotillins. Solis et al. (11Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Reggie/flotillin proteins are organized into stable tetramers in membrane microdomains.Biochem.

Here, comparable formation of flotillin-1 and -2 homotetramers and heterotetramers was observed, somewhat in contrast to our findings in T-cells. Possibly, flotillin oligomerization is regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Flotillins contain a domain in their C terminus that is predicted to form three adjacent coiled-coils. Coiled-coil 2 (as 239–321) and partially coiled-coil 1 (as 184–238) domains in flotillin-2 may mediate tetramerization. Homo- or heterotetramers, possibly formed by a four-stranded parallel coiled-coil, have been suggested to be the only stable state of flotillins (11Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Reggie/flotillin proteins are organized into stable tetramers in membrane microdomains.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). According to our work, this would be predominantly flotillin hetero-oligomers, at least in human T-cells. In summary, we provide evidence for almost exclusive formation of hetero-oligomers of flotillin-1 and -2 in resting and chemokine-stimulated human T-cells, whose formation is independent of an intact F-actin network and is not regulated by PLC or intracellular calcium. These hetero-oligomers cluster upon cell activation and may importantly contribute to the structuring of the T-cell uropod. Open questions concern the size of the hetero-oligomers, the precise arrangement of flotillins in the hetero-oligomers, and the possible regulation of oligomerization by posttranslational modifications.

The use of sliding clamps by replicative DNA polymerases to achieve high processivity is conserved throughout evolution (1Indiani C. O'Donnell M.

Moreover, these sliding clamps provide platforms onto which other replication proteins can assemble. For example, DNA polymerase III of Escherichia coli must have the β-clamp, a ring-shaped protein preassembled on the DNA before the polymerase can productively bind to the primer-template. The polymerase, then tethered to the β-clamp, can polymerize thousands of nucleotides without dissociation from the DNA (4Yao N. Leu F.P. Anjelkovic J. Turner J. O'Donnell M.

Bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase also requires a sliding clamp for processivity as well as a docking site for other proteins (5Yang J. Zhuang Z. Roccasecca R.M. Trakselis M.A. Benkovic S.J.

Similarly, in eukaryotes, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen forms a ring-shaped structure around DNA and increases the processivity of the polymerase (1Indiani C. O'Donnell M. The replication clamp-loading machine at work in the three domains of life.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In most instances, the binding of the sliding clamp to DNA requires the assistance of a clamp loader. In contrast to the sliding clamps, several viruses have evolved different mechanisms to achieve processivity of the polymerase.

T7 gp5 dissociates from a primer-template after incorporation of less than 50 nucleotides. To achieve high processivity, gp5 forms a 1:1 complex with a host protein, thioredoxin (trx), with an apparent dissociation constant KD of 5 nm (9Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C.

Comparison of the sequence of T7 gp5 to E. coli DNA polymerase I reveals the existence of a 76-amino acid segment in gp5 that is absent from E. coli DNA polymerase I. Genetic and biochemical studies (14Yang X.M. Richardson C.C. Amino acid changes in a unique sequence of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase alter the processivity of nucleotide polymerization.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that this 76-amino acid segment is responsible for the interaction with trx; deletion of this domain abolishes the ability of the polymerase to bind trx and consequently decreases the rate of polymerization of nucleotides due to the loss of processivity. Insertion of this region into DNA polymerase I of E. coli confers a trx-dependent processivity of the polymerase, indicating that this segment itself is sufficient for binding of trx (16Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. The thioredoxin binding domain of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase confers processivity on Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 76-amino acid region is, therefore, also known as the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD). The crystal structure of gp5/trx (17Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

The thumb along with the palm and fingers forms a DNA binding groove with the palm forming the base of a cleft and the fingers and thumb forming the cleft sides (Fig. 1). In this structure trx appears to bind to the extended loop of gp5 and is rotated slightly up and away from the cleft in which the primer-DNA template lies. The precise molecular mechanism by which trx mediates processivity of gp5 is not well understood. Trx is a versatile protein originally isolated as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (19Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A.

Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of trx in this role relies on two-redox active cysteines in an exposed active loop of a conserved sequence 32CGPC35. The two cysteines can form a disulfide linkage and can participate in reversible oxidation-reduction reactions with other proteins. However, the reducing power of the active site cysteines is not required in the polymerase catalytic reaction as in the case for trx in the other reactions in which it participates (19Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Structural and functional relations among thioredoxins of different species.Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Holmgren A.

Both Cys-32 and Cys-35 can be replaced with a residue that abolishes the ability of trx to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions, but these altered trx can form functional gp5/trx complexes in vitro (22Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. Interaction of mutant thioredoxins of Escherichia coli with the gene 5 protein of phage T7. The redox capacity of thioredoxin is not required for stimulation of DNA polymerase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adler S. Modrich P. T7-induced DNA polymerase. Requirement for thioredoxin sulfhydryl groups.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The altered trx do, however, have a reduced binding affinity for gp5, suggesting that the active cysteine sites play a structural role. Indeed, the crystal structure of gp5/trx reveals that one of the two cysteines, Cys-32, hydrogen bonds with Thr-327 (highlighted in pink) in the TBD (Fig. 1). The TBD of gp5 contains a number of basic residues located in two loops, designated loop A and B (14Yang X.M. Richardson C.C. Amino acid changes in a unique sequence of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase alter the processivity of nucleotide polymerization.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6599-6606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These basic residues are in position to contact the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA in the binding cleft of gp5 (Fig. 1). It has been previously shown that the gp5/trx complex remains tightly bound and slides along the DNA while diffusing, whereas gp5 without trx diffuses along the DNA using a hopping mechanism (24Etson C.M. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. van Oijen A.M. Thioredoxin suppresses microscopic hopping of T7 DNA polymerase on duplex DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1900-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of trx to gp5 may expose a number of basic residues, and the increased affinity of the gp5/trx complex for duplex DNA may be the result of increased electrostatic interactions. It is likely that in the crystal structure shown in Fig. 1, gp5/trx has been captured in a non-processive mode. In a processive mode the thumb and bound trx are postulated to swing down onto the duplex region of the primer-template to prevent the DNA from dissociation before the next polymerization cycle. Suppressor analysis of a genetically altered trx supports this hypothesis (25Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Amino acid residues critical for the interaction between bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli thioredoxin.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19999-20008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amino acids in gp5 that restore the ability of the altered trx to confer processivity on the polymerase reside within the TBD, whereas another is located within the exonuclease domain. The latter site is interesting because it raises the possibility that the extended loop of the TBD might swing down and dock on the lip of the crevice located within the exonuclease domain, thus encircling gp5/trx around the DNA (26Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Processivity of DNA polymerases. Two mechanisms, one goal.Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, trx does indeed sit over the DNA as shown by footprinting data (27Akabayov B. Akabayov S.R. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Kulczyk A.W. Richardson C.C. Conformational dynamics of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and its processivity factor, Escherichia coli thioredoxin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15033-15038Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Loops A and B in the TBD also serve as docking sites for the acidic C termini of the T7 DNA helicase and the T7 ssDNA-binding protein, both essential components of the T7 replisome. The ability of gp5 to bind to this acidic tail of the helicase provides a mechanism for gp5/trx to be captured by the helicase in the event it transiently dissociates from the DNA, thus increasing the processivity of leading strand synthesis (28Lee S.J. Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. The C-terminal residues of bacteriophage T7 gene 4 helicase-primase coordinate helicase and DNA polymerase activities.J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 27: 539-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). gp5 has 10 cysteine residues distributed throughout the protein sequence; in contrast, E. coli DNA polymerase I of the same family has only one cysteine. Of the 10 cysteines, Cys-275 and Cys-313 are located on loop A and B, respectively, of the TBD (Fig. 1). The crystal structure suggests these two cysteines are exposed to the solvent and protein-protein binding surface (17Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Crystal structure of a bacteriophage T7 DNA replication complex at 2.2 Å resolution.Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 18Brieba L.G. Eichman B.F. Kokoska R.J.

Structural basis for the dual coding potential of 8-oxoguanosine by a high fidelity DNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The unique location of these two cysteines encouraged us to study their potential role in protein-protein interaction as well as polymerase function of gp5. We have replaced each of exposed cysteines with serine and examined the effect of the mutation on the function of gp5 both in vitro and in vivo. In this study we describe yet another role of trx: the binding of trx to gp5 sequesters an otherwise solvent-exposed cysteine that can form intermolecular disulfide bonds. E. coli A307 (HrfC, trxA−) lacking the trx coding gene and T7Δ5 phage lacking gene 5 were constructed by Stanley Tabor (Harvard Medical School). M13 mp18 phage purchased from Novagene was used to purify M13 ssDNA using a Lambda Maxi kit (Qiagen Inc.). Plasmids pGP5-3 expressing wild-type T7 gene 5 and pTrx-3 expressing E. coli trxA were generated from parent vector pT7-1 (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C.

U.S.A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar) in which the expression of gene 5 and trxA were under the control of a T7 promoter. Similarly, plasmid pTrxA expressing trxA derived from pET-24a backbone (Novagene) was used for a complementation assay. 25-nt oligo(dT) to 350-nt poly(dA) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis and primers for DNA polymerase assay were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Plasmids pGP5-C275S, pGP5-C313S, and pGP-5C275S/C313S were constructed using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The parent plasmid used for mutagenesis of gene 5 was pGP5-3. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type-gp5, gp5-C275S, gp5-C313S, and gp5-C275S/C313S were overproduced in E. coli A307 (DE3) (lacking gene trxA) using plasmids pGP5-3 and purified to homogeneity following the procedures described previously (31Johnson D.E. Richardson C.C. A covalent linkage between the gene 5 DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 and Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the processivity factor. Fate of thioredoxin during DNA synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23762-23772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Wild-type trx was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using plasmid pTrx-3 and purified as previously described (10Modrich P. Richardson C.C.

Chem. 1975; 250: 5508-5514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-reduced conditions for gp5 were generated by passing 30 μg of protein through a G-25 column (GE Healthcare) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C to remove dithiothreitol (DTT) present in the solution. Samples were collected and incubated on ice for 30 min with or without the addition of 1 mm DTT. Samples were then electrophoresed on pre-casted 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) either under reduced or non-reduced conditions by using protein loading buffer containing or lacking 1 mm DTT, respectively. Complementation assays to examine the ability of altered gp5, gp5-C275S, and gp5-C313S to support growth of phage T7Δ5 (lacking gene 5) were carried out as described previously (31Johnson D.E. Richardson C.C. A covalent linkage between the gene 5 DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 and Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the processivity factor. Fate of thioredoxin during DNA synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23762-23772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of 7-fold serial dilutions (10−7) of T7Δ5 phage were mixed with a 400 μl of cell culture of E. coli A307 (trxA−) carrying both pGP5-3 (ampicillin resistance) and pTrxA (kanamycin resistance) plasmids at A600 = 1 and 3 ml of soft agar (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 0.7% agar). Mixtures were plated on LB plates (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, and 1.5% agar) containing appropriate antibiotics. The expression of gene 5 and trxA were under the control of a T7 promoter that was induced upon the expression of T7 RNA polymerase after T7Δ5 phage infection. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The efficiency of plating was determined by dividing the number of plaque-forming units obtained with each altered gp5 against the number of plaques obtained with wild-type gp5. The circular DNA template used for DNA synthesis was prepared by annealing a 24-mer oligonucleotide (M13 primer −47) to M13 mp18 ssDNA at a molar ratio of 1:1. The homopolymeric DNA template was prepared by annealing a 25-nt oligo(dT) to 350-nt poly(dA) (dT25/dA350). The DNA polymerase assay for the primed M13 ssDNA contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 250 μm each of dGTP, dATP, and dCTP, [3H]dTTP (10 cpm/pmol), 20 nm primed M13 ssDNA, and 5 nm gp5 with a 40-fold excess of trx. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. Aliquots were spotted on DE81 ion exchange filters. Unincorporated radiolabeled nucleotides were removed by washing the filters with three successive 5-min washes in 300 mm ammonium formate (pH 8.0). Filters were dried, and the amount of [3H]dTMP incorporated into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Reactions to monitor polymerase activity on linear DNA substrate were similar to those for primed M13 ssDNA except that dT25/dA350 was added at a concentration of 200 nm, resulting in a 40-fold molar excess of DNA over polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C. Processivity assays were carried out on a circular M13 ssDNA primed with a 5′ 32P-labeled 24-nt primer (M13 primer −47). Primers for processivity assays were labeled with [γ-32P] ATP at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeling reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. M13 ssDNA was primed by annealing with the labeled 24-nt primer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Primed M13 DNA was purified using S-400 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA polymerase reaction (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 μm each of four dNTPs, 5 nm wild-type or altered gp5, 200 nm trx, and 40 nm 32P-labeled primed M13 ssDNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times aliquots (20 μl) were removed, and the reaction was terminated by EDTA (25 mm). The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.6% alkaline agarose gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate followed by scanning with a Fuji BAS 1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. 100 nm 32P-labeled primed linear DNA primer/template and increasing amount of proteins (gp5 wt or gp5-C313S: 0–10 μm) were incubated for 30 min in ice in binding buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. Reactions (10 μl) were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate EDTA buffer at 50 V for 3 h. The gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate and analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. The relative surface accessibility for all cysteines of gp5 was calculated using Naccess (32Hubbard J.J. Thornton J.H. NACCESS, computer program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar). Naccess calculates the solvent-accessible surface that is defined by rolling a probe with the size of a water molecule around a Van der Waals surface. Hydroxyapatite chromatography in phosphate buffer provides an effective method to separate free gp5 from gp5/trx (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C.

A mixture of gp5 (5 μm) and trx (50 μm) were incubated at 4 °C overnight in buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium citrate, and 10% glycerol. The mixture was then dialyzed twice against 500 ml of the same buffer. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a prepacked column of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a FPLC system (AKTA, GE Healthcare). The column was then washed with 100 ml of the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient (20–250 mm) of potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Peaks of protein elution were monitored at A280. SAXS analysis of wild-type gp5 and gp5-C313S was measured at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Upton, NY) on beamline X-9 as previously described (27Akabayov B. Akabayov S.R. Lee S.J. Tabor S.

Measurements were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml of gp5 at 15 °C. The magnitude of the scattering vector (q) is defined as, q=4πSin0λ(Eq. 1) where 2θ is the scattering angle. The experimental SAXS data for all samples showed a linear behavior (see Fig. 8) in the low q, Guinier region, indicating that gp5 did not undergo aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2009088814,"The central shaft of the catalytic core of ATP synthase, the γ subunit consists of a coiled-coil structure of N- and C-terminal α-helices, and a globular domain. The γ subunit of cyanobacterial and chloroplast ATP synthase has a unique 30-40-amino acid insertion within the globular domain. We recently prepared the insertion-removed α(3)β(3)γ complex of cyanobacterial ATP synthase (Sunamura, E., Konno, H., Imashimizu-Kobayashi, M., and Hisabori, T. (2010) Plant Cell Physiol. 51, 855-865). Although the insertion is thought to be located in the periphery of the complex and far from catalytic sites, the mutant complex shows a remarkable increase in ATP hydrolysis activity due to a reduced tendency to lapse into ADP inhibition. We postulated that removal of the insertion affects the activity via a conformational change of two central α-helices in γ. To examine this hypothesis, we prepared a mutant complex that can lock the relative position of two central α-helices to each other by way of a disulfide bond formation. The mutant obtained showed a significant change in ATP hydrolysis activity caused by this restriction. The highly active locked complex was insensitive to N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, suggesting that the complex is resistant to ADP inhibition. In addition, the lock affected ε inhibition. In contrast, the change in activity caused by removal of the γ insertion was independent from the conformational restriction of the central axis component. These results imply that the global conformational change of the γ subunit indirectly regulates complex activity by changing both ADP inhibition and ε inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2036557536,"Prothrombin is conformationally activated by von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp) from Staphylococcus aureus through insertion of the NH(2)-terminal residues of vWbp into the prothrombin catalytic domain. The rate of prothrombin activation by vWbp(1-263) is controlled by a hysteretic kinetic mechanism initiated by substrate binding. The present study evaluates activation of prothrombin by full-length vWbp(1-474) through activity progress curve analysis. Additional interactions from the COOH-terminal half of vWbp(1-474) strengthened the initial binding of vWbp to prothrombin, resulting in higher activity and an ∼100-fold enhancement in affinity. The affinities of vWbp(1-263) or vWbp(1-474) were compared by equilibrium binding to the prothrombin derivatives prethrombin 1, prethrombin 2, thrombin, meizothrombin, and meizothrombin(des-fragment 1) and their corresponding active site-blocked analogs. Loss of fragment 1 in prethrombin 1 enhanced affinity for both vWbp(1-263) and vWbp(1-474), with a 30-45% increase in Gibbs free energy, implicating a regulatory role for fragment 1 in the activation mechanism. Active site labeling of all prothrombin derivatives with D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, analogous to irreversible binding of a substrate, decreased their K(D) values for vWbp into the subnanomolar range, reflecting the dependence of the activating conformational change on substrate binding. The results suggest a role for prothrombin domains in the pathophysiological activation of prothrombin by vWbp, and may reveal a function for autocatalysis of the vWbp·prothrombin complexes during initiation of blood coagulation."

DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase enzymes (DCMTases) catalyze cytosine methylation via reaction intermediates in which the DNA is drastically remodeled, with the target cytosine residue extruded from the DNA helix and plunged into the active site pocket of the enzyme. We have determined a crystal structure of M.HaeIII DCMTase in complex with its DNA substrate at a previously unobserved state, prior to extrusion of the target cytosine and frameshifting of the DNA recognition sequence. The structure reveals that M.HaeIII selects the target cytosine and destabilizes its base-pairing through a precise, focused, and coordinated assault on the duplex DNA, which isolates the target cytosine from its nearest neighbors and thereby facilitates its extrusion from DNA.

We have determined a crystal structure of M.HaeIII DCMTase in complex with its DNA substrate at a previously unobserved state, prior to extrusion of the target cytosine and frameshifting of the DNA recognition sequence. The structure reveals that M.HaeIII selects the target cytosine and destabilizes its base-pairing through a precise, focused, and coordinated assault on the duplex DNA, which isolates the target cytosine from its nearest neighbors and thereby facilitates its extrusion from DNA. In bacteria, cytosine methylation confers resistance of the host genome to endonucleases that destroy invading foreign DNA, whereas in eukaryotes, this covalent modification underpins the system for epigenetic regulation of gene transcription (for review, see Ref. 1Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 481-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism by which these enzymes select a particular target cytosine and initiate its extrusion is largely unknown. Despite the large body of available structural data on various states of DCMTase/DNA recognition, none of these addresses the question of how the enzyme selects the target cytosine and promotes its extrusion from DNA helix. The targeting mechanism is particularly intriguing in the case of M.HaeIII, a bacterial DCMTase that not only extrudes the substrate cytosine, but also induces frameshifted base pairing and the formation of a large gap in the duplex DNA recognition site (4Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N.

M.HaeIII recognizes the sequence 5′-GGCC in DNA and transfers a methyl group to the internal C residue; each strand is methylated sequentially, with the hemimethylated sequence being a preferred substrate. Substitution of the target cytosine by 5-fluorocytosine enables the trapping of a covalent enzyme-substrate complex (11Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L.

Immediately apparent in the structures of the first two such trapped covalent complexes, M.HhaI (3Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. HhaI methyltransferase flips its target base out of the DNA helix.Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) and M.HaeIII (4Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. The crystal structure of HaeIII methyltransferase convalently complexed to DNA: an extrahelical cytosine and rearranged base pairing.Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), was the extrusion of the entire substrate cytosine nucleotide from the DNA helix. One aspect of the M.HhaI and M.HaeIII structures was strikingly different, however. Whereas the DNA duplex was nearly undisturbed in the M.HhaI structure save for the extruded target cytosine, the DNA conformation in the M.HaeIII structure was far from canonical, with the 3′-cytosine engaged in frameshifted base pairing (Fig. 1F, green) and a gaping hole in the duplex almost as wide as an entire base pair. In neither of these original structures was it clear how the DCMTase transitioned from the sequence-specific recognition mode to extrusion mode and catalysis of methyl transfer; the nature of this transition is particularly mysterious in the case of M.HaeIII, because of the drastic remodeling of the DNA recognition sequence. Despite the availability of dozens of structures of DCMTases bound to DNA, not a single structure has been determined at the state of sequence-specific recognition but preceding extrusion of the target cytosine. Therefore, the molecular origins of target recognition, selection of the target cytosine and management of its extrusion from DNA have gone unelucidated. Structures of a portion of mammalian DNMT1 bound to an intact target duplex have recently been reported (13Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), but interestingly, these studies captured the DCMTase bound to DNA in an autoinhibitory state completely distinct from the protein-DNA complex that precedes target extrusion. The aim of the present study was to capture and molecularly characterize the elusive pre-extrusion state. The C71S mutation was introduced into the wild-type M.HaeIII expression plasmid (11Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L.

The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 20–30 min at 3000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 25 ml of cold (4 °C) lysis buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.25, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All further purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cell suspension was thawed, and β-mercaptoethanol (βME) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to 10 mm and 1 mm final concentrations, respectively. Lysis was done by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 25 min, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and loaded onto a heparin column (Hi-Trap Heparin HP, 5 ml; GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 350 mm NaCl in MH buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.25, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm βME). The column was then washed with 25 ml of 350 mm NaCl in MH buffer and eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient from 350 to 700 mm NaCl in MH buffer. The fractions containing high concentrations of M.HaeIII were pooled and exchanged to HAP-A buffer (10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.25, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm βME) using size exclusion chromatography (HiPrep 26/10 Desalting; GE Healthcare). The fractions were combined and loaded onto a ≈1-ml hydroxyapatite column (Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite, type I, 40 μm; Bio-Rad), pre-equilibrated with HAP-A buffer. The column was then washed with 6 ml of HAP-A buffer and eluted with a 35-ml gradient from 100% HAP-A to 63% HAP-A plus 37% HAP-B buffer (500 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.25, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm βME). The fractions containing the purest M.HaeIII were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15, 10000 NMWL; Millipore), and further purified by gel filtration (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75; GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 100 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Crystallization Buffer). The self-complementary DNA oligonucleotide 5′-TpGpGpCpCpA-3′ was synthesized with an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer (MerMade 12; BioAutomation Corporation) using standard reagents, purified by urea-PAGE, desalted with C18+ reverse-phase chromatography (C18+ Sep-Pak cartridge; Waters), and annealed in Crystallization Buffer without dithiothreitol by cooling from ≈70 °C to 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were prepared in 1:2 protein to double-stranded DNA molar ratio at 160 μm protein concentration in Crystallization Buffer with 10 mm ATP as a crystallization additive. The complex was crystallized at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against the well solution consisting of 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 26–27% (v/v) pentaerythritol ethoxylate (15/4 EO/OH) (further referred to as PE, for brevity), 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, in water. The drops were 1:1 mixture (1 + 1 to 2 + 2 μl) of the protein-DNA and well solutions. Crystallization was highly sensitive to the state of PE as the crystals grew only when aged PE was used. Specifically, we used PE from Hampton Research, HR2–745, lot 274514. For cryoprotection the crystals were quickly dipped in 39.4% (v/v) PE, 10% glycerol, 125 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline 24-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The data used for the initial model refinement were reduced and scaled with HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar).

The structural figures and supplemental Movie S1 were rendered using PyMOL (Schrödinger). Molecular morphing simulation was performed as described (25Echols N. Milburn D. Gerstein M.

The morph server: a standardized system for analyzing and visualizing macromolecular motions in a database framework.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1665-1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the catalytic nucleophile of M.HaeIII, Cys-71, to Ser is known to afford a variant (C71S M.HaeIII) that lacks methyltransferase activity but retains sequence-specific DNA recognition that is independent of co-factor binding (7Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Verdine G.L. Mutational separation of DNA binding from catalysis in a DNA cytosine methyltransferase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5318-5319Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To characterize the DNA recognition mode of C71S M.HaeIII, we crystallized the protein in complex with a palindromic 6-mer DNA duplex (5′-TGGCCA-3′, where 5′-GGCC-3′ is the M.HaeIII recognition sequence) and solved the structure to 2.5 Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The asymmetric unit contains three protein-DNA complexes, designated as Mol A, B, and C in Fig. 2. The DNA duplexes of Mol A–C are co-axially stacked in the asymmetric unit, and the duplexes of adjacent asymmetric units also stack, thus forming a pseudocontinuous duplex through the crystal (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1). The overall structures of the three complexes are very similar (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C), with Watson-Crick base pairing maintained throughout the M.HaeIII recognition site, a fully intrahelical target cytosine, and an absence of sequence frameshifting. The three sequence-specific M.HaeIII DNA recognition sites are nearly identical (all-atom root mean square deviation ≈ 0.6Å, supplemental Fig. S2, D–G), as are the three protein monomers in the asymmetric unit (Cα root mean square deviation ≤ 0.3 Å, supplemental Fig. S3). The only significant structural differences among Mols A–C are localized to the base pairs outside the M.HaeIII recognition site, both of which are intact in Mol A, but one of which is disrupted in Mols B and C (A5 and T′5, supplemental Fig. S2, E and G). Here we present in detail the analysis of Mol A only; the details of protein-DNA interactions are essentially identical in all three complexes. Below we refer to the structure of the present M.HaeIII-DNA complex, with its intrahelical target cytosine, as InC, whereas we denote the previously determined structure of a catalytically trapped species having an extrahelical target cytosine as ExC (4Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. The crystal structure of HaeIII methyltransferase convalently complexed to DNA: an extrahelical cytosine and rearranged base pairing.Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Though the DNA conformation in InC has drastic differences from that of ExC, the overall structures of the two complexes are quite similar (Fig. 1). At the protein level, the most obvious difference in InC compared with ExC is a retraction away from DNA of loops N-terminal to helices C and D of the catalytic domain (yellow in Fig. 1). The portion of the catalytic domain bearing these loops is also slightly retracted from the DNA in InC versus ExC (supplemental Movie S1). Together, these structural alterations make the conformation of InC considerably more open at the interface between DNA and the catalytic domain than in ExC, and it is noteworthy that this opening results in partial disassembly of the active site in InC. These structural findings are thus consistent with the results of biochemical and biophysical studies on the closely related DCMTase M.HhaI, which showed that DNA binding precedes extrusion of the target nucleobase and initiation of catalysis (8Gerasimaite R.

Determinants of precatalytic conformational transitions in the DNA cytosine methyltransferase M.HhaI.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Upon formation of the closed, catalytically active state, the mobile loops of the catalytic domain acquire multiple contacts to both the duplex DNA backbone (Ser-79, Arg-87, Arg-81, Lys-112, and Gln-117) and the extrahelical target cytosine (Gly-68 and Ser-75); these contacts are likely to stabilize the extrahelical, frameshifted conformation of the complex (compare Fig. 3, C and D). A central mystery of M.HaeIII function regards how the protein could specifically recognize such drastically different DNA conformations as the B form duplex it first encounters and the drastically remodeled conformation observed in the trapped catalytic complex ExC. The M.HaeIII recognition site is rendered particularly stable by virtue of its all-G/C content, and yet in ExC, M.HaeIII manages to bring about multiple powerfully destabilizing alterations (Fig. 3D): thrusting of the Ile-221 side chain into the helical stack and complete destacking at base pairs G2/C′2 and C4/G′3, extrusion of the target cytosine C3, and frameshifting of the sequence at G′3/C4, with concomitant abandonment of pairing for G′4. The structure of InC provides clear insight into the factors that govern the formation of this highly distorted state and that target the substrate cytosine for extrusion. Details of the protein-DNA interface in the InC structure are fully consistent with the notion that InC represents a sequence-specific recognition complex formed between M.HaeIII and a fully base-paired DNA duplex bearing distortions that poise the complex for transition into the mode of target extrusion and catalysis of methyl transfer. Remarkably, InC possesses all of the sequence-specific contacts seen in ExC, with the sole exception of those made to the target C (compare Fig. 3, A and C; see supplemental Fig. S4). The only noteworthy differences in sequence-specific contacts between InC and ExC consist of subtle adjustments in hydrogen bonding configuration between two conserved sets of interacting partners, namely Arg-243 and G′4; and the Gln-244 and C4. The sequence-specific contacts thus function to anchor the complex on DNA, providing a structural platform that isolates and focuses the leverage of the protein-DNA interface on the two migratory nucleobases, C3 and C4, both of which are free of direct contacts to M.HaeIII in InC but are extensively contacted in ExC. Although no base pairs are disrupted in InC, the duplex does exhibit significant deviations from canonical B form structure that appear specifically tailored to facilitate the extrusion of C3 and migration of C4. Specifically, the InC structure possesses a large duplex gap at the site of Ile-221 insertion, between base-pairs 2 and 3 (Fig. 3A, see also Figs. 1C and 4, A and B); in ExC, this gap resides between base pair 2 and the frameshifted C4/G′3 pair (Figs. 3C and 1F). The gap is approximately the same width in the two complexes on the nontarget strand, where Ile-221 physically blocks gap closure, but is narrower on the target strand in InC than ExC. Although x-ray structures do not per se provide energetic information, a number of features in the InC structure indicate that the target G′3/C3 base pair, and in particular the extrusion target C3, is substantially destabilized relative to canonical B form DNA. First, C3 is virtually devoid of stacking interaction with either of its nearest neighbors, as it has been pried away from G2 by the insertion of Ile-221 (Fig. 4, A and B) and completely destacked from C4 by induced helical underwinding (Fig. 4C). Second, the geometry of the target base pair deviates significantly from the norm, being separated by an unusually large distance (stretch of 0.1 Å) excessively propeller-twisted (22°), and severely buckled (−21°) (Fig. 4, B and D). Third, the hydrogen bonding partner of C3, namely G′3, is engaged in a hydrogen bonding interaction between its O6 atom and the side chain amide of Gln-244 that, because of its interaction geometry, places it in direct competition with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding to C3 (Fig. 4D). A similar competing interaction with the target base pair of the DNA glycosylase MutM has been shown to facilitate base pair rupture and target extrusion (30Qi Y. Spong M.C. Nam K. Banerjee A. Jiralerspong S. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Encounter and extrusion of an intrahelical lesion by a DNA repair enzyme.Nature. 2009; 462: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutation of the residue corresponding to Gln-244 (to Ala) in the M.HaeIII homolog M.NgoPII has been shown to reduce its methyl transfer activity substantially (31Radlinska M. Kondrzycka-Dada A. Piekarowicz A. Bujnicki J.M. Identification of amino acids important for target recognition by the DNA:m5C methyltransferase M.NgoPII by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues at the protein-DNA interface.Proteins. 2005; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The structure of the pre-extrusion complex InC clearly suggests that M.HaeIII locates its specific recognition sequence, selects its target cytosine among the four cytosines within that sequence, and promotes extrusion of the target cytosine from DNA through active engagement in extensive protein-DNA interactions. First, at the pre-extrusion state represented by InC, M.HaeIII directly contacts the major groove surface of every nonmigratory nucleobase in the sequence except C′1, stabilizing their intrahelical conformation. M.HaeIII thrusts Ile-221 into the helical stack, distorting the target base pair and weakening the stacking of the target cytosine C3 with G2. M.HaeIII establishes a network of backbone contacts that induce underwinding of the DNA duplex at the site of the target base pair, destacking C3 from its other neighbor, C4. The protein positions Gln-244 in direct competition with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding of the target base pair. The protein is devoid of direct interactions with the migratory nucleobases C3 and C4, which if present could stabilize their intrahelical conformation; these nucleobases are both contacted post-migration. Likewise, M.HaeIII makes no contacts to the two backbone phosphates that undergo large positional shifts, C3pC4 and C4pA5, although these are both contacted post-extrusion (Fig. 3, C and D). The phosphate on the 5′-side of the target cytosine, G2pC3, also undergoes a significant positional shift upon extrusion, but the hydrogen bonding interaction is improved in terms of distance, geometry and number of interacting atoms upon extrusion. The active mechanism of target engagement observed here for M.HaeIII represents a completely different mode from that recently reported for the human DCMTase DNMT1, where passive discrimination against an unmethylated recognition sequence was observed (13Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this structure, the elements of protein structure responsible for specific recognition of the target sequence and selection of the target cytosine do not interact directly with the DNA duplex because they are occluded by an autoinhibitory domain in the protein. The present structure leaves open the question of whether frameshifting of the M.HaeIII recognition site occurs in synchrony with base extrusion or follows it. We note in this regard that simulated interpolation of the InC to ExC transition reveals a remarkably facile pathway for simultaneous migration of both cytosines through an intermediate in which the frameshifting base is transiently base paired to both G′4 to G′3 during the hand-off from one to the other (supplemental Movie S1). We thank Brian Bowman, Michael Eck, David Jeruzalmi, Danaya Pakotiprapha, Yan Qi, Daqi Tu, and Wilhelm Weihofen for help with crystallography; Prarthna Desai for help with protein purification and crystallization; and the entire staff at 23-ID and 24-ID beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source for help with data collection.
