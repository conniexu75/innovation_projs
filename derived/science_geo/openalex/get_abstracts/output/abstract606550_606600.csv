Plants greatly rely on their root microbiome for uptake of nutrients and protection against stresses. Recent studies have uncovered the involvement of plant stress responses in the assembly of plant-beneficial microbiomes. To facilitate durable crop production, deciphering the driving forces that shape the microbiome is crucial. The rhizosphere microbiome extends the functional repertoire of plants beyond imagination. Exciting developments in high-throughput molecular analyses of the plant microbiome pinpointed enhanced nutrient uptake, improvement of root architecture, and protection of the host against biotic and abiotic stress as key functions of the microbiome. Currently, the life processes that shaped the co-evolution between plant hosts and their beneficial microbiota members gradually come to surface. It appears that plants evolved adaptive strategies by which they utilize root-associated microbiota to optimize both nutrient acquisition and immunity. Knowledge on the mechanisms and plant genetic pathways involved provides great potential for sustainable microbiome-based improvements of our future crops. One of the most intensively studied microbiome functions is protection of the host against infectious diseases. A recent study in common beans has shown that the rhizosphere microbiome provides a first line of defense against the soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Mendes et al., 2018Mendes L.W. Raaijmakers J.M. de Hollander M. Mendes R. Tsai S.M. Influence of resistance breeding in common bean on rhizosphere microbiome composition and function.ISME J. 2018; 12: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Fusarium-resistant genotypes supported a higher abundance of specific plant-beneficial families in their rhizospheres, including Pseudomonadaceae and Bacillaceae. Moreover, metagenome analysis showed that the rhizosphere bacterial communities of Fusarium-resistant genotypes were enriched for biosynthetic genes that encode antifungal traits, such as phenazine and rhamnolipids (Mendes et al., 2018Mendes L.W. Raaijmakers J.M. de Hollander M. Mendes R. Tsai S.M. Influence of resistance breeding in common bean on rhizosphere microbiome composition and function.ISME J. 2018; 12: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The protective effect of the rhizosphere microbiome became well known from the discovery of disease-suppressive soils, which typically develop in mono-cultured crops in response to a severe disease outbreak (Raaijmakers and Mazzola, 2016Raaijmakers J.M. Mazzola M. ECOLOGY. Soil immune responses.Science. 2016; 352: 1392-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Such soils accumulate plant-protective microbiota that protect future generations of plants against the pathogen that triggered the suppressiveness. Specific microbes that are enriched in disease-suppressive soils and their plant-protecting metabolites have only rarely been identified (Raaijmakers and Mazzola, 2016Raaijmakers J.M. Mazzola M. ECOLOGY. Soil immune responses.Science. 2016; 352: 1392-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For instance, in a soil suppressive to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, the sugar beet rhizosphere microbiome was enriched for the bacterial families Oxalobacteraceae, Burkholderiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae, while stress-related bacterial genes representing antifungal activities were specifically upregulated (Chapelle et al., 2016Chapelle E. Mendes R. Bakker P.A.H.M. Raaijmakers J.M. Fungal invasion of the rhizosphere microbiome.ISME J. 2016; 10: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It was postulated that invasion by R. solani could affect the microbiome composition of the infected plant, leading to enhanced antifungal activity in the root microbiome community, thereby restricting pathogen growth. Whether the disease-mediated effects on microbiome composition and activity were a direct effect of pathogen-derived metabolites—for example, production of antimicrobial oxalic acid—or were indirectly mediated via pathogen-inflicted changes in root exudate profiles remained undetermined. In a recent study, the effect of foliar pathogen infection on root microbiome changes was investigated, excluding possible direct effects of the pathogen on the rhizosphere microbiome. Inoculation of Arabidopsis leaves with the downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis resulted in an enrichment of a Microbacterium sp., a Stenotrophomonas sp., and a Xanthomonas sp. in the rhizosphere microbial community (Berendsen et al., 2018Berendsen R.L. Vismans G. Yu K. Song Y. de Jonge R. Burgman W.P. Burmølle M. Herschend J. Bakker P.A.H.M. Pieterse C.M.J. Disease-induced assemblage of a plant-beneficial bacterial consortium.ISME J. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-018-0093-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). When applied to soil as a synthetic consortium, the recruited bacteria protected Arabidopsis against aboveground downy mildew infection via the onset of induced systemic resistance, a well-characterized disease-resistance mechanism in which the plant immune system is systemically primed for enhanced defense against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens (Verbon et al., 2017Verbon E.H. Trapet P.L. Stringlis I.A. Kruijs S. Bakker P.A.H.M. Pieterse C.M.J. Iron and Immunity.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2017; 55: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preconditioning of the soil with downy mildew-infected plants resulted in reduced susceptibility to the disease in a next generation of plants that were grown on this preconditioned soil (Berendsen et al., 2018Berendsen R.L. Vismans G. Yu K. Song Y. de Jonge R. Burgman W.P. Burmølle M. Herschend J. Bakker P.A.H.M. Pieterse C.M.J. Disease-induced assemblage of a plant-beneficial bacterial consortium.ISME J. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-018-0093-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Thus, plants can “cry for help” from their root microbiome when they are under attack by pathogens, leading to selective enrichment of plant-protective microbes and microbial activities in the soil. This soil-borne legacy, or suppressive soil memory (Raaijmakers and Mazzola, 2016Raaijmakers J.M. Mazzola M. ECOLOGY. Soil immune responses.Science. 2016; 352: 1392-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), benefits future plant generations growing on the same soil. The observation that activation of the plant immune system in response to foliar pathogen attack results in changes in the root microbiome indicates that plant immune signaling and root microbiome assembly are functionally linked. Upon infection by microbial pathogens, plants activate systemic defense responses in which the hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play key roles. SA is essential for protection against biotrophic pathogens that feed on living host cells, such as the downy mildew pathogen H. arabidopsidis. In a study with SA-defective Arabidopsis mutants, it was established that defects in SA signaling led to an altered root microbiome, possibly due to differences in SA-dependent root exudate profiles (Lebeis et al., 2015Lebeis S.L. Paredes S.H. Lundberg D.S. Breakfield N. Gehring J. McDonald M. Malfatti S. Glavina del Rio T. Jones C.D. Tringe S.G. Dangl J.L. PLANT MICROBIOME. Salicylic acid modulates colonization of the root microbiome by specific bacterial taxa.Science. 2015; 349: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). JA is essential for immune response against insect herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens. Both root microbiome composition and root exudate profiles of JA signaling mutants were clearly distinct from those of wild-type plants, demonstrating the involvement of JA signaling in the assembly of the rhizosphere microbiome (Carvalhais et al., 2015Carvalhais L.C. Dennis P.G. Badri D.V. Kidd B.N. Vivanco J.M. Schenk P.M. Linking jasmonic acid signaling, root exudates, and rhizosphere microbiomes.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2015; 28: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, hormone-dependent secondary metabolites excreted by plant roots have important functions in the communication between the plant immune system and the root microbiome. Not only immune responses affect the root microbiome. Drought can substantially alter the composition of the root microbiome and have the largest effect on the endophytic community inside the root, suggesting that the effects of drought on the root microbiome are also plant mediated (Fitzpatrick et al., 2018Fitzpatrick C.R. Copeland J. Wang P.W. Guttman D.S. Kotanen P.M. Johnson M.T.J. Assembly and ecological function of the root microbiome across angiosperm plant species.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; (Published online January 22, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717617115Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, drought and other abiotic stress responses are known to cross-communicate with plant immunity. Recently, Castrillo et al., 2017Castrillo G. Teixeira P.J. Paredes S.H. Law T.F. de Lorenzo L. Feltcher M.E. Finkel O.M. Breakfield N.W. Mieczkowski P. Jones C.D. et al.Root microbiota drive direct integration of phosphate stress and immunity.Nature. 2017; 543: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar provided evidence that the plant’s response to nutritional cues, particularly phosphate starvation, interacts with plant immune responses to coordinate the structure of the root microbiome community for their own benefit. It was demonstrated that the master transcriptional regulator of the phosphate starvation response, PHR1, negatively regulates immunity by binding to the promoters of SA- and JA-response genes, and so prioritizing nutritional stress over plant defense. Interestingly, a synthetic, root-derived bacterial community enhanced the activity of PHR1, suggesting an intricate interplay between nutrient uptake, plant immunity, and microbiome assembly. The phosphate starvation response involves massive changes in gene expression (Castrillo et al., 2017Castrillo G. Teixeira P.J. Paredes S.H. Law T.F. de Lorenzo L. Feltcher M.E. Finkel O.M. Breakfield N.W. Mieczkowski P. Jones C.D. et al.Root microbiota drive direct integration of phosphate stress and immunity.Nature. 2017; 543: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) resulting in the excretion of protons and primary metabolites, such as organic acids, that affect phosphate availability directly (Pant et al., 2015Pant B.-D. Pant P. Erban A. Huhman D. Kopka J. Scheible W.-R. Identification of primary and secondary metabolites with phosphorus status-dependent abundance in Arabidopsis, and of the transcription factor PHR1 as a major regulator of metabolic changes during phosphorus limitation.Plant Cell Environ. 2015; 38: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Sasse et al., 2018Sasse J. Martinoia E. Northen T. Feed your friends: do plant exudates shape the root microbiome?.Trends Plant Sci. 2018; 23: 25-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Moreover, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, like glucosinolates, is altered, leading to changes in the composition of the root microbiome, which in turn indirectly modulate phosphate availability (Pant et al., 2015Pant B.-D. Pant P. Erban A. Huhman D. Kopka J. Scheible W.-R. Identification of primary and secondary metabolites with phosphorus status-dependent abundance in Arabidopsis, and of the transcription factor PHR1 as a major regulator of metabolic changes during phosphorus limitation.Plant Cell Environ. 2015; 38: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Hiruma et al., 2016Hiruma K. Gerlach N. Sacristán S. Nakano R.T. Hacquard S. Kracher B. Neumann U. Ramírez D. Bucher M. O’Connell R.J. Schulze-Lefert P. Root endophyte Colletotrichum tofieldiae confers plant fitness benefits that are phosphate status dependent.Cell. 2016; 165: 464-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such adaptive root exudation changes show resemblance with those triggered by iron starvation, another nutritional stress response connected with plant immunity and the root microbiome (Verbon et al., 2017Verbon E.H. Trapet P.L. Stringlis I.A. Kruijs S. Bakker P.A.H.M. Pieterse C.M.J. Iron and Immunity.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2017; 55: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The transcription factor MYB72 was identified as an important regulator coordinating both iron uptake and rhizobacteria-mediated systemic immunity. Hence, the picture is emerging that plant genetic pathways regulating nutrition and defense coordinately shape plant-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere as part of an adaptive plant strategy that may help to optimize plant survival in nature. Plants seem to have co-evolved with microbial partners to adopt an adaptive life strategy in which they select plant-beneficial functions of the root microbiome (Figure 1). It will be an important future research goal to resolve how the genetic pathways that regulate plant immunity and nutrient acquisition coordinate the selection of microbial traits. The chemical communication between roots and the microbiome at the root-soil interface must be essential in microbiome assembly. Indeed, recent findings have highlighted root exudates produced in response to pathogen infection and nutrient starvation as key players in selection, proliferation, and interactions of microbes in the rhizosphere (Berendsen et al., 2018Berendsen R.L.

Martinoia E. Northen T. Feed your friends: do plant exudates shape the root microbiome?.Trends Plant Sci. 2018; 23: 25-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). However, as of yet, our knowledge of how specific plant root exudates shape the microbiome to the plant’s advantage is limited. Regulation at the level of root metabolite biosynthesis and transport is likely, but only a few biosynthesis pathways and corresponding transporters have so far been characterized (Sasse et al., 2018Sasse J. Martinoia E. Northen T. Feed your friends: do plant exudates shape the root microbiome?.Trends Plant Sci. 2018; 23: 25-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In-depth insight in plant cues and traits that sculpt the soil-borne microbial legacy may emerge from carefully designed experiments in which metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and root metabolomics approaches are combined to inform us about how plants recruit their microbiome to maximize both nutrition and defense under often harsh environmental conditions. The soil-borne legacy can then be sensibly exploited in agriculture by introducing specific microbial consortia in combination with microbiome-optimized plant genotypes that sustain their populations and activities and improve crop production with reduced input of chemical pesticides and fertilizers."
https://openalex.org/W2791680789,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key signaling proteins that regulate nearly every aspect of cell function. Studies of GPCRs have benefited greatly from the development of molecular tools to monitor receptor activation and downstream signaling. Here, we show that mini G proteins are robust probes that can be used in a variety of assay formats to report GPCR activity in living cells. Mini G (mG) proteins are engineered GTPase domains of Gα subunits that were developed for structural studies of active-state GPCRs. Confocal imaging revealed that mG proteins fused to fluorescent proteins were located diffusely in the cytoplasm and translocated to sites of receptor activation at the cell surface and at intracellular organelles. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays with mG proteins fused to either a fluorescent protein or luciferase reported agonist, superagonist, and inverse agonist activities. Variants of mG proteins (mGs, mGsi, mGsq, and mG12) corresponding to the four families of Gα subunits displayed appropriate coupling to their cognate GPCRs, allowing quantitative profiling of subtype-specific coupling to individual receptors. BRET between luciferase-mG fusion proteins and fluorescent markers indicated the presence of active GPCRs at the plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes. Complementation assays with fragments of NanoLuc luciferase fused to GPCRs and mG proteins reported constitutive receptor activity and agonist-induced activation with up to 20-fold increases in luminescence. We conclude that mG proteins are versatile tools for studying GPCR activation and coupling specificity in cells and should be useful for discovering and characterizing G protein subtype-biased ligands."

We know less about viruses than any other lifeform. Fortunately, metagenomics has led to a massive expansion in the known diversity of the virosphere. Here, we discuss how metagenomics has changed our understanding of RNA viruses and present some of the remaining challenges, including characterization of the “dark matter” of divergent viral genomes. Viruses are the most abundant source of genetic material on Earth, likely infecting all cellular organisms and even other viruses. They are ubiquitous in all environments and can account for a substantial proportion of RNA within hosts. However, since viruses were discovered at the end of the 19th century, they have been mainly studied as agents of disease in humans or economically important animals and plants. Although of undoubted importance, these only represent a tiny proportion of the total universe of viruses—the virosphere—and have led to a biased view of virus diversity and function. In reality, we know less about viruses than any group of organisms, with likely only a fraction of one percent of all viruses characterized (Geoghegan and Holmes, 2017Geoghegan J.L. Holmes E.C. Predicting virus emergence amid evolutionary noise.Open Biol. 2017; 7: 170189Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This restricted view of the virosphere has two inter-linked causes. First, most sampling has been directed to a subset of hosts, particularly those that experience overt disease or that act as important reservoirs for viruses that jump species boundaries. Second, virus discovery was traditionally a laborious process, involving complex isolation and sometimes culturing procedures, which meant that characterizing a novel virus necessarily took time. Fortunately, both of these limitations are being overcome with metagenomics, which is rapidly transforming our understanding of the virosphere. Although a variety of metagenomic techniques are available, including those that specifically enrich for viruses, arguably the most informative approach is total transcriptome sequencing, or “meta-transcriptomics” (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). This involves the large-scale RNA sequencing of individual tissues, species, or assemblages of species—usually with a depletion of ribosomal (r) RNA—and is able to reveal, in an unbiased manner, the entire viromes (and other micro-organisms) present in a sample. The transcriptome data generated is a rich source of evolutionary, genomic, and functional information and has revealed enormous levels of untapped virus genetic diversity. For example, meta-transcriptomics has revealed remarkable levels of RNA virus diversity in invertebrates (Li et al., 2015Li C.-X. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Kang Y.-J. Qin X.-C. Chen L.-J. Xu J. Holmes E.C. Zhang Y.-Z. Unprecedented RNA virus diversity in arthropods reveals the ancestry of negative-sense RNA viruses.eLife. 2015; 4: e05378Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), with new viral taxa (species, genera, families, and orders) identified on a regular basis. These newly described RNA viruses have also helped to fill some of the evolutionary gaps among known families or orders and have shown that the RNA virosphere is very different from what we thought based on culturable or disease-causing agents (Figure 1). Although there were glimpses of this new virosphere before metagenomics, such as the discovery of giant DNA viruses from eukaryotes that blurred the formerly clearly defined line between viral and cellular life, the metagenomics transformation has been truly dramatic. Metagenomics is heralding a new era in virology, in which virus discovery is primarily performed with genomic technology and full phenotypic characterization reserved for that small subset of special interest (Shi et al., 2018Shi M. Zhang Y.-Z. Holmes E.C. Meta-transcriptomics and the evolutionary biology of RNA viruses.Virus Res. 2018; 243: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, the more we delve into the virosphere, the more apparent it becomes that we have only characterized a miniscule proportion, with a systematic bias against identifying the most divergent genomes. For example, the most likely explanation for the existence of “gaps” (i.e., an absence of branching events) on phylogenetic trees, particularly those that exist between different virus families and orders, is that the taxa that exist on these branches have yet to be sampled. With more expansive surveys, the phylogeny of RNA viruses is likely to turn from a tree into a bush. It is clear that the metagenomic discovery and characterization of more viruses, particularly those that are divergent in structure, will provide critical new data on virus genetic and phenotypic diversity, transforming our understanding of the virosphere and of the evolutionary processes that have shaped it, as well as fundamental aspects of virus biology, including the virus-host interactions that can on occasion lead to disease emergence. Herein, we briefly review some of the key advances of this new virological age of discovery and some of the challenges for the future. We necessarily focus on RNA viruses, in which the expansion in diversity has been the greatest and the challenges are perhaps the most profound—although a similar story could and should be told for DNA viruses. The most obvious and dramatic impact of metagenomics has been to transform our understanding of the extent and structure of viral biodiversity, including the discovery of a plethora of new viruses (Shi et al., 2018Shi M. Zhang Y.-Z. Holmes E.C. Meta-transcriptomics and the evolutionary biology of RNA viruses.Virus Res. 2018; 243: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The breadth of every known family of RNA virus has expanded during the metagenomics revolution, and there is a greater evolutionary continuity between virus taxa than we ever thought existed (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Indeed, phylogenetic analysis of metagenomics data has revealed that virus genera, families, orders, and currently unclassified lineages can often be clumped into larger groups. For example, the so-called “Hepe-Virga” group (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), defined on the basis of a relatively conserved cluster of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences, contains 11 orders/families/floating genera with distinct host groups and genome structures, including members of order Tymovirales, the families Virgaviridae, Togaviridae, Bromoviridae, Closteroviridae, Endornaviridae, Alphatetraviridae, and Hepeviridae, as well as the floating genera Idaeovirus, Negevirus, and Cilevirus. However, it is also the case that, to date, the main impact of metagenomics has been to expand the diversity of existing families rather than to define new ones. Although, at face value, this suggests that we are beginning to exhaust the deepest levels of viral diversity, it is more probable that we are unable to detect highly divergent groups of viruses because of limitations in the currently available similarity-searching algorithms. Indeed, an inherent limitation of metagenomics is that it is heavily dependent on the accuracy and sensitivity of sequence assembly and searching. A notable exception was the recent discovery of chuviruses, qinviruses, and yueviruses (Li et al., 2015Li C.-X. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Kang Y.-J. Qin X.-C. Chen L.-J. Xu J. Holmes E.C. Zhang Y.-Z. Unprecedented RNA virus diversity in arthropods reveals the ancestry of negative-sense RNA viruses.eLife. 2015; 4: e05378Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2016Shi M.

Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), which have now been recognized as new families (or orders) of negative-sense RNA viruses. Not only do these viruses fall between the major clusters of segmented and unsegmented viruses on phylogenetic trees, but they contain either a bi-segment form or both bi-segmented and unsegmented genomes, as well as circular genomes in the case of some chuviruses (Li et al., 2015Li C.-X. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Kang Y.-J. Qin X.-C. Chen L.-J. Xu J. Holmes E.C. Zhang Y.-Z. Unprecedented RNA virus diversity in arthropods reveals the ancestry of negative-sense RNA viruses.eLife. 2015; 4: e05378Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar), highlighting the complexity of genome-scale evolution (see below). The most dramatic expansion of virus genetic diversity has occurred in the invertebrates. Until recently, invertebrates, which usually meant arthropods, were almost exclusively only thought of as the vectors of viruses that were transmitted among vertebrates (such as the agents of dengue and zika), with little understanding of their “natural” viromes outside of these pathogens. This view has radically changed with metagenomics, with a massive expansion in the RNA virus diversity present in these animals such that disease-causing viruses are now the exception rather than the rule (Junglen and Drosten, 2013Junglen S. Drosten C. Virus discovery and recent insights into virus diversity in arthropods.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2013; 16: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2015Li C.-X. Shi M.

Zirkel F. Kurth A. Drosten C. Junglen S. Evolutionary and phenotypic analysis of live virus isolates suggests arthropod origin of a pathogenic RNA virus family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Buck A.H. et al.The discovery, distribution, and evolution of viruses associated with Drosophila melanogaster.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in some cases, the RNA viruses that are present in invertebrates may be ancestral to those viruses found in vertebrates, which in turn suggests that some families of RNA viruses have existed for the entire evolutionary history of the animals, although the phylogenetic distance between viruses from different animal groups is often substantial. Although the expansion in the diversity of invertebrate RNA viruses has been dramatic, it should not surprise us, as these animals are highly diverse and often possess the huge population sizes that are the ecological prerequisite for high viral diversities. The case of the invertebrates also reminds us of the sampling biases inherent in virus discovery. For example, the vast majority of invertebrate viruses sampled still come from a single phylum—the arthropods. Although arthropods may be of particular importance because of their diversity, comprising more than 80% of all living animal species described to date, and because of their strong ecological relationship with both plants and vertebrates, it is possible that similar amounts of virus diversity will be discovered in other invertebrate phyla once they are sampled more intensively. In particular, we suggest that viruses from basal metazoa, such as from the phyla Cnidaria (corals, jellyfish) and Porifera (sponges), will provide important insights into the origin and evolution of animal viruses, and whether vertebrate viruses ultimately originate from invertebrates will clearly require denser sampling. Sampling biases are equally profound when we consider groups other than invertebrates. For example, our knowledge of vertebrate RNA viruses is heavily skewed toward mammals and, to a lesser extent, birds, with relatively little known about the viruses that infect amphibians, reptiles, and the diverse groups of fish. While the bias toward mammalian viruses is understandable from the perspective of human disease emergence, because most human viruses are of mammalian origin, it makes little sense in terms of animal biodiversity. Indeed, recent work has hinted that fish may be a particularly rich source of virus diversity (Lauber et al., 2017Lauber C. Seitz S. Mattei S. Suh A. Beck J. Herstein J. Börold J. Salzburger W. Kaderali L. Briggs J.A.G. Bartenschlager R. Deciphering the origin and evolution of hepatitis B viruses by means of a family of non-enveloped fish viruses.Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22: 387-399.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Finally, it is obvious that the diversity of RNA viruses discovered by metagenomic methods will pose major challenges to virus taxonomy (Shi et al., 2018Shi M. Zhang Y.-Z. Holmes E.C. Meta-transcriptomics and the evolutionary biology of RNA viruses.Virus Res. 2018; 243: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Simmonds et al., 2017Simmonds P. Adams M.J. Benkő M. Breitbart M. Brister J.R. Carstens E.B. Davison A.J. Delwart E. Gorbalenya A.E. Harrach B. et al.Consensus statement: Virus taxonomy in the age of metagenomics.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In particular, it is likely that metagenomics data will become the new standard for taxonomic studies, with full virological analysis restricted to a subset of interesting exemplars. However, as well as increasing biological diversity, metagenomic data also creates new challenges for those wishing to classify viruses. For example, the reliance on trees inferred from a single gene—usually the most conserved RdRp—may paint an incomplete picture of phylogenetic relationships if different genes have different evolutionary histories, as commonly appears to be the case. Similarly, simple bifurcating phylogenetic trees are evidently neither the best nor most accurate descriptor of evolutionary relationships in the face of widespread lateral gene transfer and recombination. Not only has metagenomics led to a revolution in our view of the phylogenetic diversity of RNA viruses, but it has led to a new understanding of the range and structure of virus genomes and the evolutionary processes that have given rise to them. Indeed, it now appears that despite their (currently) universally small genomes, RNA viruses experience as complex processes of genome evolution as those large DNA viruses and utilize a wide range of replication-expression strategies. Hence, RNA virus genomes are more diverse and have more intricate structures and a wider range of lengths—including mixes of segmented, unsegmented, and circular genomes—than previously anticipated. Similarly, processes such as gene duplication and loss, genomic rearrangements, and lateral gene transfer occur far more frequently than ever imagined (with some viruses even lacking structural genes), and there are an increasing number of examples of cellular genes integrated into viral genomes (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). For example, phylogenetic analysis revealed that two related exonuclease genes of eukaryotic origin that are present in divergent sea slater (Ligia oceanica) RNA viruses were acquired independently and relatively recently from the cellular organisms (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Lateral gene transfer events that occurred earlier in evolutionary history are likely to remain undetected because sequence homology will be obscured by rapid evolution and intensive positive selection upon integration and because the length of insertions in RNA viruses are usually restricted by constraints on genome size. RNA virus genomes are clearly dynamic and flexible entities. For example, until recently, it was thought that families of RNA viruses were usually characterized by a specific segmentation type, such as the presence or absence of segmented genomes or a certain number of segments. Metagenomic data now tells us that segmentation is not a strong taxon defining trait, and a combination of segmented and unsegmented genomes have been observed within families of RNA viruses, such as the Flaviviridae, Partitiviridae, Picorbirnaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Luteoviridae. Even the order Mononegavirales, whose name invokes a single segment of negative-sense RNA, in fact has a small number of segmented members. Genome segmentation is therefore a flexible evolutionary trait, illustrating that RNA viruses are able to re-program their genomes more easily than previously thought. Again, invertebrates appear to be a particularly rich source of genomic diversity and often have genomes that are more complex in both size and structure than in related viruses found in vertebrates (although, again, major sampling biases may be at play). A good example is provided by the flaviviruses and the related “flavi-like” viruses. Flaviviruses were conventionally thought to be unsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses that infected vertebrates, with any association with invertebrates (usually mosquitoes and ticks) simply a reflection of their role in vector-borne transmission. Meta-transcriptomic studies have radically changed this view, and “insect-specific” flaviviruses are now commonplace (Qin et al., 2014Qin X.-C. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Gao D.-Y. He J.-R. Wang J.-B. Li C.-X. Kang Y.-J. Yu B. et al.A tick-borne segmented RNA virus contains genome segments derived from unsegmented viral ancestors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). More dramatically, these insect-associated flaviviruses can possess very large genomes (∼26 kb), and these can be arranged in four or five segments (Qin et al., 2014Qin X.-C. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Gao D.-Y. He J.-R. Wang J.-B. Li C.-X. Kang Y.-J. Yu B. et al.A tick-borne segmented RNA virus contains genome segments derived from unsegmented viral ancestors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), that may even exist as different virus particles (Ladner et al., 2016Ladner J.T. Wiley M.R. Beitzel B. Auguste A.J. Dupuis 2nd, A.P. Lindquist M.E. Sibley S.D. Kota K.P. Fetterer D. Eastwood G. et al.A multicomponent animal virus isolated from mosquitoes.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). The latter observation is particularly striking, as such multicomponent viruses were thought to be exclusive to plant RNA viruses. This raises questions about how viruses with this distinctive structure originated and what selective processes are responsible for their evolutionary maintenance. Similarly, the existence of viruses that lack glycoprotein or nucleoprotein genes, or even both (Li et al., 2015Li C.-X. Shi M. Tian J.-H. Lin X.-D. Kang Y.-J. Qin X.-C. Chen L.-J. Xu J. Holmes E.C. Zhang Y.-Z. Unprecedented RNA virus diversity in arthropods reveals the ancestry of negative-sense RNA viruses.eLife. 2015; 4: e05378Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar), challenge what we mean by a “complete” virus genome and raise questions about how these viruses function within hosts. Metagenomics is also beginning to shed new light on the interactions between viruses and their hosts. Central to this are measures of viral abundance. Meta-transcriptomics provides an in-built way to measure the relative of abundance of viruses within hosts: as the proportion of the total number of transcripts (excluding rRNA) from a host that map to RNA viruses. Although this is only a relative measure and is likely subject to a variety of biases, one of the most striking results is that RNA viruses appear to be at consistently higher abundance in invertebrates than vertebrates. It is tempting to think that this reflects, at least in part, the evolution of adaptive immunity in the latter. At the same time, measures of abundance are an important means to assess the true host range of an RNA virus, which is always a challenge to measure from metagenomic data alone. In particular, the higher the abundance of a virus in a host (particularly if it infects multiple tissues), then the more likely that it really infects the host it was sampled from rather than being associated its diet or with another (micro)organism present in that host. More fundamentally, data on virus abundance are challenging the long-held view that viruses are usually the agents of overt disease in the hosts they infect. Although there is a growing list of examples in which viruses (or endogenous retroviruses) can be beneficial to hosts, viruses have traditionally been considered to be agents of disease, particularly given the number of “immune” resources that hosts of all types devote to their removal. However, metagenomics studies question the automatic association between virus and illness. Again, invertebrates present the most interesting case, as not only can these animals carry an enormous diversity of viruses, but these can be at huge abundance within hosts, sometimes forming the majority of the non-rRNA component of the host transcriptome (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). How are invertebrates able to tolerate such remarkably high viral loads? While it is possible that some of these high-abundance viruses will ultimately cause disease in their hosts, it is tempting to think that these viruses do not cause overt illness and that some species have evolved mechanisms to tolerate such a richness of viruses. Should this be the case, determining exactly how invertebrates might be refractory to viral infection will clearly be an important research question for the future. Similarly, it will also be important to test the idea that overt disease is most commonly associated with cross-species transmission (i.e., host-jumping), as often appears to be the case with emerging human diseases. If so, this would have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of virulence in viruses. Metagenomic data, particularly when combined with phylogenetic analysis, have also told us that long-term virus evolution reflects a complex mix of virus-host co-divergence over many millions of years and frequent cross-species transmission and that it is sometimes difficult to disentangle these two processes, particularly as single viruses can be associated with multiple hosts (Geoghegan et al., 2017Geoghegan J.L. Duchêne S. Holmes E.C. Comparative analysis estimates the relative frequencies of co-divergence and cross-species transmission within viral families.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13: e1006215Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, an emerging view is that virus-host co-divergence can extend back many millions—and perhaps even billions—of years and that cross-species transmission can occur frequently on this back-bone of co-divergence: it is this pattern that shapes the macro-evolution of RNA viruses and forms the evolutionary background to virus emergence. As a case in point, major clades of RNA viruses can be sampled from diverse eukaryotic groups in manner that does not always mirror the host phylogeny, including fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Shi et al., 2016Shi M. Lin X.-D. Tian J.-H. Chen L.-J. Chen X. Li C.-X. Qin X.-C. Li J. Cao J.-P. Eden J.-S. et al.Redefining the invertebrate RNA virosphere.Nature. 2016; 540: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). On a more localized scale, although hantaviruses were conventionally thought to have strictly co-diverged with their rodent hosts, more detailed sampling and analysis has revealed multiple instances of cross-species transmission (Holmes and Zhang, 2015Holmes E.C. Zhang Y.-Z. The evolution and emergence of hantaviruses.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2015; 10: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Metagenomics is transforming our understanding of the breadth and diversity of the virosphere, showing it to be far larger, richer, complex, and thus, more interesting than previously envisioned. It is now clear that RNA virus evolution is not simply the product of rampant mutation, but that a variety of genomic processes such as lateral gene transfer and changes in the number of segments have played a major role in rewiring viral genomes. At the same time, the more that we dig into the virosphere, the more it becomes clear that there are fundamental gaps in our understanding of the virus world and that our view of what it means to be a virus is largely a function of that achingly small subset of viruses that we have sampled so far. It is therefore evident that we have only just begun to scratch the surface of the true diversity of viruses and that we know little of the factors that shape this diversity and evolution within ecosystems and over long evolutionary scales."
https://openalex.org/W2792024998,"100 years after the infamous “Spanish flu” pandemic, the 2017–2018 flu season has been severe, with numerous infections worldwide. In between, there have been continuous, relentless attacks from (re-)emerging viruses. To fully understand viral pathogenesis and develop effective medical countermeasures, we must strengthen current surveillance and basic research efforts. 100 years after the infamous “Spanish flu” pandemic, the 2017–2018 flu season has been severe, with numerous infections worldwide. In between, there have been continuous, relentless attacks from (re-)emerging viruses. To fully understand viral pathogenesis and develop effective medical countermeasures, we must strengthen current surveillance and basic research efforts. This year marks the centenary of the “Spanish flu” pandemic, the most devastating viral pandemic in history caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus that infected over 500 million and killed between 50 and 100 million people. We know to expect a flu season every year; the question is always how severe it will be. With high numbers of influenza infections reported worldwide during this season, we are again reminded of the public health threat stemming from a potential influenza pandemic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that this is the first time in the past 15 years that all states in the entire continental USA have reported widespread flu activity during the same week. In China, the reported number of flu cases have increased over 2-fold compared to the flu seasons in the past several years—the second-highest recorded number, just after the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1)—and many patients have been hospitalized with severe clinical symptoms. These events have raised concerns that we are in danger of another flu pandemic. Circulating flu viruses are quite diverse this year—including the “swine flu” 2009-pH1N1, H3N2, and influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata—and are spread across various geographical locations. The H3N2 subtype is dominant in the UK and the USA, but a mixed pool of pH1N1, H3N2, and influenza B/Yamagata, with a small portion of B/Victoria, have been reported in China. A universal influenza vaccine to combat such mutation-prone viruses is urgently needed yet still far from reach, despite the global efforts. Despite best efforts to anticipate the emergent strains, vaccines vary from year to year in terms of efficacy, with this year’s providing only moderate protection. Human infections with different subtypes of avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) have been consistently reported since H5N1 AIV was reported in Hong Kong during 1997 (Yuen et al., 1998Yuen K.Y. Chan P.K. Peiris M. Tsang D.N. Que T.L. Shortridge K.F. Cheung P.T. To W.K. Ho E.T. Sung R. Cheng A.F. Clinical features and rapid viral diagnosis of human disease associated with avian influenza A H5N1 virus.Lancet. 1998; 351: 467-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Infections with AIV typically result in high case fatality rates (CFRs) ranging from ∼30% to ∼70%, and at least 14 influenza A virus subtypes—including the three seasonal flu viruses, H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2—have reportedly infected humans to date (Figure 1). Of note, influenza A virus has a segmented genome with 8 genomic segments encoding at least 10–16 proteins, two of which are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are currently 16 (+2) HA genes and 9 (+2) NA genes (+2 means two more HA or NA from bat-derived influenza-like viruses, for which only genomic sequences are available, but no alive virus has yet been isolated; Wu et al., 2014Wu Y. Wu Y. Tefsen B. Shi Y. Gao G.F. Bat-derived influenza-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11.Trends Microbiol. 2014; 22: 183-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The combination of HA and NA would theoretically yield 144 subtypes of HxNy viruses. Due to the migratory birds’ travel and live poultry trade, which includes the transport of poultry and operation of live poultry markets (LPMs) throughout China and Southeast Asia (Gao, 2014Gao G.F. Influenza and the live poultry trade.Science. 2014; 344: 235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we should expect more human infections with AIVs in the future. AIVs may supply genomic segments for reassortment with circulating seasonal influenza viruses to generate a novel pathogen with high CFR and pandemic potential. As we can’t yet eradicate seasonal flu, efforts to change the traditional live poultry trade—for example, the traditional LPMs—in order to restrict the flow of domestic poultry migration may help decrease the probability of the emergence of novel AIV subtypes, even the potential pandemic viruses. Flu isn’t alone. Coronavirus is another family of emerging pathogens with public health concern. A devastating but quickly conquered outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during 2003 transformed China’s approach to outbreak control. A sophisticated surveillance system has since been put into place. While primarily government led, there is extensive collaboration with various institutes in the academic, industry, and healthcare fields to produce a wide-ranging, comprehensive network that issues warnings of an impending outbreak at the earliest opportunity. As exemplified by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE) network, in addition to Chinese National Influenza Center/WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza under China CDC, such a system can drive basic, applied, and translational research on infectious disease control and prevention (Bi et al., 2017Bi Y. Shi W. Chen J. Chen Q. Ma Z. Wong G. Tian W. Yin R. Fu G. Yang Y. et al.CASCIRE surveillance network and work on avian influenza viruses.Sci. China Life Sci. 2017; 60: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A related coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in the Middle East during 2012 and has on occasion caused sporadic infections with imported cases from returning travelers, some of which go on to infect others. One such instance was the importation of a MERS-CoV case into China from South Korea during 2015 (Su et al., 2015Su S. Wong G. Liu Y. Gao G.F. Li S. Bi Y. MERS in South Korea and China: a potential outbreak threat?.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2349-2350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in which the traveler was promptly identified and quarantined, preventing further infections. Due to the ongoing nature of the MERS-CoV outbreak, we are likely to encounter more coronavirus infections in the future. Preparations should be made accordingly through the development of both vaccines and antivirals. Ebola virus (EBOV), first identified in Central Africa during 1976, unexpectedly struck West Africa during 2013–2015, impacting several countries in North America, Europe, and Africa. After earlier incidents, efforts were underway to develop vaccine candidates; however, these were challenged, as the virus was at first suspected to have a higher mutation rate that might negatively impact the efficacy of the EBOV vaccine candidates under clinical trials (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). To address this question directly, a total of 175 whole-genome sequences were obtained from viral isolates, and the mutation rate was determined to be similar to that of past EBOV outbreaks (Tong et al., 2015Tong Y.G. Shi W.F. Liu D. Qian J. Liang L. Bo X.C. Liu J. Ren H.G. Fan H. Ni M. et al.China Mobile Laboratory Testing Team in Sierra LeoneGenetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.Nature. 2015; 524: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, current experimental vaccines should still be efficacious. During this epidemic, application of genomic sequencing technology greatly facilitated disease control. Molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis studies, in addition to the development of effective antivirals, such as the ZMapp antibody cocktail and the vesicular-stomatitis-virus (VSV)- and adenovirus (Ad5, chAd3)-based vaccines, were the key measures for the effective control of these pathogens. While the world was still celebrating the success of finally conquering EBOV after a protracted 2-year battle, Zika virus (ZIKV) struck with the first cases reported in Brazil after small outbreaks previously reported in Micronesia (Yap Island) and French Polynesia in 2007 and 2013, respectively (Figure 2). As an obscure pathogen (but known to humans since 1947), the ZIKV isolates from the 2015–2016 epidemic were found to possess new characteristics (Grubaugh et al., 2018Grubaugh N.D. Faria N.R. Anderson K.G. Pybus O.G. Genomic Insights into Zika Virus Emergence and Spread.Cell. 2018; 172 (this issue): 1160-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The virus quickly spread geographically with at least 84 countries/regions affected (Figure 2). A coordinated global response eventually led to the conclusion of the epidemic in November 2016, but long-term complications stemming from ZIKV infections are yet being reported from convalescent patients. After the ZIKV epidemic, outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV) occurred across Angola and Brazil in 2017. The virus was imported to China as Chinese workers returned from Angola (Chen et al., 2016Chen Z. Liu L. Lv Y. Zhang W. Li J. Zhang Y. Di T. Zhang S. Liu J. Li J. et al.A fatal yellow fever virus infection in China: description and lessons.Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2016; 5: e69Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Almost simultaneously, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was also imported into China from Angola through a returning traveler. These events highlighted the difficulty in accurately predicting the time and location, as well as the identity, of the causative pathogen behind the next outbreak. Indeed, EBOV and ZIKV were both considered neglected, tropical re-emerging pathogens, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were novel, emerging pathogens, and influenza viruses were typically re-emerging pathogens with new properties derived from genetic evolution and reassortments. A myriad of contributing factors such as urbanization, globalization, and climate change will impact the pathogenicity and transmission of certain pathogens, as well as the distribution of their reservoir hosts. This reality places additional emphasis on the importance of proactive countermeasures, such as pathogen surveillance and vaccine development, as well as the need for reactive countermeasures, such as antiviral therapy. As a community of scientists, clinicians, public health experts, and caregivers, we have so far been able to answer the challenges posed by a spectrum of pathogens ranging from “A”vian influenza virus to “Z”ika virus. Each has taken time and a somewhat tailored approach. We can expect sterner tests in the future, and some of the lessons learned must be carried forward. Since the spread of (re-)emerging viruses is not confined by geographic boundaries, it is clear that collaborative solutions across nations are needed to solve these global problems. Efforts in this vein are getting off the ground. International partnerships, such as the Global Virome Project (Carroll et al., 2018Carroll D. Daszak P. Wolfe N.D. Gao G.F. Morel C.M. Morzaria S. Pablos-Méndez A. Tomori O. Mazet J.A.K. The Global Virome Project.Science. 2018; 359: 872-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for virus hunting worldwide and the establishment of a CDC network in Africa with assistance from the US CDC and China CDC, will greatly improve our capacity for surveillance, contributing to, ideally, a worldwide system in the “big data” era of the 21st century. The Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), launched by the World Bank in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the governments of Japan and Germany, aims to provide over $500 million to cover developing countries against the risk of outbreaks. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), founded by the Norway government, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum aim to provide a coordinated, bench-to-bedside approach for (pre-)clinical vaccine development and delivery. The above examples show that we are beginning to learn our lessons, but we must not forget that basic scientific research into both high-profile and obscure pathogens forms a crucial basis for the effective implementation of informed public health policies and innovative collaborative initiatives. Robust investment into basic research (i.e., viral pathogenesis, interspecies transmission, etc.) should be encouraged to achieve a fully multi-faceted approach to combating future pandemics.

https://openalex.org/W2790594012,"Endogenous circadian rhythms are thought to modulate responses to external factors, but mechanisms that confer time-of-day differences in organismal responses to environmental insults/therapeutic treatments are poorly understood. Using a xenobiotic, we find that permeability of the Drosophila ""blood""-brain barrier (BBB) is higher at night. The permeability rhythm is driven by circadian regulation of efflux and depends on a molecular clock in the perineurial glia of the BBB, although efflux transporters are restricted to subperineurial glia (SPG). We show that transmission of circadian signals across the layers requires cyclically expressed gap junctions. Specifically, during nighttime, gap junctions reduce intracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]i), a positive regulator of efflux, in SPG. Consistent with lower nighttime efflux, nighttime administration of the anti-epileptic phenytoin is more effective at treating a Drosophila seizure model. These findings identify a novel mechanism of circadian regulation and have therapeutic implications for drugs targeted to the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2790732445,"The dynamics of the chromatin regulatory landscape during human early embryogenesis remains unknown. Using DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) sequencing, we report that the chromatin accessibility landscape is gradually established during human early embryogenesis. Interestingly, the DHSs with OCT4 binding motifs are enriched at the timing of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in humans, but not in mice. Consistently, OCT4 contributes to ZGA in humans, but not in mice. We further find that lower CpG promoters usually establish DHSs at later stages. Similarly, younger genes tend to establish promoter DHSs and are expressed at later embryonic stages, while older genes exhibit these features at earlier stages. Moreover, our data show that human active transposons SVA and HERV-K harbor DHSs and are highly expressed in early embryos, but not in differentiated tissues. In summary, our data provide an evolutionary developmental view for understanding the regulation of gene and transposon expression."

Coevolution of the malignant mammary epithelium and its underlying stroma instigates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to support most, if not all, hallmarks of cancer progression. Here we delineate a previously unappreciated role for CAFs as determinants of the molecular subtype of breast cancer. We identified paracrine crosstalk between cancer cells expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-CC and CAFs expressing the cognate receptors in human basal-like mammary carcinomas. Genetic or pharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity in mouse models of cancer resulted in conversion of basal-like breast cancers into a hormone receptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy in previously resistant tumors. We conclude that specification of breast cancer to the basal-like subtype is under microenvironmental control and is therapeutically actionable."
https://openalex.org/W2792913800,"Memories become less precise and generalized over time as memory traces reorganize in hippocampal-cortical networks. Increased time-dependent loss of memory precision is characterized by an overgeneralization of fear in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or age-related cognitive impairments. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), memories are thought to be encoded by so-called 'engram-bearing' dentate granule cells (eDGCs). Here we show, using rodents, that contextual fear conditioning increases connectivity between eDGCs and inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the downstream hippocampal CA3 region. We identify actin-binding LIM protein 3 (ABLIM3) as a mossy-fiber-terminal-localized cytoskeletal factor whose levels decrease after learning. Downregulation of ABLIM3 expression in DGCs was sufficient to increase connectivity with CA3 stratum lucidum INs (SLINs), promote parvalbumin (PV)-expressing SLIN activation, enhance feedforward inhibition onto CA3 and maintain a fear memory engram in the DG over time. Furthermore, downregulation of ABLIM3 expression in DGCs conferred conditioned context-specific reactivation of memory traces in hippocampal-cortical and amygdalar networks and decreased fear memory generalization at remote (i.e., distal) time points. Consistent with the observation of age-related hyperactivity of CA3, learning failed to increase DGC-SLIN connectivity in 17-month-old mice, whereas downregulation of ABLIM3 expression was sufficient to restore DGC-SLIN connectivity, increase PV+ SLIN activation and improve the precision of remote memories. These studies exemplify a connectivity-based strategy that targets a molecular brake of feedforward inhibition in DG-CA3 and may be harnessed to decrease time-dependent memory generalization in individuals with PTSD and improve memory precision in aging individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2793097477,"MicroRNA is an endogenous, small RNA controlling multiple target genes and playing roles in various biological processes including tumorigenesis. Here, we addressed the function of miR-155 using LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling of miR-155 deficient breast cancer cells. Our results revealed the loss of miR-155 hampers glucose uptake and glycolysis, via the down-regulation of glucose transporters and metabolic enzymes including HK2, PKM2, and LDHA. We showed this is due to the down-regulation of cMYC, controlled through phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1)-PDK1/AKT-FOXO3a pathway. UTR analysis of the PIK3R1 and FOXO3a indicated miR-155 directly represses these genes. A stable expression of miR-155 in patient-derived cells (PDCs) showed activated glucose metabolism whereas a stable inhibition of miR-155 reduced in vivo tumor growth with retarded glucose metabolism. Furthermore, analysis of 50 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) specimens and specific uptake value (SUV) of PET images revealed a positive correlation between miR-155 level and glucose usage in human breast tumors via PIK3R1-PDK/AKT-FOXO3a-cMYC axis.

Adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by the abnormal accumulation of disease-driving proteins. Mechanisms by which the accumulated protein causes pathology are unclear. Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders represent monogenic proteinopathies, in which a polyQ-expanded tract in a protein causes neuronal demise. In spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), polyQ-expanded Ataxin-1 (ATXN1, encoded by ATXN1) leads to cerebellar and brain stem degeneration (Orr et al., 1993Orr H.T. Chung M.Y. Banfi S.

Individuals carrying uninterrupted CAG expansions in ATXN1, ranging from 39 to 82 repeats, present with ataxia, speaking and swallowing difficulties, and muscle weakness and succumb to disease within two decades of diagnosis. While there is a clear link between polyQ length and disease severity and onset (Orr et al., 1993Orr H.T. Chung M.Y. Banfi S. Kwiatkowski Jr., T.J. Servadio A. Beaudet A.L. McCall A.E. Duvick L.A.

Previous studies found that ATXN1 natively forms a transcriptional repressor complex with Capicua (CIC), as well as its paralog ATXN1L: the “ATXN1-CIC complex” (Kim et al., 2013Kim E. Lu H.C.

The interaction of polyQ-expanded ATXN1 with CIC is believed to mediate some of the toxicity based on data showing that the ATXN1-CIC complex becomes hypermorphic upon the polyQ expansion in ATXN1 (Fryer et al., 2011Fryer J.D.

Furthermore, reducing CIC levels in an SCA1 mouse model rescues pathology and corrects the gain-of-function transcriptional phenotype. Loss-of-function studies of the ATXN1-CIC complex in the cortex and hypothalamus (Lu et al., 2017Lu H.C. Tan Q. Rousseaux M.W. Wang W. Kim J.Y. Richman R. Wan Y.W. Yeh S.Y. Patel J.M.

Collectively, these findings lead to two unanswered questions. (1) Is cerebellar pathology exclusively driven by the ATXN1-CIC complex or are there other interactors and/or modes of toxicity that contribute to SCA1 pathogenesis? (2) Does loss of the ATXN1-CIC complex contribute to disease? Studying the gain versus loss of function of ATXN1-CIC complex formation in vivo offers an opportunity to parse out a specific mode of toxicity in SCA1. Specifically, whether other mechanisms—including RNA-mediated toxicity, repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation, and/or additional interacting partners—mediate cerebellar pathology in SCA1 remains unknown (Wojciechowska et al., 2014Wojciechowska M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7425-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Given recent loss-of-function evidence suggesting that the ATXN1-CIC complex plays important developmental roles (Lu et al., 2017Lu H.C. Tan Q. Rousseaux M.W. Wang W. Kim J.Y. Richman R. Wan Y.W. Yeh S.Y. Patel J.M. Liu X. et al.Disruption of the ATXN1-CIC complex causes a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes in mice and humans.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), formally testing its contribution to cerebellar function is critical for a better understanding of SCA1 pathogenesis and for the design of therapeutics. We previously found that haploinsufficiency of CIC suppresses disease phenotypes in mice (Fryer et al., 2011Fryer J.D. Yu P. Kang H. Mandel-Brehm C. Carter A.N. Crespo-Barreto J. Gao Y. Flora A. Shaw C. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Exercise and genetic rescue of SCA1 via the transcriptional repressor Capicua.Science. 2011; 334: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mutating two crucial residues in ATXN1, valine 591 (V591A) and serine 602 (S602D), in its AXH domain was sufficient to abolish ATXN1-CIC complex formation in vitro (Kim et al., 2013Kim E. Lu H.C. Zoghbi H.Y. Song J.J. Structural basis of protein complex formation and reconfiguration by polyglutamine disease protein Ataxin-1 and Capicua.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mice that overexpress polyQ-expanded ATXN1 under the control of a Purkinje cell (PC)-specific promoter exhibit the cardinal features of SCA1, including motor performance deficits and PC degeneration (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat.Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We harnessed the information from structural studies to generate a new polyQ-expanded ATXN1 transgenic line that is CIC-interaction deficient (ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D; Figure S1A). First, we asked whether the V591A; S602D mutation in the AXH domain of ATXN1 prevented its association with CIC in vivo. We immunoprecipitated CIC from wild-type (WT), ATXN1[82Q], and ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D mice and tested whether ATXN1 was complexed with CIC. CIC could bind endogenous mouse ATXN1 in all cases but could bind to polyQ-expanded ATXN1 only in the ATXN1[82Q] mice (Figure 1A). Previous work demonstrated that protein levels, localization, and developmental timing of ATXN1 transgene expression in PCs affect the severity of disease in adult mice (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Duvick L. Zu T. Carlson K. Stevens S. Jorgensen N. Lysholm A. Burright E. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. et al.RORalpha-mediated Purkinje cell development determines disease severity in adult SCA1 mice.Cell. 2006; 127: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We found that there were no differences in transgene expression (Figure 1B) and that these mice exhibited similar developmental timing of transgene transcription and nuclear localization (Figures S1E–S1G). Next, we measured motor performance of ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D mice via the rotarod test. At 6, 12, and 20 weeks of age, ATXN1[82Q] mice were significantly impaired on the rotarod compared to WT animals (Figure 1C). In contrast, ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D were indistinguishable from WT mice at each age tested. We examined whether the observed motor performance rescue was due to improved cerebellar morphology. Consistent with previous reports, mice expressing ATXN1[82Q] showed significant loss of molecular layer thickness as early as 6 weeks, which progressively degenerated over time (Figure 1D; Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat.Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Conversely, there was a striking absence of neurodegeneration in ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D cerebella up to 52 weeks of age (Figure 1D). Thus, disrupting the interaction between ATXN1[82Q] and CIC is sufficient to eliminate toxicity in the mouse cerebellum. Previous work from our lab and others suggested that part of the cerebellar phenotypes occurring in SCA1 may be due to a partial loss of function of the ATXN1-CIC complex (Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010Crespo-Barreto J. Fryer J.D. Shaw C.A. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Partial loss of ataxin-1 function contributes to transcriptional dysregulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 pathogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001021Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Fryer et al., 2011Fryer J.D.

Exercise and genetic rescue of SCA1 via the transcriptional repressor Capicua.Science. 2011; 334: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, these studies are difficult to interpret due to the functionally redundant ATXN1 homolog ATXN1L that compensates for its loss in vivo (Lee et al., 2011Lee Y. Fryer J.D. Kang H. Crespo-Barreto J. Bowman A.B. Gao Y. Kahle J.J. Hong J.S. Kheradmand F. Orr H.T. et al.ATXN1 protein family and CIC regulate extracellular matrix remodeling and lung alveolarization.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 746-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Due to the important roles of this protein complex in the developing forebrain (Lu et al., 2017Lu H.C. Tan Q. Rousseaux M.W. Wang W. Kim J.Y. Richman R. Wan Y.W. Yeh S.Y. Patel J.M. Liu X. et al.Disruption of the ATXN1-CIC complex causes a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes in mice and humans.Nat.

Choi Y.S. et al.Capicua deficiency induces autoimmunity and promotes follicular helper T cell differentiation via derepression of ETV5.Nat.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E1511-E1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), its native cerebellar function remains clouded. To formally test whether a loss of function of the ATXN1-CIC complex accounts for part of the toxicity observed in SCA1, we deleted members of this complex from the mouse cerebellum during development using En1-Cre (Li et al., 2002Li J.Y. Lao Z. Joyner A.L. Changing requirements for Gbx2 in development of the cerebellum and maintenance of the mid/hindbrain organizer.Neuron. 2002; 36: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since ATXN1 and ATXN1L are functionally redundant and their loss is phenocopied by CIC, we generated En1-Cre; Atxn1−/−; Atxn1lflox/flox (“Cerebellar Atxn1-1l KO”; note: the Atxn1 allele is a null) and En1-Cre; Cicflox/flox (“Cerebellar Cic KO”) mouse lines to determine the effect of disrupting this complex in development. We examined the knockout efficiency of the ATXN1-CIC complex in these mice by western blot, immunofluorescence, and qPCR, confirming their effective deletion (Figure 2A; Figures S2A and S2B). Moreover, we noted that ATXN1-ATXN1L stabilized CIC, whereas CIC loss did not result in a dramatic destabilization of ATXN1 or ATXN1L. SCA1 mice exhibit motor behavior deficits, neurodegeneration, and early lethality (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Weeber E.J. Xu B. Antalffy B. Yuva-Paylor L. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Atkinson R. Sun Y.

In stark contrast to SCA1 mice, loss of function of ATXN1-CIC did not cause SCA1-like motor phenotypes when tested with the open field and rotarod assays. In fact, the cerebellar CIC knockout mice were slightly hyperactive and stayed significantly longer on the rotarod (Figures 2B and 2C) and lived well over 1 year of age. Even at 1 year of age, ATXN1-CIC complex knockout mice demonstrated normal cerebellar morphology (Figure 2D; Figure S2C). A possible explanation for the lack of phenotype in the cerebellar ATXN1-CIC complex knockout mice is developmental compensation. To test this, we disrupted this complex in adult mice. Given that loss of Atxn1/1l or Cic phenocopy each other in all paradigms tested (Lee et al., 2011Lee Y. Fryer J.D. Kang H. Crespo-Barreto J. Bowman A.B. Gao Y. Kahle J.J. Hong J.S. Kheradmand F.

Liu X. et al.Disruption of the ATXN1-CIC complex causes a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes in mice and humans.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we focused on the adult loss of Cic. Adult cerebellar conditional knockouts of Cic were obtained using UBC-CreERT2 (Ruzankina et al., 2007Ruzankina Y. Pinzon-Guzman C. Asare A. Ong T. Pontano L. Cotsarelis G. Zediak V.P. Velez M. Bhandoola A. Brown E.J. Deletion of the developmentally essential gene ATR in adult mice leads to age-related phenotypes and stem cell loss.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 113-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and designated UBC-CreERT2; Cicflox/flox [“Adult Cic KO”]. To excise the floxed Cic allele, we administered a series of tamoxifen injections to 8- to 12-week-old adult mice (Sztainberg et al., 2015Sztainberg Y. Chen H.M. Swann J.W. Hao S. Tang B. Wu Z. Tang J. Wan Y.W. Liu Z. Rigo F. Zoghbi H.Y. Reversal of phenotypes in MECP2 duplication mice using genetic rescue or antisense oligonucleotides.Nature. 2015; 528: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Examination of CIC protein levels by western blot confirmed that it was effectively knocked out (Figure 2A, right panel). These adult knockout mice had normal exploratory behavior in the open field when compared to controls and did not exhibit any motor impairment on the rotarod 8 weeks following the last injection (Figure 2B, right panels). Cerebellar histological analysis of UBC-CreERT2; Cicflox/flox mice compared to their littermates failed to reveal any changes in morphology or PC number at 20 weeks post injection (Figure 2C, bottom panels), a time point when pathology can be clearly observed in mouse models of SCA1 (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

These data show that CIC loss in the adult cerebellum does not lead to hallmark cerebellar features of SCA1 pathology. To assess for defects at the cellular and neurophysiological level in CIC KO mice, we further studied PC function in these mice. We tested whether Cerebellar Cic KO mice exhibit PC spine or climbing fiber innervation defects as well as electrophysiological abnormalities. We found that spine density (Figure 3A) and climbing fiber innervation (Figure 3B) were largely unaffected from CIC disruption. Interestingly, Cerebellar Cic KO mice displayed an increase in PC firing pattern variability while maintaining normal firing frequencies at 2 months of age (P60; Figure 3C, top panels), which were markedly increased at an earlier age (P20; Figure 3C, bottom panels), suggestive of a mild neurodevelopmental phenotype. These findings contrast with those from SCA1 mice (and other models of ataxia), which show reduced firing frequencies that worsen together with behavior phenotypes (Chopra and Shakkottai, 2014Chopra R. Shakkottai V.G. Translating cerebellar Purkinje neuron physiology to progress in dominantly inherited ataxia.Future Neurol. 2014; 9: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Dell’Orco et al., 2015Dell’Orco J.M.

Neuronal atrophy early in degenerative ataxia is a compensatory mechanism to regulate membrane excitability.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 11292-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of CIC in the cerebellum, both developmentally and in adulthood, leads to abnormal PC firing regularity but does not result in SCA1-like degenerative disease. Given that the polyQ-expanded ATXN1-CIC complex acts in a gain-of-function manner, we asked what may be the primary mediators of such an effect. We performed transcriptomic analysis on ATXN1[82Q], ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D, and En1-Cre; Cicflox/flox mice (and control littermates). ATXN1[82Q] mice had marked gene expression changes (545, fold change ≥ 1.5, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) in their cerebella, whereas the ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D mice exhibited very few expression changes (16, fold change ≥ 1.5, FDR < 0.05; Figure 4A; Figures S3B and S3D). In contrast, En1-Cre; Cicflox/flox mice exhibited few expression changes (136, fold change ≥ 1.5, FDR < 0.05), which did not significantly overlap with the ATXN1[82Q] mice (Figure 4A; Figures S3A–S3C). These molecular findings are consistent with our behavioral and anatomical findings that SCA1 is driven by a gain of function of the ATXN1-CIC complex. To test whether this transcriptomic signature was preserved in other models of polyQ-mediated ATXN1 toxicity, we used a knockin mouse model of SCA1. Atxn1154Q/2Q mice express 154 glutamines in one Atxn1 allele (Watase et al., 2002Watase K. Weeber E.J. Xu B. Antalffy B. Yuva-Paylor L. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Atkinson R. Sun Y. Armstrong D.L. et al.A long CAG repeat in the mouse Sca1 locus replicates SCA1 features and reveals the impact of protein solubility on selective neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2002; 34: 905-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We tested a subset of genes highly dysregulated in ATXN1[82Q] mice (Ingram et al., 2016Ingram M. Wozniak E.A.L. Duvick L. Yang R. Bergmann P. Carson R. O’Callaghan B. Zoghbi H.Y. Henzler C. Orr H.T. Cerebellar transcriptome profiles of ATXN1 transgenic mice reveal SCA1 disease progression and protection pathways.Neuron. 2016; 89: 1194-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and found that more than 60% were dysregulated in Atxn1154Q/2Q mice (Figure 4B; Figure S3E). To test whether these findings could be generalized to human SCA1, we generated neurons from SCA1 patients as well as their unaffected siblings (Figure S4). Fibroblasts were obtained under oversight of the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. Genes tested—in particular, those involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission—were significantly downregulated in these neurons (Figure 4C). A fundamental question in polyQ-expansion disorders involves the extent to which polyQ pathogenesis is driven by aspects of the native function of disease-causing protein compared to pathologic features such as protein inclusions, mRNA containing an expanded CAG tract, and, more recently, dipeptide repeat proteins generated from RAN translation. Within the polyQ native function, there is uncertainty regarding the relative importance of gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms to toxicity. In SCA1, there is evidence that polyQ expansion in ATXN1 causes toxicity through a gain-of-function mechanism (Zoghbi and Orr, 2009Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 7425-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Whether it does so selectively through its native interactor CIC or whether it is toxic via other mechanisms is currently unknown. Moreover, whether loss of function also contributes to the cerebellar degeneration seen in SCA1 is unclear (Crespo-Barreto et al., 2010Crespo-Barreto J. Fryer J.D. Shaw C.A. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y.

In this study, we found that polyQ-expanded ATXN1 exerts cerebellar toxicity exclusively through its interaction with CIC and that its nuclear accumulation is not sufficient for its toxicity. These data are consistent with our recent results that suggest that CIC stabilizes the formation of toxic polyQ-expanded ATXN1 oligomers that correlate with disease onset and severity (Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015Lasagna-Reeves C.A.

Another important outcome of the genetic studies pertains to excluding additional potential pathogenic mechanisms: specifically, the toxicity of RNA and RAN-translated peptides. The fact that mice carrying the ATXN1[82Q]V591A;S602D allele lack disease but have similar levels of CAG-expanded ATXN1 mRNA as ATXN1[82Q] mice that have PC degeneration argues against toxicity at the RNA level. This differs from what was suggested for SCA3 (Li et al., 2008Li L.B. Yu Z. Teng X. Bonini N.M. RNA toxicity is a component of ataxin-3 degeneration in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 453: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and HD (Bañez-Coronel et al., 2015Bañez-Coronel M. Ayhan F.

Margolis R.L. et al.RAN translation in Huntington disease.Neuron. 2015; 88: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Given that the ATXN1-CIC complex is critical for various developmental functions, we tested whether this complex is also important for cerebellar function. We found that developmental or adult ablation of CIC in the cerebellum did not result in neurodegenerative phenotypes. To study the role of the ATXN1-CIC complex in its native versus polyQ-expanded states, we performed mRNA profiling in these mouse models. We found that polyQ-expanded ATXN1 in PCs exhibits a large number of transcriptional changes that are conserved in an independent model of polyQ-expanded ATXN1 as well as in neurons derived from individuals with SCA1. Importantly, these changes are dramatically curtailed when polyQ-expanded ATXN1 cannot bind CIC, suggesting that its interaction with CIC mediates the bulk of these effects. Alternatively, when CIC was depleted from the cerebellum, very few transcriptional changes occurred, suggesting that the native role of the ATXN1-CIC complex in the cerebellum is more subtle than in other areas of the brain (Lu et al., 2017Lu H.C.

The emergence and spread of Zika virus in the Americas continues to challenge our disease surveillance systems. Virus genome sequencing during the epidemic uncovered the timescale of Zika virus transmission and spread. Yet, we are only beginning to explore how genomics can enhance our responses to emerging viruses. The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas took the world by surprise. Although the spread of mosquito-borne pathogens to new territories is a recognized threat, no one was prepared for a public health emergency from this little-known flavivirus. Like dengue and chikungunya viruses, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which thrive in growing tropical cities. The first confirmed report of Zika virus infection in the Americas occurred in northeastern Brazil in May 2015 (Kindhauser et al., 2016Kindhauser M.K. Allen T. Frank V. Santhana R.S. Dye C. Zika: the origin and spread of a mosquito-borne virus.Bull. World Health Organ. 2016; 94: 675-686CCrossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Its detection was initially met with limited interest, but concerns grew quickly once data indicated a link between Zika virus infection and the development of microcephaly in newborns (e.g., Souza et al., 2016Souza W.V. Araújo T.V. Albuquerque Mde.F. Braga M.C. Ximenes R.A. Miranda-Filho Dde.B. Bezerra L.C. Dimech G.S. Carvalho P.I. Assunção R.S. et al.Microcephaly in Pernambuco State, Brazil: epidemiological characteristics and evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of cutoff points for reporting suspected cases.Cad. Saude Publica. 2016; 32: e00017216PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the Americas, the virus encountered a hemisphere full of immunologically naive human hosts and competent mosquito vectors. Infections with the virus and resultant cases of severe microcephaly subsequently soared in Brazil, and detection in other countries quickly followed (Figure 1). Researchers raced to answer fundamental questions, including (1) when and from where did the epidemic originate, (2) how was the virus spreading, and (3) were severe clinical conditions, such as microcephaly, a new occurrence? In this commentary, we summarize what we have learned about the spread and evolution of the Zika epidemic. As with the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa (Dudas et al., 2017Dudas G. Carvalho L.M. Bedford T. Tatem A.J. Baele G. Faria N.R. Park D.J. Ladner J.T. Arias A. Asogun D. et al.Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic.Nature. 2017; 544: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), virus genomic data were used to answer critical epidemiological questions and to complement traditional disease surveillance efforts. The Zika epidemic also posed a distinct set of technical challenges and provided new insights into how an integrated, real-time response system to emerging arboviruses might be achieved. Genomic characterization of the Zika epidemic revealed vulnerabilities in current arbovirus disease surveillance systems. Analyses of Zika virus genomes demonstrated that the epidemic in the Americas was likely established in late 2013 in northeastern Brazil, more than a year before the first confirmed case (Figure 1A; Faria et al., 2016Faria N.R. Azevedo R.D.S.D.S. Kraemer M.U.G. Souza R. Cunha M.S. Hill S.C. Thézé J. Bonsall M.B. Bowden T.A. Rissanen I. et al.Zika virus in the Americas: early epidemiological and genetic findings.Science. 2016; 352: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, Faria et al., 2017Faria N.R. Quick J.

Black A. da Costa A.C. et al.Establishment and cryptic transmission of Zika virus in Brazil and the Americas.Nature. 2017; 546: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This surveillance gap, between the arrival and discovery of the virus (Figure 1B) exists, in part, because the symptoms of Zika virus infection are often mild or similar to those of other co-circulating viruses, including dengue and chikungunya (Figure 1C). Using genomics to quantify the true arrival date of Zika virus therefore helps us understand what fraction of microcephaly cases might be attributable to the virus and why microcephaly rates vary among locations (e.g., de Oliveira et al., 2017de Oliveira W.K. de França G.V.A. Carmo E.H. Duncan B.B. de Souza Kuchenbecker R. Schmidt M.I. Infection-related microcephaly after the 2015 and 2016 Zika virus outbreaks in Brazil: a surveillance-based analysis.Lancet. 2017; 390: 861-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The retrospective discovery of this long surveillance gap means that measures to control international spread of the virus were already too late by the time Zika virus was first detected in the Americas (Metsky et al., 2017Metsky H.C. Matranga C.B. Wohl S. Schaffner S.F. Freije C.A. Winnicki S.M. West K. Qu J. Baniecki M.L. Gladden-Young A. et al.Zika virus evolution and spread in the Americas.Nature. 2017; 546: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition to the timescale of international spread, Zika virus genomic studies also estimated the frequency and sources of virus introductions into specific locations. While the epidemic in the Americas can be traced back to a single “successful” introduction of Zika virus into Brazil, local outbreaks in other countries were likely composed of transmission chains derived from multiple independent introductions (Faria et al., 2017Faria N.R. Quick J. Claro I.M. Thézé J. de Jesus J.G. Giovanetti M. Kraemer M.U.G. Hill S.C. Black A. da Costa A.C. et al.Establishment and cryptic transmission of Zika virus in Brazil and the Americas.Nature. 2017; 546: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, Metsky et al., 2017Metsky H.C. Matranga C.B. Wohl S. Schaffner S.F. Freije C.A. Winnicki S.M. West K. Qu J. Baniecki M.L. Gladden-Young A. et al.Zika virus evolution and spread in the Americas.Nature. 2017; 546: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For example, phylogenetic analyses estimated that more than 30 separate introductions of Zika virus to Florida were responsible for the comparatively small outbreak there of ∼250 reported cases (Grubaugh et al., 2017Grubaugh N.D. Ladner J.T. Kraemer M.U.G. Dudas G. Tan A.L. Gangavarapu K. Wiley M.R. White S. Thézé J. Magnani D.M. et al.Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions of Zika virus into the United States.Nature. 2017; 546: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). If repeated introductions in a given region are the norm, then responsive local control efforts by themselves may not be able to eliminate infection risk. Rather, the intensity of modern human mobility means that emerging epidemics like Zika require international coordination and an increased focus on surveillance and control efforts in source countries. A significant challenge for Zika virus diagnostics, and subsequent virus genome sequencing, was the low amounts of virus present in most clinical samples. This problem is caused by the rapid decrease in viremia following the onset of symptoms (Lessler et al., 2016Lessler J. Chaisson L.H. Kucirka L.M. Bi Q. Grantz K. Salje H. Carcelen A.C. Ott C.T. Sheffield J.S. Ferguson N.M. et al.Assessing the global threat from Zika virus.Science. 2016; 353: aaf8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), when most clinical samples were collected. The need for virus genomic data to understand the epidemic, however, led to the development of several sequencing methods that specifically enriched for Zika virus RNA (e.g., Quick et al., 2017Quick J. Grubaugh N.D. Pullan S.T. Claro I.M. Smith A.D. Gangavarapu K. Oliveira G. Robles-Sikisaka R. Rogers T.F. Beutler N.A. et al.Multiplex PCR method for MinION and Illumina sequencing of Zika and other virus genomes directly from clinical samples.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The open sharing of laboratory protocols facilitated the generation of most of the available Zika virus genetic data and resulting insights discussed here. Despite an estimated 100 million Zika cases in the Americas, less than 300 complete or partial Zika virus genomes are publicly available (as of January 18, 2018). In comparison, >5% (1,600) of all known Ebola cases were sequenced during the outbreak in West Africa (Dudas et al., 2017Dudas G. Carvalho L.M. Bedford T. Tatem A.J. Baele G. Faria N.R. Park D.J. Ladner J.T. Arias A. Asogun D. et al.Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic.Nature. 2017; 544: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our ability to genetically track the Zika virus epidemic was limited not only by difficulties in sequencing Zika virus but also by uneven virus sampling through space and time. Reducing surveillance gaps during future arbovirus outbreaks requires a systematic change, moving from passive case reporting and ad hoc genomic sampling to continuous and structured virus reconnaissance. Such a strategy should target patients in at-risk areas, together with population-level surveillance in mosquitoes, primates, and other mammals that could establish cycles of sylvatic transmission. Several lines of evidence suggest that Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses can spread through international corridors of human mobility that connect locations with synchronized vector breeding seasons. Recent Zika cases in Angola, for example, raised concerns that a Zika virus lineage from the Americas could have reached Africa. Conversely, the first case of the chikungunya virus ESCA genotype in Brazil most likely originated from Angola (Nunes et al., 2015Nunes M.R.T. Faria N.R. de Vasconcelos J.M. Golding N. Kraemer M.U.G. de Oliveira L.F. Azevedo Rdo.S. da Silva D.E. da Silva E.V. da Silva S.P. et al.Emergence and potential for spread of Chikungunya virus in Brazil.BMC Med. 2015; 13https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0348-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, a Zika outbreak comprising >7,500 infections was reported in Cabo Verde. Yet, due to a dearth of genomic and epidemiological data, we know little about the origins of these outbreaks, the transmission dynamics of the virus, and the genetic diversity of Zika virus strains present in Africa. Much greater investment in virus surveillance in at-risk regions is needed to minimize local surveillance gaps and generate rapid outbreak control responses. It is still unclear whether specific Zika virus mutations might have contributed to the virus’ rapid spread in the Americas or its association with microcephaly. Studies comparing the replication, tropism, and pathogenesis of Zika virus isolates collected worldwide have reported some phenotypic differences, yet most studies agree that all Zika virus lineages can infect human placental cells and are neurotrophic. These results thus suggest that Zika-associated neuropathology is likely not a newly evolved trait, but these studies cannot exclude the possibility that recent Zika virus mutations could have enhanced this trait. For example, genomic studies of past West Nile, chikungunya, and Ebola virus outbreaks have discovered individual mutations that increase viral replication in new hosts and could exacerbate transmission (e.g., Diehl et al., 2016Diehl W.E. Lin A.E. Grubaugh N.D. Carvalho L.M. Kim K. Kyawe P.P. McCauley S.M. Donnard E. Kucukural A. McDonel P. et al.Ebola virus glycoprotein with increased infectivity dominated the 2013-2016 epidemic.Cell. 2016; 167: 1088-1098.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two Zika virus mutations that evolved shortly before the epidemic in the Americas (Faria et al., 2016Faria N.R. Azevedo R.D.S.D.S. Kraemer M.U.G. Souza R. Cunha M.S. Hill S.C. Thézé J. Bonsall M.B. Bowden T.A. Rissanen I. et al.Zika virus in the Americas: early epidemiological and genetic findings.Science. 2016; 352: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) have been reported to enhance Aedes aegypti infectivity (NS1 A188V; Liu et al., 2017Liu Y. Liu J. Du S. Shan C. Nie K. Zhang R. Li X.-F. Zhang R. Wang T. Qin C.-F. et al.Evolutionary enhancement of Zika virus infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.Nature. 2017; 545: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and neurovirulence (prM S17N; Yuan et al., 2017Yuan L. Huang X.-Y. Liu Z.-Y. Zhang F. Zhu X.-L. Yu J.-Y. Ji X. Xu Y.-P. Li G. Li C. et al.A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly.Science. 2017; 358: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). While these mutations could have elevated the epidemic potential of Zika virus, there is no current epidemiological support of such a hypothesis. Moreover, mutations that pre-date the epidemic cannot explain the high variation in reported microcephaly rates across the Americas (e.g., de Oliveira et al., 2017de Oliveira W.K. de França G.V.A. Carmo E.H. Duncan B.B. de Souza Kuchenbecker R. Schmidt M.I. Infection-related microcephaly after the 2015 and 2016 Zika virus outbreaks in Brazil: a surveillance-based analysis.Lancet. 2017; 390: 861-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Systematic functional studies of Zika virus mutations from before and during the epidemic, matched with epidemiological data, are required to determine whether recent virus genetic factors have contributed to the epidemic. A variety of mathematical models have been used to investigate the transmission potential of Zika virus, the risk of neuropathology associated with infection, and the drivers of virus spread. Virus genomic data have the potential to significantly enhance the utility of more traditional epidemiological investigations (Dudas et al., 2017Dudas G. Carvalho L.M. Bedford T. Tatem A.J. Baele G. Faria N.R. Park D.J. Ladner J.T. Arias A. Asogun D. et al.Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic.Nature. 2017; 544: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic birth-death models, for example, provide an accurate way to estimate fluctuations through time in the effective reproductive number of an epidemic (Stadler et al., 2013Stadler T. Kühnert D. Bonhoeffer S. Drummond A.J. Birth-death skyline plot reveals temporal changes of epidemic spread in HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The ability of virus genomes to cross-check conclusions drawn from case report data may be particularly valuable in locations where such data are uncertain (e.g., during co-circulation of multiple arboviruses; Figure 1C). Moreover, advances in phylogeographic methods mean that the dynamics of viral spread and persistence across regions can be investigated at high resolution. In one recent example, analyses of Ebola virus genomes revealed that the spread of the epidemic in West Africa involved intense transmission between larger and closer populations (Dudas et al., 2017Dudas G. Carvalho L.M. Bedford T. Tatem A.J. Baele G. Faria N.R. Park D.J. Ladner J.T. Arias A. Asogun D. et al.Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic.Nature. 2017; 544: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Given the scale of the Zika epidemic, however, at least an order of magnitude more virus genome sequences are required to successfully undertake an equally detailed analysis of Zika virus transmission. Despite the many challenges and questions that remain, the open and collaborative nature of research undertaken by the infectious disease community during recent emerging epidemics gives ample reason for optimism. In contrast to the historical model of data generation by a few genomics centers, the Zika epidemic showed that many smaller laboratories can combine efforts in response to a public health crisis. Open sharing of protocols, epidemiological data, and pathogen genome sequences from laboratories and organizations worldwide played a central role in obtaining insights into the origins, timing, and spread of the Zika epidemic. We thank the clinicians, epidemiologists, and biologists at the front lines of the epidemic and the many laboratories worldwide that shared protocols and data ahead of print.

Restoration of the human microbiome must become a priority for biomedicine. The evolutionary fate of humans is intimately linked with that of our microbiome. Medical and technological advances have caused large-scale changes in the composition and maturation of human-associated microbial communities, increasing our susceptibility to infectious and developmental diseases. Restoration of the human microbiome must become a priority for biomedicine. In the beginnings of life on Earth, bacteria were alone. As multicellular organisms arose over the eons, they fought some bacteria and adapted to living with others that colonized external and internal surfaces. From invertebrates to mammals, these microbial consortia have not evolved strictly at random; sequence analyses provide evidence for extensive sympatry between hosts and their colonizing microbial populations, indicating long-standing co-evolution. These microbes have an evolutionary stake in keeping their hosts alive; their conservation is an indication of their functional benefits. Together, the host and its microbes form a “holobiont,” an emergent property in which the whole exceeds the sum of its parts, based on the added dimension of co-evolution over time. This simple concept underlies human biology. The sympatry between hosts and their microbes implies strong vertical transmission (Moeller et al., 2016Moeller A.H. Caro-Quintero A. Mjungu D. Georgiev A.V. Lonsdorf E.V. Muller M.N. Pusey A.E. Peeters M. Hahn B.H. Ochman H. Cospeciation of gut microbiota with hominids.Science. 2016; 353: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, the roots of the microbiome in each individual lay in the preceding generation, and the mother transmits her microbes to her offspring. During microbiological youth, including at least the first 3 years of life (Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4786) Google Scholar), we acquire the microbial populations that support our development, leading to the ultimate reproduction of ourselves and our microbes. In middle-life, major microbiome functions involve homeostasis and protection from pathogens that may interfere with fecundity. Humans have a longer tail of senescence relative to most species. Although the microbiome in senescent hosts has little or no direct impact on the reproductive capacity of an individual, connections at the population level may occur through horizontal transfer of microbial communities (Blaser and Webb, 2014Blaser M.J. Webb G.F. Host demise as a beneficial function of indigenous microbiota in human hosts.MBio. 2014; 5 (e02262–14)Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In any event, the selection for senescent age microbes must differ from the reproductive period; the microbiome changes with age both drive and reflect the aging process. In one example, Helicobacter pylori, the dominant ancestral constituent of the gastric microbiome, drives the age-related transformation to gastric malignancy. Conversely, the microbiome lacking H. pylori promotes malignancy in the adjacent esophagus. Although the rules remain opaque, the senescent microbiome clearly contributes to the diseases of aging, including cancers and degenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s). In the late 19th century, the microbiome apparently began to change in developed countries. We can infer this based on changes in indicator organisms, like H. pylori, Oxalobacter formigenes, and the ratio between Prevotella and Bacteroides species. Perhaps this was due to cleaner drinking water and better sanitation or more directly due to chlorination. Cumulatively, the benefits of these public health practices have been enormous, contributing substantially to our improved longevity. Nevertheless, an unintended consequence has been deleterious effects on our microbiota. In the past 80 years, we have seen the introduction of antibiotics into the human biosphere on enormous scale. Practices including Cesarean-section, which interferes with the transmission of maternal microbes to the next generation, and the use of infant formula lacking the micronutrients that co-evolved to support the propagation and maintenance of ancestral microbiota, are the norm in many localities. Conversely, in present-day traditional societies in which these aspects of modernization are not present, the microbiota is substantially richer (Clemente et al., 2015Clemente J.C. Pehrsson E.C. Blaser M.J. Sandhu K. Gao Z. Wang B. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Contreras M. Noya-Alarcón Ó. et al.The microbiome of uncontacted Amerindians.Sci.

Altogether, these practices have impaired both the horizontal and vertical transmission of the ancestral microbiota and the maintenance of the transmitted organisms (Figure 1). We have postulated that the microbiome losses are in fact extinctions that have accumulated with the passage of generations (Blaser and Falkow, 2009Blaser M.J. Falkow S.

Although differing in the year of commencement and in the extent of the perturbation by locality, these man-made changes represent a worldwide change in ecology. In many ways, it parallels the changes in macro-ecology affecting farmland, oceans, and the climate, but it is happening faster, over years and decades. In our euphoria over the successes of public health and the sometimes miraculous effects of antibiotics, we missed seeing this phenomenon until recently. Sentinel events, like the decline of our ancestral H. pylori, were considered positive because of the easily apparent benefits of its disappearance. Yet, like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, its loss is reflective of a wider decrease in microbial diversity (Clemente et al., 2015Clemente J.C. Pehrsson E.C. Blaser M.J. Sandhu K. Gao Z. Wang B. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Contreras M. Noya-Alarcón Ó. et al.The microbiome of uncontacted Amerindians.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1500183Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and an altered maturation of the microbiome in early life (Bokulich et al., 2016Bokulich N.A. Chung J. Battaglia T. Henderson N. Jay M. Li H. D Lieber A. Wu F. Perez-Perez G.I. Chen Y. et al.Antibiotics, birth mode, and diet shape microbiome maturation during early life.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8: 343ra82Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). We might consider four consequences (horsemen) of the altered microbiome: facilitating antibiotic resistance, developmental diseases, middle-life illnesses, and most worrisome, epidemics. Known since antibiotics were first deployed, antibiotic resistance is obviously fueled by selection for resistance genes. But another factor is that the altered microbiota has diminished ecological resistance, which in net favors retention of commensals that carry or have gained antibiotic-resistance genes. During periods in which antibiotic selection is absent (most of the time), the resistance mechanisms have metabolic costs favoring the loss of organisms carrying them. Perturbation and reduced microbial diversity lead to conditions that create new niches, lowering the net costs. By facilitating colonization by altered commensals and invasion by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, loss of ecological resistance promotes the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms. One example is the emergence of infections by the commensal Clostridium difficile. Ecological change, e.g., induced by antibiotic exposure, removes natural competitors, allowing either endogenous or exogenous (nosocomial) C. difficile to bloom. That there has been further selection for hypertoxinogenic strains (O’Connor et al., 2009O’Connor J.R. Johnson S. Gerding D.N. Clostridium difficile infection caused by the epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain.Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 1913-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) provides an unfortunate example for the natural progression beyond the initial ecological disturbance. Paradoxically, the success of fecal transplantation in curing these infections points directly to the value of an intact ecosystem that keeps opportunists in check. Similarly, alterations of the upper respiratory microbiota may play a role in fueling antibiotic-resistant commensals/invaders (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). In recent years, multiple studies of children have found associations between large-scale changes to the microbiome in early life (caused by activities including antibiotic use, C-sections, or formula feeding) and the later development of diseases including childhood-onset obesity, asthma, food allergies, and inflammatory bowel diseases. These epidemiologic associations are correlative only, even across numerous studies, and further do not permit exploration of whether, for example, the insult might have been the original infection for which antibiotics were prescribed or the antibiotics themselves. For this reason, experiments in model systems, including mice, are extremely useful. Although used to mitigate the invasion of hosts by pathogens, the collateral effects of antibiotics are to uncouple the co-evolved partnership between the host and the microbiome. We can gain important insight by considering the 70-year-long worldwide experiment on farms: early-in-life antibiotic use, even in low dose, promotes the growth of livestock, ranging from chickens to cows. One reason why antibiotics work as growth promoters—moving young hosts toward greater mass, regardless of animal species or the particular anti-bacterial used—is by upsetting developmental equilibria conserved over the eons. A proportion of nutrients in food pass undigested through the host and microbiota into the animal’s wastes. By selecting for a more energy-efficient microbiota (Cho et al., 2012Cho I. Yamanishi S. Cox L. Methé B.A. Zavadil J. Li K. Gao Z. Mahana D. Raju K. Teitler I. et al.Antibiotics in early life alter the murine colonic microbiome and adiposity.Nature. 2012; 488: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar), antibiotic exposure leads to a new energy source also available to the host. On the farm, animals become bigger, and a growing body of evidence supports similar phenomena in humans (Cox and Blaser, 2015Cox L.M. Blaser M.J. Antibiotics in early life and obesity.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2015; 11: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Similar to farm animals, mice have altered metabolism after early life exposure to antibiotics, with synergistic effects from genetic diatheses and hypercaloric diets. Antibiotic treatment of germ-free animals has shown that a microbiota is necessary for the effects, whereas microbiome transplantation to germ-free mice shows that the perturbed microbiota is sufficient for the effects (Cox et al., 2014Cox L.M. Yamanishi S. Sohn J. Alekseyenko A.V. Leung J.M. Cho I. Kim S.G. Li H. Gao Z. Mahana D. et al.Altering the intestinal microbiota during a critical developmental window has lasting metabolic consequences.Cell. 2014; 158: 705-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, Ruiz et al., 2017Ruiz V.E. Battaglia T. Kurtz Z.D. Bijnens L. Ou A. Engstrand I. Zheng X. Iizumi T. Mullins B.J. Müller C.L. et al.A single early-in-life macrolide course has lasting effects on murine microbial network topology and immunity.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Importantly, even if the perturbation is transient, consequences can be long term (Cox et al., 2014Cox L.M. Yamanishi S. Sohn J. Alekseyenko A.V. Leung J.M. Cho I. Kim S.G. Li H. Gao Z. Mahana D. et al.Altering the intestinal microbiota during a critical developmental window has lasting metabolic consequences.Cell. 2014; 158: 705-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), consistent with the general theories of development, in which early life insults lead to permanent sequelae. We know that gastric colonization with the ancestral/dominant H. pylori affects the regulation of ghrelin. Mostly produced in the stomach, ghrelin is an important hormonal player in appetite and energy homeostasis. Because of extinction, recent generations of children have been growing up without the ancestral H. pylori effects on ghrelin regulation, but we do not yet understand the consequences of this loss. Not surprisingly, by changing microbial compositions, early life antibiotic exposures also affect immunological development, particularly the context governing how adaptive responses develop from their interactions with innate immunity. Extending the concept still further, in genetically predisposed mice, an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota in the antecedent generation led to ecological disturbances and enhanced inflammatory disease after a months-long latency in the offspring (Schulfer et al., 2017Schulfer A. Battaglia T. Alvarez Y. Bijnens L. Ruiz V.E. Ho M. Robinson S. Ward T. Cox L.M. Rogers A.B. et al.Intergenerational transfer of antibiotic-perturbed microbiota enhances colitis in susceptible mice.Nat. Microbiology. 2017; 3: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); a fiber-depleted diet had similar ecological effects on the microbiome across generations (Sonnenburg et al., 2016Sonnenburg E.D. Smits S.A. Tikhonov M. Higginbottom S.K. Wingreen N.S. Sonnenburg J.L. Diet-induced extinctions in the gut microbiota compound over generations.Nature. 2016; 529: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that perturbing the maternally transmitted microbiome can have long-term ecological and disease consequences on subsequent generations. Studies in both mice and humans show that early life exposures can cause a dysmaturity of the microbiota (Ruiz et al., 2017Ruiz V.E. Battaglia T. Kurtz Z.D. Bijnens L. Ou A. Engstrand I. Zheng X. Iizumi T. Mullins B.J. Müller C.L. et al.A single early-in-life macrolide course has lasting effects on murine microbial network topology and immunity.Nat.

Med. 2016; 8: 343ra82Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) that can lead to disease (e.g., asthma; Stokholm et al., 2018Stokholm J. Blaser M.J. Thorsen J. Rasmussen M.A. Waage J. Vinding R.K. Schoos A.-M.M. Kunøe A. Fink N.R. Chawes B.L. et al.Maturation of the gut microbiome and risk of asthma in childhood.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02573-2Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The boundaries between developmental and middle-life illnesses are imprecise, since many conditions may have developmental origins. However, there is increasing evidence that ecological disturbances due to exposures to antibiotics, other medications, specific types of diets, and food additives (artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers) may be further driving pathogenesis. For example, the incidence of kidney stones has been progressively rising, and approximately 80% of cases are calcium oxalate stones. Cross-sectional studies (e.g., Clemente et al., 2015Clemente J.C. Pehrsson E.C. Blaser M.J. Sandhu K. Gao Z. Wang B. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Contreras M. Noya-Alarcón Ó. et al.The microbiome of uncontacted Amerindians.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1500183Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) indicate that a member of the human microbiota, Oxalobacter formigenes, is becoming less common. Since these organisms metabolize both dietary and host-derived oxalate, their loss may be one factor that has driven the increased prevalence of oxalate kidney stones, as indicated in experimental models. For immunological diseases that have become more common in adults in the past century, including systemic lupus erythematosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease, microbiota changes are considered as important potential antecedents for the increased incidence, but no role has been proven thus far. One possibility is that the effects of an altered microbiome (whether it be inherited, acquired early in life, or both) on early life immunological development change the context for immune responses of adults to adventitious antigenic exposures, creating a diathesis for pathogenicity. Invasions are not restricted to commensals that have virulence properties but also can be due to high-grade pathogens. Macro-ecology provides numerous examples of invasive species spreading without the check of their natural competitors, using the resources of the indigenes, and ultimately choking them. In fact, this is the greatest threat of our micro-ecological changes. Invasion is a generic property and, in the human context, could be due to any microbe or virus. The critical questions concern the role of the microbiome in host resistance to invasion, the natural boundaries that curtail spread, and the resilience that allows for rapid recovery. We are already witnessing the spread of opportunistic antibiotic-resistant commensals (e.g., MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE], and C. difficile) in largely compromised populations but also disseminating to less-affected hosts. With a growing and increasingly dense (urban) human population, and shortening mean travel times, we have a progressively interconnected planet. Larger contiguous populations permit the maintenance of increasingly virulent pathogens. Global micro-ecological changes make pandemics more likely. This is a horrifying concept, but we need to marshal our forces to anticipate and resist them. Much like recent human activities have resulted in a global carbon debt in the soil, we can think of modern sanitation and medicine having created a global human microbe debt. Is the process of loss accelerating, or is homeostasis bringing us back toward equilibrium? Although it is possible that homeostatic mechanisms may be moderating the impact of microbe depletion, the losses have been so rapid in evolutionary time that true adaptation is unlikely. Slowing the rate of loss will mitigate the extent of the burden, but how will our collective debt be repaid? Can we manage to do it slowly, gradually, or will nature do it by cataclysm? The answer is not obvious, and the stakes are high. One hope is that we can rebuild slowly through both global and host-specific (precision) approaches. In addition to particular taxa and molecules, we must think about ecosystems and ecosystem services. In the complex and varied co-evolved human microbial ecosystems, we do not yet know whether the individual molecule, gene, pathway, strain, genus, family, guild of cooperating species, or other combination is most relevant to health and disease. I suggest that each plays a role, depending on the question, and that reductionist approaches will only solve a part of the puzzle. As in other complex problems, including weather forecasting, the redundancy and sheer number of interacting and variable factors constrains the accuracy of predictions. To slow the rate of loss, we must develop narrow-spectrum antibiotics, ideally aimed at single taxa, to avoid the collateral effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the “innocent bystanders” in the microbiota. Such a goal, which is technically feasible given our increasing knowledge of microbial genomes and physiology, will also require the development and deployment of rapid microbial diagnostics to ensure that the correct agents are used. Nevertheless, restoration will clearly be a priority. In a biological sense, first, we must weed our garden to remove the opportunistic invasive species filling the vacant niches that once were occupied, then we must re-seed with the lost indigenes. Their most likely source may be from remote present-day peoples of traditional societies in whom antibiotic use and other modern practices has been limited or absent. Perhaps we will need to fertilize these true “probiotic” organisms with specific prebiotics and/or with broad agents like fiber, for example, providing energy substrate to the colon. Early life seeding might have biological costs; perhaps growth will be impaired and adult height reduced, but the hope is that those children and their offspring will be healthier. Since one size will surely not fit all, we will have to develop precision approaches. Obvious recipient candidates include the babies born by C-section, those whose mother is not nursing, and those receiving early life antibiotic courses. Potential restoratives might include fecal transplants, global but crude solutions that are currently being studied for a variety of conditions. Alternatively, and more importantly, science can develop well-defined precise and individual approaches. Examples could include the restoration of particular strains of O. formigenes in patients who have had calcium oxalate kidney stones or specific strains of Bifidobacter species in children who have received antibiotics. Alternatively, we can identify specific chemical substrates (prebiotics) that such key organisms preferentially utilize and add these to the diet of the impacted individuals to rebuild depleted but still present populations. The first step is understanding the particular losses—of taxa and functions—predisposing to disease, and then we can develop specific restorative approaches. Such activities may be valuable for both prevention and treatment of disease. What will future historians say about our era? Our conventional wisdom suggests that they would be impressed by our great medical advances that have prolonged both life and function for vast numbers of people. Or will they be disappointed by how we have been eroding our ancient microbial patrimony, with costs already appearing and a darkening sky ahead? We have been very conscious and appropriately proud of the advances, but now we need to pay attention to the costs. We must minimize and reverse the impact, because they threaten to undo all of our great progress in health. We urgently need to use science to solve this problem."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a widespread and growing metabolic disease that currently afflicts nearly 415 million people worldwide. The pathogenesis of T2D is multi-faceted with at least two fundamental components: (1) development of insulin resistance, and (2) pancreatic β cell failure. In patients with T2D, a 37-amino acid hormone that is co-secreted with insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), typically misfolds and forms amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets (Clark et al., 1988Clark A. Wells C.A. Buley I.D. Cruickshank J.K. Vanhegan R.I. Matthews D.R. Cooper G.J. Holman R.R. Turner R.C.

In disease, the buildup of toxic IAPP aggregates likely contribute to β cell failure (Jurgens et al., 2011Jurgens C.A. Toukatly M.N. Fligner C.L. Udayasankar J. Subramanian S.L. Zraika S.

Supporting the hypothesis that toxic IAPP aggregates play a role in diabetes, a mutation in IAPP which converts serine at position 20 to glycine has been shown to increase the amyloidogenicity and toxicity of the peptide (Ma et al., 2001Ma Z.

This mutation has been associated with premature onset diabetes (Sakagashira et al., 1996Sakagashira S. Sanke T. Hanabusa T. Shimomura H. Ohagi S. Kumagaye K.Y. Nakajima K. Nanjo K.

Diabetes Investig. 2011; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although mouse IAPP is not amyloidogenic, transgenic mice overexpressing human IAPP developed spontaneous diabetes, with mice expressing higher levels of IAPP progressing to diabetes more rapidly than those expressing lower levels of IAPP (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang S. Liu H. Chuang C.L. Li X. Au M. Zhang L. Phillips A.R.J. Scott D.W. Cooper G.J.S. The pathogenic mechanism of diabetes varies with the degree of overexpression and oligomerization of human amylin in the pancreatic islet β cells.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 5083-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IAPP aggregates have recently been shown to behave as prions in mice, signifying that IAPP aggregation could accelerate and spread once it has started (Mukherjee et al., 2017Mukherjee A. Morales-Scheihing D. Salvadores N. Moreno-Gonzalez I. Gonzalez C. Taylor-Presse K. Mendez N. Shahnawaz M. Gaber A.O.

Thus, it may be necessary intervene at the earliest onset of aggregation to avoid irreparable damage to β cells. Similar to findings for neurodegeneration-associated protein aggregates, the consensus on what constitutes the toxic form of IAPP has shifted from amyloid deposits, to smaller, diffusible oligomers. Indeed, the extent of IAPP amyloid deposition often does not correlate with β cell death (Butler et al., 2004Butler A.E. Jang J. Gurlo T. Carty M.D. Soeller W.C. Butler P.C.

Staining human IAPP-expressing mouse islets with this oligomer-specific antibody has revealed that IAPP oligomers are predominantly found intracellularly and independent of IAPP amyloid deposits (Lin et al., 2007Lin C.-Y.

Yet, we do not have a complete understanding of how IAPP aggregates cause toxicity, preempting our ability to identify ways to avert it.

Building on the successes of these yeast models, we have created the first yeast model of IAPP toxicity. Strains expressing IAPP oligomers experienced a strong growth defect enabling genome-wide overexpression and deletion screens for modifiers of this defect. The known functions of the genetic modifiers recovered from these screens provided insights into pathways perturbed by IAPP. The strongest suppressor recovered was Ste24, a protease that is highly conserved from yeast to humans (ZMPSTE24). Mutations in ZMPSTE24 have been previously shown to cause laminopathies such as mandibuloacral dysplasia (Agarwal et al., 2003Agarwal A.K. Fryns J.-P. Auchus R.J. Garg A.

Common and rare forms of diabetes mellitus: towards a continuum of diabetes subtypes.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2016; 12: 394-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, ZMPSTE24 had never been associated with IAPP toxicity. As Ast et al., 2016Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. The protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar recently demonstrated, Ste24 and ZMPSTE24 clear translocons of polypeptides that have stalled during translocation. Our results, therefore, revealed a previously unidentified proteotoxic mechanism for IAPP oligomers: clogging of the ER translocon. IAPP is post-translationally processed from 89 to 37 amino acids while transiting the secretory pathway of pancreatic β cells, at the end of which it is stored in secretory granules. To mimic endogenous IAPP trafficking in yeast, we adapted a strategy successfully employed for our yeast model of Aβ toxicity, which exposes the cytoplasm, as well as much of the secretory and endocytic pathways, to the peptide (Treusch et al., 2011Treusch S. Hamamichi S. Goodman J.L. Matlack K.E.S. Chung C.Y. Baru V. Shulman J.M. Parrado A. Bevis B.J. Valastyan J.S. et al.Functional links between Aβ toxicity, endocytic trafficking, and Alzheimer’s disease risk factors in yeast.Science. 2011; 334: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We fused the ER signal peptide of the Kar2 protein (Kar2SS) to the N terminus of IAPP. Once this fusion protein enters the ER, the signal peptide is removed. IAPP is then trafficked through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, where it is retained by the cell wall. There, IAPP can undergo endocytosis and traffic through endocytic compartments. Overexpressing IAPP monomers did not produce sufficient toxicity under conditions required for screening (Figures S1A and S1B). This is in keeping with previous work indicating that IAPP oligomers, not monomers, are responsible for toxicity. To increase the production of proteotoxic IAPP molecules, we created a genetically encoded IAPP oligomer, which we expected would model some aspects of IAPP proteotoxicity. This approach enabled us to bypass a rate-limiting step of protein aggregation: primary nucleation. We linked six IAPP monomers into a single polypeptide and fused it to the Kar2 signal peptide forming a construct we termed 6xIAPP (Figure S1). Expression of 6xIAPP produced protein of the expected size and elicited a strong growth defect from a single-copy insertion into the genome (Figures 1A and 1B ). The two bands visible by western blot resulted from the presence or absence of the Kar2 signal peptide. 6xIAPP tagged with monomeric super folder GFP (msfGFP) (Landgraf et al., 2016Landgraf D. Huh D. Hallacli E. Lindquist S. Scarless gene tagging with one-step transformation and two-step selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0163950Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) retained its toxicity (Figure S1C) and its pattern of distribution in the cell was consistent with localization to secretory compartments (Figure 1C). Because 6xIAPP was properly localized and produced a growth defect strong enough for screening, we used the 6xIAPP expressing yeast as our model of IAPP toxicity.Figure 1Growth Defects and ER Stress in Yeast Expressing 6xIAPPShow full caption(A) Yeast harboring empty vector or 6xIAPP were induced with 100 nM estradiol and grown on agar plates for 24 hr.(B) Western blot of cells expressing 6xIAPP.(C) Cells expressing 6xIAPP-msfGFP fused to a Kar2 signal peptide (Kar2SS) (panel 1), msfGFP fused to Kar2SS (panel 2), and msfGFP fused to Kar2SS and an ER retention peptide (HDEL) (panel 3).

Before making genetic manipulations, we observed the effects of IAPP oligomer overexpression in yeast. First, we measured changes in the transcriptome of 6xIAPP-expressing yeast using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Figure 1D). Relative to control cells, 6xIAPP-expressing cells had 38 genes with >4-fold increased expression. Of these, 22 were targets of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Pincus et al., 2014Pincus D. Aranda-Díaz A. Zuleta I.A. Walter P. El-Samad H. Delayed Ras/PKA signaling augments the unfolded protein response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14800-14805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), representing a highly significant enrichment for this pathway (p = 3.8 × 10−18, Fisher’s exact test). We confirmed the activation of the UPR by expressing 6xIAPP in a reporter strain harboring GFP under the control of a UPR-inducible promoter (Figure S1D). These results gave us confidence that our 6xIAPP-expressing yeast were modeling a biologically relevant toxicity, as ER stress is also a phenotype of IAPP toxicity in other model systems (Huang et al., 2007Huang C.-J. Haataja L. Gurlo T. Butler A.E. Wu X. Soeller W.C. Butler P.C.

We employed a fluorescent reporter library recently constructed in our lab (D.L., W.R.H., and S.L., unpublished data) to further probe the mechanisms of IAPP toxicity (Figure 1E). This library allowed us to examine changes in the levels and localization of key proteins. Furthermore, the sensitivity of this library to proteotoxic stresses allowed us to interrogate cellular responses at low levels of toxicity (Figure S1E). For most reporter strains in the library, cells expressing 6xIAPP had higher mean fluorescence intensity relative to controls, potentially due to the slower growth rate of the 6xIAPP-expressing cells or lower protein turnover in these cells. ER-stress reporter strains (such as those expressing monomeric Neon Green [mNG] fusions of Kar2 and Scj1, tagged at their endogenous loci) had greatly elevated fluorescence, consistent with the ER stress signal in the RNA-seq data. The most striking changes were in strains that overexpressed ER-targeted GFP (Kar2SS-mNG, Kar2SS-msfGFP-HDEL, etc.). In IAPP-expressing cells, the ER-targeted GFP molecules were localized to the cytoplasm instead of the ER. Therefore, we concluded that 6xIAPP induces ER stress and impairs transport into the ER. To identify modifiers of IAPP toxicity, we performed a genome-wide overexpression screen. We created a library of diploid yeast carrying two copies of estradiol-inducible 6xIAPP and 5,532 yeast open reading frames (ORFs) on low-copy plasmids under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter (Hu et al., 2007Hu Y. Rolfs A. Bhullar B. Murthy T.V.S. Zhu C. Berger M.F. Camargo A.A. Kelley F. McCarron S. Jepson D. et al.Approaching a complete repository of sequence-verified protein-encoding clones for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This diploid, two-copy 6xIAPP strain experienced significant IAPP toxicity but not lethality, allowing for simultaneous screening for enhancers and suppressors of IAPP toxicity. An ORF was defined as modifier if it changed the growth of IAPP-expressing cells while producing no change in growth on its own (Figure 2A). After extensive secondary validation, we confirmed 29 suppressors (Figure S2A; Table S1) and 3 enhancers (Figure S2B) as bona fide modifiers of 6xIAPP toxicity.Figure S2Validation of Modifiers Recovered from the Overexpression Screen, Related to Figure 2AShow full caption(A) Spotting assays demonstrating representative verification data for 6xIAPP suppressors identified in the overexpression screen.

Strains were diploid W303 containing one copy of 6xIAPP and grown for 48 hours on the indicated media. Two strong suppressors from the overexpression screen were related to protein degradation. These were Rpn4, a transcription factor that promotes the expression of proteasomal subunits, and Atg17, a phagophore assembly scaffold protein involved in autophagy. These findings were consistent with the proposed roles of autophagy and the proteasome in other models of IAPP toxicity (Costes et al., 2011Costes S. Huang C.J. Gurlo T. Daval M. Matveyenko A.V. Rizza R.A. Butler A.E.

Invest. 2014; 124: 3489-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The strongest suppressor of 6xIAPP toxicity was Ste24, a highly conserved transmembrane protease of the ER with the active site in the cytoplasm. Ste24 overexpression suppressed both 6xIAPP (Figure 2B) and 1xIAPP toxicity (Figure 2C), with 6xIAPP being rescued more strongly than 1xIAPP. These results indicated that while direct expression of IAPP oligomers produced greater amounts of the toxic species that is affected by Ste24, overexpression of IAPP monomers could also produce this toxic form. In yeast, the annotated function of Ste24 is the processing of a-factor, a mating pheromone. The annotated function of the human homolog ZMPSTE24 is the processing of lamin A, a nuclear membrane protein not present in yeast. Notably, Ast et al., 2016Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. The protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar recently discovered that Ste24 and ZMPSTE24 clear the ER translocon of trapped polypeptides, identifying a shared function between the two proteins. If translocon clearing was indeed responsible for relieving IAPP oligomer toxicity, then IAPP oligomers might clog the translocon, providing a mechanistic explanation for our observed ER defects. To expand our knowledge of the genetic modifiers of IAPP toxicity, we followed up on our overexpression screen with a genome-wide deletion screen (Baryshnikova et al., 2010Baryshnikova A. Costanzo M.

RNA localization, followed by local translation, presents a mechanism for spatial and temporal gene expression regulation utilized by various cell types. However, little is known about mRNA localization and translation in the mammalian oocyte and early embryo. Importantly, fully-grown oocyte becomes transcriptionally inactive and only utilizes transcripts previously synthesized and stored during earlier development. We discovered an abundant RNA population in the oocyte and early embryo nucleus together with RNA binding proteins. We also characterized specific ribosomal proteins, which contribute to translation in the oocyte and embryo. By applying selected markers to mouse and human oocytes, we found that there might be a similar mechanism of RNA metabolism in both species. In conclusion, we visualized the localization of RNAs and translation machinery in the oocyte, that could shed light on this terra incognita of these unique cell types in mouse and human."

Although accumulating evidence indicates that endometriosis is associated with some cancer types, the cancer risks in patients with adenomyosis have been rarely examined. In this study, we investigated the relationship between adenomyosis and risks of common cancers.This study included a cohort of 12,447 women with adenomyosis but not endometriosis, born in 1951-1984, and a cohort of 124,470 adenomyosis-free women matched by birth year. Their medical records (collected between 1996 and 2011) were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We first compared the distribution of cancer-free survival (CFS) between cohorts with and without adenomyosis. Subsequently, within the adenomyosis cohort, we examined whether time-to-onset of the identified cancer type was correlated with time-to-onset of adenomyosis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the distribution of CFS between the adenomyosis and adenomyosis-free cohorts and between the early- and late-diagnosed adenomyosis groups. For comparison, we further evaluated the cancer risks for a cohort of 10,962 women with endometriosis but not adenomyosis and a birth-year matched cohort of 109,620 endometriosis-free women.Compared with adenomyosis-free women, patients with adenomyosis had higher risks of endometrial and thyroid cancers, with estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval) of 2.19 (1.51-3.16) and 1.70 (1.29-2.24), respectively. For both cancers, distributions of CFS were not significantly different between the early- and late-diagnosed adenomyosis groups. Furthermore, compared with endometriosis-free women, patients with endometriosis had higher risks of endometrial and ovarian cancers, with HRs of 1.89 (1.07-3.35) and 2.01 (1.27-3.16), respectively.Women with adenomyosis are at higher risks of endometrial and thyroid cancers, while women with endometriosis are at higher risks of endometrial and ovarian cancers."

The two inverted repeats (IRa and IRb; 26,606 bp) are spaced by a small single-copy region (22,868 bp) and a large single-copy region (88,751 bp). The chloroplast genome has 131 (113 unique) functional genes, including 86 (79 unique) protein-coding genes, 37 (30 unique) tRNA genes, and eight (four unique) rRNA genes. Tandem repeats comprise the majority of the 43 long repetitive sequences. In addition, 111 simple sequence repeats are present, with mononucleotides being the most common type and di- and tetranucleotides being infrequent events. Positive selection pressure on rps12 in the E. aureum chloroplast has been demonstrated via synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and selection pressure sites analyses. Ycf15 and infA are pseudogenes in this species. We constructed a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the complete chloroplast genomes of 38 species from 13 families. Those results strongly indicated that E. aureum is positioned as the sister of Colocasia esculenta within the Araceae family.

https://openalex.org/W2790674664,"Social institutions that facilitate sharing and redistribution may help mitigate the impact of resource shocks. In the North American Arctic, traditional food sharing may direct food to those who need it and provide a form of natural insurance against temporal variability in hunting returns within households. Here, network properties that facilitate resource flow (network size, quality, and density) are examined in a country food sharing network comprising 109 Inuit households from a village in Nunavik (Canada), using regressions to investigate the relationships between these network measures and household socioeconomic attributes. The results show that although single women and elders have larger networks, the sharing network is not structured to prioritize sharing towards households with low food availability. Rather, much food sharing appears to be driven by reciprocity between high-harvest households, meaning that poor, low-harvest households tend to have less sharing-based social capital than more affluent, high-harvest households. This suggests that poor, low-harvest households may be more vulnerable to disruptions in the availability of country food."
https://openalex.org/W2793745141,"Methods for representing the meaning of words in vector spaces purely using the information distributed in text corpora have proved to be very valuable in various text mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these methods still disregard the valuable semantic relational structure between words in co-occurring contexts. These beneficial semantic relational structures are contained in manually-created knowledge bases (KBs) such as ontologies and semantic lexicons, where the meanings of words are represented by defining the various relationships that exist among those words. We combine the knowledge in both a corpus and a KB to learn better word embeddings. Specifically, we propose a joint word representation learning method that uses the knowledge in the KBs, and simultaneously predicts the co-occurrences of two words in a corpus context. In particular, we use the corpus to define our objective function subject to the relational constrains derived from the KB. We further utilise the corpus co-occurrence statistics to propose two novel approaches, Nearest Neighbour Expansion (NNE) and Hedged Nearest Neighbour Expansion (HNE), that dynamically expand the KB and therefore derive more constraints that guide the optimisation process. Our experimental results over a wide-range of benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method statistically significantly improves the accuracy of the word embeddings learnt. It outperforms a corpus-only baseline and reports an improvement of a number of previously proposed methods that incorporate corpora and KBs in both semantic similarity prediction and word analogy detection tasks."

https://openalex.org/W2793896555,"Melatonin is a neurohormone produced in both animals and plants. It binds at least three G-protein-coupled receptors: MT1 and MT2, and Mel1cGPR. Mammalian GPR50 evolved from the reptilian/avian Mel1c and lost its capacity to bind melatonin in all the therian mammal species that have been tested. In order to determine if binding is lost in the oldest surviving mammalian lineage of monotremes we investigated whether the melatonin receptor has the ability to bind melatonin in the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), and evaluated its pharmacological profile. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that platypus has in fact retained the ancestral Mel1c and has the capacity to bind melatonin similar to other mammalian melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2), with an affinity in the 1 nM range. We also investigated the binding of a set of melatoninergic ligands used previously to characterize the molecular pharmacology of the melatonin receptors from sheep, rats, mice, and humans and found that the general profiles of these compounds make Mel1c resemble human MT1 more than MT2.

We examined whether several community measures of wellbeing, and their change since 2012, could be used to understand electoral changes that led to the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election. We found that areas of the US which had the largest shifts away from the incumbent party had both lower wellbeing and greater drops in wellbeing when compared with areas that did not shift. In comparison, changes in income were not related to voting shifts. Well-being may be more useful in predicting and understanding electoral outcomes than some more conventional voting determinants."

Internalized IgG captured by FcRn under acidic endosomal conditions is recycled to the cell surface where exocytosis and a shift to neutral pH promote extracellular IgG release. Although a similar mechanism is proposed for FcRn-mediated albumin intracellular trafficking and recycling, this pathway is less well defined but is relevant to the development of therapeutics exploiting FcRn to extend the half-life of short-lived plasma proteins. Recently, a long-acting recombinant coagulation factor IX–albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) has been approved for the management of hemophilia B. Fusion to albumin potentially enables internalized proteins to engage FcRn and escape lysosomal degradation. In this study, we present for the first time a detailed investigation of the FcRn-mediated recycling of albumin and the albumin fusion protein rIX-FP. We demonstrate that following internalization via FcRn at low pH, rIX-FP, like albumin, is detectable within the early endosome and rapidly (within 10–15 min) traffics into the Rab11+ recycling endosomes, from where it is exported from the cell. Similarly, rIX-FP and albumin taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis at physiological pH traffics into the Rab11+ recycling compartment in FcRn-positive cells but into the lysosomal compartment in FcRn-negative cells. As expected, recombinant factor IX (without albumin fusion) and an FcRn interaction–defective albumin variant localized to the lysosomal compartments of both FcRn-expressing and nonexpressing cells.

The FcRn-IgG complex, supported by the acidic conditions of the early endosome, is sorted into common recycling endosomes that divert cargo away from lysosomes.

It is widely assumed that an equivalent pathway exists for FcRn-mediated salvage of albumin, although to date, there has been a lack of imaging studies that have directly demonstrated the intracellular transport and recycling of internalized albumin. Importantly, there appear to be differences in the relative contribution of different cell types to FcRn-mediated IgG and albumin homeostasis.

Hemophilia B is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by gene mutations within the X-linked gene encoding coagulation factor (F)IX and affecting ∼1:30,000 males. Until recently, the standard therapy for patients involves replacement therapy using recombinant FIX (rFIX) or plasma-derived FIX, with patients suffering from more severe symptoms requiring prophylactic administration of FIX concentrates to prevent spontaneous bleeding. However, as a result of the short serum half-life of traditional FIX treatments (∼18 h in humans) (22White 2nd, G.C. Beebe A. Nielsen B. Recombinant factor IX.Thromb.

To reduce the frequency of dosing, a recombinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin, rIX-FP, was developed and is now licensed for use in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan. rIX-FP is produced as a single protein with a cleavable linker between FIX and albumin. The short linker peptide, derived from an endogenous activation peptide in native FIX, enables in vivo cleavage of activated FIX from the albumin moiety by FXIa when required for coagulation (25Metzner H.J.

Most recently, a 4–5-fold half-life extension was demonstrated in phase III studies in patients with severe hemophilia B, translating to a once every 14 days dosing regime (31Santagostino E.

Previous biosensor analysis has shown that the albumin moiety of rIX-FP supports interaction with FcRn under acidic conditions. 4H. Braley, V. Tomasetig, S. Zollner, G. Dickneite, S. Schulte, S. Dower, and D. Hartman, poster presented at the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) World Congress, Paris, France (July 8–12, 2012). Furthermore, the half-life extension of rIX-FP in vivo recently observed in clinical trials is consistent with FcRn-mediated recycling. However, the proposed cellular mechanism of half-life extension has not been directly demonstrated. In this study, we have established in vitro cellular systems to investigate the interaction of rIX-FP (and other albumin- or Fc-fusion proteins) with FcRn and the recycling through the FcRn-mediated salvage system. Our results demonstrate that FcRn engages with rIX-FP at acidic pH, diverting it from the lysosomal degradation pathway into the recycling endosomes for transport out of the cell. These data provide strong support for the contribution of the FcRn salvage pathway to the prolonged half-life of the FIX–albumin fusion in vivo and provide a cell system to rapidly analyze a range of albumin fusion proteins for their recycling efficiency. To investigate the interactions of albumin- and Fc-fusion proteins with FcRn, we generated a stable cell line expressing human FcRn and β2 microglobulin using FreeStyleTM 293-F cells (henceforth, denoted by 293-F FcRn+). As shown in Fig. 1A, FcRn protein expression was validated by Western blotting and flow cytometric analysis. To verify the functionality of the cell-surface–expressed FcRn and the pH dependence of ligand engagement, IgG and albumin interaction with viable 293-F FcRn+ cells and the control parental line, 293-F, was examined over a pH range by flow cytometry. Specific binding of IgG and albumin to 293-F FcRn+ cells was minimal at neutral pH, but was readily detectable under mildly acidic conditions (pH 6), and was further enhanced at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1B); findings consistent with the pH-dependent interaction of ligands with FcRn. Next, we compared the binding of rIX-FP and rFIX to cell-surface–expressed FcRn (Fig. 1C). Whereas specific interaction of rFIX to 293-F FcRn+ cells was not evident, binding of rIX-FP was detectable at pH 6 and further enhanced at pH 5.5. Hence, these results demonstrate that this albumin fusion, rIX-FP, has similar pH dependence for receptor binding to cells as unmodified albumin. Based on these results, pH 5.5 was selected for cell-based FcRn-binding studies. To further examine the interaction of albumin and rIX-FP with cellular FcRn, we adapted a competition based inhibition assay from Mathur et al. (33Mathur A. Arora T. Liu L. Crouse-Zeineddini J. Mukku V. Qualification of a homogeneous cell-based neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding assay and its application to studies on Fc functionality of IgG-based therapeutics.J. Immunol. Methods. 2013; 390 (23384837): 81-9110.1016/j.jim.2013.01.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), originally developed to evaluate the binding of IgG-based therapeutics for FcRn. In our assay, test molecules containing albumin compete with fluorescently labeled albumin (albumin-AF488) for binding to cell-surface–expressed FcRn at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1D), and the relative binding affinity to cell-surface–expressed FcRn is inferred by the individual Ki values of the molecules. As shown in Fig. 1E, rIX-FP (Ki of 193 ± 36 nm) binds to cell-surface–expressed FcRn with a stronger apparent affinity than albumin (Ki of 879 ± 136 nm). Previous biosensor analyses using soluble FcRn have also derived a higher affinity for rIX-FP,4 although the difference between rIX-FP and albumin was only 2-fold (∼5 and 10 μm for rIX-FP and albumin, respectively, at pH 6). When examining ligand interaction with cell surface FcRn, however, it is possible that additional electrostatic or Gla domain–phospholipid interactions may occur, mediated by the FIX component of rIX-FP, thereby creating some binding avidity in the bifunctional fusion protein that may lower the Kd (34Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Lipid-protein interactions in blood coagulation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376 (9805008): 433-45310.1016/S0304-4157(98)00018-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these interactions are presumably too weak to be detectable for native FIX alone. Having demonstrated the interaction between FcRn and the albumin/Fc-containing cargo on 293-F FcRn+ cells, we sought to determine whether receptor-bound cargo could then be internalized and recycled via the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway. To track the movement of internalized proteins through the intracellular recycling and/or degradation pathways in 293-F FcRn+ cells, we assessed a number of different antibodies raised against specific endosomal compartments that were suitable for paraformaldehyde-fixed samples. We selected a panel of three antibodies for co-localization experiments: anti-EEA1, anti-Rab11, and anti-CD63 as markers for the early endosomes, recycling endosomes, and late endosomes/lysosomes, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, co-staining cells with EEA1 (Fig. 2A) and CD63 (Fig. 2B) revealed minimal co-localization with Rab11. Although EEA1 and CD63 antibodies have been used previously for identifying endosomal compartments in human cells, this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that a Rab11 antibody has been used to detect endogenous Rab11 in recycling endosomes as a marker for the FcRn-mediated recycling of cargo. Other publications have, however, used fluorescently tagged Rab11 constructs transfected into their cell line of interest (35Ward E.S. Martinez C. Vaccaro C. Zhou J. Tang Q. Ober R.J. From sorting endosomes to exocytosis: association of Rab4 and Rab11 GTPases with the Fc receptor, FcRn, during recycling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 (15689494): 2028-203810.1091/mbc.E04-08-0735Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the Rab11 antibody and validate its use in 293-F FcRn+ cells, we performed a knockdown experiment using siRNA against Rab11. Cells that were transfected with Rab11-specific siRNA resulted in almost complete loss of antigen detection by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C), confirming antibody specificity. To confirm whether 293-F FcRn+ cells are functionally capable of mediating intracellular trafficking and recycling, we examined IgG and transferrin, because the movement of these proteins via the Rab11 compartment through engagement with FcRn and transferrin receptors respectively is well documented. As shown in Fig. 2D, following internalization (10–15 min at pH 5.5 for IgG or pH 7 for transferrin) and a 10-min chase, both IgG and transferrin were shown to co-localize with Rab11+ recycling endosomes in 293-F FcRn+ cells, kinetics consistent with the trafficking of cargo from the cell surface to the recycling endosomes via the early endosomes. To evaluate the intracellular trafficking of albumin, 293-F FcRn+ cells were pulsed with AF488-labeled albumin at pH 5.5, for 10 min to allow the internalization of cargo via the surface FcRn receptor (minimal internalization by parental 293-F cells was observed under these conditions). Excess cargo was then removed and replaced with complete growth media (pH 7) for various chase periods. The cells were then fixed and stained for the organelle markers EEA1, Rab11, and CD63 (Fig. 3). At the earliest time point (10-min pulse, 0-min chase), albumin was readily detectable within early endosomes (Fig. 3, A, top row, and D), decreasing thereafter. After a 5-min chase, the presence of cargo in the recycling endosome was clearly evident (Fig. 3, B, second row, and D). This was also observed at the 20-min chase period (Fig. 3, B, third row, and D), although the overall signal for albumin was markedly reduced, presumably because much had already been exported from the cells by this time (Fig. 3E). Co-localization at this later time point was observed as orange (rather than yellow/pale green) because of the dominance of the Rab11 signal (in red) over the faint albumin signal (in green) and is highlighted with arrows for individual and combined channels. By the 45-min chase, only traces of cargo were evident, consistent with observations for IgG (data not shown). Throughout the time course, minimal albumin was detected within the CD63+ lysosomal compartment (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that albumin is efficiently internalized and directed via the Rab11+ recycling endosomes in human cells expressing FcRn, similar to previous reports for IgG (12Ward E.S.

Next, 293-F FcRn+ cells were used to determine whether rIX-FP has the potential to be recycled via the FcRn pathway. As above for albumin, 293-F FcRn+ cells were pulsed with AF488-labeled rIX-FP at pH 5.5 for 10 min, and the transport of rIX-FP through intracellular organelles were examined after a series of chase intervals (Fig. 4). After the pulse (10-min pulse, 0-min chase), and as observed for albumin, rIX-FP was readily detected within the early endosome (Fig. 4, A, top row, and D). After a 5-min chase and from then on, rIX-FP was detected in the recycling endosome (Fig. 4, B, second and third rows, and D). As for albumin, after a 20-min chase, the amount of AF488-labeled rIX-FP cargo detected was markedly reduced (Fig. 4E and Fig. S1; arrows highlight regions of co-localization with Rab11+ endosome) and by 45 min was virtually undetectable (data not shown). Throughout the time course, rIX-FP was largely excluded from CD63+ lysosomal compartments (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting minimal degradation. We also examined the co-trafficking of albumin and rIX-FP, where cells were simultaneously pulsed with differentially labeled cargoes at acidic pH (Fig. 5). Following FcRn-mediated uptake, the itinerary and kinetics of intracellular transport of AF594-labeled albumin and AF488-labeled rIX-FP were very similar, and a high degree of co-localization of the two molecules was observed. Although the internalization of albumin and IgG via FcRn at acidic pH may occur in some physiological settings, fluid-phase endocytosis, such as pinocytosis or macropinocytosis, is likely to have a greater role in internalization of these proteins in vivo from which subsequent rescue by FcRn may occur (36Ward E.S.

To examine the cellular transport of albumin ligands under physiological conditions, cell monolayers were incubated with albumin at neutral pH for prolonged periods. Internalization of cargo was observed in both parental 293-F and 293-F FcRn+ cells, although the amount of cargo detected in the parental cells was notably higher (Fig. 6A; ∼3-fold increased levels of albumin in 293-F cells than 293-F FcRn+ cells). This is consistent with an absence of recycling in cells not expressing FcRn, where accumulation within the CD63+ compartments (where degradation occurs more slowly) was clearly evident (Fig. 6A, top row). In contrast, in 293-F FcRn+ cells, albumin was detected mainly in Rab11+ recycling endosomes with a weaker signal, presumably resulting from constant export from the cell and an absence of accumulation within the lysosomal compartment (Fig. 6A, bottom row).

https://openalex.org/W2790231851,"The Sexual Excitation Sexual/Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M) and the Sexual Excitation Scales/Sexual Inhibition Scales short form (SIS/SES-SF) are two self-report questionnaires for assessing sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI). According to the dual control model of sexual response, SE and SI differ between individuals and influence the occurrence of sexual arousal in given situations. Extreme levels of SE and SI are postulated to be associated with sexual difficulties or risky sexual behaviors. The present study was designed to assess the psychometric properties of the German versions of both questionnaires utilizing a large population-based sample of 2,708 participants (Mage = 51.19, SD = 14.03). Overall, psychometric evaluation of the two instruments yielded good convergent and discriminant validity and mediocre to good internal consistency. The original 30-item version of the SESII-W/M did not show a sufficient model fit. For a 24-item version of the SESII-W/M partial strong measurement invariance across gender, and strong measurement invariance across relationship status, age, and educational levels were established. The original structure (14 items, 3 factors) of the SIS/SES-SF was not replicated. However, a 4-factor model including 13 items showed a good model fit and strong measurement invariance across the before-mentioned participant groups. For both questionnaires, partial strong measurement invariance with the original American versions of the scales was found. As some factors showed unsatisfactory internal consistency and the factor structure of the original scales could not be replicated, scores on several SE- and SI-factors should be interpreted with caution. However, most analyses indicated sufficient psychometric quality of the German SESII-W/M and SIS/SES-SF and their use can be recommended in German-speaking samples. More research with diverse samples (i.e., different sexual orientations, individuals with sexual difficulties) is needed to ensure the replicability of the factor solutions presented in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2791521637,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is an integral component of proliferative signaling. EGFRs on the cell surface become activated upon EGF binding and have an increased rate of endocytosis. Once in the cytoplasm, the EGF·EGFR complex is trafficked to the lysosome for degradation, and signaling is terminated. During trafficking, the EGFR kinase domain remains active, and the internalized EGFR can continue signaling to downstream effectors. Although effector activity varies based on the EGFR's endocytic location, it is not clear how this occurs. In an effort to identify proteins that uniquely associate with the internalized, liganded EGFR in the early endosome, we developed an early endosome isolation strategy to analyze their protein composition. Post-nuclear supernatant from HeLa cells stimulated with and without EGF were separated on an isotonic 17% Percoll gradient. The gradient was fractionated, and early endosomal fractions were pooled and immunoisolated with an EEA1 mAb. The isolated endosomes were validated by immunoblot using antibodies against organelle-specific marker proteins and transmission EM. These early endosomes were also subjected to LC-MS/MS for proteomic analysis. Five proteins were detected in endosomes in a ligand-dependent manner: EGFR, RUFY1, STOML2, PTPN23, and CCDC51. Knockdown of RUFY1 or PTPN23 by RNAi indicated that both proteins play a role in EGFR trafficking. These experiments indicate that endocytic trafficking of activated EGFR changes the protein composition, membrane trafficking, and signaling potential of the early endosome."

In this study, we searched a focused chemical library for small-molecule Hes1 inhibitors that competitively block TLE1 binding to Hes1. Extensive structural optimization of a hit molecule led to the discovery of JI051, which reverted Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression and interfered with cell proliferation. In a surprising twist, JI051 did not bind to TLE1 but instead interacted with an unexpected player, PHB2. Because the WRPW Hes1–TLE1 interaction domain is composed of two tryptophan residues each comprising a side-chain indole (17Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. The WRPW motif of the hairy-related basic helix-loop-helix repressor proteins acts as a 4-amino-acid transcription repression and protein–protein interaction domain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 (8649374): 2670-267710.1128/MCB.16.6.2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we searched a chemical library enriched with indole-like π-electron–rich pharmacophores for a small molecule that would mimic the protein–protein interface to block Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression. A total of 1,800 compounds were screened with a luciferase reporter assay to study the activity of the Hes1 promoter (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. S1A, exogenous Hes1 expression decreased the expression of the reporter gene to 56.5 ± 4.1% compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (control), due to negative feedback regulation on the Hes1 promoter. The ability of each small molecule to revert the Hes1-mediated luciferase gene repression was reported as an increase in the luminescence signal compared with cells treated with DMSO. Of the compounds tested, 17 increased the level of luciferase expression to more than 80% of control levels. As benzothiazoles, benzimidazoles, and benzoxazoles have been previously reported to act as firefly luciferase stabilizers (18Georgia S. Soliz R. Li M. Zhang P. Bhushan A. P57 and Hes 1 coordinate cell cycle exit with self-renewal of pancreatic progenitors.Dev.

Of the compounds that initially passed the screening with the luciferase reporter gene, three of them (D8C, L4F, and T10E) produced a fluorescence signal 3-fold higher compared with DMSO in cells overexpressing Hes1 (Fig. S1B). Among these validated compounds, D8C, an indolylacrylamide molecule, induced the most significant response, with a 5.2-fold increase in fluorescence signal. Based on these results, D8C was chosen as the lead compound for further analysis. Fig. 1, B and C, highlights the effects of the validated compound on Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression on luciferase and the EGFPd2 reporter gene, respectively. Hes1 is essential for cell proliferation as progenitor cells with inactivated Hes1 choose to exit the cell cycle (19Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S.

To examine whether D8C influences cell growth, a colorimetric cell proliferation assay was carried out using the tetrazolium salt WST-8. As shown in Fig. 2A, D8C decreased the cell proliferation to 69.9 ± 2.4% of the levels observed in cells treated with DMSO after an incubation period of 24 h. The inhibition of cell growth was time-dependent and reached a plateau after 72 h (37.8 ± 1.3% compared with DMSO). To improve the potency of D8C, we synthesized a series of 130 compounds derived from its chemical structure, including modifications of the ethoxyphenetyl, amide, alkene, and indole moieties (Table S1 and supporting Chemical Synthesis). Structure–activity relationship studies revealed that the ethoxy group needs to be located in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring, as the meta- and para-positions resulted in a significant loss of activity. Introduction of longer alkyl groups or substitution with halogen atoms also resulted in a loss of activity. Other modifications around the amide bond were not tolerated for activity, and deletion of the double bond or the indole ring resulted in activity loss. In contrast, modifications including the introduction of a methoxy group (JI051) or a methyl group (JI021) at position 7 of the indole ring resulted in improved EC50 values compared with D8C (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the decrease in proliferation could be attributed to cell-cycle arrest, HEK293 cells were transfected with the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicators (Fucci) (20Choi H.J. Fukui M. Zhu B.T. Role of cyclin B1/Cdc2 up-regulation in the development of mitotic prometaphase arrest in human breast cancer cells treated with nocodazole.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21918689): e2431210.1371/journal.pone.0024312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These probes exploit the cell cycle-dependent proteolysis of Cdt1 and geminin by E3 ligases, enabling the visualization of G1 and G2/M phases in red and green, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with JI051 induced a dose-dependent increase in the geminin/Cdt1 fluorescence ratio, suggesting an increase in the cell population in G2/M. A similar increase was also observed with the microtubule-depolarizing agent nocodazole, which is known to arrest cell cycle progression in G2/M (21Thorne N. Inglese J. Auld D.S. Illuminating insights into firefly luciferase and other bioluminescent reporters used in chemical biology.Chem. Biol. 2010; 17 (20609414): 646-65710.1016/j.chembiol.2010.05.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As the Fucci probes do not enable the distinction between G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, we examined the effect of JI051 on chromatin condensation to evaluate the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis. As shown in Fig. 3B, the proportion of cells with visible chromosomes increased from 3.6 to 37.9% following treatment with JI051. Fluorescence microscopy analysis also showed incomplete chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, suggesting that the cells are blocked in mitotic prometaphase. To confirm whether the JI051 effect on cell proliferation is mediated through Hes1, we carried out a series of experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from Hes1–KO mice (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 2C, Hes1 gene depletion induced a 40.1 ± 8.6% decrease in cell growth as compared with control cells. This reduction was equivalent to that observed in control cells treated with JI051 (35.2 ± 6.5%). However, incubation with JI051 did not further reduce cell growth (42.2 ± 2.7%) in Hes1 KO cells, suggesting that Hes1 is required for the JI051 response. We also tested the effect of Hes1 overexpression on G2/M cell-cycle arrest. For this experiment, HEK293 cells were transfected with the Fucci probes together with increasing amounts of pC1–Hes1 cDNA. As shown in Fig. S3, overexpression of Hes1 blocked JI051-mediated G2/M cell-cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, reaching levels similar to those observed in the absence of the compound. Taken together, these results indicate that JI051 mediates cell-cycle arrest by interfering with Hes1 function. As our initial strategy was to mimic the WRPW motif of Hes1 for blocking Hes1–TLE1 interaction, we attempted to determine whether JI051 interacts with TLE1. For this purpose, we synthesized a JI051 photoreactive probe (JITV10) equipped with a diazirine group for covalent binding upon UV irradiation, and a biotin moiety for pulldown with NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Fig. S4A). Although TLE1 was efficiently pulled down in HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG–TLE1, a 5-fold excess of JI051 failed to compete with JITV10 and comparable labeling was obtained with JIN04 (a negative control lacking JI051 moiety), showing that TLE1 labeling is not specific for JI051 (Fig. S4B). To identify the true protein target for JI051, we carried out immunomagnetic isolation of target protein(s) with streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads for optimal washing efficiency. We also used a biotinylated version of JI051 (JITV14) without the diazirine moiety to reduce nonspecific binding. Analysis of bound proteins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) showed a distinct band pattern for JITV14 compared with JIN05 (negative control without the JI051 moiety). The protein bands that were efficiently displaced by a 10-fold excess of JI130 (a JI051 derivative with improved solubility; Table S1) were isolated and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by nanoscale LC/tandem MS (nano LC-MS/MS). MS/MS ion search (22Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20 (10.1002/(SICI)1522-2683(19991201)20:18%3C3551::AID-ELPS3551%3E3.0.CO%3B2–2, 10612281): 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar) identified three potential targets: Prohibitin 2 (PHB2); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; and β-actin. Because the last two proteins represent nonspecific abundant proteins frequently occurring during target identification, we therefore focused on PHB2, a cancer-related protein chaperone, which showed 12 matching peptides covering 51% of the entire protein sequence (Fig. S5). We then performed a series of pulldown studies in HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG–PHB2 to confirm that PHB2 is a target for JI051. Western blotting revealed that PHB2 was photoreacted and pulled down with JITV10, but not with JIN04 (negative control without the JI051 moiety), and displaced with a 2.5-fold excess of JI051 (bound fraction, Fig. 4B). To determine whether JITV10 binds directly to PHB2 or needs additional proteins found in cell lysates, a series of photoaffinity studies with human recombinant PHB2 protein was carried out, using streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for detection. As shown in Fig. S6A, HRP–streptavidin labeling confirmed the biotinylation of PHB2 following incubation with 25 μm JITV10, suggesting that JITV10 binds directly to PHB2. The signal was displaced with increasing amounts of JI051, and UV irradiation was required for JITV10/PHB2 cross-linking. Analysis of PHB2 recombinant protein incubated with JITV10 also revealed a dose-dependent biotinylation of PHB2 with a KD of 3.7 μm (Fig. S6B and Fig. 4C), indicating that JITV10 binds directly to PHB2. In addition, labeling of JITV10 with a streptavidin–Alexa 568 conjugate displayed a substantial overlap with PHB2 immunostaining in HEK293 cells (Fig. S7). Taken together, these results suggest that PHB2 is a bona fide target for JI051. We next carried out a series of siRNA experiments to determine whether PHB2 is important for JI051 response. PHB2 siRNAs decreased PHB2 protein levels by at least 50% (Fig. S8A) and induced a substantial decrease in cell proliferation compared with cells treated with scrambled (control) siRNAs (77.4 ± 4.7% and 26.6 ± 0.6%, respectively; Fig. S8, B and C). This reduction in cell growth is consistent with previous studies in PHB2-depleted cells (23Merkwirth C. Dargazanli S. Tatsuta T. Geimer S. Löwer B. Wunderlich F.T. von Kleist-Retzow J.C. Waisman A. Westermann B. Langer T. Prohibitins control cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating OPA1-dependent cristae morphogenesis in mitochondria.Gene Dev. 2008; 22 (18281461): 476-48810.1101/gad.460708Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 24Von Hoff D.D.

Bahary N. et al.Increased survival in pancreatic cancer with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369 (24131140): 1691-170310.1056/NEJMoa1304369Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar). However, condensed chromatin was not observed in cells treated with PHB2 siRNAs alone (Fig. S8, D and E), suggesting that PHB2-depleted cells are not arrested in mitosis. Next, we investigated the effect of PHB2 knockdown on JI051 response. As shown in Fig. S9, JI051-induced condensed chromatin was significantly reduced in cells treated with PHB2 siRNAs as compared with control siRNAs (10.3 ± 3.2 and 27.4%± 6.5%, respectively), indicating that PHB2 is critical for JI051 response. We then tested the possibility that PHB2 regulates Hes1 signaling by direct interaction through a series of coimmunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cell lysates. Western blotting with a Hes1 antibody revealed that Hes1 is specifically coimmunoprecipitated with PHB2 (Fig. 5A) in cells transfected with FLAG–PHB2 and Hes1, suggesting that the two proteins interact with each other. The amount of Hes1 coimmunoprecipitated with PHB2 strongly increased upon incubation with JI051, reaching saturation around 1 μm. These results not only indicate that Hes1 interacts directly with PHB2 but also suggest that JI051 serves as a stabilizer for the Hes1–PHB2 interaction. To determine whether the compound increases the colocalization of Hes1 and PHB2 in intact cells, double immunostaining was carried out in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment with 1 μm JI051 for 24 h induced a 3-fold increase in Pearson's correlation coefficient, indicating that the compound enhances spatial overlap between Hes1 and PHB2. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that colocalization was mainly found in the cytoplasm. Also, cells without Hes1 nuclear labeling were observed, suggesting that Hes1 nuclear trafficking may be disrupted. As Notch signaling pathway appears to be activated in human pancreatic cancer, we tested the effects of our Hes1 inhibitors on a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line. As shown in Fig. 6A and Fig. S10A, treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells with JI051 and JI130 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in cell growth as compared with cells treated with DMSO. Dose-response studies revealed an EC50 of 49 nm for JI130, comparable with 59 nm for the pyrimidine antimetabolite gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug recommended as a first-line treatment in pancreatic cancer in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Fig. 6B) (25Mc Gee M.M. Targeting the mitotic catastrophe signaling pathway in cancer.Mediators Inflamm. 2015; 2015 (26491220): 146282Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fluorescence imaging following staining with Hoechst 33342 not only indicated the presence of condensed chromatin (Fig. 6C) but also revealed additional morphological alterations such as micronucleation and multinucleation. These features are prominent characteristics of mitotic catastrophe, a mechanism of delayed cell death resulting from aberrant mitosis (26Peyroche A. Antonny B. Robineau S. Acker J. Cherfils J. Jackson C.L. Brefeldin A acts to stabilize an abortive ARF-GDP-Sec7 domain protein complex: involvement of specific residues of the Sec7 domain.Mol.

In addition to MIA PaCa-2 cells, JI130 was able to suppress cell growth in several pancreatic cancer cell lines, including CFPAC-1, PK9, and KP4-1 (Fig. S10B). Finally, we tested the effects of JI130 on tumor growth in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model created with implanted MIA PaCa-2 cells. Mice were treated according to the protocol detailed in Fig. 7A. As shown in Fig. 7B, treatment with JI130 induced a gradual decrease in the tumor volume compared with DMSO, reaching a 48.2% reduction after 21 days. A decrease in tumor weight was also observed after treatment with JI130 (Fig. 7, C and D) without any noticeable change in body weight (Fig. 7E). To examine whether our Hes1 inhibitor also induced cell-cycle arrest in vivo, immunohistochemical staining on MIA PaCa-2 xenograft tumors with the proliferation marker Ki-67 was carried out. As shown in Fig. S11, treatment with JI130 induced a significant reduction in the proportion of Ki-67 positive cells compared with DMSO (26.8 ± 3.3 and 51.2 ± 4.5%, respectively), suggesting that our Hes1 inhibitor is decreasing tumor volume/weight by interfering with cell proliferation. This study reports the discovery of a novel Hes1 inhibitor that highlights PHB2 as a new player in Hes1 signaling. Most importantly, our results indicate that JI051 stabilizes the interaction between Hes1 and PHB2 and induces cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting the Notch downstream effector gene Hes1. Few small molecules that act as protein–protein interaction stabilizers have been reported in the literature (27Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G.

However, vaccine uptake varies widely across countries and falls short of levels needed to achieve population immunity. We highlight policy measures that would help ensure greater worldwide coverage and save lives. Evidence of the safety and protective benefits of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccines as an anti-cancer measure is overwhelming. However, vaccine uptake varies widely across countries and falls short of levels needed to achieve population immunity. We highlight policy measures that would help ensure greater worldwide coverage and save lives. Childhood immunization programs prevent up to three million deaths globally per year, but that number could be increased by a further 1.5 million if optimal vaccination coverage could be achieved. Despite efforts through The Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by Ministers of Health from 194 countries in May 2017, the World Health Organization's goals to improve immunization coverage worldwide continue to face considerable challenges. There is overwhelming evidence that human papillomaviruses (HPV) are responsible for diverse preventable cancers, accounting for 4.5% of all new cancers occurring worldwide (de Martel et al., 2017de Martel C. Plummer M. Vignat J. Franceschi S. Worldwide burden of cancer attributable to HPV by site, country and HPV type.Int. J. Cancer. 2017; 141: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Extensive clinical testing and post-market experience have shown that HPV vaccines deliver safe and durable protection against these tumorigenic viruses (Huh et al., 2017Huh W.K. Joura E.A. Giuliano A.R. Iversen O.E. de Andrade R.P. Ault K.A. Bartholomew D. Cestero R.M. Fedrizzi E.N. Hirschberg A.L. et al.Final efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety analyses of a nine-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in women aged 16-26 years: a randomised, double-blind trial.Lancet. 2017; 390: 2143-2159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, despite compelling objective evidence of benefit, vaccination rates and policies differ markedly in different countries consequent to apparent happenstance. In this article, we focus on strategies that should further promote wider protective HPV immunization. Anogenital human papillomaviruses are among the most common sexually transmitted infections, with tens of millions of new cases per year globally. The majority of infections are eliminated by the host immune system within 2–3 years. However, HPV infections that evade the immune response and promote proliferation of mucoepithelial tissues can have serious long-term health consequences. Of the more than 170 genotypes identified to date, types 16 and 18 are associated with the majority of HPV-related tumors, which include cervical, vulvar, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal tumors, as well as precancerous and dysplastic lesions. Of these, cervical cancer represents the greatest global health burden, as it is the fourth most common cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer mortality in the developing world (over a quarter of a million deaths per annum, Figure 1 and http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/cervix-new.asp). The link between viral infection and urogenital/oropharyngeal cancer was first identified nearly a half century ago, but effective preventative measures have only been available since the introduction of the first prophylactic vaccines against HPV. Akin to the implementation of worldwide neonatal hepatitis B vaccination, HPV vaccination should be viewed primarily as an anti-cancer measure, and one that will pay the largest health dividends in one of the world’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations: women in the Global South. Since 2006, Gardasil, the first approved HPV vaccine, has offered protection against both HPV-16 and -18, reducing the risk of HPV-related neoplasms by 60%–70% on completion of a course of two or three vaccine doses. Gardasil additionally confers immunogenicity against HPV serotypes 6 and 11, which are causative of anogenital warts and associated with a persistent airway infection known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Subsequently approved HPV vaccines provide either narrower (Cervarix) or broader (Gardasil 9) spectrums of coverage against HPV serotypes, although each are similarly effective against the serotypes most commonly associated with cancers. Gardasil 9, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014, protects against nine of the most pathogenic strains, accounting for approximately 90% of all cervical cancer cases, and is likely to become the preferred vaccine in many countries. A massive body of evidence supports the safety of HPV vaccines. All such vaccines are made using viral structural proteins produced using recombinant techniques. The vaccines comprise purified L1 capsid protein of the relevant papillomavirus genotypes, together with standard vaccine adjuvants of proven safety. No viral genes that enable papillomavirus reproduction or cell transformation are incorporated in the manufacturing process. In a study of nearly one million vaccine recipients, researchers in Denmark and Sweden found no association between immunization with quadrivalent HPV vaccine and autoimmune, neurological, or thromboembolic adverse reactions (Arnheim-Dahlström et al., 2013Arnheim-Dahlström L. Pasternak B. Svanström H. Sparén P. Hviid A. Autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic adverse events after immunisation of adolescent girls with quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Denmark and Sweden: cohort study.BMJ. 2013; 347: f5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A UK study of more than 10 million girls vaccinated against HPV likewise found no increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (Andrews et al., 2017Andrews N. Stowe J. Miller E. No increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome after human papilloma virus vaccine: A self-controlled case-series study in England.Vaccine. 2017; 35: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which had anecdotally been reported as a possible adverse effect in other countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 270 million doses of HPV vaccines have been delivered since the approval of Gardasil in 2006. With the exception of transient syncope, a common anxiety-related side effect of many vaccines, and rare cases of anaphylaxis, the WHO vaccine safety committee found no association of HPV vaccination with serious adverse events (http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/hpv/June_2017/en/). The uptake of HPV vaccines has varied dramatically across countries and regions. The reasons for this are complex, and span both biological and social considerations. The mode of transmission (mainly through intimate contact), age of vaccine administration (adolescence), the time lag between infection and cancer onset (often decades), and the gender distribution of HPV-associated cancers (primarily female) all distinguish HPV vaccines from more familiar pediatric vaccines that protect against casually-transmitted childhood infectious diseases. Cultural factors also affect public sentiment surrounding HPV vaccines. These range from sensationalist coverage of suspected adverse incidents in public and social media, to questions of cost and access, to suspicions of pharmaceutical company motives, to religious or moral concerns over vaccination of juveniles as they near the age of sexual maturity. Questions of balancing individual autonomy against collective benefit have prompted philosophical and ethical debates, many of which have focused on the question of whether anti-HPV programs, like many other immunization efforts, should include a vaccination mandate (Colgrove, 2006Colgrove J. The ethics and politics of compulsory HPV vaccination.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 2389-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additionally, debates have concerned whether, and under what conditions, people objecting to vaccines should be permitted to opt out. The latter question is of particular relevance in the United States, where state laws allowing religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccines are common. Local and national governments have shown highly variable responses to the challenges of public education and trust-building. The result has been tremendous variability in HPV vaccine uptake even in countries at similar levels of economic development. Globally, full-course vaccination rates for young women in developed economies stand at around one in three (Bruni et al., 2016Bruni L. Diaz M. Barrionuevo-Rosas L. Herrero R. Bray F. Bosch F.X. de Sanjosé S. Castellsagué X. Global estimates of human papillomavirus vaccination coverage by region and income level: a pooled analysis.Lancet Glob. Health. 2016; 4: e453-e463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Through the enactment of “no-jab, no-pay” and “no-jab, no-play” laws, which make vaccination a prerequisite for school registration, payment of childcare benefits, and other public benefits, Australia has achieved more than 70% coverage for all mandated pediatric vaccines among school-age children. The success of such programs may be instructive for measures intended to raise HPV vaccine coverage. In the UK, where their National Health Service covers HPV vaccines, more than 88% of 12- to 13-year-old females have completed the vaccination course. Yet in the United States, where the first HPV vaccine was introduced, over half of eligible teens have not completed the recommended vaccination series, although there have been gradual improvements. In some parts of the USA, coverage remains below 15%, influenced by factors including urban residence, poverty, ethnicity, insurance, completion rates, and state-based policies. Similarly, the European Union shows highly variable coverage among its member states, with the highest rates in Northern Europe, but much lower coverage in several other regions, leaving less than 40% of the target population in EU covered by a full HPV vaccination course (Bruni et al., 2016Bruni L. Diaz M. Barrionuevo-Rosas L. Herrero R. Bray F. Bosch F.X. de Sanjosé S. Castellsagué X. Global estimates of human papillomavirus vaccination coverage by region and income level: a pooled analysis.Lancet Glob. Health. 2016; 4: e453-e463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare flinched after unverified media reports of vaccine side effects including motor and cognitive disorders, withdrawing its active recommendation for HPV vaccination in 2013, which led to the withdrawal of the vaccines from the national health insurance scheme. This led to a dramatic loss of public confidence, resulting in plummeting vaccination rates from around 70% to just 0.6% of the target population (Hanley et al., 2015Hanley S.J. Yoshioka E. Ito Y. Kishi R. HPV vaccination crisis in Japan.Lancet. 2015; 385: 2571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A 2015 follow-up study of 2,584 reported adverse reactions, among 3.38 million persons vaccinated, identified only 186 cases (<0.006%) that had not spontaneously resolved (Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/kenkou/kekkaku-kansenshou28/chousa/dl/160212_02.pdf). Importantly, no cause-effect relationship linking adverse reactions to the vaccine was established. That notwithstanding, the Ministry’s non-committal stance and the lack of reimbursement remain unchanged, and uptake of HPV vaccination in Japan consequently continues to be extremely low for an advanced economy. The global repercussions of Japan’s equivocation are grave, having provided anti-vaccination groups with what they claim to be evidence of the harms of a safe vaccine (Larson et al., 2014Larson H.J. Wilson R. Hanley S. Parys A. Paterson P. Tracking the global spread of vaccine sentiments: the global response to Japan’s suspension of its HPV vaccine recommendation.Hum. Vaccin. Immunother. 2014; 10: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The safety question is now making its way through the nation’s courts, with more than 100 young women suing both the government and the vaccine manufacturers for compensation over claims of adverse effects, including chronic pain and debility. A second legal case centers on a scientific dispute. A Japanese academic scientist is suing a physician-journalist for defamation over her claims that he misled the public about the safety of the HPV vaccine by reporting that it caused brain damage in mice. The study was called into question when medical journalist, Dr. Riko Muranaka, discovered that it involved only a single mouse each in the active and control groups, and that moreover the slides presented to the media did not even show the brain of the mouse that had received the vaccine. Muranaka was awarded the 2017 John Maddox Prize for her work championing HPV vaccination, a valuable recognition of her courage in taking a stand against vaccine fear-mongering. In developing countries, the situation is, with notable exceptions, even less reassuring. By 2016, only 2.7% of females aged 10–20 years in low and lower-middle income countries had received a full HPV vaccine course (HPV Information Centre http://http://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/XWX.pdf). This is especially concerning given the higher incidence and mortality of HPV-associated cancers in such regions, especially cancer of the cervix. In many countries, the lack of HPV screening options, such as national Pap smear programs, further compounds the cancer risk in adult women. In light of the health burden of HPV-related disease, the WHO has issued a series of recommendations for the introduction of low-cost HPV vaccines in developing countries, paying particular attention to the need for effective messaging and educational strategies for HPV vaccine rollout. The combination of high manufacturing cost relative to other vaccines, communications, and cultural factors has nonetheless left much of the developing world underserved. Similar to Japan, India experienced a challenge to public trust over questions about the deployment of a vaccination program by an international health organization in 2010. The resultant HPV vaccine hesitancy lingers even today, although some progress has been made in broadening coverage in a number of Indian states. The Chinese government has also been very conservative in its review of HPV vaccines, the first of which was only approved in 2017. A public crisis of confidence over the deaths of several infants who had been vaccinated against hepatitis B in 2013 may have contributed to the delay. Notably, as was the case for HPV vaccines in Japan, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration found that the deaths were not caused by the hepatitis B vaccine; however, not before public confidence in vaccines was damaged by widespread misinformation and finger-pointing on social media (Chen et al., 2015Chen B. Zhang J.M. Jiang Z. Shao J. Jiang T. Wang Z. Liu K. Tang S. Gu H. Jiang J. Media and public reactions toward vaccination during the ‘hepatitis B vaccine crisis’ in China.Vaccine. 2015; 33: 1780-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite these substantial challenges, some developing nations have attained high rates of HPV vaccination. The government of Rwanda, working with the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Merck, the maker of Gardasil, succeeded in delivering full-course coverage to 93.3% of girls in primary grade six through a school-based program with no out-of-pocket payment. In Bhutan, a national vaccination program endorsed by that country’s monarch has achieved three-dose coverage rates of > 90% in adolescents (Dorji et al., 2015Dorji T. Tshomo U. Phuntsho S. Tamang T.D. Tshokey T. Baussano I. Franceschi S. Clifford G. Introduction of a National HPV vaccination program into Bhutan.Vaccine. 2015; 33: 3726-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Low- and no-cost programs have been introduced in numerous other developing regions as well, either through direct negotiations with vaccine manufacturers or through private philanthropic efforts. These success stories highlight the key importance of establishing local champions in encouraging HPV vaccination. It has been estimated that around 380,000 cases of cancer could be avoided by 2080 in the 118 million women who were fully vaccinated against HPV worldwide. Countries that succeed in introducing effective HPV vaccination programs deliver lifelong health benefits to individual vaccine recipients and contribute to national health through increases in population immunity. Those that fail to do so risk unnecessarily exposing generations of young women and men to preventable virus-associated cancers and other serious diseases. The outcomes attributable to differences in national health policy stand in stark relief; lessons can be learned from both the successes and failures in safeguarding populations against HPVs, and have clear implications for vaccination programs targeting other microbial and viral infections. Despite the availability of effective prophylaxis against a spectrum of HPV-associated cancers and other diseases, vaccine uptake worldwide remains inadequate. Most ill-health due to HPV falls disproportionately on reproductive-age women in the developing world. This represents a policy challenge, as much as a scientific one. We suggest below a number of measures that should help governments, vaccine providers, and philanthropic organizations establish and maintain public confidence in HPV vaccine safety and efficacy, and in their efforts to reduce the global health burden of HPV-associated disease. A 2016 systematic review of peer reviewed behavioral, informational, and social interventions designed to improve adolescent HPV vaccination rates found that measures designed to increase access and availability are the most effective (Walling et al., 2016Walling E.B. Benzoni N. Dornfeld J. Bhandari R. Sisk B.A. Garbutt J. Colditz G. Interventions to Improve HPV Vaccine Uptake: A Systematic Review.Pediatrics. 2016; 138: e20153863Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). School-based programs have shown particular promise. And it comes as no surprise that reducing the financial burden to recipients translates into higher uptake. However, educational interventions demonstrate relatively minimal effects on sustaining vaccination behavior. Stakeholder groups should thus make coordinated efforts to increase access and availability especially targeting both providers and vaccine recipients. Very high levels of immunization coverage are achievable with low/no cost, school-based programs. In Figure 2 we highlight some policy measures designed to promote widespread uptake of global HPV vaccines. In many developing-world countries no public health programs are currently targeted to adolescents at an appropriate age for HPV vaccine delivery. Consequently the addition of a new program to deliver HPV vaccines would be expensive and logistically challenging. Consideration has therefore been given to adding the HPV vaccine to existing pediatric vaccine programs, but evidence for adequate duration of protection will be required and will take decades to establish. There is good evidence that HPV vaccines given to adolescents provide sufficient duration of protection against infection following two immunizations, and gathering evidence that a single dose may provide up to seven years protection against infection (Safaeian et al., 2018Safaeian M. Sampson J.N. Pan Y. Porras C. Kemp T.J. Herrero R. Quint W. van Doorn L.J. Schussler J. Lowy D.R. et al.Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial (CVT) GroupDurability of Protection Afforded by Fewer Doses of the HPV16/18 Vaccine: The CVT Trial.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2018; 110: 205-212Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As further data accrues, support for, a single dose mass immunization campaign may break the tragic and preventable cycle that links this sexually transmitted infection with cancer. Communication efforts to promote greater HPV vaccine uptake should be focused beyond the simple provision of accurate and understandable information to the families of adolescents in the targeted age group for HPV immunization. It is essential that the perception of these vaccines within local contexts be addressed. The WHO and the US CDC have published recommendations designed to help vaccine stakeholders craft effective messages to enhance uptake. These include continuing education courses for medical providers, public education materials for parents and media, and HPV references to other informational resources. Such materials need to be tailored to many distinct national contexts, which will require coordination and funding support—thereby providing a clear opportunity for health organizations with a developing world focus. Effective counter-messages against misconceptions and misinformation are also needed. The incontrovertible evidence for their safety notwithstanding, HPV vaccine manufacturers and advocates have faced vocal opposition from well-coordinated anti-vaccination groups. Serious conditions incorrectly attributed to HPV immunization include multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and chronic pain (Offit, 2011Offit P.A. Deadly choices: how the anti-vaccine movement threatens us all. Basic Books, New York2011Google Scholar). The lack of evidence to support these claims is frequently attributed to a conspiracy by vaccine makers, government bureaucrats, public health workers, and academics to suppress reports of harm. Some religious groups have further raised concerns that vaccination of young people nearing the age of sexual maturity may somehow lead them to engage in more casual sexual behavior. Such thinking can result in actual harms, not only for children who fail to gain protection against preventable cancers, but on the broader community through reductions in vaccine uptake needed to achieve herd immunity. Clear and accurate messaging about the benefits of HPV immunization is centrally important to countering misinformation and public uncertainty. Parents are apt to be influenced in their decisions by frightening stories of vaccine harm, no matter the source. The effect is amplified by the media-savvy efforts of anti-vaccine groups (which often style themselves misleadingly as “vaccine safety” organizations). In the United States in particular, scare mongering about HPV vaccines has taken hold among a surprising number of film and TV celebrities, who lend further artificial authority to the movement. The damage is not limited to the US, as the internet affords a global megaphone to distort and disseminate such messages based on cultural context. For example, among some African expatriates in the UK, HPV vaccine has come to be viewed not only as risky to health and sexual mores, but also as part of a plot to sterilize young African women (Mupandawana and Cross, 2016Mupandawana E.T. Cross R. Attitudes towards human papillomavirus vaccination among African parents in a city in the north of England: a qualitative study.Reprod. Health. 2016; 13: 97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given the much higher incidence of, and mortality due to, cervical cancer in developing economies, the scare tactics deployed by developed world anti-vaccine organizations are even more pernicious. In such countries, communications efforts must work with trusted health partners at the local level to develop and deploy messages that accurately convey the benefits of vaccination. In the first world, pushing back against the misinformation and doubt spread by opponents of HPV vaccination is also an important, although unfortunately sometimes thankless, mission. Scholars of vaccine history such as Paul Offitt and anonymous science bloggers such as the authors of skepticalraptor.com and respectfulinsolence.com provide an important public service by confronting, contextualizing and debunking false stories about alleged HPV vaccine harm. Research and medical institutions need to do more to encourage these kinds of engagement, especially in contentious areas of public health debate and misunderstanding of science. Human papillomavirus vaccination programs stand poised to eliminate a deadly threat to the health of women and men around the world. We would all do well to shout a little louder about their value. Raising HPV vaccine coverage will require well-coordinated, long-term programs with strong financial and logistic support from both governmental and non-governmental organizations. These will necessarily entail identifying and implementing effective measures on the scientific, clinical, public health and regulatory fronts, with a focus on enhancing greater access and public understanding (Frazer, 2018Frazer I.H. Eradicating HPV-Associated Cancer Through Immunization: A Glass Half Full….Viral Immunol. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To be effective, vaccine programs must be supported by sufficient funding, stable government policies, vocal national champions, adequate infrastructure to enable delivery to school-age children, and educational and informational programs on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. With such measures in place, near-universal immunization at levels needed to confer herd immunity against HPV is an attainable goal. Having served the quest to eradicate avoidable cancers, cervical cancer screening programs may yet become a historical footnote if all women are immunized. The University of Queensland as employer of IHF receives royalties from the sale of papillomavirus vaccines in the developed world."
https://openalex.org/W2794401625,"Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils. The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, ACT (actin) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, GAPDH and helicase gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, ACT and GAPDH were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), GAPDH and βTUB (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and helicase and EF1α (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was ACT and GAPDH. Additionally, the expression pattern of NAC2 (a transcription factor) and BGL2 in different tissues and under different stress conditions was analyzed relative to ACT and GAPDH and UBQ (ubiquitin) the least stably expressed gene. NAC2 and BGL2 both had highest expression in flowers and pods under ABA stress at 48h. This study provides useful reference genes for future gene expression studies in black locust."

In individuals with hematological diseases such as cryoglobulinemia and certain B cell lymphoma forms, the RFs derived from specific heavy- and light-chain germline pairs, so-called “stereotypic RFs,” are frequently produced in copious amounts and form immune complexes with IgG in serum. Of note, many structural details of the antigen recognition mechanisms in RFs are unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the RF YES8c derived from the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 germline pair, the most common of the stereotypic RFs, in complex with human IgG1-Fc at 2.8 Å resolution. We observed that YES8c binds to the CH2–CH3 elbow in the canonical antigen-binding manner involving a large antigen–antibody interface. On the basis of this observation, combined with mutational analyses, we propose a recognition mechanism common to IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs: (1) the interaction of the Leu432–His435 region of Fc enables the highly variable complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3 to participate in the binding, (2) the hydrophobic tip in the CDR-H2 typical of IGHV1-69 antibodies recognizes the hydrophobic patch on Fc, and (3) the interaction of the highly conserved RF light chain with Fc is important for RF activity. These features may determine the putative epitope common to the IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20 RFs. We also showed that some mutations in the binding site of RF increase the affinity to Fc, which may aggravate hematological diseases. Our findings unravel the structural basis for germline-encoded antibody autoreactivity. Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies against the fragment-crystallizable (Fc) region of IgG.

https://openalex.org/W2793668821,"The objective of this study was to characterize the proteome of the corneal endothelial cell layer and its basement membrane (Descemet membrane) in humans with various severities of type II diabetes mellitus compared to controls, and identify differentially expressed proteins across a range of diabetic disease severities that may influence corneal endothelial cell health. Endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissues were peeled from transplant suitable donor corneas. Protein fractions were isolated from each sample and subjected to multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide spectra were matched to the human proteome, assigned gene ontology, and grouped into protein signaling pathways unique to each of the disease states. We identified an average of 12,472 unique proteins in each of the endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissue samples. There were 2,409 differentially expressed protein isoforms that included previously known risk factors for type II diabetes mellitus related to metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that diabetes progression has many protein footprints related to metabolic processes, binding, and catalysis. The most represented pathways involved in diabetes progression included mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-cell junction structure, and protein synthesis regulation. This proteomic dataset identifies novel corneal endothelial cell and Descemet membrane protein expression in various stages of diabetic disease. These findings give insight into the mechanisms involved in diabetes progression relevant to the corneal endothelium and its basement membrane, prioritize new pathways for therapeutic targeting, and provide insight into potential biomarkers for determining the health of this tissue."

The present study aims to investigate the potential of metabolomics and cytokine profiling for improving the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. Serum and plasma samples were collected from pediatric patients for metabolic and inflammatory mediator analyses respectively. Targeted metabolic profiling was performed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Flow Injection Analysis Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry and targeted cytokine/chemokine profiling was completed using a multiplex platform to compare children with and without appendicitis. Twenty-three children with appendicitis and 35 control children without appendicitis from the Alberta Sepsis Network pediatric cohorts were included. Metabolomic profiling revealed clear separation between the two groups with very good sensitivity (80%), specificity (97%), and AUROC (0.93 ± 0.05) values. Inflammatory mediator analysis also distinguished the two groups with high sensitivity (82%), specificity (100%), and AUROC (0.97 ± 0.02) values. A biopattern comprised of 9 metabolites and 7 inflammatory compounds was detected to be significant for the separation between appendicitis and control groups. Integration of these 16 significant compounds resulted in a combined metabolic and cytokine profile that also demonstrated strong separation between the two groups with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity and AUROC value of 0.96 ± 0.03. The study demonstrated that metabolomics and cytokine mediator profiling is capable of distinguishing children with appendicitis from those without. These results suggest a potential new approach for improving the identification of appendicitis in children."
https://openalex.org/W2794126317,"Introduction Bisphenol A (BPA) is an ubiquitous environmental toxin that is also found in dialyzers. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) more efficiently clears high molecular weight molecules, and this may improve BPA clearance. However, the BPA contents of dialysis membranes may be a source of BPA loading during OL-HDF. Methods A prospective study assessed plasma BPA levels in OL-HDF patients using BPA-free (polynephron) or BPA-containing (polysulfone) dialyzers in a crossover design with two arms, after a run-in OL-HDF period of at least 6 months with the same membrane: 31 patients on polynephron at baseline were switched to polysulfone membranes for 3 months (polynephron-to-polysulfone) and 29 patients on polysulfone were switched to polynephron for 3 months (polysulfone-to-polynephron). Results After a run-in OL-HDF period of at least 6 months with the same membrane, baseline pre-dialysis BPA was lower in patients on polynephron (8.79±7.97 ng/ml) than in those on polysulfone (23.42±20.38 ng/mL, p<0.01), but still higher than in healthy controls (<2 ng/mL). After 3 months of polynephron-to-polysulfone switch, BPA was unchanged (8.98±7.88 to 11.14±15.98 ng/mL, ns) while it decreased on the polysulfone-to-polynephron group (23.42±20.38 to 11.41±12.38 ng/mL, p<0.01). Conclusion OL-HDF for 3 months with BPA-free dialyzer membranes was associated to a significant decrease in predialysis BPA levels when compared to baseline BPA levels while on a BPA-containing membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2794261778,"Under various conditions of liver injury, the intrahepatic biliary epithelium undergoes dynamic tissue expansion and remodeling, a process known as ductular reaction. Mouse models defective in inducing such a tissue-remodeling process are more susceptible to liver injury, suggesting a crucial role of this process in liver regeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the biliary epithelial cell (BEC) dynamics in the ductular reaction remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) is highly enriched in mouse liver BECs and plays a key role in regulating the ductular reaction, specifically under cholestatic injury conditions. Although mice lacking Klf5 in the entire liver epithelium, including both hepatocytes and BECs (Klf5-LKO (liver epithelial-specific knockout) mice), did not exhibit any apparent phenotype in the hepatobiliary system under normal conditions, they exhibited significant defects in biliary epithelial tissue remodeling upon 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced cholangitis, concomitantly with exacerbated cholestasis and reduced survival rate. In contrast, mice lacking Klf5 solely in hepatocytes did not exhibit any such phenotypes, confirming Klf5's specific role in BECs. RNA-sequencing analyses of BECs isolated from the Klf5-LKO mouse livers revealed that the Klf5 deficiency primarily affected expression of cell cycle-related genes. Moreover, immunostaining analysis with the proliferation marker Ki67 disclosed that the Klf5-LKO mice had significantly reduced BEC proliferation levels upon injury. These results indicate that Klf5 plays a critical role in the ductular reaction and biliary epithelial tissue expansion and remodeling by inducing BEC proliferation and thereby contributing to liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2793599580,"Cyanuric acid is a metabolic intermediate of s-triazines, such as atrazine (a common herbicide) and melamine (used in resins and plastics). Cyanuric acid is mineralized to ammonia and carbon dioxide by the soil bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP via three hydrolytic enzymes (AtzD, AtzE, and AtzF). Here, we report the purification and biochemical and structural characterization of AtzE. Contrary to previous reports, we found that AtzE is not a biuret amidohydrolase, but instead it catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of 1-carboxybiuret. X-ray crystal structures of apo AtzE and AtzE bound with the suicide inhibitor phenyl phosphorodiamidate revealed that the AtzE enzyme complex consists of two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. We also show that AtzE forms an α2β2 heterotetramer with a previously unidentified 68-amino acid-long protein (AtzG) encoded in the cyanuric acid mineralization operon from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP. Moreover, we observed that AtzG is essential for the production of soluble, active AtzE and that this obligate interaction is a vestige of their shared evolutionary origin. We propose that AtzEG was likely recruited into the cyanuric acid-mineralizing pathway from an ancestral glutamine transamidosome that required protein-protein interactions to enforce the exclusion of solvent from the transamidation reaction."

The objective of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of smear-positive TB patients since initiation and completion of treatment, which includes TB recurrence and mortality of TB patients. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study on 2,272 smear-positive TB patients who initiated treatment for TB from September 1, 2002—October 10, 2012 in health facilities in Dale district and Yirgalem town administration. We followed them from the date of start of treatment to either the date of interview or date of death. Results Recurrence rate of TB was 15.2 per 1000 person-years. Recurrence was higher for re-treatment cases (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.3). Mortality rate of TB patients was 27.1 per 1,000 person-years. The risk was high for patients above 34 years of age (aHR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.9), poor patients (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.8), patients with poor treatment outcomes (aHR, 6.7; 95% CI, 5.1–8.9) and for patients treated at least 3 times (aHR 4.8; 95% CI, 2.1–11.1). The excess mortality occurred among patients aged above 34 years was high (41.2/1000 person years). Conclusion High TB recurrence and death of TB patients was observed among our study participants. Follow-up of TB patients with the risk factors and managing them could reduce the TB burden."

Following from Weiner’s (2010) attribution theory of achievement motivation, the present research examined relationships between causal attributions and emotions concerning academic computing difficulties in two studies. Study samples consisted of North American university students enrolled in both traditional and online universities (total N = 559) who responded to either hypothetical scenarios or experimental manipulations involving technological challenges experienced in academic settings. Findings from Study 1 showed stable and external attributions to be emotionally maladaptive (more helplessness, boredom, guilt), particularly in response to unexpected computing problems. Additionally, Study 2 found stable attributions for unexpected problems to predict more anxiety for traditional students, with both external and personally controllable attributions for minor problems proving emotionally beneficial for students in online degree programs (more hope, less anxiety). Overall, hypothesized negative effects of stable attributions were observed across both studies, with mixed results for personally controllable attributions and unanticipated emotional benefits of external attributions for academic computing problems warranting further study."
https://openalex.org/W2794003394,"Interleukin (IL)-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that was traditionally recognized for its hematopoietic and anti-inflammatory functions, but has recently been shown also to be involved in tumorigenesis. IL-11 signaling is initiated by binding of the cytokine to the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R), which is not directly involved in signaling but required for IL-11 binding to the signal-transducing receptor glycoprotein (gp) 130. In classic signaling, IL-11 binds to the membrane-bound IL-11R to initiate signal transduction. Additionally, IL-11 signaling can be initiated via soluble IL-11R, known as trans-signaling, and this pathway only requires the three extracellular domains of the IL-11R, but not stalk, transmembrane, or intracellular region. Here, we analyzed the role of the IL-11R stalk region, a 55 amino acid stretch connecting the extracellular domains with the transmembrane helix, in classic IL-11 signaling with the help of cytokine-dependent cell lines. We showed that the stalk region is crucial for IL-11 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-11R. Using different deletion variants, we found that a minimal length of 23 amino acid residues is required for efficient signal transduction. We further found that classic IL-11 signaling depended solely on the length, but not the sequence, of the IL-11R stalk region, suggesting that the stalk functions as a spacer in the signaling complex. We previously described the IL-11R stalk region as determinant of proteolysis and regulator of IL-11 trans-signaling. The results presented here reveal an additional function in classic IL-11 signaling, highlighting the importance of the IL-11R stalk in IL-11 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2794379741,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by epithelial cell activation, expansion of the fibroblast population and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation. The mechanisms are incompletely understood but evidence indicates that the deregulation of several proteases contributes to its pathogenesis. Transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that may promote migration and facilitate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), two critical processes in the pathogenesis of IPF. Thus, we hypothesized that over-expression of TMPRSS4 in the lung could promote the initiation and/or progression of IPF. In this study we first evaluated the expression and localization of TMPRSS4 in IPF lungs by real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Then we examined the lung fibrotic response in wild-type and TMPRSS4 deficient mice using the bleomycin-induced lung injury model. We found that this protease is upregulated in IPF lungs, where was primarily expressed by epithelial and mast cells. Paralleling the findings in vivo, TMPRSS4 was expressed by alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and unexpectedly, provoked an increase of E-cadherin. No expression was observed in normal human or IPF lung fibroblasts. The lung fibrotic response evaluated at 28 days after bleomycin injury was markedly attenuated in the haplodeficient and deficient TMPRSS4 mice. By morphology, a significant reduction of the fibrotic index was observed in KO and heterozygous mice which was confirmed by measurement of collagen content (hydroxyproline: WT: 164±21.1 μg/lung versus TMPRSS4 haploinsufficient: 110.2±14.3 μg/lung and TMPRSS4 deficient mice: 114.1±24.2 μg/lung (p<0.01). As in IPF, TMPRSS4 was also expressed in epithelial and mast cells. These findings indicate that TMPRSS4 is upregulated in IPF lungs and that may have a profibrotic role."

To answer this question was the main goal of the present research. For that purpose, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted manipulating for the first time the degree of orthographic overlap of the L2 word as a whole, as well as of their morphemic constituents (bases and suffixes). Thirty-four European Portuguese-English bilinguals (16 intermediate and 18 high-proficient) and 16 English native-speaking controls performed the task in English. Results revealed that both groups of bilinguals decomposed words as the native control group. Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes)."
https://openalex.org/W2791854458,"Deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) in developing male strobili of second-generation offspring originating from a nuclear genic male sterile tree of Cryptomeria japonica were performed to characterize sRNA populations in the male strobili at early pollen developmental stages. Comparing to sequences of microRNA (miRNA) families of plant species and sRNAs expressed in the reproductive organs of representative vascular plants, 37 conserved miRNA families were detected, of which eight were ubiquitously expressed in the reproductive organs of land plant species. In contrast, miR1083 was common in male reproductive organs of gymnosperm species but absent in angiosperm species. In addition to conserved miRNAs, 199 novel miRNAs candidates were predicted. The expression patterns of the obtained sRNAs were further investigated to detect the differentially expressed (DE) sRNAs between genic male sterile and fertile individuals. A total of 969 DE sRNAs were obtained and only three known miRNA families were included among them. These results suggest that both conserved and species-specific sRNAs contribute to the development of male strobili in C. japonica."

However, the impact of swimming pool exposure at a recreational level on autonomic activity has never been explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how swimming pool attendance is influencing lung and autonomic function in school-aged children. Methods A total of 858 children enrolled a cross sectional survey. Spirometry and airway reversibility to beta-2 agonist, skin-prick-tests and exhaled nitric oxide measurements were performed. Pupillometry was used to evaluate autonomic nervous function. Children were classified as current swimmers (CS), past swimmers (PS) and non-swimmers (NS), according to the amount of swimming practice. Results Current swimmers group had significantly lower maximum and average pupil constriction velocities when compared to both PS and NS groups (3.8 and 5.1 vs 3.9 and 5.3 vs 4.0 and 5.4 mm/s, p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, affinity to the beta-2 agonist and levels of exhaled nitric oxide were significantly higher in CS when compared to NS (70 vs 60 mL and 12 vs 10 ppb, p<0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). A non-significant trend for a higher risk of asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis was found with more years of swimming practice, particularly in atopic individuals (β = 1.12, 1.40 and 1.31, respectively). After case-case analysis, it was possible to observe that results were not influenced by the inclusion of individuals with asthma. Conclusions Concluding, swimming pool attendance appears to be associated with autonomic changes and increased baseline airway smooth muscle constriction even in children without asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2794339447,"A novel paradigm of diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction proposes involvement of the cardiac microvasculature. Vitamin K dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) plays a role in preserving microcirculatory integrity. We hypothesized that LV filling pressure-a measure of diastolic LV dysfunction-increases with higher plasma level of inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). We also studied the distribution of active and inactive MGP in human myocardium.We measured echocardiographic diastolic LV function and plasma dp-ucMGP (ELISA) in 668 Flemish and for replication in 386 Swiss.Among Flemish and Swiss, E/e' (6.78 vs. 6.73) and dp-ucMGP (3.94 μg/L vs. 4.20 μg/L) were similarly distributed. In multivariable-adjusted models, for each doubling of dp-ucMGP, E/e' increased by 0.26, 0.33 and 0.31 in Flemish, Swiss and both cohorts combined (P≤0.026); the odds ratios for having E/e' ≥ 8.5 were 1.99, 3.29 and 2.36, respectively (P≤0.017). Cardiac biopsies from patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and healthy hearts (n = 4 for each) were stained with conformation-specific MGP antibodies. In diseased compared with normal hearts, uncarboxylated inactive MGP was more prevalent (P≤0.004) in the perivascular matrix and interstitium (204.4 vs. 8.6 μm2 per field) and phosphorylated active MGP in and around capillaries and interstitial cells (31.3 vs. 6.6 number of positive capillaries and cells per field).Our study supports a role of activated MGP in maintaining myocardial integrity and diastolic LV performance and can potentially be translated into new strategies for managing diastolic LV dysfunction and preventing its progression to heart failure."

https://openalex.org/W2792061260,"The 2017–2018 flu season has been worse than normal, with an increase of influenza-like cases and deaths, and researchers are examining why this could be and how to increase vaccine effectiveness in the coming years. This effort includes examining the circulating influenza strains and trying to understand how these match with the predictions made months ago when the yearly influenza vaccine was designed. Circulating strains this flu season include influenza A H3N2 (a H3N2 strain caused the 1968 influenza pandemic), influenza A H1N1pdm09 (the pandemic strain from the 2009 season that is still around), and influenza B. Even though influenza is a relatively small virus whose genome is contained on 8 RNA regions that encode 11 proteins, it evolves rapidly, and these new mutations can spread as new infectious strains disseminate within the population. This is a challenge in creating the annual influenza vaccine, as the vaccine needs to elicit an immune response to some part of the influenza virus that is fairly invariable. Ideally, we would have a single universal vaccine, but this has been a challenging goal to meet because of differences between strains of influenza virus. Instead, each year the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates surveillance and makes recommendations as to which strains should be included in vaccine preparations. From the selected strains, vaccines are created to induce the generation of antibodies specific for hemagglutinin, a protein on the surface of influenza that is critical for viral adhesion to host cells. Roughly, hemagglutinin is a spike-shaped protein coming out of the viral capsid with a globular head. Most hemagglutinin-specific antibodies recognize the head, specifically to antigenic site B, but the head is highly mutable and mutations can prevent recognition by the immune system. Moreover, changes can also occur within the viral strains used to create the influenza vaccines within chicken eggs, such that the vaccine antigen does not match that found in the circulating viral strain. For example, to ensure that the 2016–2017 influenza vaccine better matched circulating H3N2 viruses, a clade 3C.2 H3N2 virus was added to the vaccine to replace a H3N2 virus of the 3C.1 hemagglutinin clade. However, the egg-adapted 3C.2a vaccine strain lacks a glycosylation site on the antigenic site B of the hemagglutinin head that is found in H3N2 viruses circulating within humans (Lin et al., 2017Lin Y.

This mismatch between the egg-adapted vaccine strain and circulating strains could then have implications for vaccine efficacy. Prompted by low vaccine efficacy in 2016–2017, Zost et al., 2017Zost S.J. Parkhouse K. Gumina M.E. Kim K. Diaz Perez S. Wilson P.C. Treanor J.J. Sant A.J. Cobey S. Hensley S.E. Contemporary H3N2 influenza viruses have a glycosylation site that alters binding of antibodies elicited by egg-adapted vaccine strains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 12578-12583Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar examined this glycosylation site further. Circulating H3N2 viruses were found to primarily have threonine (T) at position 160 of hemagglutinin instead of lysine (K), but these strains grew poorly in chicken eggs and the egg-adapted H3N2 strain contains a reversion mutant back to lysine. Zost et al. found that T160 and K160 are antigenically distinct and that antibodies created in ferrets as well as in humans to egg-adapted H3N2 poorly recognize and neutralize circulating H3N2 strains, influencing the effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine. Alternatives to egg-based technology for influenza vaccines exist, including cell-based alternatives or baculovirus systems. Zost et al., 2017Zost S.J. Parkhouse K. Gumina M.E. Kim K. Diaz Perez S. Wilson P.C. Treanor J.J. Sant A.J. Cobey S. Hensley S.E. Contemporary H3N2 influenza viruses have a glycosylation site that alters binding of antibodies elicited by egg-adapted vaccine strains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 12578-12583Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar found that Flublok (derived from antigens created in insect cells) did not create an antibody response that was higher but did create a response that was more efficient at recognizing T160 hemagglutinin in circulating H3N2 strains. This work highlights the potential importance of expanding the use of alternative ways of mass producing influenza antigens for vaccines beyond egg-based strategies, since egg-adapted strains can impair influenza vaccine effectiveness. Cell-based flu vaccines are approved for use in several European countries, and the US FDA has approved the use of one cell-based flu vaccine, but existing facilities for egg-based vaccine production would need to be completely rebuilt to move away from egg-based vaccines. Another way to potentially improve influenza vaccine design is by making mutations within influenza strains to attenuate the virus and increase the immune response. The type I interferon (IFN) system is at the center of the innate immune response against viruses, and viruses have responded with many strategies to get around IFN (García-Sastre, 2017García-Sastre A. Ten Strategies of Interferon Evasion by Viruses.Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22: 176-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While multiple modulators and suppressors of IFN are helpful for a virus during pathogenesis, they increase the difficulty of vaccine design because the ideal vaccine strain would induce a rapid and strong immune response, while a vaccine strain that modulates the initial interferon response might dampen subsequent immune responses to that pathogen. In influenza virus, the most well-characterized IFN modulator is non-structural protein NS1, but other modulators of interferon exist and Du et al., 2018Du Y. Xin L. Shi Y. Zhang T.H. Wu N.C. Dai L. Gong D. Brar G. Shu S. Luo J. et al.Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design.Science. 2018; 359: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar designed a quantitative high-throughput genomics method to systematically identify point mutations that modulate IFN in the genome of influenza A. Using this information about mutations that confer IFN sensitivity and lead to IFN induction, they created the HIS virus strain for vaccination with eight IFN-sensitive mutations that had increased IFN sensitivity and yielded greater in vitro induction of IFN. When the HIS strain was tested in mice and ferrets, it had reduced replication and growth and transiently increased expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes, which would both be good qualities for a vaccine strain, limiting damage while stimulating an immune response. When HIS was used to vaccinate mice and ferrets, it induced a robust humoral and cellular immune response and protected against three different influenza A strains, making this a valuable potential strategy. This unbiased technique holds promise for improving strains for vaccinations for other pathogens in addition to influenza. While efforts to anticipate seasonal influenza strains and produce well-targeted and effective vaccines must continue, the ultimate quest is for a universal influenza vaccine that could be used from year to year. This type of vaccine would rely on conserved sequences from influenza to create antigens that would be able to broadly recognize and neutralize a wide set of influenza strains. In one step toward this goal, Deng et al., 2018Deng L. Mohan T. Chang T.Z. Gonzalez G.X. Wang Y. Kwon Y.M. Kang S.M. Compans R.W. Champion J.A. Wang B.Z. Double-layered protein nanoparticles induce broad protection against divergent influenza A viruses.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 359Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar used a double-layered protein nanoparticle approach. Within the core of the protein nanoparticles, a tetramer protein of the influenza matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) was included. M2e can cause a weak-antibody response that fades over time, but it is conserved across influenza strains. The soluble tetramer protein that Deng et al. created included M2e from human, swine, avian, and domestic fowl consensus sequences. Coating the core of the nanoparticles were headless hemagglutinin sequences from the hemagglutinin stalk and hemagglutinin HA2 ectodomain taken from either H1N1 or H3N2 strains. While the head of hemagglutinin is mutable, the spikey stalk of hemagglutinin is more conserved. Vaccination of mice with the protein nanoparticles yielded robust immune responses through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis as well as leading to increased survival when the mice were infected with a range of influenza A strains including H1N1 and H3N2 as well as avian strains H5N1 and H7N9. These latter two are of interest given concerns about pandemics that could arise if avian strains begin broadly circulating in humans. The initial positive indications mark this protein nanoparticle strategy as a promising vaccine strategy for influenza and other pathogens, and because it does not require refrigeration it may also offer a better option for widespread transportation and distribution of vaccines to remote and low-income settings. These three studies point to three slightly different directions for how we think about vaccine design and creation. All three versions of the future of influenza vaccine design are worthwhile to expand on as a way to improve upon vaccine design as we continue to work toward a universal influenza vaccine. Promisingly, there are Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of universal influenza vaccines. Eventually, we will be able to pin down the moving target of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2793904194,"The risk of atrial fibrillation (AF)-related stroke is usually assessed by calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the components of which are various risk factors, including prior stroke. Although prior stroke is considered the strongest risk factor, the associated risk is actually inferred. Nevertheless, it implies a “freedom-from-event effect” (FEE)—the longer a patient is stroke-free, the lower the stroke risk. Although dynamic prognostication has been applied to cancer, the FEE has been ignored in AF, probably because of methodological difficulties. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the FEE in the risk of AF-related stroke. We modeled various populations of AF patients and simulated the development of stroke assuming a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the hazard depends on age, comorbidities, and individual variability. Parameters were set so that the model respects the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring scheme and reproduces the 1-year CHA2DS2-VASc score-wise stroke risk and relative risk conferred by real-world risk factors. We tracked stroke risk over 0 to 15 years of freedom-from-stroke time (FST), both prospective FST (pFST), which begins at the time of diagnosis and continues to the future, and retrospective FST (rFST), which begins at the present and looks backward to the time of diagnosis. The pFST counterbalanced the increase in stroke risk conferred by aging; in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, the pFST offset 62% of the age-conferred risk increase. The rFST reduced the stroke risk; in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 and without prior stroke, an rFST of 6.8 years reduced the stroke risk to the midpoint between CHA2DS2-VASc scores 1 and 2. The study results suggest that the FEE should be considered in evaluating stroke risk in patients with AF. The FEE may be important in other recurrent diseases for which a prior event is a risk factor for a future event."
