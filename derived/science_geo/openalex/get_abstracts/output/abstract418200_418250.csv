https://openalex.org/W2153745732,"Freshwater scarcity is a growing concern, placing considerable importance on the accuracy of indicators used to characterize and map water scarcity worldwide. We improve upon past efforts by using estimates of blue water footprints (consumptive use of ground- and surface water flows) rather than water withdrawals, accounting for the flows needed to sustain critical ecological functions and by considering monthly rather than annual values. We analyzed 405 river basins for the period 1996–2005. In 201 basins with 2.67 billion inhabitants there was severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. The ecological and economic consequences of increasing degrees of water scarcity – as evidenced by the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo), Indus, and Murray-Darling River Basins – can include complete desiccation during dry seasons, decimation of aquatic biodiversity, and substantial economic disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2103872250,"Failure of immune surveillance related to inadequate host antitumor immune responses has been suggested as a possible cause of the high incidence of recurrence and poor overall survival outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma. The stress-induced heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to act as endogenous “danger signals” that can improve tumor immunogenicity and induce natural killer (NK) cell responses. Exosome is a novel secretory pathway for HSPs. In our experiments, the immune regulatory effect of the HSP-bearing exosomes secreted by human hepatocellular carcinoma cells under stress conditions on NK cells was studied. ELISA results showed that the production of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 was up-regulated in both cell lines in a stress-specific manner. After exposure to hepatocellular carcinoma cell-resistant or sensitive anticancer drugs (hereafter referred to as “resistant” or “sensitive” anticancer drug), the membrane microvesicles were actively released by hepatocellular carcinoma cells, differing in their ability to present HSPs on the cell surface, which were characterized as exosomes. Acting as a decoy, the HSP-bearing exosomes efficiently stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity and granzyme B production, up-regulated the expression of inhibitory receptor CD94, and down-regulated the expression of activating receptors CD69, NKG2D, and NKp44. Notably, resistant anticancer drugs enhanced exosome release and generated more exosome-carried HSPs, which augmented the activation of the cytotoxic response. In summary, our findings demonstrated that exosomes derived from resistant anticancer drug-treated HepG2 cells conferred superior immunogenicity in inducing HSP-specific NK cell responses, which provided a clue for finding an efficient vaccine for hepatocellular carcinoma immunotherapy.

It is also the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with over 600,000 patients dying from this disease annually, especially in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2008.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10209) Google Scholar). At present, surgical treatment is regarded as the most effective standard therapy for HCC. Recent progresses in both diagnostic and surgical techniques have resulted in substantial improvement in the morbidity and mortality rates, but the overall outcome remains far from satisfactory. Traditional chemotherapy is widely performed and recognized as having a survival benefit, such as reducing HCC burden in patients with advanced disease or reducing the risk of recurrence after curative resection (2Yeo W. Mok T.S. Zee B. Leung T.W. Lai P.B. Lau W.Y. Koh J. Mo F.K. Yu S.C. Chan A.T. Hui P. Ma B. Lam K.C. Ho W.M. Wong H.T. Tang A. Johnson P.J.

Unfortunately, its therapeutic efficacy appears disappointing in clinical trials, and a standard therapeutic method has not been established. Recently, attention has focused on a variety of vaccines investigated in experimental studies comprising patients with HCC, because they have been reported to greatly induce a tumor-specific immune response against tumor cells (4Kuang M.

As a result, identifying and establishing a novel approach for the prevention of HCC development and recurrence (i.e. anticancer drug-based immunotherapy that targets antitumor immune response) has become the focus of researchers around the world. hepatocellular carcinoma heat shock protein natural killer natural killer group 2 member D 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide acetylcholinesterase tumor-derived exosome(s) test drug concentration phycoerythrin. HSPs were first discovered in 1962 (6Ritossa P. [Problems of prophylactic vaccinations of infants].Riv. Ist. Sieroter. Ital. 1962; 37: 79-108PubMed Google Scholar) as a family of highly conserved proteins. HSPs play a crucial role as molecular chaperones by assisting the proper folding of newly synthesized and stress-denatured polypeptides, the assembly of multiprotein complexes, and the transport of proteins across cell membranes (7Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in the cytosol. From nascent chain to folded protein.Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2791) Google Scholar). The dual function of HSPs, depending on their intracellular and extracellular location, strongly increases the interest of these molecules in tumor therapy (8Schmitt E. Gehrmann M. Brunet M. Multhoff G. Garrido C. Intracellular and extracellular functions of heat shock proteins. Repercussions in cancer therapy.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Apart from their cytoprotective/antiapoptotic roles in the cytosol, HSPs have been found to provide danger signals for the host's cellular immune system when located in the extracellular space or on the plasma membrane (9Pockley A.G. Heat shock proteins as regulators of the immune response.Lancet. 2003; 362: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10Hickman-Miller H.D. Hildebrand W.H. The immune response under stress. The role of HSP-derived peptides.Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HSPs may be an ideal candidate for enhancing antitumor immunity. To develop a therapeutic vaccine, appropriate molecules for immune cells should be identified, and an adequate vehicle needs to be developed. One of the simplest vehicles for the therapeutic vaccine is tumor-derived exosome (Tex) that contains HSPs. Exosomes are specialized 30–100-nm-sized lipid-rich membrane-bound microvesicles with a defined morphology and phenotype and are smaller and more homogeneous in size than membrane-shed vesicles (100–1000 nm). Exosomes are actively released into the extracellular environment from cells via the endosomal vesicle/multivesicular the body pathway by fusion with the plasma membrane under normal and pathological conditions (11Théry C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Exosomes. Composition, biogenesis, and function.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar, 12Février B. Raposo G. Exosomes.

From tumor immunology to pathogen biology.Traffic. 2008; 9: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Many cells have the capacity to secrete exosomes, including epithelial cells (14Kapsogeorgou E.K. Abu-Helu R.F. Moutsopoulos H.M. Manoussakis M.N. Salivary gland epithelial cell exosomes.

Depending on the cell types from which they are derived, exosomes play a role in diverse physiological and pathological processes, serving as a novel and more intricate form of cell-cell communication. Tumor cells also produce exosomes, evidently abundant in culture and malignant effusions (19Andre F. Schartz N.E. Movassagh M. Flament C. Pautier P. Morice P. Pomel C. Lhomme C. Escudier B. Le Chevalier T. Tursz T. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Angevin E. Zitvogel L.

Tex might represent ideal vehicles for immunomodulation with an impact on the immune system, and their influence should be taken into consideration when designing treatment for cancer patients (21Clayton A. Mason M.D. Exosomes in tumor immunity.Curr. Oncol. 2009; 16: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, the identification of HSPs on the exosome surface and the known role of these molecules in the stimulation of resting NK cells prompted us to investigate whether anticancer drugs may efficiently up-regulate the expression of HSPs on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell-derived exosomes and the ability of exosomal HSPs as a tumor vaccine to potentially induce NK cells responses that lead to eliciting an antitumor immune response in vitro. This was measured with the NK cell cytotoxic function, granzyme B secretion, and cell surface density of several NK cell receptors. The human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5) and erythromyeloblastoid leukemia (K562) cell lines, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were routinely cultured in complete DMEM culture medium (25 mm d-glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate; Invitrogen). This medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated exosome-depleted FBS (Biological Industries; previously accomplished by overnight ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C) and penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (both from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator designated as culture at a steady-state condition. Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion test and routinely found to contain <5% dead cells. The in vitro growth-inhibitory effect of the anticancer drugs was measured by the MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) assay as described previously with slight modification (22Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Evaluation of a tetrazolium-based semiautomated colorimetric assay. Assessment of chemosensitivity testing.Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well (200 μl/well). After 24 h, cells were treated with different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200% test drug concentration (TDC)) of TAXOL (paclitaxel; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), Campto (irinotecan hydrochloride; Pfizer), Paraplatin (carboplatin; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), etoposide (Hengrui Medicine Co.), Militant (mitoxantrone hydrochloride; Sanjing Shenhe Pharmaceutical Co.), Pharmorubicin (epirubicin hydrochloride; Pfizer), cisplatin (Hansoh Pharmaceutical Co.), mitomycin (Hisun Pharmaceutical Co.), fluorouracil (Xudong Haipu Pharmaceutical Co.), Eloxatin (oxaliplatin; Sanofi-Aventis), or Gemzar (gemcitabine hydrochloride; Lilly) in 200 μl of fresh culture medium. After 72 h, medium was replaced with 200 μl of fresh culture medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/ml). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, MTT-containing medium was removed, and 150 μl of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each well. After gentle mixing for 15 min, the reduced purple formazan crystals were solubilized, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm using a spectrophotometric microplate reader (MK-3 microplate reader, Thermo Labsystems). The growth inhibition rate was calculated using the formula, growth inhibition rate (%) = (1 − ODdrug exposure/ODcontrol) × 100. For each single anticancer drug, the result of chemosensitivity was determined to be sensitive (100% TDC >90% and 50% TDC >70%) or resistant (100% TDC <70% and 50% TDC <50%) (Table 1).TABLE 1100% TDC of anticancer drugsAnticancer drug100% TDCμg/molPaclitaxel13.6Etoposide48.0Carboplatin15.8Irinotecan hydrochloride14.0Mitoxantrone hydrochloride0.6Epirubicin hydrochloride0.5Cisplatin3.8Mitomycin0.23Fluorouracil22.5Oxaliplatin1.8Gemcitabine hydrochloride25.0 Open table in a new tab HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates. After a 48-h incubation in complete DMEM culture medium with 10% heat-inactivated exosome-depleted FBS, cells reaching ∼80% confluence were exposed to 100% TDC of paclitaxel, carboplatin, etoposide, or irinotecan hydrochloride for different lengths of time. Untreated cells were used as controls. The culture media were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h after treatment with anticancer drugs. HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in complete DMEM culture medium with 10% heat-inactivated exosome-depleted FBS. After a 24-h incubation period for attachment, cultured cells were heat-shocked by incubating them at 43 °C for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, or 3 h or kept at 37 °C as controls, followed by a recovery period of 24 h at 37 °C. The conditioned media were collected 24 h after the end of heat shock. Cell culture supernatants were harvested at different time points from HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells; exposed to heat shock, paclitaxel, carboplatin, etoposide, irinotecan hydrochloride, or control; and centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min to remove cells. The concentrations of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 in each sample were measured using the human ultrasensitive heat shock protein 60/70/90 (HSP60/70/90) ELISA kit (CSB-E13498h/13463h/13497h, Cusabio Biotech), with subsequent assays done as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was read by a spectrophotometer. Previously reported isolation protocols (23Pisitkun T. Shen R.F.

Briefly, 12 ml of conditioned culture medium was collected from HepG2 cells at the indicated times; treated with heat shock, paclitaxel, carboplatin, etoposide, irinotecan hydrochloride, or control; and subjected to two consecutive centrifugations to remove residual cells and cellular debris: 800 × g for 10 min and 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm pore diameter filter (Millipore), followed by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C using SW41 Ti rotor (L-80XP, Beckman Coulter Instruments). The ultracentrifuged pellet was collected from the bottom of the tube, resuspended in sterile filtered PBS, and subsequently ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 3 h again. Finally, the exosomal pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of PBS, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C for further use. Protein content of exosomes was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The morphology of exosome was examined by transmission electron microscopy using a method described previously (25Liu C. Yu S. Zinn K. Wang J. Zhang L. Jia Y. Kappes J.C. Barnes S. Kimberly R.P. Grizzle W.E. Zhang H.G. Murine mammary carcinoma exosomes promote tumor growth by suppression of NK cell function.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In brief, exosomes obtained after differential centrifugation were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde. A 20-μl drop of the suspension was loaded onto Formvar-carbon-coated electron microscopy copper grids and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. Excess fluid was drawn off with a piece of Whatman filter paper. The sample was then negative-stained on ice with a 20-μl drop of 1% uranyl acetate for 10 min and allowed to dry under an electric incandescent lamp for 10 min before viewing in a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) operated at 80 kV. To quantify the amount of exosomes released, we assessed AChE activity, an enzyme that was specifically directed to these vesicles (26Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. The exosome pathway in K562 cells is regulated by Rab11.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AChE activity was assayed following a procedure described previously (27Savina A. Furlán M. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. Exosome release is regulated by a calcium-dependent mechanism in K562 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20083-20090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of the exosome fraction was suspended in 110 μl of PBS, and a portion (37.5 μl) was then added to individual wells on a 96-well flat-bottomed microplate. Acetylthiocholine iodide (1.25 mm) and 5′,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (0.1 mm) (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were then added to exosome fractions in a final volume of 300 μl, and the absorbance change at 412 nm was monitored every 5 min. Western blot analysis of exosomal proteins was performed using methods described previously (28Clayton A. Turkes A. Navabi H. Mason M.D. Tabi Z. Induction of heat shock proteins in B-cell exosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 29Clayton A. Mitchell J.P. Court J. Mason M.D. Tabi Z. Human tumor-derived exosomes selectively impair lymphocyte responses to interleukin-2.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7458-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Exosomal pellets were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Pierce) for 20 min on ice, and then equal volumes of reducing SDS loading buffer were added and boiled at 98 °C for 5 min. Total proteins (10 μg of protein/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels along with the PageRulerTM Plus prestained protein ladder (Fermentas) and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF (Millipore) membranes. Following overnight blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) containing 5% BSA at 4 °C, the blots were probed with the following primary mouse monoclonal antibodies (0.2 μg/ml) in PBST: anti-HSP60 (IgG1, clone LK1), anti-HSP70 (IgG1, clone C92F3A-5), anti-HSP90 (IgG2a, clone F-8) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-CD63 (IgG1, clone MEM-259, Abcam). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the blots were then incubated with species-appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution in PBST, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The corresponding bands were developed with SuperSignal West Pico Trial Kit (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. The Chemidoc EQ system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) was used for determining the density of protein bands. Flow cytometric analysis of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 surface expression on isolated exosomes was performed as described previously (24Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8927) Google Scholar). Briefly, exosomes (30 μg) were incubated with 1.5 × 105 4-μm diameter aldehyde/sulfate latex microbeads (surfactant-free, ultraclean; Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C under gentle agitation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm glycine for 30 min to saturate any remaining free binding sites on the beads. Exosome-coated beads were stained with an appropriate concentration of primary mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against HSP60 (clone LK1), HSP70 (clone C92F3A-5), or HSP90 (clone F-8) for 1 h, washed twice, subjected to a 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled (IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes) secondary antibody in darkness, and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScalibur flow cytometer using CELL-QuestTM data acquisition and analysis software. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral venous blood drawn from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation. Diluted blood was layered over Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (1.077 g/ml; GE Healthcare) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min. The interface layer was harvested and washed in PBS, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using an NK cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, non-NK cells were magnetically labeled and depleted using a mixture of biotin-conjugated antibodies and the NK cell MicroBead mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of isolated NK cells (CD3−CD56+) was analyzed with flow cytometric analysis by staining with anti-CD3-FITC/CD56-phycoerythrin (PE, IgG1, clone UCHT1/N901, Beckman Coulter) mouse monoclonal antibody and was ∼95%. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion test and always was found to be greater than 95%. NK cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated either with low dose IL-2 alone (100 IU/ml; PeproTech) or with IL-2 in combination with exosomal proteins (5, 10, or 20 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 4 days. Cell surface density of different NK cell markers was determined on day 4 after stimulation using anti-NKG2D-PE (IgG1, clone 149810), anti-CD69-PE (IgG2a, clone 298614), anti-CD94-PE (IgG1, clone 131412), or anti-NKp44-PE (IgG2a, clone 253415) (all from R&D Systems) mouse monoclonal antibodies (10 μl/106 cells for 30 min at 4 °C) by flow cytometry using a standard protocol. NK cell-mediated cytotoxic activity was determined in a colorimetric assay based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity released from the cytosol of lysed K562 or HepG2 target cells into the supernatant with the CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. K562 or HepG2 target cells were coincubated with NK cells, prestimulated for 4 days either with low dose IL-2 alone (100 IU/ml) or with IL-2 in combination with different amounts of exosomes (5, 10, or 20 μg/ml) at the indicated effector/target cell ratios of 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1. After a 4-h incubation period at 37 °C in 5% CO2, supernatants were harvested, and the percentage of specific lysis was calculated according to the equation, specific lysis (%) = (experimental − effector spontaneous − target spontaneous)/(target maximum − target spontaneous) × 100. Granzyme B released by NK cells during the stimulation period of 4 days, either with low dose IL-2 alone (100 IU/ml) or with IL-2 in combination with exosomal proteins (5, 10, or 20 μg/ml), was measured using a human granzyme B ELISA kit (CSB-E08718h, Cusabio Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plates were counted on an ELISA reader at 450 nm. Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance of differences between the experimental and control groups was analyzed using the paired samples Student's t test or repeated measures analysis of variance where appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Chemosensitivity of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells was assessed by in vitro 72-h continuous exposure to each single agent (paclitaxel, irinotecan hydrochloride, carboplatin, etoposide, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, mitomycin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or gemcitabine hydrochloride) at different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200% TDC). As can be seen in Fig. 1 1These authors contributed equally to this work., HepG2 cells showed remarkably higher sensitivity to paclitaxel and etoposide (100% TDC >90% and 50% TDC >70%), with similar results obtained with both assays between two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells exhibited resistance to irinotecan hydrochloride, carboplatin, and mitomycin (100% TDC <70 and 50% TDC <50%), and this was exemplified by both assays. Differences in growth inhibition rate under the same conditions among anticancer drugs reached the level of statistical significance (p < 0.05). For further investigation, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan hydrochloride, and carboplatin were selected for treating HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells as cellular stress. The production of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 by HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells following heat shock or anticancer drugs was evaluated by ELISA. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 1These authors contributed equally to this work.. In agreement with previous studies, both HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells constitutively released HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90; in addition, the levels were up-regulated after cellular stress (30Lindquist S.

The release of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 was approximately equally up-regulated by both types of stress in HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells. No cell line-specific differences could be noted (p > 0.05). HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 secretion were generally higher after heat shock or anticancer drug treatments, reaching statistical significance (p < 0.05). Moreover, our results demonstrated that HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells secreted the highest levels of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 treated with carboplatin or irinotecan hydrochloride (resistant anticancer drugs) as opposed to those exposed to heat shock, paclitaxel, or etoposide (sensitive anticancer drugs).

Here we establish the first current baseline and gradient of ecosystem structure of nearshore rocky reefs at the Mediterranean scale. We conducted underwater surveys in 14 marine protected areas and 18 open access sites across the Mediterranean, and across a 31-fold range of fish biomass (from 3.8 to 118 g m−2). Our data showed remarkable variation in the structure of rocky reef ecosystems. Multivariate analysis showed three alternative community states: (1) large fish biomass and reefs dominated by non-canopy algae, (2) lower fish biomass but abundant native algal canopies and suspension feeders, and (3) low fish biomass and extensive barrens, with areas covered by turf algae. Our results suggest that the healthiest shallow rocky reef ecosystems in the Mediterranean have both large fish and algal biomass. Protection level and primary production were the only variables significantly correlated to community biomass structure. Fish biomass was significantly larger in well-enforced no-take marine reserves, but there were no significant differences between multi-use marine protected areas (which allow some fishing) and open access areas at the regional scale. The gradients reported here represent a trajectory of degradation that can be used to assess the health of any similar habitat in the Mediterranean, and to evaluate the efficacy of marine protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2019982728,"Background The interest in prognostic reviews is increasing, but to properly review existing evidence an accurate search filer for finding prediction research is needed. The aim of this paper was to validate and update two previously introduced search filters for finding prediction research in Medline: the Ingui filter and the Haynes Broad filter. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a hand search of 6 general journals in 2008 we constructed two sets of papers. Set 1 consisted of prediction research papers (n = 71), and set 2 consisted of the remaining papers (n = 1133). Both search filters were validated in two ways, using diagnostic accuracy measures as performance measures. First, we compared studies in set 1 (reference) with studies retrieved by the search strategies as applied in Medline. Second, we compared studies from 4 published systematic reviews (reference) with studies retrieved by the search filter as applied in Medline. Next – using word frequency methods – we constructed an additional search string for finding prediction research. Both search filters were good in identifying clinical prediction models: sensitivity ranged from 0.94 to 1.0 using our hand search as reference, and 0.78 to 0.89 using the systematic reviews as reference. This latter performance measure even increased to around 0.95 (range 0.90 to 0.97) when either search filter was combined with the additional string that we developed. Retrieval rate of explorative prediction research was poor, both using our hand search or our systematic review as reference, and even combined with our additional search string: sensitivity ranged from 0.44 to 0.85. Conclusions/Significance Explorative prediction research is difficult to find in Medline, using any of the currently available search filters. Yet, application of either the Ingui filter or the Haynes broad filter results in a very low number missed clinical prediction model studies."
https://openalex.org/W2026308971,"The identification of early mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and associated biomarkers could advance development of new therapies and improve monitoring and predicting of AD progression. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested to underlie AD pathophysiology, however, no comprehensive study exists that evaluates the effect of different familial AD (FAD) mutations on mitochondrial function, dynamics, and brain energetics.We characterized early mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolomic signatures of energetic stress in three commonly used transgenic mouse models of FAD. Assessment of mitochondrial motility, distribution, dynamics, morphology, and metabolomic profiling revealed the specific effect of each FAD mutation on the development of mitochondrial stress and dysfunction. Inhibition of mitochondrial trafficking was characteristic for embryonic neurons from mice expressing mutant human presenilin 1, PS1(M146L) and the double mutation of human amyloid precursor protein APP(Tg2576) and PS1(M146L) contributing to the increased susceptibility of neurons to excitotoxic cell death. Significant changes in mitochondrial morphology were detected in APP and APP/PS1 mice. All three FAD models demonstrated a loss of the integrity of synaptic mitochondria and energy production. Metabolomic profiling revealed mutation-specific changes in the levels of metabolites reflecting altered energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in brains of FAD mice. Metabolic biomarkers adequately reflected gender differences similar to that reported for AD patients and correlated well with the biomarkers currently used for diagnosis in humans.Mutation-specific alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, morphology and function in FAD mice occurred prior to the onset of memory and neurological phenotype and before the formation of amyloid deposits. Metabolomic signatures of mitochondrial stress and altered energy metabolism indicated alterations in nucleotide, Krebs cycle, energy transfer, carbohydrate, neurotransmitter, and amino acid metabolic pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction, therefore, is an underlying event in AD progression, and FAD mouse models provide valuable tools to study early molecular mechanisms implicated in AD."

Although loss-of-function of NKT cells had no effect on glucose tolerance in animals with prolonged high fat diet feeding, activation of NKT cells by lipid agonist α-galactosylceramide enhances alternative macrophage polarization in adipose tissue and improves glucose homeostasis in animals at different stages of obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2112428133,"Our understanding of the composition of multi-clonal malarial infections and the epidemiological factors which shape their diversity remain poorly understood. Traditionally within-host diversity has been defined in terms of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) derived by PCR-based genotyping. Massively parallel, single molecule sequencing technologies now enable individual read counts to be derived on genome-wide datasets facilitating the development of new statistical approaches to describe within-host diversity. In this class of measures the FWS metric characterizes within-host diversity and its relationship to population level diversity. Utilizing P. falciparum field isolates from patients in West Africa we here explore the relationship between the traditional MOI and FWS approaches. FWS statistics were derived from read count data at 86,158 SNPs in 64 samples sequenced on the Illumina GA platform. MOI estimates were derived by PCR at the msp-1 and -2 loci. Significant correlations were observed between the two measures, particularly with the msp-1 locus (P = 5.92×10−5). The FWS metric should be more robust than the PCR-based approach owing to reduced sensitivity to potential locus-specific artifacts. Furthermore the FWS metric captures information on a range of parameters which influence out-crossing risk including the number of clones (MOI), their relative proportions and genetic divergence. This approach should provide novel insights into the factors which correlate with, and shape within-host diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2003258181,"The human scalp harbors a vast community of microbial mutualists, the composition of which is difficult to elucidate as many of the microorganisms are not culturable using current culture techniques. Dandruff, a common scalp disorder, is known as a causative factor of a mild seborrheic dermatitis as well as pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. Lipophilic yeast Malassezia is widely accepted to play a role in dandruff, but relatively few comprehensive studies have been reported. In order to investigate fungal biota and genetic resources of dandruff, we amplified the 26S rRNA gene from samples of healthy scalps and dandruff-afflicted scalps. The sequences were analyzed by a high throughput method using a GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencer. Of the 74,811 total sequence reads, Basidiomycota (Filobasidium spp.) was the most common phylum associated with dandruff. In contrast, Ascomycota (Acremonium spp.) was common in the healthy scalps. Our results elucidate the distribution of fungal communities associated with dandruff and provide new avenues for the potential prevention and treatment of dandruff."
https://openalex.org/W1979438083,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in women. Despite the fact that the metastatic spread is associated with the majority of deaths from ovarian cancer, the molecular mechanisms regulating the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of ovarian cancer are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that BLT2, a low affinity leukotriene B4 receptor, is highly expressed in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells, and that this receptor plays a key role in the invasiveness and metastasis of these cells through activation of STAT3 and consequent up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). In addition, our results suggest that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase-4 (NOX4) and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation lie downstream of BLT2, mediating the stimulation of STAT3-MMP2 cascade in this process. For example, knockdown of BLT2 or NOX4 using each specific siRNA suppressed STAT3 stimulation and MMP2 expression. Similarly, inhibition of STAT3 suppressed the expression of MMP2, thus leading to attenuated invasiveness of these ovarian cancer cells. Finally, the metastasis of SKOV-3 cells in nude mice was markedly suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of BLT2. Together, our results implicate a BLT2-NOX4-ROS-STAT3-MMP2 cascade in the invasiveness and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in women.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy in women, with the 5-year survival rate for all ovarian cancer patients having remained at only ∼40% for the past 30 years in the United States (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Xu J. Ward E. Cancer statistics, 2010.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2010; 60: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12356) Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed at a late stage, at which time extensive local invasion and metastasis to the peritoneal cavity have already occurred (2Holschneider C.H. Berek J.S. Ovarian cancer. Epidemiology, biology, and prognostic factors.Semin. Surg. Oncol. 2000; 19: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Currently available therapies, both surgical and cytotoxic, are not effective for the prevention or retardation of metastatic spread, with metastasis thus remaining a major clinical challenge in the treatment of ovarian cancer. A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer is thus a key to the identification of new therapeutic targets for this malignancy. An important first step in tumor metastasis is invasion of the cancer cells through the basement membrane, which requires degradation of extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseBLTleukotriene B4 receptorLOlipoxygenaseLTleukotrieneHETEhydroxyeicosatetraenoic acidROSreactive oxygen speciesNOXNAD(P)H oxidaseDPIdiphenylene iodoniumJAKJanus kinase. MMPs constitute a family of secreted or membrane-bound enzymes that modulate the tissue microenvironment and regulate various cell behaviors related to cancer including the growth, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, as well as angiogenesis (3Egeblad M. Werb Z. New functions for the matrix metalloproteinases in cancer progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5113) Google Scholar). The expression of MMP2, also known as gelatinase A, was shown to be correlated with ovarian cancer progression, with increased levels of this enzyme in peritoneal metastases being found to be associated with an increased risk of death in women with ovarian carcinoma (4Périgny M. Bairati I. Harvey I. Beauchemin M. Harel F. Plante M. Têtu B. Role of immunohistochemical overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-11 in the prognosis of death by ovarian cancer.Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2008; 129: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MMP2 functions as an early response regulator in ovarian cancer cells, facilitating and accelerating initial metastasis. Inhibition of MMP2 proteolytic activity or expression was thus found to delay ovarian cancer metastasis in a xenograft mouse model (5Kenny H.A. Lengyel E. MMP-2 functions as an early response protein in ovarian cancer metastasis.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). MMP2 expression is regulated by various transcription factors including PEA-3 and Foxp3 in ovarian cancer cells (6Davidson B. Goldberg I. Gotlieb W.H. Kopolovic J. Ben-Baruch G. Reich R.

Up-regulation of Foxp3 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in epithelial ovarian cancer.Cancer Lett. 2010; 287: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The transcription factor STAT3, which exists in a latent form in the cytosol, also regulates MMP2 expression through direct interaction with the MMP2 gene promoter (8Xie T.X. Wei D. Liu M. Gao A.C. Ali-Osman F. Sawaya R. Huang S. Stat3 activation regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tumor invasion and metastasis.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3550-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), with inhibition of STAT3 also resulting in down-regulation of MMP2 expression (9Huang C.

Inhibition of STAT3 activity with AG490 decreases the invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, STAT3 was found to be overexpressed in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer tissue, with constitutive activation of STAT3 signaling being implicated in invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer (10Huang M.

Lipoxygenase pathway metabolites and their cognate receptors have also been implicated in ovarian cancer progression (12Guo A.M. Liu X. Al-Wahab Z. Maddippati K.R. Ali-Fehmi R. Scicli A.G.

Lipoxygenase pathway receptor expression in ovarian cancer.Reprod. Sci. 2008; 15: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, expression of the leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptors BLT1 and BLT2 was found to be increased in ovarian cancer tissue compared with normal ovarian tissue and to be preferentially associated with advanced stage disease (13Rocconi R.P. Kirby T.O. Seitz R.S. Beck R. Straughn Jr., J.M. Alvarez R.D. Huh W.K. Lipoxygenase pathway receptor expression in ovarian cancer.Reprod. Sci. 2008; 15: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which BLT2 might contribute to ovarian cancer progression has remained unknown, however. We now show that increased BLT2 expression in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells results in activation of the STAT3-MMP2 axis and thereby promotes the invasiveness and metastasis of these cells. Furthermore, activation of NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (NOX4) and the consequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate activation of the STAT3-MMP2 axis by BLT2.

The PCR products were purified by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. For real time PCR analysis, cDNA derived from total RNA was subjected to PCR with the use of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Beams Biotechnology), and the data were analyzed with LightCycler software 3.3 (Roche Applied Science).

The activity of MMP2 in culture supernatants was assessed by gelatin zymography. In brief, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h, after which the conditioned medium was collected, mixed with Laemmli buffer without reducing agent, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel containing 0.2% gelatin. For detection of gelatinolytic activity, the gel was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and Brij-35 (200 μg/ml) and was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Cell invasiveness was assayed in duplicate with the use of BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) as described previously (19Kim E.Y. Seo J.M. Kim C. Lee J.E. Lee K.M. Kim J.H.

Med. 2010; 49: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells (4 × 104) were seeded on the Matrigel inserts in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The cells on the filters were fixed in methanol and stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and the contents of the upper surface were then removed before the number of invading cells on the lower chamber surface was counted in 10 random high power (×20) fields per filter with a light microscope. The cells plated in 60-mm dishes were subjected to measurement of intracellular H2O2. The actively growing cells were incubated for 10 min in the dark at 37 °C with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, after which dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). The animals were treated according to guidelines approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Korea University. Five-week-old female nude (BALB/c) mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were injected intraperitoneally with SKOV-3 cells for examination of their peritoneal metastatic potential (20Ponnusamy M.P. Lakshmanan I. Jain M. Das S. Chakraborty S. Dey P. Batra S.K. MUC4 mucin-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. A novel mechanism for metastasis of human ovarian cancer cells.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 5741-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells (5 × 106) were treated with 10 μm LY255283 or Me2SO vehicle for 3 h, isolated by exposure to 0.025% trypsin and 0.1% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution for injection in a volume of 0.1 ml with a 30-gauge needle. The mice (n = 8/group) were injected intraperitoneal with LY255283 (2.5 mg/kg) or Me2SO twice a week for 21 days beginning 14 days after the injection of cells. The number and extent of overt metastases were then quantified 35 days after cell injection. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test for comparisons among multiple groups or between two groups, respectively. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To elucidate the role of BLT2 in ovarian cancer progression, we first examined the expression of BLT1 and BLT2 in three ovarian cancer cell lines, including invasive CAOV-3 cells and the more invasive, aggressive OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and real time PCR analysis revealed that the abundance of BLT2 mRNA was markedly greater in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells than in CAOV-3 cells, whereas the amount of BLT1 mRNA was greater only in OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these results, the expression of BLT2 protein on the cell surface as determined by flow cytometry was significantly higher for OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells than for CAOV-3 cells (Fig. 1B). We next determined the levels of the BLT2 ligands LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE produced by the ovarian cancer cells. The amount of LTB4 was substantially greater in the culture supernatants of OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells than in those of CAOV-3 cells, whereas the amount of 12(S)-HETE was markedly increased in the culture supernatants of SKOV-3 cells and slightly increased in those of OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these results, immunoblot analysis revealed that the amounts of 5-LO and 12-LO, key enzymes in the synthesis of LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE, respectively, were greater in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells and SKOV-3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1D). Also, the amount of FLAP was slightly increased in SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 1D). As expected, a Matrigel invasion assay showed that the invasiveness of both OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells was much higher than that of CAOV-3 cells (Fig. 1E). Together, these results suggested that the increased expression of BLT2 in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells might contribute to the highly invasive phenotype of these cells. To investigate the potential role of BLT2 in the invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells, we examined the effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown of BLT2 on the invasive phenotype of these cells. Depletion of BLT2 resulted in marked inhibition of the invasiveness of both SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 2, A and D). Under these experimental conditions, the knockdown effects of BLT2 siRNA were clearly observed at the mRNA levels (Fig. 2, B and E) and the protein levels (Fig. 2, C and F). Similarly, treatment with the BLT2 antagonist LY255283, but not that with the BLT1 antagonist U75302, resulted in significant inhibition of the invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Also, knockdown of BLT2 did not affect the survival of these cells (supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that its effect on invasiveness is specific. Together, these results suggested that BLT2 is necessary for the highly invasive phenotype of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Increased levels of ROS have been shown to contribute to aspects of cancer progression, including cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis (21Liou G.Y. Storz P. Reactive oxygen species in cancer.Free Radic. Res. 2010; 44: 479-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 22Wu W.S. The signaling mechanism of ROS in tumor progression.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that ROS levels were significantly higher in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells than in CAOV-3 cells (data not shown). These increased ROS levels in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells were significantly reduced by treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine or with DPI, an inhibitor of flavoenzymes such as NOX (Fig. 3A). The invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells was also significantly inhibited by treatment with DPI or N-acetylcysteine (supplemental Fig. S2A), suggesting that NOX contributes to the generation of ROS and thereby promotes the invasiveness of these cells. We recently showed that NOX mediates BLT2-induced ROS generation and thereby promotes the tumorigenicity of various cancer cell types (19Kim E.Y. Seo J.M. Kim C. Lee J.E. Lee K.M. Kim J.H.

Up-regulation of BLT2 is critical for the survival of bladder cancer cells.Exp. Mol. Med. 2011; 43: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the increased ROS levels in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells might be due to NOX up-regulation. We found that NOX2 and NOX4 mRNAs are the dominant NOX mRNAs in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells (data not shown), and the amount of NOX4 mRNA, but not that of NOX2 mRNA (Fig. 3, C and D), and ROS levels (Fig. 3B) were significantly reduced as a result of LY255283 treatment or RNAi-mediated knockdown of BLT2 in these cells, suggesting that NOX4 likely functions downstream of BLT2 in ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with the suggested role for NOX4 in ROS generation, ROS levels were significantly reduced as a result of RNAi-mediated depletion of NOX4 mRNA, but not NOX2 mRNA, in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. S2B). The invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells was also significantly inhibited by depletion of NOX4, but not NOX2 (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data thus implicated a BLT2-NOX4-ROS pathway in regulation of the invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. MMP2 has been implicated in invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer cells (4Périgny M. Bairati I. Harvey I. Beauchemin M. Harel F. Plante M. Têtu B.

MMP-2 functions as an early response protein in ovarian cancer metastasis.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We therefore next examined whether MMP2 functions downstream of the BLT2-NOX4-ROS pathway in regulation of the invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of BLT2 by LY255283 treatment or BLT2 depletion by RNAi knockdown resulted in down-regulation of the amount of MMP2 mRNA (as shown by RT-PCR; Fig. 4A), the activity of MMP2 (as shown by zymography; Fig. 4A), and the promoter activity of the MMP2 gene (Fig. 4B) in both SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. However, the amount of MMP9 mRNA was not affected by these BLT2 inhibitions (Fig. 4A), suggesting the specificity of MMP2 as a downstream component of BLT2. Depletion of ROS by knockdown of NOX4 had similar effects (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, the invasiveness of SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells was greatly inhibited by RNAi-mediated depletion of MMP2 (Fig. 4E). To confirm that BLT2 contributes to the up-regulation of MMP2, we transiently transfected CAOV-3 cells, in which endogenous BLT2 is expressed at a relatively low level (Fig. 1A), with an expression vector for BLT2. Such overexpression of BLT2 resulted in a marked increase in the abundance of MMP2 mRNA as well as in that of NOX4 mRNA, and also the invasiveness was increased in these cells (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Together, these results suggested that the BLT2-NOX4-ROS signaling pathway up-regulates MMP2 in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells and thereby promotes cell invasiveness.

https://openalex.org/W2125879802,"Background Low adiponectin, a well-recognized antidiabetic adipokine, has been associated with obesity-related inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Globular adiponectin is an important regulator of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/NFκB pathway in monocytes of obese subjects. It protects against inflammation and oxidative stress by inducing IRAK3. microRNA (miR)-146b-5p inhibits NFκB-mediated inflammation by targeted repression of IRAK1 and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6). Therefore, we measured the expression of miR-146b-5p in monocytes of obese subjects. Because it was low we determined the involvement of this miR in the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and insulin signaling action of globular adiponectin. Methods miR-146b-5p expression in monocytes of obese subjects was determined by qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-146b-5p silencing on molecular markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin signaling and the association with globular adiponectin was assessed in human THP-1 monocytes. Results miR-146b-5p was downregulated in monocytes of obese persons. Low globular adiponectin decreased miR-146b-5p and IRAK3 in THP-1 monocytes, associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intracellular ROS and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) protein were unchanged. Silencing of miR-146b-5p with an antisense inhibitor resulted in increased expression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 leading to more NFκB p65 DNA binding activity and TNFα. As a response IRAK3 and IRS1 protein increased. Mitochondrial and intracellular ROS production did not increase despite more inflammation. In addition, exposure of miR-146b-5p-depleted THP-1 monocytes to high levels of globular adiponectin resulted in an increased production of TNFα and intracellular ROS. Still, they did not lose their potential to increase IRAK3 and IRS1 protein and to decrease mitochondrial ROS. Conclusion miR-146b-5p, decreased in monocytes during obesity, is a major mediator of the anti-inflammatory action of globular adiponectin. It appears not to be involved in insulin signaling possibly by protective response of IRAK3 and lack of mitochondrial ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2016847093,"Tight junctions mediate the intercellular diffusion barrier found in epithelial tissues but they are not static complexes; instead there is rapid movement of individual proteins within the junctions. In addition some tight junction proteins are continuously being endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane. Understanding the dynamic behaviour of tight junctions is important as they are altered in a range of pathological conditions including cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study we investigate the effect of treating epithelial cells with a small molecule inhibitor (YM201636) of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, a protein which is involved in endocytic trafficking. We show that MDCK cells treated with YM201636 accumulate the tight junction protein claudin-1 intracellularly. In contrast YM201636 did not alter the localization of other junction proteins including ZO-1, occludin and E-cadherin. A biochemical trafficking assay was used to show that YM201636 inhibited the endocytic recycling of claudin-1, providing an explanation for the intracellular accumulation. Claudin-2 was also found to constantly recycle in confluent MDCK cells and treatment with YM201636 blocked this recycling and caused accumulation of intracellular claudin-2. However, claudin-4 showed negligible endocytosis and no detectable intracellular accumulation occurred following treatment with YM201636, suggesting that not all claudins show the same rate of endocytic trafficking. Finally, we show that, consistent with the defects in claudin trafficking, incubation with YM201636 delayed formation of the epithelial permeability barrier. Therefore, YM201636 treatment blocks the continuous recycling of claudin-1/claudin-2 and delays epithelial barrier formation."
https://openalex.org/W2069491310,"Determinants of fatty liver (FL) might be predictive for further deterioration in insulin resistance (IR) in women with previous gestational diabetes (pGDM). The aim was to evaluate the association between pGDM, FL and future manifestation of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by a detailed pathophysiological characterization early after pregnancy.68 pGDM and 29 healthy controls were included 3-6 months after delivery and underwent specific metabolic assessments: status of IR was determined via oral- and intravenous-glucose-tolerance-tests with analysis of proinflammatory factors and kinetics of free-fatty-acids (FFA). According to the fatty-liver-index (FLI), pGDMs were categorized into three groups with low (FLI≤20), intermediate (20<FLI<60) and high (FLI≥60) risk for FL to assess differences in metabolic parameters at baseline as well as in the 10-year incidence for T2DM. Accuracy of FLI was proven with 1H-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy.FL was strongly associated with IR in pGDM. pGDM with FLI≥60 showed significantly increased interleukin-6, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1, tissue-plasminogen-activator, fibrinogen and increased ultrasensitive-C-reactive-protein compared to the low risk group (FLI≤20). Analysis of FFA indicated a less pronounced decrease of plasma FFA levels during the oral-glucose-tolerance-test in subjects with FLI≥60. History of GDM plus FLI≥60 conferred a high risk for the manifestation of diabetes over 10 years of observation as compared to pGDMs with FLI≤20 (HR:7.85, Cl:2.02-30.5, p = 0.003).FL is closely linked to GDM, especially to IR and inflammation. Most interestingly, subjects with the highest FLI values showed significant alterations in FFA kinetics and a higher risk to develop T2DM in future."
https://openalex.org/W2078336874,"Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is increasingly being appreciated as an intracellular signaling molecule that affects inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated arterial CO(2) (hypercapnia) is encountered in a range of clinical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and as a consequence of therapeutic ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In patients suffering from this syndrome, therapeutic hypoventilation strategy designed to reduce mechanical damage to the lungs is accompanied by systemic hypercapnia and associated acidosis, which are associated with improved patient outcome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of hypercapnia and the relative contribution of elevated CO(2) or associated acidosis to this response remain poorly understood. Recently, a role for the non-canonical NF-κB pathway has been postulated to be important in signaling the cellular transcriptional response to CO(2). In this study, we demonstrate that in cells exposed to elevated CO(2), the NF-κB family member RelB was cleaved to a lower molecular weight form and translocated to the nucleus in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549). Furthermore, elevated nuclear RelB was observed in vivo and correlated with hypercapnia-induced protection against LPS-induced lung injury. Hypercapnia-induced RelB processing was sensitive to proteasomal inhibition by MG-132 but was independent of the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β or MALT-1, both of which have been previously shown to mediate RelB processing. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RelB is a CO(2)-sensitive NF-κB family member that may contribute to the beneficial effects of hypercapnia in inflammatory diseases of the lung."

https://openalex.org/W1994666909,"ABCG2, encoding breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family and is often associated with cancer chemotherapeutic resistance. BCRP is also expressed in a variety of normal cells and acts as a xenobiotic efflux transporter. Because intestinal BCRP limits systemic exposure to xenobiotics, alterations in the function and expression of this transporter could account for part of the variation in oral drug absorption. In this study, we show that ATF4, a molecular component of the circadian clock, induces circadian expression of the Abcg2 gene in mouse small intestine. Three types of leader exons (termed exons 1A, 1B, and 1C) are identified in the 5'-untranslated region of mouse Abcg2 transcripts. The exon 1B-containing Abcg2 transcript was the only isoform detected in mouse small intestine, and its mRNA levels oscillated in a circadian time-dependent manner. ATF4 bound time-dependently to the cAMP response element within the exon 1B promoter region of the Abcg2 gene, thereby causing the oscillation of BCRP protein abundance and its efflux pump function. The circadian clock-ATF4 pathway appears to enhance the function of BCRP during a specific time window and to modulate intestinal drug absorption. Our findings suggest a mechanism underlying circadian change in xenobiotic detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W2080411666,"Chemokine-receptor interactions regulate leukocyte trafficking during inflammation. CC chemokines exist in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms. Although the monomers can activate chemokine receptors, dimerization is required for leukocyte recruitment in vivo, and it remains controversial whether dimeric CC chemokines can bind and activate their receptors. We have developed an obligate dimeric mutant of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by substituting Thr(10) at the dimer interface with Cys. Biophysical analysis showed that MCP-1(T10C) forms a covalent dimer with similar structure to the wild type MCP-1 dimer. Initial cell-based assays indicated that MCP-1(T10C) could activate chemokine receptor CCR2 with potency reduced 1 to 2 orders of magnitude relative to wild type MCP-1. However, analysis of size exclusion chromatography fractions demonstrated that the observed activity was due to a small proportion of MCP-1(T10C) being monomeric and highly potent, whereas the majority dimeric form could neither bind nor activate CCR2 at concentrations up to 1 μM. These observations help to reconcile previous conflicting results and indicate that dimeric CC chemokines do not bind to their receptors with affinities approaching those of the corresponding monomeric chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W1965114480,"One of the goals of plant breeding is to create crops to provide better nutrition for humans and livestock. Insufficient intake of protein is one of the most severe factors affecting the growth and development of children in developing countries. More than a century ago, in 1896, Hopkins initiated the well-known Illinois long-term selection for maize seed protein concentration, yielding four protein strains. By continuously accumulating QTLs, Illinois High Protein (IHP) reached a protein level 2.5-fold higher than normal maize, with the most increased fraction being the zein protein, which was shown to contain no lysine soon after the long-term selection program initiated. Therefore, IHP is of little value for feeding humans and monogastric animals. Although high-lysine lines of non-vitreous mutants were based on reduced zeins, the kernel soft texture precluded their practical use. Kernel hardness in opaque 2 (o2) could be restored in quality protein maize (QPM) with quantitative trait loci called o2 modifiers (Mo2s), but those did not increase total protein levels.The most predominant zeins are the 22- and 19-kDa α-zeins. To achieve a combination of desired traits, we used RNA interference (RNAi) against both α-zeins in IHP and evaluated the silencing effect by SDS-PAGE. Total protein, amino acid composition and kernel texture were analyzed.The α-zeins were dramatically reduced, but the high total seed protein level remained unchanged by complementary increase of non-zein proteins. Moreover, the residual zein levels still allowed for a vitreous hard seed. Such dramatic rebalancing of the nitrogen sink could have a major impact in world food supply."
https://openalex.org/W2014715682,"Phagocytosis is a crucial event in the immune system that allows cells to engulf and eliminate pathogens. This is mediated through the action of immunoglobulin (IgG)-opsonized microbes acting on Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on macrophages, which results in sustained levels of intracellular Ca(2+) through the mobilization of Ca(2+) second messengers. It is known that the ADP-ribosyl cyclase is responsible for the rise in Ca(2+) levels after FcγR activation. However, it is unclear whether and how CD38 is involved in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Here we show that CD38 is recruited to the forming phagosomes during phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles and produces cyclic-ADP-ribose, which acts on ER Ca(2+) stores, thus allowing an increase in FcγR activation-mediated phagocytosis. Ca(2+) data show that pretreatment of J774A.1 macrophages with 8-bromo-cADPR, ryanodine, blebbistatin, and various store-operated Ca(2+) inhibitors prevented the long-lasting Ca(2+) signal, which significantly reduced the number of ingested opsonized particles. Ex vivo data with macrophages extracted from CD38(-/-) mice also shows a reduced Ca(2+) signaling and phagocytic index. Furthermore, a significantly reduced phagocytic index of Mycobacterium bovis BCG was shown in macrophages from CD38(-/-) mice in vivo. This study suggests a crucial role of CD38 in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis through its recruitment to the phagosome and mobilization of cADPR-induced intracellular Ca(2+) and store-operated extracellular Ca(2+) influx."

First, we demonstrated that selection through an OCT4-EGFP reporter system can successfully increase the percentage of meiotic-competent, germ cell-like cells from spontaneously differentiating hESCs. Furthermore, we showed that the pluripotency associated surface marker, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), is also expressed in human fetal gonads and can be used as an effective selection marker for germ cell enrichment from differentiating hESCs. Combining OCT4 and EpCAM selection can further enrich the meiotic-competent germ cell-like cell population.

Recently, isolation of germ cells from human PSCs has been achieved using a transgenic VASA reporter (8Kee K. Angeles V.T. Flores M. Nguyen H.N. Reijo Pera R.A.

In addition to transgenic reporter systems, surface markers such as SSEA1 and others have also been used to enrich PGCs from differentiating hESCs or induced PSCs to a certain extent (10Park T.S.

These findings demonstrated the possibility of using a simple FACS strategy for germ cell enrichment. However, given the fact that these markers are also shared by other cell types (14Son M.J.

There are two pre-requisites to the elucidation of molecular pathways governing human germ cell specification in vitro from PSCs. The first is the identification of tracking markers that can effectively label precursors for germ cells as well as early germ cells, so that transition from ESC to germ cell fate can be monitored. However, even with an optimal tracking system, the number of cells may not be sufficient to perform detailed signaling analyses. An effective induction protocol for triggering hESCs to the germ cell fate, and thus increasing the absolute number of germ cells, is therefore the second prerequisite. It has been demonstrated in mice that BMP signaling, especially BMP4 expression from the extraembryonic ectoderm is sufficient for germ cell fate specification from WNT3A-expressing epiblasts (16Ohinata Y. Ohta H. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Wakayama T. Saitou M. A signaling principle for the specification of the germ cell lineage in mice.Cell. 2009; 137: 571-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In addition, during later germ cell development and migration, the SCF (KIT ligand from hindgut)-C-Kit (PGC expressing) signaling, and SDF1 (expressed alone the migratory route)-CXCR4 (PGC expressing) signaling pathways are not only important for motility of the germ cells but also for the survival and proliferation of the PGCs (17Nicholas C.R. Chavez S.L. Baker V.L. Reijo Pera R.A. Instructing an embryonic stem cell-derived oocyte fate. Lessons from endogenous oogenesis.Endocr. Rev. 2009; 30: 264-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whether these findings in mice are similar for human germline development remains to be explored. In this study, we aim to establish a reliable system to identify PGCs from differentiating hESCs to study the signaling pathways involved in human germline formation. According to the above mentioned criteria, we selected two pluripotent cell expressing markers, OCT4 and EpCAM, proved that they are both expressed in the germ cells of human fetal gonads, and tested the effectiveness of using individual and OCT4-EGFP/EpCAM combined selection platforms for enriching germ cell-like cells. Various combinations of cytokines for stimulating germ cell specification were tested, and the best combination, BMP4 and WNT3A, as well their downstream signaling pathways were examined. These strategies represent a significant step toward the efficient generation of early human germ cells for mechanistic studies. The H1 OCT4-GFP (XY), H9 (XX) (WiCell Research Institute Inc., Madison, WI), and NTU1(XX) (18Chen H.F. Kuo H.C. Chien C.L. Shun C.T. Yao Y.L. Ip P.L. Chuang C.Y. Wang C.C. Yang Y.S. Ho H.N.

See supplemental “Materials and Methods” for these methods. OCT4-EGFP hESCs were detached from feeder cells by treatment with dispase (0.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen), and transferred onto Ultra Low adhesion plates (Corning Costar) for embryoid body (EB) formation. The EBs were cultured in ESC medium for 2 days, then changed to differentiation medium, consisting of 82% DMEM (Invitrogen), 15% FBS (HyClone), 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) for another 4 days. The EBs were then transferred back onto gelatin-coated culture dishes in differentiation medium to allow attachment and spontaneous differentiation. To promote germ cell differentiation in vitro, different combinations of growth factors and cytokines/morphogenes were introduced to the induction medium. These included human BMP4, -7, and -8b (100 ng/ml) (20Kee K. Gonsalves J.M. Clark A.T. Pera R.A. Bone morphogenetic proteins induce germ cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.Stem.

To confirm the germ cell induction effect of BMP4 and WNT3A, their inhibitors, NOGGIN (100 ng/ml) and DKK1 (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech), were added to the differentiation medium, respectively. For a more detailed signaling study, DMH1 (2 μm; a BMP inhibitor) (21Hao J. Ho J.N. Lewis J.A. Karim K.A. Daniels R.N. Gentry P.R. Hopkins C.R. Lindsley C.W. Hong C.C.

Human fetal testes and ovaries were obtained following termination of pregnancy during the second trimester (12, 14, and 19 weeks for testes; 3 individuals from 18 to 19 weeks for ovaries collection). The developmental age was determined by recall of the last menstrual period and ultrasonographic measurement, and subtraction of 2 weeks to account for time of fetal development. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents, according to the protocol approved by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the National Taiwan University Hospital and the Internal Research Board (IRB) of Academia Sinica. Sorted cells were collected and fixed with Carnoy's fixative (1:3, acetic acid:methanol), then spread onto pre-cleaned slides and air dried. The hybridization of the FISH probes against chromosome 16 (CEP 16 SpectrumGreen), X (CEP X SpectrumOrange), and Y (CEP Y SpectrumAqua) (Vysis) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI II counterstains (Vysis). The post-FACS sorting of OCT4-EGFP/EpCAM double-positive cells from differentiation under BMP4/WNT3A conditions at in vitro differentiation (IVD) day 15 were mixed with the dissociated single cells of newborn ovaries from CD-1 female pups (The BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) according to the protocol generated by Nicholas et al. (2Nicholas C.R. Haston K.M. Grewall A.K. Longacre T.A. Reijo Pera R.A. Transplantation directs oocyte maturation from embryonic stem cells and provides a therapeutic strategy for female infertility.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4376-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Each graft containing at least 1–200,000 OCT4/EpCAM double-positive cells was transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of NOD-SCID mice (n = 4) using the method described from Mammary.nih.gov. 8 weeks after transplantation, host mice were sacrificed and the transplanted kidneys were retrieved, fixed, and sectioned for further histological analysis. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Academia Sinica and performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of Academia Sinica. To explore the hypothesis that OCT4 is retained in the germ cell population when hESCs differentiate, we generated an OCT4 promoter-EGFP hESC line by the lentiviral system to investigate the process of PGC derivation (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Initially, we observed EGFP expression confined to morphologically undifferentiated hESCs (Fig. 1B). During the course of IVD (Fig. 1C), the number of OCT4-EGFP+ cells gradually decreased from IVD day 4 as evidenced by a notable reduction of EGFP+ areas in EBs (Fig. 1D). After being re-plated onto the culture surface, we noted that patches of OCT4-EGFP+ cells were frequently present within or around the multisack structures (Fig. 1F) and absent from other known differentiated cell types (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 1D). The OCT4-EGFP+ cells were subsequently found mainly in floating or attached cell aggregates containing a mixture of EGFP+ and EGFP− cells at IVD day 20–30 (Fig. 1, F and G). Floating OCT4-EGFP+ cell aggregates occasionally attached to the culture surface and often formed cell colonies. Flow cytometry analysis of the differentiating OCT4-EGFP hESCs indicated that the OCT4-EGFP+ cell population decreased along with the progress of differentiation, which resulted in less than 10% EGFP+ cells remaining at IVD day 30 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we found that the majority of EGFP+ cells co-expressed endogenous OCT4 in both ES (99.3%) and IVD day 20 (74.1%) cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). These data demonstrated that EGFP was highly correlated to the endogenous OCT4 expression, and the reduction of EGFP reflected the down-regulation of OCT4 in hESC differentiation. To rule out the possibility that the EGFP-expressing cells observed in the IVD populations were due to contamination by undifferentiated hESCs, we compared the growth pattern of single OCT4-EGFP hESCs and their derivatives at IVD day 12 sorted by FACS. The results indicated that single OCT4-EGFP+ hESCs were able to form colonies and showed AP positive staining, whereas the day 12 differentiated OCT4-EGFP+ cells were unable to grow in ES culture conditions (supplemental Fig. 2C), indicating the OCT4-EGFP+ cells are likely to represent a germ cell population. To investigate whether the germ cell population is enriched in differentiated OCT4-EGFP+ cells, we performed Q-RT-PCR and IF staining on these cells (Fig. 2, B–D, and supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). The results from Q-RT-PCR showed that germ cell markers, OCT4, STELLA, DAZL, VASA, and meiotic marker SYCP3 have higher expression levels in sorted OCT4-EGFP+ cells compared with an unsorted population at various differentiation stages (Fig. 2B). In addition, many of the OCT4-EGFP+ cells from the floating or attached cell aggregates after 20 days of differentiation were stained positively for germ cell markers, VASA, STELLA, and DAZL (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). By quantifying the percentage of positive VASA, STELLA, and DAZL staining, we found that expression of the germ cell-specific marker VASA was around 7 times higher in OCT4-EGFP+ compared with OCT4-EGFP− cells, whereas a certain amount of enrichment was also observed in the germ cell-associated unspecific markers, STELLA and DAZL (Fig. 2D). We also noticed that the majority of germ cell marker positive but EGFP negative cells were present near the OCT4-EGFP+ cells (Fig, 2C). The expression of meiosis markers, SYCP1 and SYCP3, was also detected in the EGFP+ cell clumps (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that some derivatives of the OCT4-EGFP+ cells entered the meiotic cell cycle in vitro. There were around 30% SYCP3-positive cells in the OCT4-EGFP+ population, compared with less than 1% in the unpurified population. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the OCT4-EGFP selection process enriches early germ cell-like cells effectively. EpCAM has been found in the germ cells of mice and also positively regulates the pluripotency network including OCT4 in PSCs (19Huang H.P. Chen P.H. Yu C.Y. Chuang C.Y. Stone L. Hsiao W.C. Li C.L.

Shinohara T. Dynamic changes in EpCAM expression during spermatogonial stem cell differentiation in the mouse testis.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e23663Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that EpCAM is an appropriate surface marker to further enrich the germ cell population in combination with an OCT4 reporter. To confirm expression of the EpCAM in the human germ line, IF staining was performed in human fetal testes and ovaries (Fig. 3). In 12-, 14-, and 19-week old fetal testes, we found that EpCAM is expressed in germ cell clusters, indicated by their co-localization with OCT4, STELLA, DAZL, and VASA (Fig. 3A). A good correlation of EpCAM with germ cell markers, particularly VASA was also observed in three independent 18–19-week-old fetal ovarian tissues (Fig. 3B). To study whether EpCAM can be used to purify the hESC-derived germ cells, we isolated the EpCAM positive population from spontaneously differentiated hESCs by FACS and examined the RNA and protein expression patterns of the EpCAM+ cells. Our data showed that EpCAM is expressed in hESCs as described in previous studies (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S5A) (25Ng V.Y. Ang S.N. Chan J.X. Choo A.B. Characterization of epithelial cell adhesion molecule as a surface marker on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After differentiation, the percentage of EpCAM positive cells drops significantly but is still retained in a small population (19% at IVD 15, 7% at IVD 20, and around 3% at IVD 30) (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S5B). The EpCAM positive cells sorted from IVD 15 and 30 of H9 hESCs were subjected to Q-RT-PCR and showed that when compared with undifferentiated hESCs, expression levels of VASA (germ line) and SOX17 (endodermal marker) were higher in both IVD 15 and 30, whereas T (BRACHYURY; mesodermal marker) was temporarily increased in IVD 15 (Fig. 4B). In differentiated hESCs, EpCAM was co-expressed with OCT4, VASA, and SOX17, but not PAX6, as demonstrated by IF staining (Fig. 4C). Together, these results indicated that the hESC-differentiated EpCAM-positive population most likely represent germ line and early endodermal lineages. Having confirmed that EpCAM is a germ cell-enriched but not germ cell-specific marker, we further tested the effectiveness of using EpCAM alone and in combination with the OCT4-EGFP reporter to enrich a germ cell population from differentiating hESCs. As a comparison, we also included a previously published surface marker, SSEA1 (12Tilgner K. Atkinson S.P. Golebiewska A. Stojkovic M. Lako M. Armstrong L. Isolation of primordial germ cells from differentiating human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3075-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which has been used in enriching germ cell populations from differentiating hESCs. By comparing the gene expression of undifferentiated, IVD 15, and IVD 30 hESCs, we found that the expression level of germ cell-enriched genes STELLA, DAZL, VASA, and SYCP3 in OCT4+, EpCAM+, and double-positive cells to be higher than SSEA1+ or OCT4/SSEA1 double selected cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the expression level of the analyzed germ cell marker genes and the meiosis associated marker, SYCP3, is significantly higher in the OCT4+/EpCAM+ double selected population than the OCT4 single selected population of both male (H1) and female (H9) hESC lines (Fig. 5B). Also the OCT4/EpCAM double-positive cells were validated by IF staining for co-localization with STELLA and VASA (22 versus 8% of unpurified cells for STELLA; and 33% versus 3% of unpurified cells for VASA expression) (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, the above results demonstrate that the dual selection procedure can serve as an efficient readout for testing the effectiveness of germline induction conditions in vitro. Having confirmed that OCT4/EpCAM dual selection can effectively enrich a germ cell-like population from differentiating hESCs, we sought to investigate the factors assisting germ cell induction in vitro. We tested various combinations of cytokines in the differentiation medium based on what was known for mouse germ cell development in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6A, “Experimental Procedures”) (16Ohinata Y.

Among the various combinations tested, WNT3A, BMP4, BMP7 + BMP8b, and BMP4 + BMP7 + 8B had no significant effect on the number of OCT4/EpCAM double-positive cells in either H1 or H9 hESC lines. In contrast, the percentage of OCT4/EpCAM double-positive cells and the expression of germ cell-enriched genes were significantly increased when BMP4 and WNT3A were administered together on the first day of the differentiation procedure (Fig. 6A, supplemental Fig. S6 and supplemental Table 2). Introduction of SCF and SDF1 into the culture medium, either from the beginning of differentiation or 5 days after the initial induction of differentiation by BMP4 and WNT3A (two-step), did not further enhance the number of OCT4+/EpCAM+ cells (Fig. 6A). The synergistic effect between BMP4 and WNT3A induction was also verified by the reversal of germ cell differentiation when adding their respective antagonists, NOGGIN and DKK1 (supplemental Fig. S7). When comparing the percentage of positive VASA-stained cells in control (FBS), BMP4 + WNT3A, and BMP4 + WNT3A-treated OCT4+/EpCAM+ cells, the data also demonstrated that addition of both cytokines can facilitate the number of VASA positive cells, especially in the OCT4/EpCAM double-enriched population (31% in H1 and 47% in H9) (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W2132124004,"The multifunctional caspase-2 protein is involved in apoptosis, NF-κB regulation, and tumor suppression in mice. However, the mechanisms of caspase-2 responsible for tumor suppression remain unclear. Here we identified two sites of caspase-2, the catalytic Cys-320 site and the Ser-139 site, to be important for suppression of cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Using SV40- and K-Ras-transformed caspase-2 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cells reconstituted with expression of wild-type, catalytic dead (C320A), or Ser-139 (S139A) mutant caspase-2, we demonstrated that similar to caspase-2 deficiency, when Cys-320 and Ser-139 were mutated, caspase-2 lost its ability to inhibit cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. These mutant cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation, elevated clonogenic activity, accelerated anchorage-independent growth, and transformation and were highly tumorigenic, rapidly producing large tumors in athymic nude mice. Investigation into the underlying mechanism showed that these two residues are needed for caspase-2 to suppress NF-κB activity, promote apoptosis, and sustain the G(2)/M checkpoint following DNA damage induction. In addition, tumors in nude mice derived from the two mutant cell lines had higher constitutive NF-κB activity and elevated expression of NF-κB targets of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, XIAP, and cIAP2. A reduction in caspase-2 mRNA was associated with multiple types of cancers in patients. Together, these observations suggest the combined functions of caspase-2 in suppressing NF-κB activation, promoting apoptosis, and sustaining G(2)/M checkpoint contribute to caspase-2 tumor-suppressing function and that caspase-2 may also impact tumor suppression in humans. These findings provide insight into tumor suppression at the cross-roads of apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoint, and NF-κB pathways."

We found that both cellular and supernatant fractions from ActApo are required for DC maturation signaling. ActApoSup-induced CD80 and CD86 expression was significantly blocked in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Cell-cell contact-dependent signaling involved β2 integrins, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), and TLR4 because ActApo-induced up-regulation of the maturation markers CD80 and CD86 was significantly inhibited in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against CD18, CD11a, CD11b, and DC-SIGN as well as TLR4. The role of TLR4 was further confirmed by silencing of TLR4 in DCs. In addition, the endogenous adjuvant effect exerted by activated apoptotic splenocytes (ActApoSp) was reduced after immunization with human serum albumin in TLR4−/− mice. We detected activation of multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors in DCs upon co-culture with ActApo, including p38, JNK, PI3K-Akt, Src family kinases, NFκB p65, and AP1 transcription factor family members c-Jun and c-Fos, demonstrating the complex interactions occurring between ActApo and DCs. These studies provide important mechanistic insight into the responses of DCs during encounter with cells undergoing immunogenic cell death. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells playing a central role in connecting innate and adaptive immunity. Maturation signals are, however, required for DCs to undergo phenotypic and functional changes to acquire a fully competent antigen-presenting capacity.

https://openalex.org/W2066382358,"Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR) α is an inhibitory receptor that recognizes several ligands, including mouse CD99, PILR-associating neural protein, and Herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein B. The physiological function(s) of interactions between PILRα and its cellular ligands are not well understood, as are the molecular determinants of PILRα/ligand interactions. To address these uncertainties, we sought to identify additional PILRα ligands and further define the molecular basis for PILRα/ligand interactions. Here, we identify two novel PILRα binding partners, neuronal differentiation and proliferation factor-1 (NPDC1), and collectin-12 (COLEC12). We find that sialylated O-glycans on these novel PILRα ligands, and on known PILRα ligands, are compulsory for PILRα binding. Sialylation-dependent ligand recognition is also a property of SIGLEC1, a member of the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins. SIGLEC1 Ig domain shares ∼22% sequence identity with PILRα, an identity that includes a conserved arginine localized to position 97 in mouse and human SIGLEC1, position 133 in mouse PILRα and position 126 in human PILRα. We observe that PILRα/ligand interactions require conserved PILRα Arg-133 (mouse) and Arg-126 (human), in correspondence with a previously reported requirement for SIGLEC1 Arg-197 in SIGLEC1/ligand interactions. Homology modeling identifies striking similarities between PILRα and SIGLEC1 ligand binding pockets as well as at least one set of distinctive interactions in the galactoxyl-binding site. Binding studies suggest that PILRα recognizes a complex ligand domain involving both sialic acid and protein motif(s). Thus, PILRα is evolved to engage multiple ligands with common molecular determinants to modulate myeloid cell functions in anatomical settings where PILRα ligands are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2079987814,"The tertiary structures of theromacin and neuromacin confirmed the macin protein family as a self-contained family of antimicrobial proteins within the superfamily of scorpion toxin-like proteins. The macins, which also comprise hydramacin-1, are antimicrobially active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Despite high sequence identity, the three proteins showed distinct differences with respect to their biological activity. Neuromacin exhibited a significantly stronger capacity to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane of Bacillus megaterium than theromacin and hydramacin-1. Accordingly, it is the only macin that displays pore-forming activity and that was potently active against Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, neuromacin and hydramacin-1 led to an aggregation of bacterial cells that was not observed with theromacin. Analysis of the molecular surface properties of macins allowed confirmation of the barnacle model as the mechanistic model for the aggregation effect. Besides being antimicrobially active, neuromacin and theromacin, in contrast to hydramacin-1, were able to enhance the repair of leech nerves ex vivo. Notably, all three macins enhanced the viability of murine neuroblastoma cells, extending their functional characteristics. As neuromacin appears to be both a functional and structural chimera of hydramacin-1 and theromacin, the putative structural correlate responsible for the nerve repair capacity in leech was located to a cluster of six amino acid residues using the sequence similarity of surface-exposed regions."

However, the expression patterns of ZEB2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its effect on prognosis of HCC patients treated with hepatectomy are unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the methods of tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to investigate ZEB2 expression in HCC and peritumoral liver tissue (PLT). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the data. Up-regulated expression of cytoplasmic/nuclear ZEB2 protein was observed in the majority of PLTs, when compared to HCCs. Further analysis showed that overexpression of cytoplasmic ZEB2 in HCCs was inversely correlated with AFP level, tumor size and differentiation (P<0.05). Also, overexpression of cytoplasmic ZEB2 in PLTs correlated with lower AFP level (P<0.05). In univariate survival analysis, a significant association between overexpression of cytoplasmic ZEB2 by HCCs/PLTs and longer patients' survival was found (P<0.05). Importantly, cytoplasmic ZEB2 expression in PLTs was evaluated as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P<0.05). Consequently, a new clinicopathologic prognostic model with cytoplasmic ZEB2 expression (including HCCs and PLTs) was constructed. The model could significantly stratify risk (low, intermediate and high) for overall survival (P = 0.002). Conclusions/Significance Our findings provide a basis for the concept that cytoplasmic ZEB2 expressed by PLTs can predict the postoperative survival of patients with HCC. The combined cytoplasmic ZEB2 prognostic model may become a useful tool for identifying patients with different clinical outcomes."

PC1/3 KO mice have an enlarged spleen with marked disorganization of the marginal zone and red pulp. Immunohistochemical studies using various markers demonstrate a depletion of dendritic cells in PC1/3 KO spleens. When challenged with lipopolysaccharide, PC1/3 KO mice are more susceptible to septic shock than wild-type controls or other PC KO mice, such as PC2 and PC7 null mice.

NA/C6 interaction leads to increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src, FAK, Akt, GSK3β, and Bcl-2, which affects cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. siRNA-mediated suppression of C6 resulted in a down-regulation of activated Src, FAK, and Akt, increased apoptosis, and reduced expression of viral proteins and viral titers in influenza virus-infected human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial and normal human bronchial epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2005915035,"The pathways whereby Sox2 scans DNA to locate its specific binding site are investigated by NMR in specific and nonspecific Sox2·DNA complexes and in a specific ternary complex with Oct1 on the Hoxb1 regulatory element. Direct transfer of Sox2 between nonspecific sites on different DNA molecules occurs without dissociation into free solution at a rate of ∼10(6) M(-1) s(-1), whereas one-dimensional sliding proceeds with a diffusion constant of ≥0.1 μm(2)·s(-1). Translocation of Sox2 from one specific DNA site to another occurs via jumping, involving complete dissociation into free solution (k(d) ∼5-6 s(-1)) followed by reassociation (k(a) ∼5 × 10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). In the presence of Oct1 bound to an adjacent specific site, k(d) is reduced by more than 10-fold. Paramagnetic relaxation measurements, however, demonstrate that sparsely populated (<1%), transient states involving nonspecifically bound Sox2 in rapid exchange with specifically bound Sox2 are sampled in both binary Sox2·DNA- and ternary Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA-specific complexes. Moreover, Sox2 modulates the mechanism of translocation of Oct1. Both Sox2 and the Oct1 POU(HD) domain are transiently released from the specific ternary complex by sliding to an adjacent nonspecific site, followed by direct transfer to another DNA molecule, whereas the Oct1 POU(S) domain is fixed to its specific site through direct interactions with Sox2. Intermolecular translocation of POU(HD) results in the formation of a bridged intermediate spanning two DNA molecules, enhancing the probability of complete intermolecular translocation of Oct1. By way of contrast, in the specific Oct1·DNA binary complex, POU(S) undergoes direct intermolecular translocation, whereas POU(HD) scans the DNA by sliding."
https://openalex.org/W2080109084,"Alcohol treatment induces oxidative stress by a combination of increased production of partially reduced oxygen species and decreased cellular antioxidant pool, including GSH. Recently, we showed that mitochondrion-targeted CYP2E1 augments alcohol-mediated toxicity, causing an increase in reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress. Here, we show that cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal oxidase of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a critical target of CYP2E1-mediated alcohol toxicity. COS-7 and Hep G2 cell lines expressing predominantly mitochondrion-targeted (Mt(++)) CYP2E1 and livers from alcohol-treated rats showed loss of CcO activity and increased protein carbonylation, which was accompanied by a decline in the steady state levels of subunits I, IVI1, and Vb of the CcO complex. This was also accompanied by reduced mitochondrial DNA content and reduced mitochondrial mRNA. These changes were more prominent in Mt(++) cells in comparison with wild type (WT) CYP2E1-expressing or ER(+) (mostly microsome-targeted) cells. In addition, mitochondrion-specific antioxidants, ubiquinol conjugated to triphenyl phosphonium, triphenylphosphonium conjugated carboxyl proxyl, and the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide prevented the loss of CcO activity and the CcO subunits, most likely through reduced oxidative damage to the enzyme complex. Our results suggest that damage to CcO and dissociation of respirosome complexes are critical factors in alcohol-induced toxicity, which is augmented by mitochondrion-targeted CYP2E1. We propose that CcO is one of the direct and immediate targets of alcohol-induced toxicity causing respiratory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2000665189,"Recent research has shown that the presence of a task-irrelevant attractive face can induce a transient diversion of attention from a perceptual task that requires covert deployment of attention to one of the two locations. However, it is not known whether this spontaneous appraisal for facial beauty also modulates attention in change detection among multiple locations, where a slower, and more controlled search process is simultaneously affected by the magnitude of a change and the facial distinctiveness. Using the flicker paradigm, this study examines how spontaneous appraisal for facial beauty affects the detection of identity change among multiple faces.Participants viewed a display consisting of two alternating frames of four faces separated by a blank frame. In half of the trials, one of the faces (target face) changed to a different person. The task of the participant was to indicate whether a change of face identity had occurred. The results showed that (1) observers were less efficient at detecting identity change among multiple attractive faces relative to unattractive faces when the target and distractor faces were not highly distinctive from one another; and (2) it is difficult to detect a change if the new face is similar to the old.The findings suggest that attractive faces may interfere with the attention-switch process in change detection. The results also show that attention in change detection was strongly modulated by physical similarity between the alternating faces. Although facial beauty is a powerful stimulus that has well-demonstrated priority, its influence on change detection is easily superseded by low-level image similarity. The visual system appears to take a different approach to facial beauty when a task requires resource-demanding feature comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W1980565096,"DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome that regulates crucial aspects of gene function. Mammalian cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) often results in gestational or neonatal failure with only a small proportion of manipulated embryos producing live births. Many of the embryos that survive to term later succumb to a variety of abnormalities that are likely due to inappropriate epigenetic reprogramming. Aberrant methylation patterns of imprinted genes in cloned cattle and mice have been elucidated, but few reports have analyzed the cloned pig genome. Four surviving cloned sows that were created by ear fibroblast nuclear transfer, each with a different life span and multiple organ defects, such as heart defects and bone growth delay, were used as epigenetic study materials. First, we identified four putative differential methylation regions (DMR) of imprinted genes in the wild-type pig genome, including two maternally imprinted loci (INS and IGF2) and two paternally imprinted loci (H19 and IGF2R). Aberrant DNA methylation, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation, commonly appeared in H19 (45% of imprinted loci hypermethylated vs. 30% hypomethylated), IGF2 (40% vs. 0%), INS (50% vs. 5%), and IGF2R (15% vs. 45%) in multiple tissues from these four cloned sows compared with wild-type pigs. Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic modifications occur frequently in the genome of cloned swine. Even with successful production of cloned swine that avoid prenatal or postnatal death, the perturbation of methylation in imprinted genes still exists, which may be one of reason for their adult pathologies and short life. Understanding the aberrant pattern of gene imprinting would permit improvements in future cloning techniques."

This system is also involved in the cytokinetic processes of all eukaryotic cells. Myxozoan parasites are known for the disease they cause in economical important fishes. Usually, their pathology is related to rapid proliferation in the host. However, the sequences of their development are still poorly understood, especially with regard to pre-sporogonic proliferation mechanisms. The present work employs light microscopy (LM), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in combination with specific stains (Nile Red, DAPI, Phalloidin), to study the three-dimensional morphology, motility, ultrastructure and cellular composition of Ceratomyxa puntazzi, a myxozoan inhabiting the bile of the sharpsnout seabream. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of two C. puntazzi developmental cycles in the bile, i.e. pre-sporogonic proliferation including frequent budding as well as sporogony, resulting in the formation of durable spore stages and we provide unique details on the ultrastructure and the developmental sequence of bile inhabiting myxozoans. The present study describes, for the first time, the cellular components and mechanisms involved in the motility of myxozoan proliferative stages, and reveals how the same elements are implicated in the processes of budding and cytokinesis in the Myxozoa. We demonstrate that F-actin rich cytoskeletal elements polarize at one end of the parasites and in the filopodia which are rapidly de novo created and re-absorbed, thus facilitating unidirectional parasite motility in the bile. We furthermore discover the myxozoan mechanism of budding as an active, polarization process of cytokinesis, which is independent from a contractile ring and thus differs from the mechanism, generally observed in eurkaryotic cells. We hereby demonstrate that CLSM is a powerful tool for myxozoan research with a great potential for exploitation, and we strongly recommend its future use in combination with in vivo stains."
https://openalex.org/W1973149124,"Trypanosomatids' amino acid permeases are key proteins in parasite metabolism since they participate in the adaptation of parasites to different environments. Here, we report that TcAAP3, a member of a Trypanosoma cruzi multigene family of permeases, is a bona fide arginine transporter. Most higher eukaryotic cells incorporate cationic amino acids through a single transporter. In contrast, T. cruzi can recognize and transport cationic amino acids by mono-specific permeases since a 100-fold molar excess of lysine could not affect the arginine transport in parasites that over-express the arginine permease (TcAAP3 epimastigotes). In order to test if the permease activity regulates downstream processes of the arginine metabolism, the expression of the single T. cruzi enzyme that uses arginine as substrate, arginine kinase, was evaluated in TcAAP3 epimastigotes. In this parasite model, intracellular arginine concentration increases 4-folds and ATP level remains constant until cultures reach the stationary phase of growth, with decreases of about 6-folds in respect to the controls. Interestingly, Western Blot analysis demonstrated that arginine kinase is significantly down-regulated during the stationary phase of growth in TcAAP3 epimastigotes. This decrease could represent a compensatory mechanism for the increase in ATP consumption as a consequence of the displacement of the reaction equilibrium of arginine kinase, when the intracellular arginine concentration augments and the glucose from the medium is exhausted. Using immunofluorescence techniques we also determined that TcAAP3 and the specific lysine transporter TcAAP7 co-localize in a specialized region of the plasma membrane named flagellar pocket, staining a single locus close to the flagellar pocket collar. Taken together these data suggest that arginine transport is closely related to arginine metabolism and cell energy balance. The clinical relevance of studying trypanosomatids' permeases relies on the possibility of using these molecules as a route of entry of therapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2031245717,"Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected necrotizing disease of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and bone, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. BU pathogenesis is associated with mycolactone, a lipidic exotoxin with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties. Since 2004, the World Health Organization recommends the treatment of BU with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin (RS). Histological analysis of human tissue samples suggests that such antibiotic treatment reverses the mycolactone-induced local immunosuppression, leading to increased inflammatory infiltrations and phagocytosis of bacilli.We used a mouse model of M. ulcerans footpad infection, followed by combined RS treatment. Time-lapsed analyses of macroscopic lesions, bacterial burdens, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed in footpads. We also performed CFU counts, histology and immunohistochemistry in the popliteal draining lymph nodes (DLN). We observed a shift in the cellular infiltrates from a predominantly neutrophilic/macrophagic to a lymphocytic/macrophagic profile in the infected footpads of antibiotic-treated mice. This shift occurred before the elimination of viable M. ulcerans organisms, which were ultimately eradicated as demonstrated by the administration of dexamethasone. This reduction of bacillary loads was accompanied by an increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2 or iNOS). Predominantly mononuclear infiltrates persisted in the footpads during and after treatment, coincident with the long persistence of non-viable poorly stained acid-fast bacilli (AFB). We additionally observed that antibiotherapy prevented DLN destruction and lymphocyte depletion, which occurs during untreated experimental infections.Early RS treatment of M. ulcerans mouse footpad infections results in the rapid elimination of viable bacilli with pathogen eradication. However, non-viable AFB persisted for several months after lesion sterilization. This RS regimen prevented DLN destruction, allowing the rapid re-establishment of local and regional cell mediated immune responses associated with macrophage activation. Therefore it is likely that this re-establishment of protective cellular immunity synergizes with antibiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975987892,"Introduction Head lice infestations cause distress in many families. A well-founded strategy to reduce head lice prevalence must shorten the infectious period of individual hosts. To develop such a strategy, information about the actions taken (inspection, treatment and informing others about own infestations), level of knowledge and costs is needed. The present study is the first to consider all these elements combined. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was answered by 6203 households from five geographically separated municipalities in Norway. Results 94% of the households treated members with pediculicides when head lice were discovered. Nearly half of the households checked biannually or not at all. Previous occurrence of head lice and multiple children in a household improved both checking frequency and method. More than 90% of the households informed close contacts about their own pediculosis. Direct costs of pediculosis were low (less than €6.25 yearly) for 70% of the households, but the ability to pay for pediculicides decreased with the number of head lice infestations experienced. One in three households kept children from school because of pediculosis. Other widespread misconceptions, such as that excessive cleaning is necessary to fight head lice, may also add unnecessary burden to households. School affiliation had a significant effect on checking frequency and method, knowledge and willingness to inform others about own pediculosis. Conclusions Increased checking frequencies appear to be the most important element to reduce head lice prevalence in Norway and should be a primary focus of future strategies. National campaigns directed through schools to individual households, might be an important tool to achieve this goal. In addition to improving actions taken, such campaigns should also provide accurate information to reduce costs and enhance the level of knowledge about head lice in households."
https://openalex.org/W2072208556,"The linker for activation of T cells (LAT), the linker for activation of B cells (LAB), and the linker for activation of X cells (LAX) form a family of transmembrane adaptor proteins widely expressed in lymphocytes. These scaffolding proteins have multiple binding motifs that, when phosphorylated, bind the SH2 domain of the cytosolic adaptor Grb2. Thus, the valence of LAT, LAB and LAX for Grb2 is variable, depending on the strength of receptor activation that initiates phosphorylation. During signaling, the LAT population will exhibit a time-varying distribution of Grb2 valences from zero to three. In the cytosol, Grb2 forms 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. The 2:1 complex can bridge two LAT molecules when each Grb2, through their SH2 domains, binds to a phosphorylated site on a separate LAT. In T cells and mast cells, after receptor engagement, receptor phosphoyrlation is rapidly followed by LAT phosphorylation and aggregation. In mast cells, aggregates containing more than one hundred LAT molecules have been detected. Previously we considered a homogeneous population of trivalent LAT molecules and showed that for a range of Grb2, SOS1 and LAT concentrations, an equilibrium theory for LAT aggregation predicts the formation of a gel-like phase comprising a very large aggregate (superaggregate). We now extend this theory to investigate the effects of a distribution of Grb2 valence in the LAT population on the formation of LAT aggregates and superaggregate and use stochastic simulations to calculate the fraction of the total LAT population in the superaggregate."

https://openalex.org/W2090448900,"Cell fate and proliferation are tightly linked to the regulation of the mitochondrial energy metabolism. Hence, mitochondrial biogenesis regulation, a complex process that requires a tight coordination in the expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, has a major impact on cell fate and is of high importance. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis through a nutrient-sensing pathway, the Ras-cAMP pathway. Activation of this pathway induces a decrease in the cellular phosphate potential that alleviates the redox pressure on the mitochondrial respiratory chain. One of the cellular consequences of this modulation of cellular phosphate potential is an increase in the cellular glutathione redox state. The redox state of the glutathione disulfide-glutathione couple is a well known important indicator of the cellular redox environment, which is itself tightly linked to mitochondrial activity, mitochondria being the main cellular producer of reactive oxygen species. The master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in yeast (i.e. the transcriptional co-activator Hap4p) is positively regulated by the cellular glutathione redox state. Using a strain that is unable to modulate its glutathione redox state (Δglr1), we pinpoint a positive feedback loop between this redox state and the control of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is the first time that control of mitochondrial biogenesis through glutathione redox state has been shown."
https://openalex.org/W2012251585,"The use of in vitro models to unravel the phenotypic characteristics of circulating viral variants is key to understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis but limited by the availability of primary viral isolates from biological samples. However, overall in vivo genetic variability of HIV-1 within a subject may not be reflected in the viable viral population obtained after isolation. Although several studies have tried to determine whether viral populations expanded in vitro are representative of in vivo findings, the answer remains unclear due to the reduced number of clonal sequences analyzed or samples compared. In order to overcome previous experimental limitations, here we applied Deep Pyrosequencing (DPS) technology in combination with phenotypic experiments to analyze and compare with unprecedented detail the composition of viral isolates and in vivo quasispecies.We amplified by DPS HIV-1 genomic regions covering gag, protease, integrase and env-V3 to characterize paired isolates from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and compare them with total plasma viral RNA in four recently HIV-1 infected subjects. Our study demonstrated the presence of unique haplotypes scattered between sample types with conservation of major variants. In addition, no differences in intra- and inter-population encoded protein variability were found between the different types of isolates or when these were compared to plasma viral RNA within subjects. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated phenotypic similarities in terms of replicative capacity and co-receptor usage between viral isolates and plasma viral RNA.This study is the first in-depth comparison and characterization of viral isolates from different sources and plasma circulating quasispecies using DPS in recently HIV-1 infected subjects.

Leptospires in the kidney samples were detected using culture isolation, qPCR and the IM, and quantified using qPCR and the IM. In both the acute and chronic infection models, the correlation between quantification by qPCR and the IM was found to be positive and statistically significant (P<0.05). Therefore, this study demonstrates that the IM is a viable alternative for not only the detection but also the quantification of leptospires, particularly when the use of qPCR is not feasible."

In this study, we investigated the effect of relative attractiveness on pair-bond behaviour in bearded reedlings, Panurus biarmicus. We showed that mate attractiveness, in terms of beard length in males and tail length in females, influenced courtship behaviour when the pair was kept isolated. In the presence of a conspecific, contact initiations within a pair increased. This increment was mainly related to the sex of the unpaired conspecific, however, and less to differences in attractiveness between the current partner and the unpaired conspecific. Female contact initiations towards potential extra mates were independent of male attractiveness, whereas male contact behaviour was significantly influenced by female attractiveness. However, females displayed more contact initiations to their current mate when they were less attractive than the unpaired females. Males decreased their overtures towards other females with increasing attractiveness of their current mates. Overall, our results suggested that, when there was a risk of losing their mate, bearded reedlings adjust their pair-bond investment mainly in response to the presence or absence of a competitor, and fine-tune investment to a lesser extent in response to the attractiveness of that potential competitor."
https://openalex.org/W2028184978,"Recent evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that active CMV infection may result in more benign clinical disease. The goal of this pilot study was to determine whether underlying murine CMV (MCMV) infection affects the course of the Theiler's murine encephalitis virus (TMEV) induced murine model of MS. A group of eight TMEV-infected mice were co-infected with MCMV at 2 weeks prior to TMEV infection while a second group of TMEV-infected mice received MCMV two weeks post TMEV. We also used 2 control groups, where at the above time points MCMV was replaced with PBS. Outcome measures included (1) monthly monitoring of disability via rotarod for 8 months; (2) in vivo MRI for brain atrophy studies and (3) FACS analysis of brain infiltrating lymphocytes at 8 months post TMEV infection. Co-infection with MCMV influenced the disease course in mice infected prior to TMEV infection. In this group, rotarod detectable motor performance was significantly improved starting 3 months post-infection and beyond (p≤0.024). In addition, their brain atrophy was close to 30% reduced at 8 months, but this was only present as a trend due to low power (p = 0.19). A significant reduction in the proportion of brain infiltrating CD3+ cells was detected in this group (p = 0.026), while the proportion of CD45+ Mac1+ cells significantly increased (p = 0.003). There was also a strong trend for a reduced proportion of CD4+ cells (p = 0.17) while CD8 and B220+ cell proportion did not change. These findings support an immunomodulatory effect of MCMV infection in this MS model. Future studies in this co-infection model will provide insight into mechanisms which modulate the development of demyelination and may be utilized for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2083946512,"The relative length of the second-to-fourth digits (2D:4D) has been linked with prenatal androgen in humans. The 2D:4D is sexually dimorphic, with lower values in males than females, and appears to correlate with diverse measures of behavior. However, the relationship between digit ratio and cognition, and spatial cognition in particular, has produced mixed results. In the present study, we hypothesized that spatial tasks separating cue conditions that either favored female or male strategies would examine this structure-function correlation with greater precision. Previous work suggests that males are better in the use of directional cues than females. In the present study, participants learned a target location in a virtual landscape environment, in conditions that contained either all directional (i.e., distant or compass bearing) cues, or all positional (i.e., local, small objects) cues. After a short delay, participants navigated back to the target location from a novel starting location. Males had higher accuracy in initial search direction than females in environments with all directional cues. Lower digit ratio was correlated with higher accuracy of initial search direction in females in environments with all directional cues. Mental rotation scores did not correlate with digit ratio in either males or females. These results demonstrate for the first time that a sex difference in the use of directional cues, i.e., the sense of direction, is associated with more male-like digit ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2149181497,"Disruption of the polyubiquitin gene Ubc leads to a defect in fetal liver development, which can be partially rescued by increasing the amount of ubiquitin. However, it is still not known why Ubc is required for fetal liver development and the nature of the defective cell types responsible for embryonic lethality have not been characterized. In this study, we assessed the cause of embryonic lethality with respect to the fetal liver hematopoietic system. We found that Ubc was highly expressed in the embryonic liver, and the proliferation capacity of fetal liver cells was reduced in Ubc(-/-) embryos. Specifically, Ubc was most highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, and the proliferation capacity of hematopoietic cells was significantly impaired in Ubc(-/-) embryos. While hematopoietic cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) frequency was maintained in Ubc(-/-) embryos, the absolute number of these cells was diminished because of reduced total liver cell number in Ubc(-/-) embryos. Transplantations of fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice by non-competitive and competitive reconstitution methods indicated that disruption of Ubc does not significantly impair the intrinsic function of fetal liver HSCs. These findings suggest that disruption of Ubc reduces the absolute number of HSCs in embryonic livers, but has no significant effect on the autonomous function of HSCs. Thus, the lethality of Ubc(-/-) embryos is not the result of intrinsic HSC failure."
https://openalex.org/W2008584523,"Differences in day length may act as a critical factor in bird biology by introducing time constraints in energy acquisition during winter. Thus, differences in day length might operate as a main determinant of bird abundance along latitudinal gradients. This work examines the influence of day length on the abundance of wintering crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) in 26 localities of Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) dwarf woodlands (average height of 5 m) located along a latitudinal gradient in the Spanish highlands, while controlling for the influence of food availability, minimum night temperature, habitat structure and landscape characteristics. Top regression models in the AIC framework explained 56% of variance in bird numbers. All models incorporated day length as the variable with the highest magnitude effect. Food availability also played an important role, although only the crop of ripe juniper fruits, but not arthropods, positively affected crested tit abundance. Differences in vegetation structure across localities had also a strong positive effect (average tree height and juniper tree density). Geographical variation in night temperature had no influence on crested tit distribution, despite the low winter temperatures reached in these dwarf forests. This paper demonstrates for the first time that winter bird abundance increases with day length after controlling for the effect of other environmental variables. Winter average difference in day length was only 10.5 minutes per day along the 1°47' latitudinal interval (190 km) included in this study. This amount of time, which reaches 13.5 h accumulated throughout the winter season, appears to be large enough to affect the long-term energy budget of small passerines during winter and to shape the distribution of winter bird abundance under restrictive environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2061905228,"T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is known to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities that lead to aberrant expression of a number of transcription factors such as TAL1, which dimerizes with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) E proteins and inhibits their function. Activated Notch receptors also efficiently induce T cell leukemogenesis in mouse models. Interestingly, gain-of-function mutations or cryptic transcription initiation of the Notch1 gene have been frequently found in both human and mouse T-ALL. However, the correlations between these alterations and overall Notch activities or leukemogenesis have not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, we made use of our collection of T cell lymphomas developed in transgenic mice expressing Id1, which like TAL1, inhibits E protein function. By comparing expression levels of Notch target genes in Id1-expressing tumors to those in tumors induced by a constitutively active form of Notch1, N1C, we were able to assess the overall activities of Notch pathways and conclude that the majority of Id1-expressing tumors had elevated Notch function to a varying degree. However, 26% of the Id1-expressing tumors had no evidence of enhanced Notch activation, but that did not delay the onset of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we examined the genetic or epigenetic alterations thought to contribute to ligand-independent activation or protein stabilization of Notch1 and found that some of the Id1-expressing tumors acquired these changes, but they are not uniformly associated with elevated Notch activities in Id1 tumor samples. In contrast, N1C-expressing tumors do not harbor any PEST domain mutations nor exhibit intragenic transcription initiation. Taken together, it appears that Notch activation provides Id1-expressing tumor cells with selective advantages in growth and survival. However, this may not be absolutely essential for lymphomagenesis in Id1 transgenic mice and additional factors could also cooperate with Id1 to induce T cell lymphoma. Therefore, a broad approach is necessary in designing T-ALL therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2097434465,"Apoptosis allows for the removal of damaged, aged, and/or excess cells without harm to surrounding tissue. To accomplish this, cells undergoing apoptosis acquire new activities that enable them to modulate the fate and function of nearby cells. We have shown that receptor-mediated recognition of apoptotic versus necrotic target cells by viable kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) modulates the activity of several signaling pathways critically involved in regulation of proliferation and survival. Generally, apoptotic and necrotic targets have opposite effects with apoptotic targets inhibiting and necrotic targets stimulating the activity of these pathways. Here we explore the consequences of these signaling differences. We show that recognition of apoptotic targets induces a profound decrease in PTEC viability through increased responder cell death and decreased proliferation. In contrast, necrotic targets promote viability through decreased death and increased proliferation. Both target types mediate their effects through a network of Akt-dependent and -independent events. Apoptotic targets modulate Akt-dependent viability in part through a reduction in cellular β-catenin and decreased inactivation of Bad. In contrast, Akt-independent modulation of viability occurs through activation of caspase-8, suggesting that death receptor-dependent pathways are involved. Apoptotic targets also activate p38, which partially protects responders from target-induced death. The response of epithelial cells varies depending on their tissue origin. Some cell lines, like PTEC, demonstrate decreased viability, whereas others (e.g. breast-derived) show increased viability. By acting as sentinels of environmental change, apoptotic targets allow neighboring cells, especially non-migratory epithelial cells, to monitor and potentially adapt to local stresses."
