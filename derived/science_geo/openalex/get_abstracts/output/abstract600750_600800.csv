For effective tumor killing, CD8 + T cells recognize tumor peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules. In humans, there are three major HLA-I genes ( HLA-A, HLA-B , and HLA-C ). Chowell et al. asked whether germline HLA-I genotype influences how T cells recognize tumor peptides and respond to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies (see the Perspective by Kvistborg and Yewdell). They examined more than 1500 patients and found that heterozygosity at HLA-I loci was associated with better survival than homozygosity for one or more HLA-I genes. Thus, specific HLA-I mutations could have implications for immune recognition and for the design of epitopes for cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. 582 ; see also p. 516"

Although progenitor cells spin off new neurons in a seemingly organized fashion, the devil is in the details. Nowakowski et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of single cells from the developing brain to elucidate the hidden complexity of brain construction. For each cell, its position within the brain matters, as well as what type of neuron is being made at what point during overall development. These individual expression patterns result in organized diversity in the brain's cortex. Science , this issue p. 1318"

Bae et al. examined the genomes of single neurons from the prenatal developing human brain. Both the type of mutation and the rates of accumulation changed between gastrulation and neurogenesis. These early mutations could be generating useful neuronal diversity or could predispose individuals to later dysfunction. Lodato et al. also found that neurons take on somatic mutations as they age by sequencing single neurons from subjects aged 4 months to 82 years.

Zajac et al. built an efficient CNOT gate by using electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, an implementation that is especially appealing because of its compatibility with existing semiconductor-based electronics (see the Perspective by Schreiber and Bluhm).

Excitonic condensation has been studied in systems such as quantum Hall bilayers where physical separation between electrons and holes enables a longer lifetime for their bound states. Kogar et al. observed excitons condensing in the three-dimensional semimetal 1 T -TiSe 2 . In such systems, distinguishing exciton condensation from other types of order is tricky. To do so, the authors used momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy, a technique developed to probe electronic collective excitations. The energy needed to excite an electronic mode became negligible at a finite momentum, signifying the formation of a condensate. Science , this issue p. 1314"

The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Although there is strong evidence showing that apoE4 enhances amyloid pathology, it is not clear what the critical stage(s) is during amyloid development in which apoE4 has the strongest impact. Using apoE inducible mouse models, we show that increased expression of astrocytic apoE4, but not apoE3, during the seeding stage of amyloid development enhanced amyloid deposition and neuritic dystrophy in amyloid model mice. ApoE4, but not apoE3, significantly increased brain Aβ half-life measured by in vivo microdialysis. Furthermore, apoE4 expression increased whereas apoE3 reduced amyloid-related gliosis in the mouse brains. Together, our results demonstrate that apoE4 has the greatest impact on amyloid during the seeding stage, likely by perturbing Aβ clearance and enhancing Aβ aggregation."

Where fisheries in large tropical river systems are affected, there can be knock-on effects on food security. For the Mekong River, Sabo et al. used a data-based time series modeling approach to estimate the features of the flow regime that optimize the fishery that is crucial to food security in Cambodia (see the Perspective by Poff and Olden). Fish futures can be maximized within a managed hydrologic system with careful prescription of flows.

https://openalex.org/W2775683081,"A biotech tour de force RuBisCo, the key enzyme of photosynthesis, is a complex of eight large and eight small subunits. It mediates the fixation of atmospheric CO 2 in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. In addition to being enzymatically inefficient, RuBisCo has a problem with distinguishing between CO 2 and O 2 . The fixation of O 2 results in the energetically wasteful reaction of photorespiration. Thus, there is a strong incentive to improve RuBisCo's catalytic properties by engineering. However, for decades, it has been impossible to express the enzyme from plants in an easily manipulatable bacterial host. Aigner et al. succeeded in functionally expressing plant RuBisCo in Escherichia coli (see the Perspective by Yeates and Wheatley).

https://openalex.org/W3100019711,"Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound electrons, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photoelectrons along the light propagation axis. Here we implement a self-referenced attosecond photoelectron interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward electron wavepackets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We found a delay between electrons ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of electron wavepackets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly-correlated electronic dynamics."

FSGS is associated with loss of podocytes, an unusual cell type critical for the kidney's blood filtration function. Podocytes form interdigitating foot processes that wrap around capillaries and prevent leakage of plasma proteins into urine (proteinuria). Zhou et al. suppressed proteinuria by preventing podocyte loss in two different rat models of kidney disease, using a compound that selectively inhibits the TRPC5 ion channel (see the Perspective by Chung and Shaw). In short-term studies, this compound had no detectable side effects. Thus, TRPC5 inhibitors may merit exploration as a therapy for progressive kidney disease.

https://openalex.org/W2774482055,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. Previous studies suggest that reduction of apoE levels through genetic manipulation can reduce Aβ pathology. However, it is not clear how reduction of apoE levels after birth would affect amyloid deposition. We utilize an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce apoE expression in the brains of APP/PS1-21 mice homozygous for the APOE-ε4 or APOE-ε3 allele. ASO treatment starting after birth led to a significant decrease in Aβ pathology when assessed at 4 months. Interestingly, ASO treatment starting at the onset of amyloid deposition led to an increase in Aβ plaque size and a reduction in plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy with no change in overall plaque load. These results suggest that lowering apoE levels prior to plaque deposition can strongly affect the initiation of Aβ pathology while lowering apoE after Aβ seeding modulates plaque size and toxicity."

The role of dopamine (DA) in adaptive behaviors such as motivation, action control, and learning has been extensively studied. Regulation of DA release at axon terminals is governed by changes in firing rate of DA neurons. However, new evidence supporting the relevance of alterations in DA release from terminals in the striatum is emerging (Cachope and Cheer, 2014Cachope R. Cheer J.F. Local control of striatal dopamine release.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the interplay between glutamatergic and cholinergic systems drawing most attention (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y.

Liang Y. Dani J.A. Endogenous nicotinic cholinergic activity regulates dopamine release in the striatum.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) are critical modulators of motivated behaviors, partly through their actions on rostral dopaminergic projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Oleson et al., 2012Oleson E.B. Beckert M.V. Morra J.T. Lansink C.S. Cachope R. Abdullah R.A. Loriaux A.L. Schetters D. Pattij T.

However, dopaminergic neurons do not express cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors (Julian et al., 2003Julian M.D. Martin A.B. Cuellar B. Rodriguez De Fonseca F. Navarro M. Moratalla R. Garcia-Segura L.M. Neuroanatomical relationship between type 1 cannabinoid receptors and dopaminergic systems in the rat basal ganglia.Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, the actions of eCBs and exogenous cannabinoids at the level of the dopaminergic cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are indirect and likely involve disinhibition of dopaminergic neurons via decreased GABA release at CB1-expressing inhibitory afferents (Cheer et al., 2000bCheer J.F. Marsden C.A. Kendall D.A. Mason R.

This disinhibition likely produces enhanced phasic DA concentrations in the extracellular space within the NAc (Cheer et al., 2004Cheer J.F. Wassum K.M. Heien M.L. Phillips P.E. Wightman R.M. Cannabinoids enhance subsecond dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of awake rats.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4393-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Oleson et al., 2012Oleson E.B.

On the other hand, it is not clear how CB1 receptors locally regulate DA release in terminal regions such as the NAc, due to the large number of convergent neural messengers involved. The NAc is crucial for the generation of motivated behaviors and integrates dopaminergic reinforcement signals with glutamate-encoded environmental stimuli to produce motor sequences that underlie goal-directed actions (Floresco, 2015Floresco S.B. The nucleus accumbens: an interface between cognition, emotion, and action.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2015; 66: 25-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Importantly, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc contain a molecular arrangement consistent with the on-demand production of eCBs and retrograde signaling via CB1 receptor activation (Uchigashima et al., 2007Uchigashima M. Narushima M. Fukaya M. Katona I. Kano M. Watanabe M.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3663-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Prefrontal glutamatergic afferents to the NAc have long been theorized to carry information about exteroceptive triggers and contextual information (Sesack and Grace, 2010Sesack S.R. Grace A.A. Cortico-Basal Ganglia reward network: microcircuitry.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and characterization of the behavioral effects of activating these afferents has been reported (Britt et al., 2012Britt J.P. Benaliouad F. McDevitt R.A. Stuber G.D. Wise R.A. Bonci A. Synaptic and behavioral profile of multiple glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens.Neuron. 2012; 76: 790-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, there is virtually no information regarding the presynaptic modulation of glutamate release by CB1 receptor activation as it pertains to rapid DA dynamics within the NAc. Nevertheless, studies demonstrate that several forms of excitatory synaptic plasticity in the NAc (Mato et al., 2005Mato S. Robbe D. Puente N. Grandes P. Manzoni O.J.

These effects have predominantly involved CB1 receptor activation on glutamatergic terminals impinging upon MSNs and in some cases require D2 DA (Gerdeman et al., 2002Gerdeman G.L. Ronesi J. Lovinger D.M. Postsynaptic endocannabinoid release is critical to long-term depression in the striatum.Nat.

Another possible target for CB1 receptor modulation of phasic DA release within the NAc is the cholinergic interneuron (CIN) population, which exerts a profound influence on DA terminals, as its selective activation potently increases DA release independent of cell bodies in the VTA (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F.

Indeed, endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release promotes depolarization-induced mobilization of eCBs from MSNs (Narushima et al., 2007Narushima M. Uchigashima M. Fukaya M. Matsui M. Manabe T. Hashimoto K. Watanabe M. Kano M. Tonic enhancement of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression of inhibition by cholinergic interneuron activity in the striatum.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Additionally, NAc CINs co-release glutamate, and the cooperative action of DA and glutamate generates plastic changes in synaptic strength that underlie contrast enhancement of cues and action selection (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F. Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Higley et al., 2011Higley M.J. Gittis A.H. Oldenburg I.A. Balthasar N. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Lowell B.B. Kreitzer A.C. Sabatini B.L. Cholinergic interneurons mediate fast VGluT3-dependent glutamatergic transmission in the striatum.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e19155Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To clarify how CB1 receptors within the NAc modulate DA release independently from cell bodies in the midbrain, we utilized a combination of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology, electrophysiology, electrochemistry, and optogenetics. We also utilized cre-lox recombination to generate conditional knockout mouse models to test our hypotheses. We report that accumbal CB1 receptors are present in prefrontal terminals and that their specific genetic ablation eliminates CB1 receptor agonist-mediated inhibition of CIN-driven DA release. We further provide evidence that CIN activation recruits production of the eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) to activate CB1 receptors on cortical glutamatergic terminals to modulate DA release. Critically, 2-AG mobilization influences behavior reinforced by optical activation of prefrontal cortical terminals in the NAc. These results uncover the intricate and precise nature of eCB signaling within different nodes of a common anatomical framework and provide another crucial target for the modulation of mesolimbic DA release in reinforcement. Previous studies have suggested that cholinergic transmission can be potently modulated by CB1 receptor activation (Tzavara et al., 2008Tzavara E.T. Wade M.R. Davis R.J. El Khoury M.A. Nomikos G.G. Role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in the procholinergic effects of neuropsychotherapeutic compounds.Synapse. 2008; 62: 940-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and our published work has shown that selective CIN excitation enhances DA release in the NAc both in vivo and in vitro (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F. Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, CB1 receptor activation may alter ACh release and thus indirectly modify CIN-driven DA release. To examine this possibility, we monitored the effect of WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) a CB1 receptor agonist on NAc DA release triggered by selective optical stimulation of accumbal CINs (Figures 1A and 1B ). First, we replicated our previous findings (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F. Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and determined that in vivo DA release is triggered by endogenous release of ACh (Figure 1A). Next, we found that WIN (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreases CIN-driven DA release in vivo (Figures 1B and 1C; p < 0.05). We then aimed to further study this phenomenon mechanistically in a brain slice preparation (Figure 1D). We observed that bath application of WIN (1 μM) significantly decreased DA peak levels evoked by CIN activation by an average of 42% ± 3% relative to pretreatment levels (p < 0.001; n = 7; Figure 1E), recapitulating the in vivo findings. Pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (3 μM) prevented WIN-elicited decreases in CIN-driven DA release (n = 5; Figures 1D–1F), confirming the involvement of CB1 receptors in this modulation. The above-described data could be explained most parsimoniously by the presence of CB1 receptors on cholinergic terminals. Therefore, we used CB1 radioactive antisense riboprobes to examine the expression of CB1 mRNA in the NAc. We closely inspected individual ChAT immunoreactive neurons in the core and shell portions of the NAc to determine whether ChAT immunoreactivity co-localized with CB1 mRNA, but did not observe significant expression of CB1 mRNA in ChAT-expressing neurons in any of the NAc sub-fields studied (Figure S1A). This finding is none too surprising given previous data indicating no CB1 receptor expression in CINs within the NAc (Hohmann and Herkenham, 2000Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Localization of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor mRNA in neuronal subpopulations of rat striatum: a double-label in situ hybridization study.Synapse. 2000; 37: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As a complementary functional approach to determine if CB1 receptors on cholinergic terminals contribute to the inhibition of DA release, we generated conditional mutant mice in which CB1 was removed from cholinergic neurons by crossing CB1flox/flox mice with ChAT::cre mice. We confirmed that this approach was successful by measuring a significant decrease in CB1 mRNA in ChAT positive cells of ChAT cre_CB1flox/flox mice within the lateral septum (Figure S2). Next, we optically evoked CIN-driven DA release in the NAc and applied WIN (1 μM) to the slice. Recordings from ChAT::cre/CB1flox/flox mice showed a WIN-induced depression of CIN-evoked DA release that was indistinguishable from that observed in ChAT::cre mice, consistent with a lack of CB1 receptor expression on CINs (p < 0.0001; n = 5; Figure S1B). Therefore, the regulation of DA release evoked by selective activation of CINs likely involves CB1 receptors at sites other than CINs themselves. Our prior work demonstrated that glutamate signaling at AMPA receptors contributes to CIN-evoked DA release (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F. Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As CIN-driven DA release is sensitive to CB1 receptor activation and CINs do not express CB1 receptors, we next tested whether the effect of WIN on CIN-evoked DA involves an indirect mechanism whereby CB1 receptors dampen glutamatergic drive to CINs. We first assessed whether optical activation of CINs elicited oEPSCs recorded from MSNs. Optical activation of CINs produced measureable oEPSCs (Figures 2A and 2B ), as seen in previous work (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M.

Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Higley et al., 2011Higley M.J. Gittis A.H. Oldenburg I.A. Balthasar N. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Lowell B.B. Kreitzer A.C. Sabatini B.L.

Moreover, these oEPSCs appeared to have two components and a relatively long latency to peak, consistent with a disynaptic effect (Figure S3A). A 10-min bath application of WIN (1 μM) reduced the amplitude of recorded MSN oEPSCs (Figures 2A–2C; reduction to 74% ± 3% baseline). When AM251 (3 μM) was present throughout the recording, application of WIN no longer decreased MSN oEPSC amplitude (Figures 2A–2C; 92% ± 6% baseline), demonstrating that the effect of WIN occurs through CB1 receptor activation. To determine whether AMPA and CB1 receptors share a common neural substrate underlying the effects of WIN on CIN-driven DA release, we utilized a combined pharmacological and voltammetric approach. To achieve this, we initially activated CINs optogenetically and elicited a significant decrease in DA release in the presence of the AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX (5 μM; Figure 2D), as in our prior publication (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F. Selective activation of cholinergic interneurons enhances accumbal phasic dopamine release: setting the tone for reward processing.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The effects of NBQX were recapitulated with the use of the non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (Figure S3B). Next, we observed that application of WIN did not decrease DA levels further when applied in the presence of NBQX (Figure 2D). We also observed this same effect when NBQX was applied in the presence of WIN (Figure 2E). This occlusion of the effect of WIN by NBQX suggests that CB1 receptors are localized upstream of AMPA effector sites. Consistent with previous reports (Sidló et al., 2008Sidló Z. Reggio P.H. Rice M.E. Inhibition of striatal dopamine release by CB1 receptor activation requires nonsynaptic communication involving GABA, H2O2, and KATP channels.Neurochem. Int. 2008; 52: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we also found that DA release evoked by single pulse electrical stimulation was unaffected by WIN (Figures S3C and S3D) in agreement with a lack of CB1 receptor expression on dopaminergic terminals within the NAc. Interestingly, AMPA receptors are similarly uninvolved in DA release induced by single electrical pulses (Avshalumov et al., 2003Avshalumov M.V. Chen B.T. Marshall S.P. Peña D.M. Rice M.E. Glutamate-dependent inhibition of dopamine release in striatum is mediated by a new diffusible messenger, H2O2.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2744-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that glutamatergic contributions to DA release and CB1 receptor modulation of release differ when release is driven by electrical stimulation versus direct CIN activation. A possible contribution of GABA to regulation of CIN-evoked DA release was ruled out because bath application of gabazine, a GABAA receptor antagonist, (5 μM) did not change DA release induced by optical CIN activation (Figure 2F). Previous reports suggest that activation of presynaptic α7-containing nAChRs can facilitate glutamate release in the NAc (Jones et al., 2001Jones I.W. Bolam J.P. Wonnacott S. Presynaptic localisation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta2 subunit immunoreactivity in rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Kaiser and Wonnacott, 2000Kaiser S.

Muscarinic and nicotinic presynaptic modulation of EPSCs in the nucleus accumbens during postnatal development.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and this mechanism could link CIN stimulation to glutamate release that subsequently facilitates increases in extracellular DA concentration. To examine the viability of this hypothesis, we examined the effect of pharmacological activation of α7 nAChRs on mEPSCs recorded from MSNs in C57BL/6J mice. Following a 5-min baseline recording, the α7-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 (10 μM) was bath applied for 5 min, followed by an additional 5 min of co-application of the PAM and the α7-selective agonist PNU-282987 (500 nM) (Figure 3A). Recordings were performed in the absence or presence of the α7 antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA, 100 nM). Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA analysis of mEPSC frequency revealed a main effect of PAM/agonist treatment (p < 0.001), a main effect of antagonist treatment (p < 0.05), and a significant interaction between PAM/agonist and antagonist treatments (p < 0.01) (Figure 3B). Post hoc Bonferroni comparisons demonstrated that the combination of PAM and the agonist significantly increased mEPSC frequency compared with baseline (175% ± 22%). Moreover, MLA inhibited the effect of the PAM/agonist on mEPSC frequency (Figures 3A and 3B). We also observed a small but statistically significant decrease in mEPSC amplitude that was not inhibited by MLA (Figure 3B). We commonly observe this small decrease in mEPSC amplitude over the course of control mEPSC recordings in MSNs; therefore, this result is unlikely to be related to activation of α7 nAChRs. In addition, to directly assess whether α7 nAChRs can regulate glutamate release onto CINs, we also measured mEPSC frequency from CINs with the α7 PAM accompanied by the agonist PNU-282987 and found a significant increase in mEPSC frequency (Figure S4). Lastly, to further demonstrate that mPFC terminals contain functional nicotinic receptors, we examined asynchronous glutamate release. Briefly, increased frequency of asynchronous mEPSCs would indicate a presynaptic effect, most likely an increase in probability of glutamate release, while a change in amplitude would indicate a change in postsynaptic responsiveness. For this experiment, MSNs were recorded in aCSF containing 0 mM Ca2+ and 4 mM Sr2+. Asynchronous glutamate release was evoked by optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing mPFC terminals (Figures 3C and 3D). Repeated-measures one-way ANOVA shows significant effect of drug treatment on frequency (p < 0.01) but not amplitude. Post hoc Dunnett’s test of frequency shows a significant increase in frequency in the PAM plus agonist condition compared with control (138% ± 10%), but no effect of PAM alone. Having found that activation of α7 nAChRs modulates excitatory synaptic transmission through changes in the probability of glutamate release, we posited that blockade of these receptors could inhibit the glutamate-dependent component of CIN-evoked DA release. Indeed, the application of MLA at a concentration that has selectivity for α7 versus other nAChR subtypes (10 nM, Mogg et al., 2002Mogg A.J. Whiteaker P. McIntosh J.M. Marks M. Collins A.C. Wonnacott S. Methyllycaconitine is a potent antagonist of alpha-conotoxin-MII-sensitive presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat striatum.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) significantly inhibited CIN-driven DA release (p < 0.001, Figure 3E). These results suggest that functional nicotinic receptors exist on prefrontal glutamate terminals and augment DA release. To better understand the contribution of cortical glutamatergic afferents to the inhibitory effects of WIN on CIN-evoked DA release in the NAc, we used the ChAT::cre/CB1flox/flox mice described above. We confirmed that light activation of CINs produced oEPSCs recorded in MSNs and that treatment with WIN still elicited a decrease in the amplitude of oEPSCs (78% ± 3% of baseline; in these animals (Figures 4A and 4C ). Next, we used a cre-recombinase-driven approach to delete CB1 receptors in cortical pyramidal projections neurons of ChAT::cre/CB1flox/flox mice. Specifically, these mice were transduced with a recombinant AAV vector encoding cre (or EGFP as a control) under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter into the mPFC (Chiarlone et al., 2014Chiarlone A.

This treatment selectively ablates the CB1 protein on cortical projection neurons, including those projections to the NAc (Chiarlone et al., 2014Chiarlone A. Bellocchio L. Blázquez C. Resel E.

Sensory systems have the ability to recognize specific features from noisy and fluctuating background signals in the external world. A central question in sensory systems is how they can quickly and reliably extract specific sensory features from such dynamic stimuli. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the fact that sensory signals are represented not only by the changes of neuronal firing rate (rate coding), but also by altering the temporal pattern of firing (temporal coding) in neurons. These include changes in spike latency, oscillation phase, and interspike intervals (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G. Draguhn A.

However, the roles of these temporal patterns in sensory information processing are not fully established. In rodents, odorants are detected by ∼1,000 types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), each expressing a single type of odorant receptor (OR). OSNs expressing the same type of OR converge their axons to a pair of glomeruli out of ∼2,000 in the olfactory bulb (OB). Thus, odor information is spatially represented in the glomerular layer of the OB. A glomerulus is composed of excitatory mitral/tufted cells (M/T cells; 20–50/glomerulus) and inter- and intra-glomerular interneurons (Imai, 2014Imai T.

Early events in olfactory processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Odors are delivered to OSNs in the olfactory epithelium (OE) via respiratory airflow, or “sniffing” for active odor sampling. As trained rodents can recognize an odor within a single sniff, it has been proposed that the activation pattern within this timescale carries sufficient information about an odor (Uchida and Mainen, 2003Uchida N. Mainen Z.F. Speed and accuracy of olfactory discrimination in the rat.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).

Recent optogenetic experiments demonstrated that the mouse olfactory system can recognize the timing of inputs within a sniff cycle (Smear et al., 2011Smear M. Shusterman R. O’Connor R. Bozza T.

It is also suggested that the temporal patterns in M/T cells are decoded in the olfactory cortex (Haddad et al., 2013Haddad R. Lanjuin A. Madisen L. Zeng H. Murthy V.N. Uchida N. Olfactory cortical neurons read out a relative time code in the olfactory bulb.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how odor information is encoded within fine temporal patterns and how this is beneficial for olfaction. In the present study, we examined the role of temporal coding, or more specifically “phase” coding, in M/T cells and found that phase coding is concentration invariant and allows for a stable odor coding strategy under fluctuations. We also found that airflow-induced mechanosensation in OSNs facilitates, rather than masks, the robust phase coding of odors, revealing a previously unappreciated role of mechanosensation in olfaction. Recent studies using isolated OE demonstrated that mouse OSNs respond not only to odorants, but also to mechanical stimuli, such as pressure-ejected saline solution or deodorized air, through the canonical olfactory transduction cascade (Chen et al., 2012Chen X. Xia Z. Storm D.R. Stimulation of electro-olfactogram responses in the main olfactory epithelia by airflow depends on the type 3 adenylyl cyclase.J.

Thus, it has been proposed that OSNs are dual modal sensors, detecting both odor and mechanical stimuli. However, it remains unknown whether and how the olfactory system distinguishes between the two sensory modalities detected by the same OSNs. To observe how mechanical signals are detected in the OE and transduced in the OB in more physiological conditions in vivo, we performed two-photon calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators, GCaMP3 or GCaMP6f (Figures 1A and S1) (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W.

Methods. 2009; 6: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). To detect mechanosensory responses in OSNs, we generated OMP-tTA;TRE-GCaMP3 compound heterozygous mice, in which GCaMP3 is specifically and highly expressed in OSNs (OSN-GCaMP3 hereafter; Figure S1C). We used an artificial sniffing system in anesthetized and tracheotomized mice to control the nasal airflow in a reproducible manner (Figure 1B). Artificial sniffing was generated through the trachea at ∼2 Hz (250 or 300 ms ON/OFF cycles, 200 mL/min), which was within the range of the resting state in awake animals (Kepecs et al., 2007Kepecs A.

Deodorized clean air (passed through activated charcoal) was delivered to the nostril. To directly observe the responses in OSN somata, we made an optical window in the nasal bone. In the OE, odorants typically produced sparse responses in OSNs; however, airflow stimuli produced robust and widespread responses (Figure 1C). In OSN axon terminals located in the OB, airflow-driven responses were variable and unique to each glomerulus (Figure 1D), suggesting that the extent of the mechanosensitivity is OR specific, as has been reported previously (Carey et al., 2009Carey R.M.

The overall amplitude became higher as flow rate increased (Figure 1D).

It has been demonstrated that GCaMP signals at M/T cell dendrites represent action potentials at the somata (Wachowiak et al., 2013Wachowiak M. Economo M.N. Díaz-Quesada M. Brunert D. Wesson D.W. White J.A. Rothermel M. Optical dissection of odor information processing in vivo using GCaMPs expressed in specified cell types of the olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5285-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although we cannot exclude possible contribution of synaptic NMDAR activity and dendritic spikes. Like OSN-GCaMP3 mice, M/T-GCaMP3 displayed robust and widespread responses to the nasal airflow in the glomerular layer (Figure 1E). In M/T cells, ∼80% of glomeruli demonstrated significant excitatory responses to the onset of nasal airflow (p < 0.01, one-tailed t test), which was higher than the percentage of OSNs that responded (Figures 1D and 1E). However, the excitatory responses were not as persistent as was observed in OSNs and gradually declined (Figure 1E), suggesting that the M/T cells are more sensitive to temporal changes in airflow conditions. Mechanosensation in OSNs is necessary to produce the sniff-coupled oscillatory activity, also known as theta oscillations, in M/T cells. When nasal airflow was prevented by reversible unilateral naris occlusion, M/T cell dendrites in glomeruli demonstrated spontaneous and sporadic neuronal activity. However, under rhythmic nasal airflow, most glomeruli demonstrated oscillatory neuronal activity, which was coupled to the sniff cycles (Figures 2A and 2B ), recorded by a temperature sensor located at the opening of the nostril (Kepecs et al., 2007Kepecs A. Uchida N. Mainen Z.F. Rapid and precise control of sniffing during olfactory discrimination in rats.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Power spectrum analysis of the M/T cell activity yielded a peak at the sniff frequency in this condition (Figure 2B). Next, we sought to determine the precise phases of the sniff-coupled oscillations. We determined the average response from traces registered to the sniff timing. The half-rise timing was determined from averaged fluorescence traces, since the fluorescence rise time (τon) is fast and constant across a wide range of firing rates, unlike the slower decay time (τoff) (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5285-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the half-rise timing can be best used to estimate the timing of burst firing. The oscillations were synchronized within a glomerulus (Figure 2C), consistent with earlier findings of synchrony among “sister” M/T cells associated with a common glomerulus (Hayar et al., 2005Hayar A. Shipley M.T. Ennis M. Olfactory bulb external tufted cells are synchronized by multiple intraglomerular mechanisms.J.

Westbrook G.L. Glomerulus-specific synchronization of mitral cells in the olfactory bulb.Neuron. 2001; 31: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, different glomeruli oscillated at different phases relative to the sniff cycle (Figure 2D; Movie S1). These different phases were arranged in an apparent mosaic pattern in the glomerular layer (Figure 2D). We also obtained similar results for M/T cell somata (Figure S2D). Interestingly, such variable oscillation phases were not evident at the level of OSN somata. In the OSN somata, the GCaMP signals were high and low during airflow-on and -off periods, respectively, showing binary changes (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus, the glomerulus-specific variable oscillation phases are likely produced in the OB circuits. Artificial sniffing at different frequencies (1–10 Hz) produced oscillations at the corresponding frequencies; as a result, the temporal response patterns of glomeruli were slightly “compressed” at higher frequencies (Figures 3A–3C). These glomerulus-specific oscillations were also observed in head-fixed awake animals running on a treadmill (Figure 3D). Due to the dynamic nature of the sniff conditions in awake animals, the basal fluorescence levels were highly fluctuating (Figures 3E–3G), consistent with recent studies (Blauvelt et al., 2013Blauvelt D.G.

Nasal airflow is essential for sampling odors, and indeed, the sniff speed is actively controlled to improve sensitivity to an odor in behaving animals (Kepecs et al., 2007Kepecs A. Uchida N.

Sniffing controls an adaptive filter of sensory input to the olfactory bulb.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, our results show that changes in sniff conditions inherently produce large background signals in many glomeruli (Figure 3G). In such situations, many glomeruli would have difficulty in distinguishing between odor signals and mechanical signals. How can odor-evoked signals be distinguished from the airflow-produced mechanosensory responses? It has been known that odors activate M/T cells at specific timings within a sniff cycle (Bathellier et al., 2008Bathellier B. Buhl D.L. Accolla R. Carleton A.

Resulaj A. Zhang J. Bozza T. Rinberg D. Multiple perceptible signals from a single olfactory glomerulus.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed odor- and glomerulus-specific phase shifts in sniff-coupled oscillations (phase coding) (Kepecs et al., 2006Kepecs A. Uchida N. Mainen Z.F. The sniff as a unit of olfactory processing.Chem. Senses. 2006; 31: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Panzeri et al., 2010Panzeri S. Brunel N. Logothetis N.K. Kayser C.

We also observed odor-evoked phase shifts in M/T cell somata (Figures S3F and S3G). Furthermore, correlations between odor-evoked response amplitudes (mean ΔF/F0 of GCaMP signals; rate code) (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5285-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and phase shifts (shifts in half-rise timing within a sniff cycle; phase code) were typically very weak (Figure S3H), raising the possibility that phase coding behaves differently from rate coding. In fact, this result was in contrast to earlier predictions, in which response latency should be inversely correlated with the firing rate (Brody and Hopfield, 2003Brody C.D. Hopfield J.J. Simple networks for spike-timing-based computation, with application to olfactory processing.Neuron. 2003; 37: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Hopfield, 1995Hopfield J.J.

Schaefer A.T. Theta oscillation coupled spike latencies yield computational vigour in a mammalian sensory system.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that mechanical and odor stimuli have distinct impacts on the phase coding. Here we compared the changes in phase code (half-rise timing) between mechanical and odor stimuli using artificial sniffing. To increase mechanical stimuli, we changed the airflow speed from 200 to 400 mL/min (Figure 4C). Increases in airflow speed induced widespread increases in GCaMP3 fluorescence (rate code) across many glomeruli (Figures 4D and 4E; Movie S2), in contrast to the sparser responses produced by the odor stimuli (Figure 4F, left; p < 0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). However, increases in airflow speed were only accompanied by small changes in the phase code (Figure 4F, right). When we analyzed glomeruli with 20%–50% ΔF/F0 changes, odor produced significantly larger changes in phase (Figure 4G; p < 0.001, Levene’s tests for equal variance; see also Figure S3H). Thus, the phase coding in M/T cells only extracts odor signals, whereas the rate coding responds to both mechanical and odor stimuli. To further investigate the role of phase coding, we examined its stability in olfaction. The rate code patterns in M/T cells are known to be dynamically reorganized and decorrelated within seconds (Bathellier et al., 2008Bathellier B. Buhl D.L. Accolla R. Carleton A. Dynamic ensemble odor coding in the mammalian olfactory bulb: sensory information at different timescales.Neuron. 2008; 57: 586-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Kato et al., 2012Kato H.K.

Friedrich R.W. Olfactory pattern classification by discrete neuronal network states.Nature. 2010; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (see also Figures 4A and 5A ). For example, the rate code patterns at the first and last sniff cycles are very different in Figure 5B. We therefore compared the stability of rate code versus phase code across multiple sniff cycles. Since the first sniff is known to contain sufficient information for odor recognition in rodents (Uchida and Mainen, 2003Uchida N. Mainen Z.F. Speed and accuracy of olfactory discrimination in the rat.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), we examined how the rate and phase codes from the first sniff are preserved in subsequent sniff cycles. We determined the correlation at each sniff cycle relative to the first sniff for both the rate code (mean ΔF/F0) and phase code (shifts in half-rise phase/timing). We analyzed the stability of rate code for 27 odorants with various chemical structures (Figure S4A). The rate coding among glomerular populations gradually evolved over time, although its extent was variable among different odorants (Figure S4B). We then selected eight odors with different rate code stability and chemical structures for further analyses. We determined both the rate code and phase code for glomeruli showing odor-evoked amplitude changes and detectable oscillatory activities throughout sniff cycles (criteria were as follows: peak ΔF/F0 >40%, average oscillation amplitude in each cycle >5%). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient of the rate code to that of the first sniff gradually decreased across multiple sniff cycles during the odor exposure period for 12 s, whereas the correlation of the phase code was maintained at higher levels (Figures 5A–5D and S5). While a single sniff has been known to be sufficient for odor discrimination after training (Cury and Uchida, 2010Cury K.M. Uchida N.

However, basic understanding of combining high sprint and endurance performance is currently lacking. This study identifies critical determinants of combined sprint and endurance performance using multiple regression analyses of physiologic determinants at different biologic levels. Cyclists, including 6 international sprint, 8 team pursuit, and 14 road cyclists, completed a Wingate test and 15-km time trial to obtain sprint and endurance performance results, respectively. Performance was normalized to lean body mass2/3 to eliminate the influence of body size. Performance determinants were obtained from whole-body oxygen consumption, blood sampling, knee-extensor maximal force, muscle oxygenation, whole-muscle morphology, and muscle fiber histochemistry of musculus vastus lateralis. Normalized sprint performance was explained by percentage of fast-type fibers and muscle volume (R2 = 0.65; P < 0.001) and normalized endurance performance by performance oxygen consumption (Vo2), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and muscle oxygenation (R2 = 0.92; P < 0.001). Combined sprint and endurance performance was explained by gross efficiency, performance Vo2 and likely by muscle volume and fascicle length (P = 0.056; P = 0.059). High performance Vo2 related to a high oxidative capacity, high capillarization x myoglobin, and small physiologic cross-sectional area (R2 = 0.67; P < 0.001). Results suggest that fascicle length and capillarization are important targets for training to optimize sprint and endurance performance simultaneously.— Van der Zwaard, S., van derLaarse, W.

We herein show that protamine (PRM, also known as a heparin antagonist) effectively neutralizes the inhibitory activities of CSPGs, thereby enhancing OPC differentiation and (re)myelination in mice. Cell-based assays using mouse OPC-like OL1 cells revealed that the PRM treatment exerted masking effects on extracellular CSPGs and improved oligodendrocyte differentiation on inhibitory CSPG-coated substrates. PRM also bound to the extracellular region of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), a membrane-spanning CSPG predominantly expressed in OPCs, and functioned as a ligand mimetic of PTPRZ, thereby suppressing its negative regulatory activity on oligodendrocyte differentiation. In primary cultures, the differentiation of OPCs from wild-type and Ptprz-deficient mice was equally enhanced by PRM. Moreover, the intranasal administration of PRM accelerated myelination in the developing mouse brain, and its intracerebroventricular administration stimulated remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination. These results indicate that PRM has CSPG-neutralizing activity which promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation under developmental and morbid conditions."

We evaluated the participation of NCXrm-mediated Ca2+ uptake in the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of rat isolated mesenteric arterial beds. In phenylephrine-contracted mesenteries, the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasodilation was abolished by treatment with the NCXrm blockers SEA0400, KB-R7943, or SN-6. Consistent with that, the ACh-induced hyperpolarization observed in primary cultures of mesenteric endothelial cells and in smooth muscle of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries was attenuated by KB-R7943 and SEA0400, respectively. In addition, both blockers abolished the NO production activated by ACh in intact mesenteric arteries. In contrast, the inhibition of NCXrm did not affect the vasodilator responses induced by the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, and the NO donor, S-nitroso- N-acetylpenicillamine. Furthermore, SEA0400, KB-R7943, and a small interference RNA directed against NCX1 blunted the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by ACh or ATP in cultured endothelial cells. The analysis by proximity ligation assay showed that the NO-synthesizing enzyme, eNOS, and NCX1 were associated in endothelial cell caveolae of intact mesenteric resistance arteries. These results indicate that the activation of NCXrm has a central role in Ca2+-mediated vasodilation initiated by ACh in endothelial cells of resistance arteries.-Lillo, M. A., Gaete, P.

https://openalex.org/W2773136751,"Although endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are important regulators of bone integrity and the immune system, their role in bone repair after fracture-a process highly dependent on inflammation and bone formation-is unclear. Because most effects of GCs are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we used an inducible global GR knockout (GRgtROSACreERT2) mouse model to eliminate endogenous GC action in all cells contributing to bone repair. The healing process was analyzed by cytokine/chemokine multiplex analysis, flow cytometry, histology, gene-expression analysis, microcomputed tomography, and biomechanical analysis. We observed increased early systemic and local inflammatory responses, as well as a significantly higher number of T cells infiltrating the fracture callus. Later in the healing process, we found impaired endochondral ossification in the absence of the GR, leading to persistent cartilage in the calli of the GRgtROSACreERT2 mice, decreased bending stiffness, and a significantly lower proportion of healed bones. Collectively, our data show that the absence of the GR significantly impairs fracture healing associated with a defective cartilage-to-bone transition, underscoring an important role of GCs during fracture healing.-Rapp, A.

Comparative genome analyses totally suggested that Fv113-g1 is basically assigned as F. varium, in particular, it could be reclassified as notable F. varium subsp. similar to F. ulcerans because of partial shared orthologs.

However, studies on the Hsp90 genes in plants are generally limited. Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv., as a model plant for cereal crops, has become a potential biofuel grass. During its long evolution, the Hsp90 gene family in Brachypodium has developed some strategies to cope with adverse environments. How the Hsp90 gene family in Brachypodium evolved in different plant lineages and what its role is in plant responses to drought and salt stresses remains to be elucidated. We used a set of different bioinformatics tools to identify 94 Hsp90 genes from 10 species representing four plant lineages and classified into three subgroups. Eight BdHsp90 genes were detected from B. distachyon. The number of exon-intron structures differed in each subgroup, and the motif analysis revealed that these genes were relatively conservative in each group. The fragments duplication and tandem duplication, which are the prime powers for functional diversity, generally occurred during the duplication of the whole plant genome. Transcriptional analysis of the BdHsp90 genes under salt and drought stress conditions indicated that the expression of these genes was delayed or increased at different stress time points; The expression was more affected in that of Bradi3g39630, Bradi4g06370, and Bradi1g30130.

https://openalex.org/W2772191043,"Sarcopenia and cachexia present characteristic features of a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and strength, anorexia, and lack of motivation. Treatments for these diseases have not yet been established, although selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are considered as therapeutic targets. We previously reported that a novel SARM compound, SARM-2f, exhibits anabolic effect on muscles, with less stimulatory effect on prostate weight compared with testosterone, in rat Hershberger assays and cancer cachexia models. In this study, we studied the mechanism of action for SARM-2f selectivity and also assessed whether the muscle increase by this compound might lead to improvement of muscle function and physical activity. First, we examined the tissue distribution of SARM-2f. Tissue concentration was 1.2-, 1.6-, and 1.9-fold as high as the plasma concentration in the levator ani muscle, brain, and prostate, respectively. This result showed that the tissue-selective pharmacological effect did not depend on SARM-2f concentration in the tissues. The ability of SARM-2f to influence androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcriptional activation was examined by reporter assays using human normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and skeletal muscle cells (SKMC). SARM-2f exerted higher activity against AR in SKMC than in PrEC. Mammalian two hybrid assays showed different co-factor recruitment patterns between SARM-2f and dihydrotestosterone. Next, we studied the effect of SARM-2f on motivation and physical functions such as sexual behavior and motor activities in castrated rat or mouse models. SARM-2f restored the sexual behavior that was lost by castration in male rats. SARM-2f also increased voluntary running distance and locomotor activities. These results suggest that tissue-specific AR regulation by SARM-2f, but not tissue distribution, might account for its tissue specific androgenic effect, and that the muscle mass increase by SARM-2f leads to improvement of physical function. Together, these findings suggest that SARM-2f might represent an effective treatment for sarcopenia and cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W2775551001,"Objectives Visualizing the needle tip using the short-axis (SA) ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization approach can be challenging. It has been suggested to start the process with the SA approach and then switch to the long-axis (LA); however, to our knowledge, this combination has not been evaluated. We compared the combined short- and long-axis (SLA) approach with the SA approach in a manikin study. Methods We performed a prospective randomized controlled cross-over study in an urban emergency department and intensive care unit. Resident physicians in post-graduate years 1–2 performed a simulated ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein puncture using the SA and SLA approaches on manikins. Twenty resident physicians were randomly assigned to two equal groups: (1) one group performed punctures using the SA approach followed by SLA; and (2) the other performed the same procedures in the opposite order. We compared the success rate and procedure duration for the two approaches. Procedural success was defined as insertion of the guide-wire into the vein while visualizing the needle tip at the time of anterior wall puncture, without penetrating the posterior wall. Results Six resident physicians (30%) performed both approaches successfully, while 12 (60%) performed the SLA approach, but not the SA, successfully. Those who performed the SA approach successfully also succeeded with the SLA approach. Two resident physicians (10%) failed to perform both approaches. The SLA approach had a significantly higher success rate than the SA approach (P < 0.001). The median (interquartile range) procedure duration was 59.5 [46.0–88.5] seconds and 45.0 [37.5–84.0] seconds for the SLA and SA approaches, respectively. The difference of the duration between the two procedures was 15.5 [0–28.5] seconds. There was no significant difference in duration between the two approaches (P = 0.12). Conclusions Using the SLA approach significantly improved the success rate of internal jugular vein puncture performed by novice physicians on a manikin model, without increasing procedural duration. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the procedure’s utility in actual patients. Trial registration UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000026199"
https://openalex.org/W2952484998,"Annexins, a family of highly conserved calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins, play important roles in a wide range of physiologic functions. Among the 12 known annexins in humans, annexin A2 (AnxA2) is one of the most extensively studied and has been implicated in various human diseases. AnxA2 can exist as a monomer or a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 (P11) and plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including exocytosis, endocytosis, and membrane organization. At the endothelial cell surface, the (AnxA2P11)2 tetramer—acting as a coreceptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)—accelerates tPA-dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, the enzyme that is responsible for thrombus dissolution and the degradation of fibrin. This study demonstrates that EPAC1 (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP isoform 1) interacts with AnxA2 and regulates its biologic functions by modulating its membrane translocation in endothelial cells. By using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we demonstrate that EPAC1—acting via the PLCe-PKC pathway—inhibits AnxA2 surface translocation and plasminogen activation. These results suggest that EPAC1 plays a role in the regulation of fibrinolysis in endothelial cells and may represent a novel therapeutic target for disorders of fibrinolysis.— Yang, W., Mei, F.

https://openalex.org/W2772133146,"Leaf sheath hairiness is a morphological trait associated with various advantages, including tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses, thereby increasing yield. Understanding the genetic basis of this trait in barley can therefore improve the agronomic performance of this economically important crop. We scored leaf sheath hairiness in a two-year field trial in 1,420 BC1S3 lines from the wild barley nested association mapping (NAM) population HEB-25. Leaf sheath hairiness segregated in six out of 25 families with the reference parent Barke being glabrous. We detected the major hairy leaf sheath locus Hs (syn. Hsh) on chromosome 4H (111.3 cM) with high precision. The effects of the locus varied across the six different wild barley donors, with donor of HEB family 11 conferring the highest score of leaf sheath hairiness. Due to the high mapping resolution present in HEB-25, we were able to discuss physically linked pentatricopeptide repeat genes and subtilisin-like proteases as potential candidate genes underlying this locus. In this study, we proved that HEB-25 provides an appropriate tool to further understand the genetic control of leaf sheath hairiness in barley. Furthermore, our work represents a perfect starting position to clone the gene responsible for the 4H locus observed."

Only patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) received prasugrel, others were treated with clopidogrel. HPR was defined as an ADP-test >46U with the Multiplate assay and no adjustments were done based on results. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, MI, any revascularization or stroke during one-year follow-up.194 stable angina patients were recruited of whom 90% were treated with clopidogrel. Clinical characteristics and procedural data were available for all patients; while platelet function testing was performed in 152 subjects of whom 32 (21%) had HPR. Patients with HPR had a higher risk for the primary endpoint (HR: 2.45; CI: 1.01-5.92; p = 0.03). The difference was primarily driven by a higher risk for revascularization and MI. According to the multivariate analysis, HPR remained a significant, independent predictor of the primary endpoint (HR: 2.88; CI: 1.02-8.14; p = 0.04), while total DEB length and statin treatment were other independent correlates of the primary outcome.HPR was found to be an independent predictor of repeat revascularization and MI among elective patients with ISR undergoing PCI with DEB."
https://openalex.org/W2772385082,"After a 9-month probe hampered by lack of access to medical records, a panel of Cuban scientists this week declared that U.S. diplomats here likely suffered a collective psychogenic disorder earlier this year, not the deliberate health attack that the U.S. Department of State has claimed. Based on media reports about the mysterious symptoms, including hearing loss, nausea, vertigo, and memory lapses, some U.S. scientists had already reached similar conclusions. That a panel appointed by the Cuban government dismisses the U.S. claims may not be surprising, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is still leading what State Department officials have described as a vigorous multiagency investigation. But the Cuban report summary, obtained by Science , reveals intriguing details. For instance, a high-frequency noise that some had identified as a possible sonic weapon may have been crickets chirping."

But time is running short. The U.S. Senate last week approved a massive, Republican-backed rewrite of the federal tax code that mirrors, in key respects, a bill passed on 16 November by the U.S. House of Representatives. Both bills would dramatically cut corporate rates and, over a decade, deliver a majority of their benefits to the most affluent individuals. But there are also major differences between the measures, and Republican leaders in Congress have pledged to iron out the differences in time to send final legislation to President Donald Trump by the end of the year. The tight schedule leaves little time for research and university advocates to persuade lawmakers to drop several provisions that they oppose. We look at some of the flashpoints, including new taxes on tuition waivers for graduate students, university endowments, and an effort to do away with a tax break for developing so-called orphan drugs for rare diseases."
