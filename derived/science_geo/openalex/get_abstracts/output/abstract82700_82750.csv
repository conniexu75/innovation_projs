https://openalex.org/W1981231195,"We have initiated a study of the organization and expression of the actin genes of D. melanogaster. Using actin gene-specific probes from both chicken and Dictyostelium sources, a clone--denoted lambda DmA2--containing a Drosophila actin gene has been isolated from a representative library of Drosophila genomic DNA cloned in the lambda bacteriophage vector, Charon 4. Southern blotting experiments reveal that there is only one actin structural gene contained in the 17.5 kb Drosophila insert of lambda DmA2 and that the sequences immediately flanking the structural gene are single copy. Observations by electron microscopy of the R loop structures formed by hybridizing total cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA from Drosophila embryos to an appropriate subcloned segment of lambda DmA2 indicate that the gene consists of an approximately 70-170 nucleotide leader sequence encoding the 5' portion of the mature mRNA, a 1.65 kb intervening sequence not present in the mRNA and a 1.55 kb sequence containing the major portion of the gene. Using genomic blots with actin-specific probes derived from lambda DmA2, we show that there are six actin genes per haploid Drosophilia genome. They direct the synthesis of three major size classes of mRNA. Using in situ hybridization, the six genes have been localized to six widely dispersed sites on the polytene chromosomes; the locus for lambda DmA2 is 5C on the X chromosome. In vitro translation of mRNA selected hybridization by a DNA segment specific to lambda DmA2 suggests that this particular gene codes for one of the cytoplasmic actin polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2170033713,"The interaction of HMG 14 and 17 with actively transcribed genes was studied by monitoring the sensitivity of specific genes to DNAase I after reconstitution of HMG-depleted chromatin with HMG 14 and 17. Our experiments lead to the following conclusions: most actively transcribed genes become sensitized to DNAase I by HMG 14 and 17; either HMG 14 or HMG 17 can sensitize most genes to DNAase I; genes transcribed at different rates have about the same affinity for HMG 14 and 17; HMG 14 and 17 bind stoichiometrically to actively transcribed nucleosomes; and HMG 14 and 17 can restore DNAase I sensitivity to purified nucleosome core particles depleted to HMGs. This last observation suggests that during reconstitution, low levels of HMG 14 and 17 can associate with the active nucleosomes in the presence of a 10--20 fold excess of inactive nucleosomes. Consequently, we conclude that besides their association with HMGs, active nucleosomes also have at least one other unique feature that distinguishes them from bulk nucleosomes and insures proper HMG binding during reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W1599697554,"Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes attained maximal ability to bind, internalize, and degrade 125I-asialo-orosomucoid after 5 h in suspension culture at 37 degrees C. Comparison of the number and distribution of the asialoglycoprotein binding sites of these cells revealed that 5% (6.7 x 10(4) receptors/cell) were on the external cell membrane with an average residency time of slightly less than 3 min. The remaining 95% were located intracellularly, as determined with detergent-solubilized hepatocytes. Binding of ligand (asialo-orosomucoid) was time-dependent, saturable, and dissociable. The dissociation constant for the single high affinity binding site was calculated to be 3.4 x 10(-8) M. The amount of asialo-orosomucoid metabolized by these cells over a period of 3 h at 37 degrees C was reduced 50% by the inclusion of 1 mM cycloheximide in the incubation medium. However, even in the absence of protein synthesis, 34 times more asialo-orosomucoid was metabolized than could be bound by the cell surface receptors, or twice the total capacity of the intact hepatocyte. These results provide clear evidence for the stability of the binding receptor under conditions where the ligand is being continually destroyed and support the previously proposed recycling hypothesis (Tanabe, T., Pricer, W.E., Jr., and Ashwell, G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1038-1043)."
https://openalex.org/W2003182916,"Plasmids containing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNA sequences were used to obtain sequences corresponding to the 3′ termini of VSV mRNAs and to generate primers that were used to sequence through the genomic RNA regions joining the NS, M, G and L genes. Together with the sequence of the N-NS junction ( McGeoch, 1979 McGeoch D.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 673-681 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar ) these results provide the complete set of VSV intergenic and flanking gene sequences. Extensive homologies were found among the four junctions of the five VSV genes. These regions have the common structure (3′)AUACUUUUUUUNAUUGUCNNUA(5′), in which N indicates three variable positions in the 23 nucleotide sequence. The first eleven nucleotides of this sequence are complementary to the sequence (5′)…UAUGAAAAAA…(3′) which occurs at the mRNA-poly(A) junction in each mRNA. These sequences presumably signal polyadenylation of each mRNA. Dinucleotide spacers (CA or GA) whose complements do not appear in the mRNAs follow the polyadenylation signals and constitute the intergenic regions. Immediately after these dinucleotides are the sequences complementary to the 5′ terminal sequences on each mRNA, (5′)AACAGNNAUC(3′). Transcription events at these junctions, and the locations of possible promoter sequences preceding them, are discussed in terms of models of VSV transcription. Important features of VSV mRNA structure, including the location of a secondary ribosome binding site at an out-of-frame AUG codon in the N mRNA and the sequences of the M and G mRNAs preceding their ribosome binding sites, are also considered."
https://openalex.org/W1965585699,"The genomic organization of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene has been determined by hybridization of specific cDNA sequences to restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of DNA from methotrexate-resistant S-180 cells. The dihydrofolate reductase gene contains a minimum of five intervening sequences (one in the 5' untranslated region and four in the protein-coding region) and spans a minimum of 42 kilobase pairs on the genome. Genomic sequences at the junction of the intervening sequence and mRNA-coding sequence and at the polyadenylation site have been determined. A similar organization is found in independently isolated methotrexate-resistant cell lines, in the parental sensitive cell line and in several inbred mouse strains, indicating that this organization represents that of the natural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1521868395,"An exoribonuclease producing 5'-mononucleotides has been purified from ribosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme has a broad pH optimum around 8.0, requires divalent cation, and is stimulated by monovalent cation with the cation and degree of stimulation being dependent on the substrate used. With either poly(A) or rRNA as substrate, the enzyme has a processive mode of hydrolysis. The oligonucleotides, (pA)3-5, are hydrolyzed by the enzyme, and the hydrolysis is dependent on a 5'-phosphate end group. Phosphorylation of the 3' end has little effect on the rate of hydrolysis. With [3H]poly(A) or [3H]rRNA, labeled differentially at the 5' termini, a more rapid release of 5'-terminal label can be shown, providing evidence that the enzyme hydrolyzes in a 5' leads to 3' direction. Further evidence for a 5' leads to 3' mode of hydrolysis is provided by a study of the products of the hydrolysis of [3H](pA)5 labeled at the 5' termini with 32P. No 32P label is found in (pA)2 which accumulates as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1545711672,"Prostaglandin E1 and cholera toxin increased the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP of human lung fibroblasts. With prostaglandin E1, the increase in cyclic AMP occurred within 10 min followed by a decline to less than one-half of peak values in 6 h. With cholera toxin, the increase occurred within 60 min but the level of cyclic AMP remained increased for 6 h. Both agents caused a decrease in collagen production as expressed as the proportion of newly synthesized protein represented by collagen. The increase in cyclic AMP levels was accompanied by a marked increase in the proportion of newly synthesized collagen which was degraded intracellularly prior to secretion. Analysis of the degraded collagen showed it to be predominantly less than 1000 daltons in molecular mass, but still in peptide linkage. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic AMP levels in diploid fibroblasts regulate the amount of collagen produced by fibroblasts, at least in part, by modulating the level of intracellular collagen degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1548262973,"A hybrid plasmid (pgap63) was isolated which contains a second yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structural gene. The complete nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined and compared with the primary structure of a yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (pgap49) which was reported previously (Holland, J.P., and Holland, M.J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9839-9845). Based on the restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of the isolated segments of yeast DNA which contain these genes, the two genes are nontandemly duplicated. Greater than 94% of the nucleotides within the coding regions of these genes are homologous and the polypeptides encoded by the two structural genes differ by only 15 amino acid residues. Both genes have the same, highly biased, codon usage pattern and neither contains intervening sequences. Approximately 100 nucleotides adjacent to the ATG initiation codons and 130 nucleotides beyond the TAA termination codons are greater than 70% homologous. Structures within the flanking sequences of the genes which are potentially relevant to transcriptional and translational control are described. Several sequences (8 to 15 nucleotides in length) are repeated in both the 5' and 3' flanking sequences of the genes in a noninverted fashion. Finally, a rapid procedure for the isolation of spontaneous deletions within hybrid plasmid DNAs is described, as is the isolation of a structural gene deletion in pgap49."
https://openalex.org/W2025032410,"In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of a 7.2 kb D. melanogaster chromosomal DNA fragment (K1) which contains nucleotide sequences complementary to D. melanogaster actin mRNA. Plasmid K1 was identified using a Dictyostelium actin cDNA plasmid, B1, as a probe. D. melanogaster mRNA selected by hybridization with immobilized K1 DNA was translated in vitro to yield products which co-migrate with the D. melanogaster actins I, II and III in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and bind to DNAase I agarose. A physical map localizing restriction endonuclease cleavage sites in the K1 DNA fragment and the direction of transcription is presented. The position of the coding region has been localized by hybridization with labeled B1 DNA and with labeled poly(A)-containing D. melanogaster RNA. On the basis of hybridization of labeled subfragments of plasmid K1 to restriction endonuclease-cleaved D. melanogaster embryo DNA, we conclude that the nucleotide sequence of the presumptive coding region is responsible for labeling of a pattern of multiple restriction fragments from embryo DNA. The chromosomal locus from which DNA fragment K1 is derived has been localized by in situ hybridization to two closely linked bands in the region 88F. Related DNA sequences corresponding to putative actin genes have also been mapped cytologically. These results support the hypothesis that the genes for actin in D. melanogaster are members of a closely related family of coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2089629262,"Several complementary procedures were used to identify and characterize DNA sequences which are repeated within a 44 kilobase (kb) segment of rabbit chromosomal DNA containing four different rabbit β-like globin genes (β1–β4). Cross-hybridization between cloned DNAs from different regions of the gene cluster indicates the presence of a complex array of repeat sequences interspersed with the globin genes. We classified 20 different repeat sequences into five families whose members cross-hybridize. Electron microscopy was used to determine the location, size and relative orientations of many of the repeat sequences. Both direct and inverted repeats were identified, with sizes ranging from 140 to 1400 base pairs (bp). Each of the four closely linked globin genes is flanked by at least one pair of inverted repeats of 140–400 bp, and the entire set of four genes is flanked by an inverted repeat of 1400 bp. Two of the five repeat families contain repeat sequences of different sizes. We found that the smaller sequence elements can occur individually or in association with the larger repeat sequences, suggesting that the larger repeats may be composed of more than one smaller repeat sequence. The restriction fragments containing the intracluster repeats also contain sequences which are repeated many times in total rabbit genomic DNA, but it is not known whether the genomic and intracluster repeats are the same sequences. The results provide the first demonstration of the relationship between single-copy and repetitive DNA sequences in a large segment of chromosomal DNA containing a well characterized set of developmentally regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2083854003,"Two poliovirus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified: a poly(U) polymerase that copies poly(A).oligo(U) and a replicase that copies natural heteropolymers with some preference for poliovirus RNA. Both activities purified together until a step of a salt gradient elution from poly(U)-agarose, when poly(U) polymerase but no replicase was recovered. Addition of a salt wash fraction from the ribisomes of uninfected cells to this poly(U) polymerase fraction reconstituted replicase activity, and a host factor was purified 50 fold from the ribosomal salt wash. None of the available initiation factors or elongation factors for protein synthesis were able to reconstitute replicase activity. Host factor activity could be supplied by adding oligo(U), suggesting that the factor acts at the initiation step of RNA replication. With the purified replicase-host factor combination, only poly(A)-containing RNAs were copied, and a preference for poliovirus RNA was shown."
https://openalex.org/W1969004603,"We have studied the effect of tumor promoters and viral transformation on the synthesis and secretion of a glycoprotein of molecular weight 35,000 by mouse fibroblasts in culture. The secretion of this protein (known as MEP) in large amounts by transformed cells has been previously described ( Gottesman, 1978 Gottesman M.M. Transformation-dependent secretion of a low molecular weight protein by murine fibroblasts. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 75. 1978: 2767-2771 Google Scholar ). We show in this paper that NIH/3T3 cells either transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus or treated with biologically active phorbol esters synthesize and secrete increased amounts of MEP. This is due to increased levels of translatable RNA for MEP, since translation in a reticulocyte lysate of total RNA purified from virus-transformed cells or from normal cells treated for 6 hr with 4-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) reveals a dramatic increase in the synthesis in vitro of MEP when compared to untreated cells. Our evidence indicates that a tumor virus and a tumor promoter both regulate expression of a transformation-related function at a pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W2082556978,"247 independent events involving insertion of the TN3 transposable element into a 4 kb constructed plasmid (pTU4) of partially known DNA sequence were studied by restriction endonuclease mapping, and 65 of these insertion sites were examined further by DNA sequence analysis. Our results show that the previously proposed regional specificity for Tn3 insertion is associated with a strong preference for AT-rich segments as insertion sites. Moreover, multiple insertions of the Tn3 occurred at certain AT-rich nucleotide positions, and 23 of 26 independent insertion events at a single nucleotide position were found to be in the same orientation. A region of the recipient plasmid showing major homology with the terminal 18 bp of Tn3 was identified in the vicinity of an 11 nucleotide segment that included three insertional hot spots and 36 independent insertions. Our results indicate that the site and orientation of insertion of Tn3 are at least partly determined by the primary nucleotide sequence of the recipient genome, and suggest that insertional hot spots may result from the combined effects of AT richness plus homology of the recipient genome with the terminal sequences of Tn3."

https://openalex.org/W112414810,"The thyroid hormone receptor is a chromatin-associated protein which appears to mediate the actions of the thyroid hormones in mammalian cells. Unlike steroid hormone receptors, a cytoplasmic form of the receptor has not been identified, and the factors which govern the nuclear concentrations of the receptor are poorly understood. Using cultured GH1 cells, a rat pituitary cell line, we having previously demonstrated that thyroid hormones reduces the concentration of its receptor by a mechanism which involves the association of the ligand with the receptor binding site (Samuels, H.H., Stanley, F., and Shapiro, L.E. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6052-6060). In this study, we demonstrate that n-butyrate and other aliphatic carboxylic acids elicit a reduction of thyroid hormone nuclear receptor levels without altering total cell protein synthetic rates. In contrast, the nuclear association and total cell level of the glucocorticoid receptor is not altered by n-butyrate. Evidence is presented that the aliphatic carboxylic acid-mediated reduction of thyroid hormone nuclear receptor levels is secondary to the inhibitory effect of these compounds on chromatin-associated deacetylases which is reflected as an increase in the acetylation of the nucleosome core histones. Isokinetic gradient centrifugation of chromatin solubilized from GH1 cell nuclei by micrococcal nuclease indicates that the receptor exists as a form associated with high molecular weight chromatin, as a 12.5 S form that sediments slightly faster than the bulk of the mononucleosomes, and as a 6.5 S form which appears to remain associated with low molecular weight chromatin components. Exclusive of the receptor associated with the high molecular weight chromatin, the 6.5 S form represents 80% and the 12.5 S form 10% of the receptor resolved in the gradient. n-Butyrate decreases both forms to the same degree suggesting that they are generated from the same entity of chromatin structure. Studies on the reappearance of receptor after restoration of the chromatin to the normal acetylated state are consistent with a model in which the affinity of chromatin for newly synthesized receptor is diminished in the hyperacetylated state."
https://openalex.org/W2121726578,We describe a cloned segment of D. melanogaster DNA (cDm219) that contains five tandemly arranged sequence units homologous to the type I insertion sequence found in the majority of 28S rRNA genes on the X chromosome. Heteroduplex studies show that two of the units have a deletion corresponding to a 1.1 kb piece of DNA close to the right-hand end of the type I insertion. Another unit has a 7.5 kb sequence (zeta) substituted for a 0.95 kb piece of DNA close to the left-hand part of the type I rDNA insertion. The two remaining units are interrupted by the Col E1 plasmid vector. There are also differences in the restriction endonuclease cleavage maps both between the units of cDm219 themselves and compared to the restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of cloned rDNA segments that contain type I insertions. Quantitation of the gel transfer hybridization of zeta element probes to restriction endonuclease digests of D. melanogaster DNA indicates there are 30--40 copies of zeta sequences distributed in seven major arrangements within the haploid genome. The hybridization of zeta and insertion sequence probes to a library of D. melanogaster DNA segments cloned in bacteriophage lambda indicates at least 4--6 copies of the zeta element could be linked to insertion sequences. The common site of in situ hybridization of zeta sequences is to the chromocentral heterochromatin of polytene chromosomes.
https://openalex.org/W1607637931,"A temperature-sensitive single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) has been purified from mutant Escherichia coli (ssb-1) cells by use of affinity chromatography on blue dextran-Sepharose. An altered amino acid sequence in the mutant protein is apparent in tryptic digests, confirming that the ssb mutation is in the structural gene. The mutant protein is less effective than the wild type in protecting single-stranded DNA from nuclease S1 digestion and in inhibiting DNA-dependent ATPases. The purified protein supports replication of phage G4 DNA in vitro at 30 degrees C, although higher levels of mutant protein, 4-fold higher than wild type, are needed to do so. The mutant protein becomes less active in supporting replication above 30 degrees C and becomes inactive at 42 degrees C within 1 min. Activity is restored upon return to 20 degrees C. Despite its temperature sensitivity in vivo and in vitro, the mutant binding protein can renature fully after exposure to 100 degrees C. Thus, the mutant protein is both heat-stable and functionally temperature-sensitive."

Biol. Chem. 248, 1813-1821) and has been used by a large number of investigators as an index of the activation of this enzyme in the intact cell. This communication reports that with the typical conditions used the dissociation of the protein kinase is not blocked throughout the extraction. This is demonstrated, with glucagon-stimulated rat liver as the example tissue, by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. These data call into question the meaning of results reported using this experimental approach."
https://openalex.org/W1555483413,"The reduced forms of xanthine oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and sulfite oxidase are inactivated by cyanide. Following gel filtration to remove excess of reductant and cyanide, the isolated enzymes remain inactive. Thiocyanate, a product of inactivation of the oxidized forms of the xanthine- and aldehyde-oxidizing enzymes by cyanide, is not released during inactivation of the reduced enzymes. Studies with [14C]cyanide show that, while stoichiometric binding is required for the onset of inactivation, its continued binding is not essential to maintenance of the inactivated state. Electron paramagnetic resonance and absorption spectroscopic studies on the isolated inactivated enzymes show that prosthetic groups other than molybdenum are fully oxidized but that the molybdenum centers are modified. Reactivation is accomplished by incubation with suitable oxidants. Aerobic reactivation of inactive sulfite oxidase required only 1 eq of ferricyanide/active site. However, under rigorously anaerobic conditions, 3 to 4 mol of ferricyanide/active site were reduced, indicating that the molybdenum centers in the inactive enzyme had been reduced below the levels attained by the native enzyme during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2079988647,"The specific incorporation of cell surface proteins into budding Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) particles was shown by two approaches. In the first, monolayer cultures of Vero or L cells were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and the cells were then infected with VSV. Approximately 2% of the cell surface 1251 radioactivity was incorporated into particles which co-purify with normal, infectious virions by both velocity and equilibrium gradient centrifugation and which are precipitated by antiserum specific for the VSV glycoprotein. Control experiments establish that these 125I-labeled particles are not cell debris or cellular material which aggregate with or adhere to VSV virions. VSV virions contain only a subset of the 10–15 normal 1251-labeled cell surface polypeptides resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis; VSV grown in L cells and Vero cells incorporate different host polypeptides. In a second approach, Vero cells were labeled with 35S-methione, then infected with VSV. Two predominant host polypeptides (molecular weights 110,000 and 20,000) were incorporated into VSV virions. These proteins, like VSV G protein, are exposed to the surface of the virion. They co-migrate with the major incorporated 1251 host polypeptides. These host proteins are present in approximately 10 and 80 copies, respectively, per virion. Specific incorporation of host polypeptides into VSV virions does not require the presence of viral glycoprotein. This was shown by use of a ts VSV mutant defective in maturation of VSV G protein to the cell surface. Budding from infected cells are noninfectious particles which contain all the viral proteins except for G; these particles contain the same proportion and spectrum of 1251-labeled host surface polypeptides as do wild-type virions. These results extend previous conclusions implicating the submembrane viral matrix protein, or the viral nucleocapsid, as being of primary importance in selecting cell surface proteins for incorporation into budding VSV virions."
https://openalex.org/W1570353980,"Studies of rat skeletal glycogen metabolism carried out in a perfused hindlimb system indicated that epinephrine activates phosphorylase via the cascade of phosphorylation reactions classically linked to the beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system. The beta blocker propranolol completely blocked the effects of epinephrine on cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase, and glucose-6-P, whereas the alpha blocker phentolamine was totally ineffective. Omission of glucose from the perfusion medium did not modify the effects of epinephrine. Glycogen synthase activity in control perfused and nonperfused muscle was largely glucose-6-P-dependent (-glucose-6-P/+glucose-6-P activity ratios of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively). Epinephrine perfusion caused a small decrease in the enzyme's activity ratio (0.1 to 0.05) and a large increase in its Ka for glucose-6-P (0.3 to 1.5 mM). This increase in glucose-6-P dependency correlated in time with protein kinase activation and was totally blocked by propranolol and unaffected by phentolamine. Comparison of the kinetics of glycogen synthase in extracts of control and epinephrine-perfused muscle with the kinetics of purified rat skeletal muscle glycogen synthase a phosphorylated to various degrees by cAMP-dependent protein kinase indicated that the enzyme was already substantially phosphorylated in control muscle and that epinephrine treatment caused further phosphorylation of synthase, presumably via cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data provide a basis for speculation about in vivo regulation of the enzyme."

Infectious AAV particles mainly band at a density of 1.41 g/cm3 with a minor component at 1.45 g/cm3. Noninfectious AAV particles band at densities between 1.41 and 1.32 g/cm3. We have analyzed, by mapping with site-specific endodeoxyribonucleases, the molecular structure of the variant AAV DNA molecules obtained from these light density particles. The size of variant DNA molecules ranged from 100 to 3% of genome length. In general, the variant DNAs are deleted for internal regions but retain the genome termini. Some of the variant DNAs appear to be cross-linked, spontaneously renaturing molecules having structures analogous to replicating forms of AAV DNA."
https://openalex.org/W182763296,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from rat liver was phosphorylated with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. Brief exposure of the 32P-labeled enzyme to trypsin removed all radioactivity from the enzyme core and produced a single-labeled peptide. The partial sequence of the 17-amino acid peptide was found to be Ser-Arg-Pro-Ser(P)-Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-(Ser2, Glx2, Pro2, Leu, Arg2). The kinetics of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of native fructose bisphosphatase were compared with those of rat liver type L pyruvate kinase where the sequence around the phosphoserine is known (Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val; Hjelmquist, G., Anderson, J., Edlund, B., and Engstrom, L. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 61, 559-563). The Km for pyruvate kinase (17 microM) was less than that for fructose bisphosphatase (58 microM); the Vmax was about 3-fold greater with pyruvate kinase as substrate. The relationship between the rates of phosphorylation of these native substrates and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylated sites is discussed."

The cytoplasm of these glioma cells contains type II protein kinase and a small amount of cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase. Following the persistent activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunits of this enzyme redistribute into particulate fractions. A maximal increase in nuclear protein kinase activity occurrs 45 to 60 min following isoproterenol. The addition of cyclic AMP or of Ca2+ with or without the specific ionophore A-23187 fails to increase the protein kinase activity of nuclei from control or isoproterenol-treated cells. Preincubation of the cells with vinblastine blocks the increase of nuclear protein kinase activity due to isoproterenol. If the incubation with vinblastine occurs simultaneously with isoproterenol, vinblastine fails to reduce the increase in nuclear protein kinase activity elicited by isoproterenol."

Purification was 75-fold, recovery was 10%, the specific concentration of P-450 was about 15 nmol/mg of protein, and the specific content of heme was 16 nmol/mg of protein. The purified protein migrated as a single band on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and as a single major band with an insignificant minor band (less than 1%) on SDS-gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the major band was 48,000. The optical absorption spectra of the preparation exhibited Soret maxima at 416, 416, and 450 nm for the oxidized form, reduced form, and CO-reduced complex, respectively. Apparently homogeneous enzymes were purified with a molecular weight 2, 4, 6, and 8 times the molecular weight of the single unit. The enzymatic activities of the reconstituted systems under optimal conditions were 16 nmol of cholesterol cleaved/mol of P-450. The 2-unit protein was about 5% as active either because it is an incomplete portion of the natural enzyme or because the molecular environmental conditions were not optimal. No differences in biophysical characteristics between cytochrome P-450sec from corpus luteum and adrenal sources could be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1601994690,"The tryptophan residues of P nerve growth factor (J3NGF) were modified by reaction with varying concentrations of N-bromosuccinimide. Analysis of the oxidized derivatives by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, before and after reduction or oxidation of disulfide bonds, revealed partial hydrolysis of specific peptide bonds. Analysis of the newly created NH2 termini by the 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl procedure showed that the peptide bonds contained the carbonyl group of the reacted tryptophan residues and that the oxidation reaction proceeded in the order Trp21, Trp-99, and Trp-76. To obtain PNGF modified only at Trp-21, 0.9 tryptophan residues/NGF chain were oxidized. The dose-response curves for the PNGF-induced neurite outgrowth on sensory and PC12 cells showed that 20to 30-fold higher concentrations for the 0.9 Trp-OX-NGF YNGF oxidized with N-bromosuccinimide) derivative and about 1000-fold higher concentrations for a 2.0 Trp-OX-NGF derivative were required to elicit half-maximum biological response when compared with native PNGF. This decrease in biological activity was paralleled by a decreased binding to NGF receptors on both sensory and PC12 cells. On sensory cells, the affinity of 0.9 Trp-OX-NGF was 2.5% and the affinity of 2.0 Trp-OX-NGF was 0.05% of that of native PNGF. Tested on PC12 cells, 0.9 Trp-OX-NGF bound with 1.2% of the affinity of native PNGF. At the highest concentration tested, 2.0 Trp-OX-NGF did not compete with the binding of PNGF to PC12 cells. That the residual binding affinity and biological activity of 0.9 TrpOX-NGF were not due to unmodified PNGF in the preparation was ascertained by the PNGF-dependent cytotoxicity assay, which showed that less than 0.2% of unmodified PNGF remained. In contrast to the significant decrease in biological and binding activity, the derivative modified at Trp-21 retained 25% of the antigenicity of the native protein."

https://openalex.org/W1575829746,"Abstract To assess the cycle fructose-6-P leads to fructose-1,6-P2 leads to fructose-6-P in Escherichia coli we have grown the cells on [6-14C]glucose and determined label in the 1-position of glucose obtained from glycogen. In a variety of strains, including a wild type and a mutant without fructose diphosphatase, 1-position labeling was negligible. But there was little label in the 1-position of fructose-1,6-P2 either, which shows that hexose diphosphate and triose-P are not in equilibrium in this organism. Therefore, the lack of 1-position labeling in glycogen does not necessarily indicate lack of futile cycling. One strain, however, a temperature-sensitive glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase mutant grown at permissive temperature, gave substantial labeling of the 1-position of fructose-1,6-P2. In this strain 1-position labeling in glycogen was low, indicating minimal futile cycling."

https://openalex.org/W1978119836,"Females but not males of the low-lymphoma RF/J strain transmit a non-Mendelian factor which suppresses the development of lymphoma in F1 crosses with mice of the high-lymphoma AKR/J strain. Suppression of lymphoma was also evident in the first backcross generation to the parental AKR strain, but only when (RF female x AKR male)F1 mice had been the female parent. This ""maternal resistance factor"" was transmitted independently of the dominant, lymphoma-suppressing Fv-1n allele transmitted by both males and females of the RF strain, but the suppressive capacities of the two factors appeared to be additive. In this cross, F1 progeny of RF females also showed marked suppression of ecotropic murine leukemia virus expression by comparison with mice of the reciprocal F1 cross, but this suppression of virus expression was not detected in the lymphoma-suppressed AKR backcross population. The observation of lymphoma suppression in the absence of ectropic virus suppression in mice of the (RF X AKR)F1 female x AKR male backross generation indicates a qualitative or quantitative difference in the determination of these two effects."

https://openalex.org/W1581327108,"Several research groups have reported the presence of a high Km glucokinase (ATP:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.2) in tissues other than adult liver. As shown in this report, protein fractions catalyzing glucose phosphorylation only at high substrate concentrations (100 mM) are indeed found in bovine spleen, rat kidney, human placenta, and newborn rat liver. However, the study of substrate specificities and Michaelis constant values showed that those fractions could be better described as N-acetylglucosamine kinase (ATP:acetamide-2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.9) which, in addition to N-acetylglucosamine (Km = 0.066 mM), can also phosphorylate glucose although with very high Km values (370 mM). Furthermore, a homogeneous preparation from bovine spleen was able to phosphorylate both N-acetylglucosamine and glucose. An immune serum against bovine spleen N-acetylglucosamine kinase did not cross-react with purified hexokinases or with glucokinase from rat. However, it was able to remove the putative glucokinases from extracts of rat kidney, newborn rat liver, and one of two electrophoretic bands of liver glucokinase. It is proposed that any report of extrahepatic glucokinase should explicity rule out N-acetylglucosamine kinase as the enzyme being described."
https://openalex.org/W2080622963,"Yeast mitochondrial DNA-pBR322 recombinant DNA molecules screened for rRNA genes were used as a source of DNA for mitochondrial tRNA gene sequence analysis. We report here the sequences of yeast mitochondrial tRNA genes coding for a tRNAAGYSer and a tRNACGYArg. The tRNAAGYSer sequence deduced from the gene is the first reported sequence of a yeast tRNAAGYSer. It is also the second yeast mitochondrial tRNASer gene to be sequenced, and demonstrates unequivocally the presence of mitochondrial encoded serine tRNA isoacceptors. The tRNACGYArg sequence deduced from the gene is the most AT-rich (82%) tRNA sequence ever reported. Whereas all the mitochondrial genes sequenced to date exist singly on the genome and are separated by long stretches of AT-rich DNA, the tRNAACYSer and tRNAcgyarg genes exist in tandem, separated by only 3 bp. This gene arrangement strongly suggests that mitochondrial tRNA genes may be transcribed into multicistronic precursors."

https://openalex.org/W1527901870,"The photochemically reactive analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), 2-nitro-5-azidobenzoyl-Gly-Asp-Tyr-(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 (NAB-Gly-CCK-8), has been used to stimulate irreversibly the receptor for CCK-8 on preparations of dispersed guinea pig pancreatic acini. When continuously present with acini in the dark, NAB-Gly-CCK-8 is a reversible stimulant of secretory protein discharge with an ED50 of 0.4 nM. After six cycles of photolysis of acini with NAB-Gly-CCK-8 followed by extensive washing and assay in peptide-free medium in the dark, the photoactivated label induces irreversible discharge. Irreversible discharge is proportional to the concentration of NAB-Gly-CCK-8 present during photolysis and is nearly equivalent in intrinsic activity to that induced by CCK-8 in the dark. Inclusion of a 5-fold excess of prephotolyzed NAB-Gly-CCK-8 during photolysis partially protects against irreversible discharge, suggesting that the receptor irreversibly stimulated by NAB-Gly-CCK-8 is likely a receptor for peptides in the CCK family. Irreversible discharge requires metabolic energy supplied by oxidative phosphorylation and is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and, thus, resembles that induced by reversible secretagogues."
https://openalex.org/W1599894107,"Abstract A non-histone chromatin protein (NHCP), which is specifically phosphorylated by a nuclear cAMP-independent protein kinase from mouse spleen cells in vitro, has been purified from calf thymus chromatin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the molecular weight of the purified NHCP (single peptide) is 13,000. This peptide consists of 14 amino acid residues and has high serine content (17.9%). However, no methionine, proline, or half-cysteine have been detected. The NHCP is a basic protein (isoelectric point, approximately 9.0), although it has high acidic amino acid content (26.2%). This protein serves as the most effective phosphate acceptor for the kinase in vitro when compared with other chromatin proteins such as histones; the Km value of the kinase for the NHCP is 3.65 x 10(-6) M, whereas that for histone H2a (Mr = 14,000) is 1.08 x 10(-5) M. The present finding that the NHCP phosphorylation by the kinase in vitro is remarkably stimulated by double-stranded DNA but inhibited by whole histone or histone H2a suggests that the phosphorylation may be controlled by both double-stranded DNA and histone H2a."

https://openalex.org/W173174679,"The in uitm metabolic effects of e-pyridoxyllysine, shown to be a degradation product of vitamin Be in foods, and several of its derivatives have been examined using partially purified pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) from bovine brain and rat liver and rabbit liver pyridoxamine (pyridoxine) 5”phosphate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.5). a-Pyridoxyllysine competitively inhibits pyridoxal kinase of both brain and liver tissue, with inhibition efTiciency ratios (K,,, for p~doxal/Ki) of 5.0 and 0.6, respectively. The 5’-phosphorylation of epyridoxyllysine by brain and liver pyridoxal kinase was demonstrated using high performance liquid chromatography, showing K,,, values of 24 and 206 p~, respectively. The 5’-phosphate derivatives of e-pyridoxyllysine were readily cleaved by pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate oxidase to form pyridoxal S’-phosphate. These results strongly suggest that dietary E-pyridoxyllysine exerts its previously observed partial vitamin Bs activity by enzymatic phosphorylation and cleavage. The competitive inhibition of pyridoxal kinase or a possible anticoenzyme activity of 5‘-phospho-e-pyridoxyllysine, or both, are suggested as mechanisms for the previously observed inhibitory effect of dietary a-pyridoxyllysine on pyridoxine utilization. The results of this study indicate that dietary 6-pyridoxyllysine is nutritionally significant by virtue of its involvement in the normal metabolic pathways for the formation of pyridoxal 5”phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W2063948084,"(AKR x NZB)F1 mice possess the dominant genes, Akv-1, Akv-2, Nzv-1a and Nzv-2a, which determine the expression of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. Nevertheless, their thymic lymphocytes fail to produce these agents, and these mice are resistant to leukemia. We investigated the mechanism of this cell-specific restriction in radiation chimeras. (AKR x NZB)F1 thymocytes that had differentiated in lethally irradiated AKR recipients produced high levels of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses and showed marked amplification of MuLV antigen expression. Polytropic viruses could also be isolated from such thymocytes. These virological changes in chimeric thymocytes were donor- and host-specific and occurred only when (AKR x NZB)F1 bone marrow cells were inoculated into AKR recipients. This inductive capacity of the host environment could be detected in irradiated AKR recipients as early as age 2 months. The phenotypic changes brought about in leukemia-resistant (AKR x NZB)F1 thymocytes by the leukemia-susceptible AKR thymic microenvironment may be the result of a three-component inductive system."
https://openalex.org/W1520357552,"The chemical reactivity of fully maleylated horse heart cytochrome c with oxidants, reductants, and iron ligands was studied in the presence and absence of MgCl2. In the absence of salt, the partly unfolded protein reacts rapidly with cyanide in the ferric state (k = 235 M-1s-1); the reaction is exothermic (delta H = -9.4 kcal/mol) and entropically unfavored (delta S = -7.0 e.u.). In 0.01 M MgCl2, the refoleded protein recovers the behavior towards cyanide of native cytochrome c. The oxidation-reduction potential of the refolded species is 190 mV. In the course of reduction of the unfolded form with dithionite, a reduced intermediate species (t 1/2 = 5.9 s) is observed; this species binds carbon monoxide rapidly, but the ligand dissociates thereafter. This shows that full maleylation does not disrupt the conformational stability of reduced cytochrome c."
