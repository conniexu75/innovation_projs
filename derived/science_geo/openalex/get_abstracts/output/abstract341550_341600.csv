https://openalex.org/W2077353305,"The degree to which widely accepted generalizations about food web structure apply to natural communities was determined through examination of 50 pelagic webs sampled consistently with even taxonomic resolution of all trophic levels. The fraction of species in various trophic categories showed no significant overall trends as the number of species varied from 10 to 74. In contrast, the number of links per species increased fourfold over the range of species number, suggesting that the link-species scaling law, defined on the basis of aggregated webs, does not reflect a real ecological trend."
https://openalex.org/W1986425852,"Glass spherules, similar to microtektites, have been found near the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (F/F) (Upper Devonian) at Senzeilles, Belgium, contemporaneous with one of the largest marine mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. These spherules exhibit a wide range of compositions and display teardrop, dumbbell, and compound morphologies analogous to microtektites. In addition, they lack crystallites, have few or no vesicles, and have a low content of volatile material. These characteristics are supportive of an impact origin. The Siljan Ring (Sweden) and Charlevoix structure (Quebec,Canada) are candidate craters of this age. The presence of microtektites near the F/F boundary supports the hypothesis that an impact caused the Upper Devonian worldwide benthic mass extinctions."
https://openalex.org/W2019171990,Observations of Comet West (1975n) at wavelengths from 0.5 to 18 microns and at a variety of scattering angles are used to infer the scattering phase function for the cometary dust. This function is strongly peaked in the forward direction. The form of the function indicates that the particles are dielectric grains with radii of approximately 1 micron. Abrupt increases in the intrinsic brightness of the coma (both in scattered sunlight and in thermal emission) are consistent with the projected times of comet fragmentation.
https://openalex.org/W2012821014,"A detailed comparison is made between the per capita energy consumption in the US and Sweden. Sweden uses between 55% and 65% of the per capita energy (depending on the way hydro-electricity is counted) at essentially the same per capita income. It is shown that this difference arises both from differences in the mix of economic activities and from the differences in the energy consumption per unit output of these activities. The most important contributions to the differences in energy use arise from higher efficiencies in transportation, materials processing, and space heating in Sweden. Differences in the mode mix in transportation, particularly the reliance on the automobile in the US, also contribute significantly to the lower Swedish energy use. The more severe Swedish climate substantially increases the need for space heat relative to the US, obscuring dramatic differences in space heating efficiencies. Energy costs have played an important role in creating a more energy efficient economy in Sweden, aided by institutional and cultural factors. The comparison suggests that more efficient energy use will not interfere with and can in fact improve the functions of the United States economy over the long run."

Proximate analysis of captured specimens indicates that this organism may represent a numerically significant, but low organic content member of many near-bottom deep-sea communities."
https://openalex.org/W2014851927,Laser-extraction oxygen isotope and major element analyses of individual glass spherules from Haitian Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sediments demonstrate that the glasses fall on a mixing line between an isotopically heavy (delta(18)O = 14 per mil) high-calcium composition and an isotopically light (delta(18)O = 6 per mil) high-silicon composition. This trend can be explained by melting of heterogeneous source rocks during the impact of an asteroid (or comet) approximately 65 million years ago. The data indicate that the glasses are a mixture of carbonate and silicate rocks and exclude derivation of the glasses either by volcanic processes or as mixtures of sulfate-rich evaporate and silicate rocks.

The corresponding upper molars and the first known Middle Jurassic morganucodontid, kuehneotheriid, and dryolestid teeth are briefly described and illustrated."

https://openalex.org/W2068392736,"Measurements of current speed and direction from the sea surface to below 400 meters made on the equator in the eastern Pacific in April 1968 indicate that the Equatorial Undercurrent extends from 300 meters to the sea surface. These measurements, when compared with previous observations, indicate that eastward motion at the surface is a result of surfacing of the undercurrent caused by a release of the surface wind stress."
https://openalex.org/W2081862768,"With reference to arguments that weather modification technology is sufficiently advanced for the federal government to finance cloud-seeding operations as a means of alleviating water shortages, an analysis of the Whitetop rain stimulation experiment was performed. The average 24-hour precipitation in six concentric regions up to 180 miles from the center of the target on 102 days of cloud seeding was less than that on the 96 experimental days without seeding. For distances less than 30 miles, the apparent loss of rain due to seeding was 32 percent. With the increase in distance, this apparent loss decreased to a minimum of 9 percent for gages between 120 and 150 miles from the center. However, the 48 gages at distances between 150 and 180 miles showed a 22 percent apparent loss of rain due to seeding. The estimated average loss of rain within the whole region of about 100,000 square miles was 21 percent of what would have fallen without seeding. When a 5-year experiment, expected to produce a 5 to 10-percent increase, shows a 20-percent decrease in rainfall, the relevant technology does not appear reliable enough for practical use."
