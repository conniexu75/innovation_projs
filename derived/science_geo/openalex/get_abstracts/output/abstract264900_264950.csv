https://openalex.org/W1967925990,"All possible outcomes of ecological competition, including stable coexistence, were observed in laboratory studies of two species of freshwater diatoms potentially limited by phosphate and silicate. The relative abundance of these nutrients determined the outcome of competition. The observed conditions of coexistence and competitive displacement agree with those predicted solely from the abilities of each species to acquire and utilize limiting nutrients. Coexistence occurred only when the growth rate of each species was limited by a different resource. These results may help explain the regional coexistence in nature of an otherwise paradoxically high number of algal species."

https://openalex.org/W1979873463,"The number of decapod species associated with the coral Pocillopora damicornis is compared between two regions on the Pacific coast of Panama which are of the same geologic age but differ in environmental characteristics. The relationship between number of species and coral head size does not differ between the two regions but species composition among coral heads is more variable in the fluctuating environment. Thus there are more species (55 compared to 37) associated with corals in the fluctuating environment than in the constant environment. These data impugn the concept that environmental constancy increases species richness. They support the hypothesis that species equilibrium within habitats is maintained by measurable ecological factors-in this case, the effects of a natural physical disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2023865085,"Potassium-argon ages of eight volcanic rocks from some of the geologically oldest flows exposed in the Galápagos Archipelago indicate that the Galápagos Islands have a probable maximum age of 3 million years. Rocks from six islands were dated; the oldest are from Española (3.2 +/- 0.2), Sante Fe (2.7 +/- 0.1), and Plazas (4.2 +/- 1.8 million years). The new data suggest that the Galápagos Islands are younger than previously supposed on the basis of marine magnetic anomaly dating, but they are older than most previously dated rocks from the Galápagos."

https://openalex.org/W2013197889,"Using historical data, a study of U.S. uranium resources was performed with emphasis on discovery and drilling rates for the time interval from 1948 until the present. The ultimate recoverable resource up to a forward cost category of $30 or less per pound is estimated to be 1,134,000 short tons--about one third the estimate offered by ERDA. A serious shortfall in uranium supply is predicted for the late 1980's if nuclear power proceeds as planned; and courses of action are recommended for uranium resource management. (DDA)"
