The deep waters of the entire world ocean are replaced on average every 500 years."
https://openalex.org/W2073530913,"In a 1980 sample of U.S. nonfarm households with children and with both spouses employed full time, one-third of the couples included at least one spouse who worked other than a regular day shift. In about one-tenth of the couples the spouses worked entirely different shifts with no overlap in hours. These findings are linked to an earlier study which showed a high prevalence of child care by employed fathers whose wives were employed in certain occupations."

https://openalex.org/W2051138693,"Vapor profiles of pesticide mixtures over fallow agricultural fields reveal consistent rapid shifts in the relative proportions of the components in air. These relative concentration changes are correlated with molecular weight and size and reveal a significant molecular contribution to dispersion in turbulent air. Atmospheric studies that rely upon tracer gases, or use calculations that assume the equality of eddy dispersion coefficients, may be in serious error."

https://openalex.org/W1993836320,"The Voyager observation of high zonal flow speeds (about 400 meters per second) in the atmosphere of Saturn has raised fundamental questions about the flow on both Jupiter and Saturn. One possibility is that the flow is extremely deep, perhaps extending through the planet. Another is that the flow is confined near the cloud tops and is associated with very strong buoyancy contrasts. It is demonstrated that the heat of conversion from parahydrogen to orthohydrogen can provide buoyancy contrasts of the required magnitude, and a feedback mechanism is proposed to couple the heat of conversion to the flow dynamics."
