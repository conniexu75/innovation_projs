W e are aware that the lnstiruco del Pe- troleo scientists h ad identified propane as a significant hydrocarbon in their earl ier studies (reference 3 in thei r comment is reference 7 in our report ) and that they had also q ualitatively ident ified LPG as a source for propane (reference 9 in their comment). Nevertheless, as we discussed in our report, the 1994 MARI report (which c ites both references 3 and 9 of their comment) states ( / , vo l. 3, p. 82), without any ment ion of LPG emissions, that Increase Throughput For Kinase Assays Signal transduction a ssays are an important tool in drug dis- covery. The M illipore MultiScreen A ssa y System uniquely offers a 9 6 -w ell filter plate containing phosphocellulose paper and pro tocols to perform peptide substrate kinase assays. No more cutting and transferring the paper! Every step, from the phosphory- lation reaction lo direct scintillation counting, can be carried out in one plate. The MultiScreen A ssa y System can a lso be used w ith other filter formats, including gla ss fiber or low pro tei n binding Durapore® (PVDF) membrane - both ideally suited for TCA precipitated substrates.

Recently, the importance of biogenic emissions (emissions from vegetation) has been pointed out as a major source of VOCs. The most prominent LPG alkane in o ur daca is pro pane, and there is no mention of measured propane concentrations in Mexi- co C ity anywhere in the five-volume report. The MARI report also provides an emis- sions inventory fo r in which resi- dential combust ion accounts for 33 1.2 met- ric tons per year out of a total of 624,954.3 metric to ns per year ( / , vol. 3, p. 88). We commented in our report that th is I 994 MARI estimate of 33 1 metric tons from residential combustion seemed much too small for an area with annual sales exceeding 2 million tons and that LPG leakage needed to be included in the calculations. We agree that further research on the composition and reactivity of a ll of the h ydrocarbons in Mexico City air is urgently needed if major progress is to be made toward solution of their serious air pollution problem. The statement at the end of the third paragraph of their comment- the absence of this compound [toluene) in Blake and Rowland's samples may be attributed to their sampling protocol -is puzzling, be- cause toluene was present in all of our sam- ples and was so reported. O ur table I re- ported the measured abundances of 25 hy- d rocarbons in four typical samples fro m our 1993 experiments, and toluene was reported as present in all of them. Indeed , when expressed in the units ppbC used in the MARI reports, toluene is the third most abundant hydrocarbon after methane and propane in the noontime Zocalo sample of table 1 in our report. However, the tre nd in our own data for toluene does not support the statement th at toluene concentration drops significantly at about 11:00 a.m. We have regularly observed more toluene at noon than at 6:00 a.m., as noted in our report. Th is difference cou ld be the result of a more complicated diurnal dependence, as well as our use of samples, each collected in less than 1 minute rather than 3 hours. We voes SCIENCE • VOL. 271 • 23 FEBRUARY 1996 W~ prefer the near instan taneous collection procedure because we are greatly interested in the correlat ions among the ind ividual hydrocarbon concentrat ions and believe the mixing of aliquots of air collected over sev- eral hours tends to complicate these signals. As everyone recognizes, changing the composition of LPG gas toward higher total vapor pressure (for example, toward more propane ) and lower chemical reactivity is not likely to be helpful with an overall system that already has a high rate of leak- age. O ur recommended reduction in the butene composition does not have this prob- lem because the vapor pressures of the bu- tanes and butenes are similar. If the compo- sit ion of LPG sample M 134 in table 3 of our report were h ypothetically altered by substi- tution of n-butane for all of the C 4 unsatur- ated compounds, then the total hydrocarbon reactivity would be reduced by about a factor of 2. For major overall hydrocarbon reduc- t ion in the LPG sector, however, the loss of unburned LPG at all scages of its handling must be addressed. This is obviously a d iffi- cult task because it involves about 5 million individual heating and cooking sources. Donald R. Blake F.

The Mexico City AJr Quality Initiative {MARI) is de- scribed in a five-volume study produced by a collab- oration between the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the lnstituto Mexicano del Petroleo and pub- lished as Los Alamos Rep. LA-12699 {1994). Climate Change Consensus I would like to reply to a letter by S. Fred Singer (2 Feb., p. 58 1 ). 1 a lso attended t he Madrid meet ing of che U nited Nations-- sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on C li - mate C hange (IPCC) in November 1995 and remember Singer's presence. As a non- governmental organization (NGO) repre- sen tative along with others in the envi ron- mental- and industry-sponsored lobbying groups, he was inv ited to attend and al- lowed to participate. Although he disputes the records of temperature change in his letter, 1 remember h im asking only one q uestion on ozone depletion and ultravio- let-B. He had fu ll access to all meeti ngs and on several occasions sought for and was given o ne-on-one meetings with several of the scientists present. The IPCC summary is indeed a summary and does nor include every piece of infor- mation that went into the full report . Much more supporting material, including most of che eclect ic collection of facts h ighl ighted"
