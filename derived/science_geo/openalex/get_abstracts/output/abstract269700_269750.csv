https://openalex.org/W1972089338,"An endocast of the frontal lobe of a reconstructed skull, which is approximately 2 million years old, from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya appears to represent the oldest human-like cortical sulcal pattern in the fossil record, while the endocast from another skull from the same region produces an endocast that appears apelike in its frontal lobe and similar to endocasts from earlier South African australopithecines. New analysis of paleoanatomical evidence thus indicates that at least two taxa of early hominids coexisted in East Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2056987538,"Four color names-red, yellow, green, and blue-can be used singly or combined in pairs to describe all other colors. Orange, for example, can be described as a reddish yellow, cyan as a bluish green, and purple as a reddish blue. Some dyadic color names (such as reddish green and bluish yellow) describe colors that are not normally realizable. By stabilizing the retinal image of the boundary between a pair of red and green stripes (or a pair of yellow and blue stripes) but not their outer edges, however, the entire region can be perceived simultaneously as both red and green (or yellow and blue)."
https://openalex.org/W1992829362,"Dialkyldimethylammonium hydroxide surfactants are highly soluble in water and form spontaneous stable vesicles. These vesicles can be grown to size with added acid, and appear to provide an ideal membrane mimetic system for the study of fusion and ion transport. These phenomena are a consequence of strong hydration forces that are not necessarily limited to the hydroxide ions. The forces can be used to design a variety of model systems whose behavior differs from that of systems in which double-chained surfactants form insoluble liquid crystalline phases in water and unstable vesicle suspensions on prolonged sonication."
https://openalex.org/W1981097699,"Thallium ion-induced carbonyl carbon chemical shifts were compared for all of the L-residue-peptide carbonyl carbons of the gramicidin A transmembrane channel. Molecular structures were deduced by using the argument that helically equivalent and equally proximal carbonyls would exhibit essentially equivalent ion-induced chemical shifts. The transmembrane channel was found to be a head-to-head dimer with the structure of a left-handed, single-stranded beta-helix."

https://openalex.org/W2028109535,"Embryonic softshell turtles develop inside eggs exchanging little, if any, liquid water with the nest environment. Despite the consequent restriction on availability of water to support development, embryos convert most of the ammonia released in catabolism of proteins into soluble urea rather than insoluble urate, and thereby commit a portion of their limited reserve of water to serve as solvent for metabolic wastes. This finding is contrary to expectations from prior studies of cleidoic eggs."
