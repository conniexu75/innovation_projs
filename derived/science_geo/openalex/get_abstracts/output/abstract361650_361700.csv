https://openalex.org/W2001089308,"Background The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein is the principal target of protective humoral immune responses to influenza virus infections but such antibody responses only provide efficient protection against a narrow spectrum of HA antigenic variants within a given virus subtype. Avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 are currently panzootic and pose a pandemic threat. These viruses are antigenically diverse and protective strategies need to cross protect against diverse viral clades. Furthermore, there are 16 different HA subtypes and no certainty the next pandemic will be caused by an H5 subtype, thus it is important to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that provide heterosubtypic protection. Methods and Findings Here we describe a panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recovered from combinatorial display libraries that were constructed from human IgM+ memory B cells of recent (seasonal) influenza vaccinees. The mAbs have broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes. Restriction to variable heavy chain gene IGHV1-69 in the high affinity mAb panel was associated with binding to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the stem domain of HA. The most potent antibody (CR6261) was protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge. Conclusions The human monoclonal CR6261 described in this study could be developed for use as a broad spectrum agent for prophylaxis or treatment of human or avian influenza infections without prior strain characterization. Moreover, the CR6261 epitope could be applied in targeted vaccine strategies or in the design of novel antivirals. Finally our approach of screening the IgM+ memory repertoire could be applied to identify conserved and functionally relevant targets on other rapidly evolving pathogens."

Previous fMRI studies have predicted a perceptual state by classifying brain activity into prespecified categories. Constraint-free visual image reconstruction is more challenging, as it is impractical to specify brain activity for all possible images. In this study, we reconstructed visual images by combining local image bases of multiple scales, whose contrasts were independently decoded from fMRI activity by automatically selecting relevant voxels and exploiting their correlated patterns. Binary-contrast, 10 × 10-patch images (2100 possible states) were accurately reconstructed without any image prior on a single trial or volume basis by measuring brain activity only for several hundred random images. Reconstruction was also used to identify the presented image among millions of candidates. The results suggest that our approach provides an effective means to read out complex perceptual states from brain activity while discovering information representation in multivoxel patterns.

Objective assessment of perceptual experience in terms of brain activity represents a major challenge in neuroscience. Previous fMRI studies have shown that visual features, such as orientation and motion direction (Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y. Tong F.

Furthermore, a primitive form of “mind-reading” has been demonstrated by predicting a subjective state under the presentation of an ambiguous stimulus using a decoder trained with unambiguous stimuli (Kamitani and Tong, 2005Kamitani Y.

However, such a simple classification approach is insufficient to capture the complexity of perceptual experience, since our perception consists of numerous possible states, and it is impractical to measure brain activity for all the states. A recent study (Kay et al., 2008Kay K.N. Naselaris T. Prenger R.J. Gallant J.L. Identifying natural images from human brain activity.Nature. 2008; 452: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that a presented image can be identified among a large number of candidate images using a receptive field model that predicts fMRI activity for visual images (see also Mitchell et al., 2008Mitchell T.M. Shinkareva S.V. Carlson A. Chang K.M. Malave V.L. Mason R.A. Just M.A. Predicting human brain activity associated with the meanings of nouns.Science. 2008; 320: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, for a related approach). But the image identification was still constrained by the candidate image set. Even more challenging is visual image reconstruction, which decodes visual perception into an image, free from the constraint of categories (see Stanley et al., 1999Stanley G.B. Li F.F. Dan Y. Reconstruction of natural scenes from ensemble responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8036-8042PubMed Google Scholar, for reconstruction using LGN spikes). A possible approach is to utilize the retinotopy in the early visual cortex. The retinotopy associates the specific visual field location to the active cortical location, or voxel, providing a mapping from the visual field to the cortical voxels (Engel et al., 1994Engel S.A. Rumelhart D.E. Wandell B.A. Lee A.T. Glover G.H. Chichilnisky E.J. Shadlen M.N. fMRI of human visual cortex.Nature. 1994; 369: 525Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, Sereno et al., 1995Sereno M.I. Dale A.M. Reppas J.B. Kwong K.K. Belliveau J.W. Brady T.J. Rosen B.R. Tootell R.B. Borders of multiple visual areas in humans revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.Science. 1995; 268: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Thus, one may predict local contrast information by monitoring the fMRI signals corresponding to the retinotopy map of the target visual field location. The retinotopy can be further elaborated using a voxel receptive-field model. By inverting the receptive-field model, a presented image can be inferred given the brain activity consistent with the retinotopy (Thirion et al., 2006Thirion B. Duchesnay E. Hubbard E. Dubois J. Poline J.B. Lebihan D. Dehaene S. Inverse retinotopy: inferring the visual content of images from brain activation patterns.Neuroimage. 2006; 33: 1104-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, it may not be optimal to use the retinotopy or the inverse of the receptive field model to predict local contrast in an image. These methods are based on the model of individual voxel responses given a visual stimulus, and multivoxel patterns are not taken into account for the prediction of the visual stimulus. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the activity pattern, in particular the correlation among neurons or cortical locations in the decoding of a stimulus (Averbeck et al., 2006Averbeck B.B. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Neural correlations, population coding and computation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2006Chen Y. Geisler W.S. Seidemann E. Optimal decoding of correlated neural population responses in the primate visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since even a localized small visual stimulus elicits spatially spread activity over multiple cortical voxels (Engel et al., 1997Engel S.A. Glover G.H. Wandell B.A. Retinotopic organization in human visual cortex and the spatial precision of functional MRI.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, Shmuel et al., 2007Shmuel A. Yacoub E. Chaimow D. Logothetis N.K. Ugurbil K. Spatio-temporal point-spread function of fMRI signal in human gray matter at 7 Tesla.Neuroimage. 2007; 35: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), multivoxel patterns may contain information useful for predicting the presented stimulus. In addition, a visual image is thought to be represented at multiple spatial scales in the visual cortex, which may serve to retain the visual sensitivity to fine-to-coarse patterns at a single visual field location (Campbell and Robson, 1968Campbell F.W. Robson J.G. Application of Fourier analysis to the visibility of gratings.J. Physiol. 1968; 197: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, De Valois et al., 1982De Valois R.L. Albrecht D.G. Thorell L.G. Spatial frequency selectivity of cells in macaque visual cortex.Vision Res. 1982; 22: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The conventional retinotopy, by contrast, does not imply such multiscale representation, as it simply posits a location-to-location mapping. It may be possible to extract multiscale information from fMRI signals and use it to achieve better reconstruction. Here, we present an approach to visual image reconstruction using multivoxel patterns of fMRI signals and multiscale visual representation (Figure 1A). We assume that an image is represented by a linear combination of local image elements of multiple scales (colored rectangles). The stimulus state at each local element (Ci, Cj, …) is predicted by a decoder using multivoxel patterns (weight set for each decoder, wi, wj, …), and then the outputs of all the local decoders are combined in a statistically optimal way (combination coefficient, λi, λj, …) to reconstruct the presented image. As each local element has fewer possible states than the entire image, the training of local decoders requires only a small number of training samples. Hence, each local decoder serves as a “module” for a simple image component, and the combination of the modular decoders allows us to represent numerous variations of complex images. The decoder uses all the voxels from the early visual areas as the input, while automatically pruning irrelevant voxels. Thus, the decoder is not explicitly informed about the retinotopy mapping. We applied this approach to the reconstruction of contrast-defined images consisting of 10 × 10 binary patches (Figure 1B). We show that once our model is trained with several hundred random images, it can accurately reconstruct arbitrary images (2100 possible images), including geometric and alphabet shapes, on a single trial (6 s/12 s block) or volume (2 s) basis, without any prior information about the image. The reconstruction accuracy is quantified by image identification performance, revealing the ability to identify the presented image among a set of millions of candidate images. Analyses provide evidence that the multivoxel pattern decoder, which exploits voxel correlations especially in V1, and the multiscale reconstruction model both significantly contribute to the high quality of reconstruction. In the present study, we attempted to reconstruct visual images defined by binary contrast patterns consisting of 10 × 10 square patches (Figure 1). Given fMRI signals r, we modeled a reconstruction image Î(x|r) by a linear combination of local image bases (elements) ϕm(x) (Olshausen and Field, 1996Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images.Nature. 1996; 381: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (3740) Google Scholar),Iˆ(x|r)=∑mλmCm(r)ϕm(x),where x represents a spatial position in the image, Cm(r) is the contrast of each local image basis predicted from fMRI signals, and λm is the combination coefficient of each local image basis. The local image bases, ϕm(x), were prefixed such that they redundantly covered the whole image with multiple spatial scales. We used local image bases of four scales: 1 × 1, 1 × 2, 2 × 1, and 2 × 2 patch areas. They were placed at every location in the image with overlaps. Thus, ϕm(x) served as overcomplete basis functions, the number of which was larger than that of all the patches. Although image elements larger than 2 × 2 or those with nonrectangular shapes could be used, the addition of such elements did not improve the reconstruction performance. For each local image basis, we trained a “local decoder” that predicted the corresponding contrast using a linearly weighted sum of fMRI signals. The weights of voxels, w, were optimized using a statistical learning algorithm described in Experimental Procedures (“sparse logistic regression,” Yamashita et al., 2008Yamashita O. Sato M.A. Yoshioka T. Tong F. Kamitani Y. Sparse estimation automatically selects voxels relevant for the decoding of fMRI activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2008; 42: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to best predict the contrast of the local image element with a training data set. Note that our algorithm automatically selected the relevant voxels for decoding without explicit information about the retinotopy mapping measured by the conventional method. The combination coefficient, λm, was optimized to minimize the errors between presented and reconstructed images in a training data set. This coefficient was necessary because the local image bases were overcomplete and not independent of each other. Trained local decoders and their combination coefficients constituted a reconstruction model. fMRI signals were measured while subjects viewed a sequence of visual images consisting of binary contrast patches on a 10 × 10 grid. In the “random image session,” a random pattern was presented for 6 s followed by a 6 s rest period (Figure 1B). A total of 440 different random images were shown (each presented once). In the “figure image session,” an image forming a geometric or alphabet shape was presented for 12 s followed by a 12 s rest period. Five alphabet letters and five geometric shapes were shown six or eight times. We used fMRI signals from areas V1 and V2 for the analysis (unless otherwise stated). The data from the random image session were analyzed by a cross-validation procedure for quantitative evaluation. They were also used to train a model to reconstruct the images presented in the figure image session. Reconstructed images from all trials of the figure image session are illustrated in Figure 2A. They were reconstructed using the model trained with all data from the random image session. Reconstruction was performed on single-trial, block-averaged data (average of 12 s or six-volume fMRI signals). Note that no postprocessing was applied. Even though the geometric and alphabet shapes were not used for the training of the reconstruction model, the reconstructed images reveal essential features of the original shapes. The spatial correlation between the presented and reconstructed images was 0.68 ± 0.16 (mean ± s.d.) for subject S1 and 0.62 ± 0.09 for S2. We also found that reconstruction was possible even from 2 s single-volume data without block averaging (Figure 2B). The results show the temporal evolution of volume-by-volume reconstruction including the rest periods. All reconstruction sequences are presented in Movie S1. To further quantify reconstruction performance, we conducted image identification analysis (Kay et al., 2008Kay K.N. Naselaris T. Prenger R.J. Gallant J.L. Identifying natural images from human brain activity.Nature. 2008; 452: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, Thirion et al., 2006Thirion B. Duchesnay E. Hubbard E. Dubois J. Poline J.B. Lebihan D. Dehaene S. Inverse retinotopy: inferring the visual content of images from brain activation patterns.Neuroimage. 2006; 33: 1104-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in which the presented image was identified among a number of candidate images using an fMRI activity pattern (Figure 3A). We generated a candidate image set consisting of an image presented in the random image session and a specified number of random images selected from 2100 possible images (combinations of 10 × 10 binary contrasts). Given an fMRI activity pattern, image identification was performed by selecting the image with the smallest mean square difference from the reconstructed image. The rate of correct identification was calculated for a varied number of candidate random images. In both subjects, image identification performance was far above the chance level, even up to an image set size of 10 million (Figure 3B). The identification performance can be further extrapolated by fitting the sigmoid function. The extrapolation suggests that performance above 10% correct could be achieved even with image sets of 1010.8 for S1 and of 107.4 for S2, using block-averaged single-trial data. The identification performance with 2 s single-volume data was lower than that of block-averaged data, but was still above the chance level for a large number of candidate images (above 10% correct with image sets of 108.5 for S1 and of 105.8 for S2). In the following sections, we examine how multivoxel patterns and multiscale image representation, critical components of our reconstruction model, contributed to the high reconstruction performance. Our algorithm for training local decoders automatically selected relevant voxels and assigned weights, thereby yielding robust classification performance (Yamashita et al., 2008Yamashita O. Sato M.A. Yoshioka T. Tong F. Kamitani Y. Sparse estimation automatically selects voxels relevant for the decoding of fMRI activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2008; 42: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar; see Figure S1 for comparison with conventional algorithms without sparse voxel selection). We first examined the distributions of voxel weights of local decoders in comparison with the conventional retinotopy. Cortical surface maps show the distributions of weight magnitudes for a foveal and a peripheral patch (Figure 4A). The largest weight values are found around the cortical locations consistent with the retinotopic representation of the patch locations. The distributions of voxel weights for 1 × 1 decoders are summarized in Figure 4B. Decoders were sorted by the eccentricity and the polar angle of their target locations, and voxels were sorted by their corresponding eccentricity and polar angle identified by the conventional retinotopy mapping from a separate experiment. Large weight values were distributed around the diagonal line, indicating that local decoders mainly used voxels corresponding to the retinotopic locations for their target patches (see Figure S2 for comparison between the conventional retinotopy and the map of the voxels relevant for the decoding). The weight distribution tended to be blurred for peripheral patches, indicating that peripheral decoders failed to select retinotopic voxels (Figure 4B, left). Along the polar angle, the patches around the vertical and horizontal meridians (0/180° and 90°, respectively) showed higher correlation with the retinotopy than those at other angles (Figure 4B, right). This is partly because the locations of the patches arranged on the square grid have anisotropy with respect to the polar angle: the patches around the meridians are located at smaller eccentricity than those at nonmeridian angles on average. When the eccentricity was matched between the meridian and non-meridian patches, the difference became less pronounced. Our local decoders were trained to exploit multivoxel patterns for the prediction of target contrast (“multivoxel pattern decoders”). However, as noted above, the locations of the selected voxels were largely consistent with the conventional retinotopy. Thus, a simple mapping between a cortical location [single or group of voxel(s)] and a stimulus position might be sufficient for the decoding. To examine whether multivoxel patterns were effectively used for the decoding, we devised other types of local decoders that only used retinotopic voxels (“retinotopic decoders”). By applying the standard general linear model to the data from the random image session, we identified a single voxel with the highest t value, or a group of significantly responsive voxels (p < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected for multiple comparisons) for each patch (Figure S3). This technique, known as the multifocal retinotopy mapping, gives the equivalent of the conventional phase-encoded retinotopy map (Hansen et al., 2004Hansen K.A. David S.V. Gallant J.L. Parametric reverse correlation reveals spatial linearity of retinotopic human V1 BOLD response.Neuroimage. 2004; 23: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Vanni et al., 2005Vanni S. Henriksson L. James A.C. Multifocal fMRI mapping of visual cortical areas.Neuroimage. 2005; 27: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We used (1) the most responsive voxel, (2) the average of the significantly responsive voxels, or (3) the “t value weighted” average of the significantly responsive voxels as the input. The decoders consisted of the standard univariate logistic regression model. The performance of these decoders was compared with that of the multivoxel pattern decoder. Cross-validation analysis using the random image trials revealed that the multivoxel pattern decoder achieved significantly higher correct rates than either of the three retinotopic decoders (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons), while the difference gradually diminished at the periphery approaching the chance level (Figure 5A). Although the figure illustrates the performance only for the 1 × 1 scale, the decoders of other scales showed similar results. The number of the significantly responsive voxels was larger than the number of the voxels selected by the multivoxel pattern decoder for the foveal to middle eccentricity. Since in this range of eccentricity the multivoxel pattern decoder largely outperformed the retinotopic decoders, the higher performance of the multivoxel pattern decoder is not merely due to noise reduction by pooling multivoxel signals. These results indicate that our local decoders did not simply depend on the mapping between a cortical location and a stimulus location, but that they effectively exploited multivoxel patterns. One of the key features of multivoxel patterns is the correlation between voxels. Our multivoxel pattern decoder takes into account the correlation between voxels in the training data to determine voxel weight parameters, as is the case with other multivariate statistical methods (see Supplemental Data; Yamashita et al., 2008Yamashita O. Sato M.A. Yoshioka T. Tong F. Kamitani Y. Sparse estimation automatically selects voxels relevant for the decoding of fMRI activity patterns.Neuroimage. 2008; 42: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To examine how voxel correlations contribute to decoding accuracy, we trained the decoder with fMRI data in which voxel correlations were removed and compared the performance with that of the original decoder. The data were created by shuffling the order of the trials with the same stimulus label in each voxel (Averbeck et al., 2006Averbeck B.B. Latham P.E. Pouget A. Neural correlations, population coding and computation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). This shuffling procedure removes voxel correlations that are independent of the stimulus label. Note that since the stimuli were random images, the voxel correlations observed in the original training data do not reflect the correlations between stimulus patches. The trained decoder was tested with independent nonshuffled data. The performance with shuffled data was significantly lower than that with the original data (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05), particularly at the middle range of eccentricity (Figure 5B). The results suggest that the multivoxel pattern decoder makes effective use of voxel correlation to achieve high decoding performance. We have thus far shown the results obtained using the voxels from V1 and V2 as the input to the decoders. We next compared the reconstruction between individual visual areas by using the voxels in each of V1, V2, and V3 as the input. As illustrated in Figure 6A, reconstruction quality progressively deteriorated along the visual cortical hierarchy. Quantitative comparison was performed by calculating the reconstruction errors for the images from the random image session (squared difference between the presented and the reconstructed contrast in each patch averaged over each entire image). Higher visual areas showed significantly larger errors than V1 (Figure 6B; ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons), indicating that V1 contains most reliable information for reconstructing visual images. Inspection of the models for these three visual areas revealed the following differences. First, in higher areas, the selected voxels were less localized to the retinotopic locations than in V1 (Figure 6C). Second, the shuffling analysis on the local decoders showed that the performance significantly decreased for all areas when voxel correlations were removed (Figure 6D, 1 × 1 decoders; ANOVA, p < 0.05; other scales showed similar results). The performance difference between the original and shuffled data was prominent in V1 but diminished in higher areas, indicating the critical contribution of voxel correlations in V1. Finally, the difference in reconstruction error was also largest in V1 (Figure 6E; ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons), consistent with the performance of the local decoders. These findings suggest that the reliable information available in V1 is represented not only in the ordered retinotopic organization, but also in the correlated voxel patterns. When we used all voxels from V1 to V4 together as the input to the decoder, most of the nonzero weights were found around the retinotopic voxels in V1, but not in the higher areas (Figure S4). The quality of image reconstruction remained similar to that obtained by V1 and V2 voxels. This preference to V1 voxels may also be accounted for by the fine retinotopic organization and the informative voxel correlations available in V1, from which our decoder can effectively extract information. We then tested the significance of the multiscale representation by comparing the multiscale model with single-scale models that consisted of optimally combined, single-scale image bases (1 × 1, 1 × 2, 2 × 1, or 2 × 2; V1 and V2 voxels used as the input). Representative examples of the reconstructed images obtained from the figure image session are presented in Figure 7A. The reconstructed image from the 1 × 1 scale model showed fine edges but exhibited patchy noise. By contrast, the 2 × 2 scale model produced a spatially blurred image. The images from the 1 × 2 and 2 × 1 scale models contained horizontally and vertically elongated components. The reconstructed image from the multiscale model appears to have balanced features of these individual scales. The reconstruction error of the multiscale model, calculated with the images from the random image session, was significantly smaller than those of the single-scale models (Figure 7B; ANOVA, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons). We also calculated reconstruction errors at each eccentricity (Figure 7C). For all scales, the reconstruction error increased with eccentricity, but the profiles were different. The error sharply increased with eccentricity for the 1 × 1 model, while the profile was rather flat for the 2 × 2 model. As a result, the errors for these models were reversed at the fovea and the periphery. The 1 × 2 and 2 × 1 models showed intermediate profiles. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction between scale and eccentricity (p < 0.05 for interaction between eccentricity and scale, two-way ANOVA). The multiscale model exhibited an error profile matching the minimum envelope of those for the single-scale models. Thus, the multiscale model appears to optimally find reliable scales at each eccentricity. The combination coefficients of the multiscale model are summarized in Figure 7D. Consistent with the above observation, the model relied on the fine- and coarse-scale decoders for the reconstruction of the foveal and peripheral regions, respectively. These results indicate that the optimization of combination coefficients indeed found reliable local decoders at each visual field location to achieve high reconstruction performance. The image bases of different scales were useful since the scale of reliable decoders varied across eccentricity. However, it is not clear whether overlapping multiple scales contributed to the reconstruction. To address this issue, we compared the multiscale model with an “eccentricity-dependent-scale model”, in which the region of the same eccentricity was tiled with image bases of a single reliable scale (Figure 8A). We found that the reconstruction error was significantly smaller with the multiscale model than with the eccentricity-dependent-scale model (ANOVA, p < 0.05; Figure 8A). The performance of the multiscale model was particularly better in the middle to peripheral range of eccentricity (Figure 8B). This result is in agreement with the combination coefficients shown in Figure 7D, in which all scales had comparable values at the middle to peripheral eccentricity. The results shown in Figure 8 were obtained using a particular spatial arrangement of nonoverlapping images bases, whose"

To explore the neural underpinnings of these processes, we scanned subjects with fMRI while they determined the appropriate punishment for crimes that varied in perpetrator responsibility and crime severity. Activity within regions linked to affective processing (amygdala, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex) predicted punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios. By contrast, activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex distinguished between scenarios on the basis of criminal responsibility, suggesting that it plays a key role in third-party punishment. The same prefrontal region has previously been shown to be involved in punishing unfair economic behavior in two-party interactions, raising the possibility that the cognitive processes supporting third-party legal decision-making and second-party economic norm enforcement may be supported by a common neural mechanism in human prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3123259284,"In classical mathematical epidemiology, individuals do not adapt their contact behavior during epidemics. They do not endogenously engage, for example, in social distancing based on fear. Yet, adaptive behavior is well-documented in true epidemics. We explore the effect of including such behavior in models of epidemic dynamics.Using both nonlinear dynamical systems and agent-based computation, we model two interacting contagion processes: one of disease and one of fear of the disease. Individuals can ""contract"" fear through contact with individuals who are infected with the disease (the sick), infected with fear only (the scared), and infected with both fear and disease (the sick and scared). Scared individuals--whether sick or not--may remove themselves from circulation with some probability, which affects the contact dynamic, and thus the disease epidemic proper. If we allow individuals to recover from fear and return to circulation, the coupled dynamics become quite rich, and can include multiple waves of infection. We also study flight as a behavioral response.In a spatially extended setting, even relatively small levels of fear-inspired flight can have a dramatic impact on spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics. Self-isolation and spatial flight are only two of many possible actions that fear-infected individuals may take. Our main point is that behavioral adaptation of some sort must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2063414626,"The GTPase dynamin is critically involved in membrane fission during endocytosis. How does dynamin use the energy of GTP hydrolysis for membrane remodeling? By monitoring the ionic permeability through lipid nanotubes (NT), we found that dynamin was capable of squeezing NT to extremely small radii, depending on the NT lipid composition. However, long dynamin scaffolds did not produce fission: instead, fission followed GTPase-dependent cycles of assembly and disassembly of short dynamin scaffolds and involved a stochastic process dependent on the curvature stress imposed by dynamin. Fission happened spontaneously upon NT release from the scaffold, without leakage. Our calculations revealed that local narrowing of NT could induce cooperative lipid tilting, leading to self-merger of the inner monolayer of NT (hemifission), consistent with the absence of leakage. We propose that dynamin transmits GTP's energy to periodic assembling of a limited curvature scaffold that brings lipids to an unstable intermediate. The GTPase dynamin is critically involved in membrane fission during endocytosis. How does dynamin use the energy of GTP hydrolysis for membrane remodeling? By monitoring the ionic permeability through lipid nanotubes (NT), we found that dynamin was capable of squeezing NT to extremely small radii, depending on the NT lipid composition.

Formation of an endocytic vesicle is completed by scission of a thin membrane neck connecting the vesicle and the plasma membrane (De Camilli et al., 1995De Camilli P. Takei K. McPherson P.S.

Though scission is intuitively associated with cutting and resealing, even transient permeabilization of cellular membranes could be damaging, especially for small vesicles whose content can quickly escape through even minute pores (Frolov et al., 2003aFrolov V.A.

Thus, fission of neck membranes is more likely to proceed via “hemifission” to avoid leakage (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M.

Crucial for many cell processes featuring fission, dynamin family members form dense collars around necks of budding vesicles and dividing organelles (Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L.

Assembly of this collar triggers cooperative GTP hydrolysis, which is thought to force membrane remodeling (Marks et al., 2001Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R.

However, the pathway that links the GTPase activity of dynamin and membrane rearrangements during fission is obscure. The strongest experimental data supporting the hypothesis of a direct mechanochemical action of dynamin are based upon analysis of dynamin's interaction with pure lipid membranes. Isolated dynamin remains mechanically active in vitro: it causes tubulation of charged lipid bilayers via self-assembly into long cylindrical superstructures, showing a pronounced helical pattern of dynamin packing (Marks et al., 2001Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T.

Tube fragmentation is generally linked to the cooperative reorganization of the helix upon GTP hydrolysis: constriction, extension, and twisting of the dynamin helix have all been proposed to impose curvature and tensile stresses on the tube membrane (Roux et al., 2006Roux A.

Whether similar long-range transformations of dynamin helices catalyze rearrangements of cellular membrane necks remains unclear. In the presence of GTP, dynamin polymerizes only transiently on liposome templates: cooperative GTP hydrolysis, triggered by polymerization (Warnock et al., 1996Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Dynamin self-assembly stimulates its GTPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) leads to disordering and disassembly of the dynamin scaffold, preventing formation of extended structures (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H.

Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In cells, dynamin is efficiently and transiently targeted to membrane necks, where it is thought to quickly mediate their scission (Rappoport et al., 2008Rappoport J.Z. Heyman K.P. Kemal S.

McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Long membrane necks covered by dynamin are only seen when the fission activity of dynamin is suppressed, e.g., by addition of nonhydrolysable analogs of GTP or by overexpression of specific mutants of dynamin (Takei et al., 1995Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Tubular membrane invaginations coated by dynamin rings are induced by GTP-gamma S in nerve terminals.Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that short dynamin collars formed when GTP is constantly present suffice to mediate membrane fission. The dynamics of membrane remodeling by short dynamin assemblies formed in the presence of GTP is difficult to characterize because the corresponding membrane transformations are expected to be fast and highly localized. In cellular systems, similar membrane transformations are studied by electrophysiology revealing a rich dynamic behavior of membrane necks of endocytic vesicles (Frolov et al., 2003bFrolov V.A. Lizunov V.A. Dunina-Barkovskaya A.Y. Samsonov A.V. Zimmerberg J. Shape bistability of a membrane neck: a toggle switch to control vesicle content release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 1994; 91: 5267-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here, we applied these techniques to resolve dynamin's interaction with nanotubes pulled from lipid membranes (Frolov et al., 2003bFrolov V.A. Lizunov V.A. Dunina-Barkovskaya A.Y. Samsonov A.V. Zimmerberg J. Shape bistability of a membrane neck: a toggle switch to control vesicle content release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8698-8703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We measured the ionic permeability of the tube's interior to estimate average changes in the diameter of the tube and to resolve the kinetics of tube fission. We discovered that self-assembling dynamin scaffolds caused dramatic narrowing of the nanotubes, their final radius depending on the tube rigidity. However, fission required partial disassembly of long dynamin scaffolds triggered by GTP hydrolysis. GTPase cycles of dynamin were coupled to assembly and disassembly of short dynamin coats, producing membrane curvature and fission in a stochastic lipid-dependent manner. These results suggest that dynamin acts as a catalyst of membrane remodeling bringing membrane nanotubes to the point of spontaneous fission via creation of regulated curvature constraints. Lipid nanotubes were pulled from planar phospholipid bilayers with a glass pipette so that the nanotube extended between the bilayer and the pipette tip (Figure 1A) (Frolov et al., 2003bFrolov V.A. Lizunov V.A. Dunina-Barkovskaya A.Y. Samsonov A.V. Zimmerberg J. Shape bistability of a membrane neck: a toggle switch to control vesicle content release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Membrane nanotubes in the electric field as a model for measurement of mechanical parameters of the lipid bilayer.Biochemistry (Moscow). Supplement Series A: Membrane and Cell Biology. 2007; 1: 176-184Crossref Google Scholar). The nanotubes were formed in ionic buffer, and the integral ionic permeability (hereafter conductance, G) of the tube interior was monitored in real time. The luminal radius (RL) of a nanotube pulled from a lipid bilayer is defined by mechanical equilibrium between the lateral tension (σ) and the bending rigidity (B) of the tube membrane (RL∼√B/σ) and thus does not depend on the tube length L (Supplemental Data, “Estimation of the lateral tension of the NT and wNT membranes,” available online) (Evans and Yeung, 1994Evans E. Yeung A. Hidden dynamics in rapid changes of bilayer shape.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 39-56Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Measurement of the dependence of G on L gives RL (Figure 1B). To obtain different RL, we used lipid compositions that differ substantially in their bending rigidity. The first produced narrow nanotubes (NT) (RL = 6.0 ± 1.2 nm, SD, n = 21). The second produced wide nanotubes (wNT) (RL = 20.5 ± 2.2 nm, SD n = 6) (Figure 1B). Both compositions contained moderate amounts (15–20 mol%) of charged lipids (phosphatidylserine [PS]).We estimated lateral tension of NT as 0.7 ± 0.2 dyn/cm and of wNT as 0.4 ± 0.2 dyn/cm (Figure S1). This difference and the approximately six times higher bending rigidity of wNT membrane containing lysolipids and cholesterol (Supplemental Data, “Estimation of the lateral tension of the NT and wNT membranes”) (Frolov et al., 2003bFrolov V.A. Lizunov V.A. Dunina-Barkovskaya A.Y. Samsonov A.V. Zimmerberg J. Shape bistability of a membrane neck: a toggle switch to control vesicle content release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8698-8703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) account for larger value of the wNT radius. Both NT and wNT were used as templates for dynamin. Shortly after application of 4 μM dynamin solution from a delivery pipette (Figure 1A), the NT conductance gradually decreased, reaching a new stationary level (Figure 2A, in five out of five experiments). The conductance decrease indicates narrowing of NT, presumably caused by assembly of dynamin helices. Removal of the delivery pipette did not lead to restoration of the NT conductance; thus, dynamin binds strongly to the tube wall. We interpret the subsequent resistance to NT shortening as the assembly of an extended dynamin scaffold. Unlike the bare NT, which could be shortened and extended freely, the NT coated by dynamin was usually severed upon shortening, detected by an instant and irreversible drop of the NT conductance to background level (Figure 2A, ↓L). To minimize the concentration variability, we pulled NT in the constant presence of dynamin (0.4 μM) in solution. Immediately after NT formation, dynamin assembling on the tubule caused a gradual reduction of the NT conductance (Figure 2B, 12 experiments in total). After a new steady-state was reached, further extension of the NT was still possible: when a new piece of the bare NT was pulled out, dynamin quickly bound and squeezed it (Figure 2C, three experiments in total). To verify that dynamin can bind to the NT membrane containing no PI(4,5)P2, we monitored dynamin interaction with membrane tubes pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing a moderate amount of PS (20 mol%). Dynamin produced visible squeezing of such tubes as detected by reduction of the peak fluorescence averaged over the tube length (1.9-fold ± 0.8-fold, SD, n = 4; Figure 2D). Furthermore, fluorescently labeled dynamin densely covers the membrane tubes containing 20 mol% PS (Figure 2E). The increase of the BODIPY fluorescence associated with the tube (at least three times higher than the background noise) was detected in five out of five trials. Thus, dynamin indeed interacts with lipid nanotubes containing a moderate amount of PS. However, the action of dynamin on lipid nanotubes was strongly modulated by PI(4,5)P2 and membrane rigidity. Figure 3A shows representative recordings demonstrating the dynamin-induced decrease of the conductance of NT, NT doped with PI(4,5)P2 and wNT. PI(4,5)P2 greatly accelerated the squeezing process (Figures 3A and 3B, brown). The wNT conductance, on the other hand, decreased much slower (Figures 3A and 3B, red), likely reflecting dynamin's binding preference for highly curved PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2008Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The conductance of the nanotube, normalized to its initial value, reached a similar steady-state value independently on the lipid composition (Figure 3A). However, the luminal radius corresponding to this new steady-state was substantially different for NT and wNT (Figure 3C). Assuming that the nanotubes were uniformly covered and squeezed by dynamin (Figure 2E), we found that the NT RL decreased to 2.6 ± 0.6 nm (SE, Figure 3B, black columns), whereas the wNT was squeezed to 12.4 ± 1.6 nm (SE, Figure 3C, red columns). Addition of PI(4,5)P2 caused only a minor effect on RL (Figure 3C, brown columns). The scaled images illustrating the geometry of NT and wNT squeezed by dynamin are shown in the insert in Figure 3C. The outer diameter of the squeezed NT (∼40 nm) and wNT (∼60 nm) are not substantially different, comparable to those obtained from structural studies (Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Dynamin undergoes a GTP-dependent conformational change causing vesiculation.Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the luminal diameters of NT and wNT are drastically different. This difference demonstrates that the curvature-driven activity of dynamin can be strongly modulated by membrane lipid composition. Thus, the dynamin scaffold cannot impose the same geometry on every lipid membrane (Kozlov, 2001Kozlov M.M. Fission of biological membranes: interplay between dynamin and lipids.Traffic. 2001; 2: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar): more rigid membranes bend less. The inner diameter of the NT squeezed by dynamin was comparable with the membrane thickness, indicating possible curvature instabilities (Allain et al., 2004Allain J.M. Storm C. Roux A. Ben Amar M. Joanny J.F. Fission of a multiphase membrane tube.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004; 93: 158104Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003Kozlovsky Y. Kozlov M.M.

Wortis M. Stability of cylindrical vesicles under axial tension.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Phys. Plasmas Fluids Relat. Interdiscip. Topics. 1996; 54: 5463-5468PubMed Google Scholar). To examine stability of NT at high curvatures, we used osmotic pressure. High- and low-salt solutions were applied to the NT (Figure 1A, Figure S2). External application of hypotonic solutions to NT led to a moderate expansion of the NT (Figure 3D, green curve). Hypertonic solutions caused a gradual squeezing, mimicking the action of dynamin (Figure 3D, blue curve). Upon reaching RL comparable with those of the NT squeezed by dynamin (see histogram in Figure 3C), osmotically stressed NT collapsed (in five out of eight experiments; Figure 3D, blue curve). These data establish that a curvature stress close to that imposed by the dynamin scaffold destabilizes the bare lipid NT (Jan Bukman et al., 1996Jan Bukman D. Hua Yao J. Wortis M. Stability of cylindrical vesicles under axial tension.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Phys. Plasmas Fluids Relat. Interdiscip. Topics. 1996; 54: 5463-5468PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although the dynamin scaffold can generate potentially destabilizing high membrane curvature, it unexpectedly stabilizes narrow NT from fission. In cells, dynamin acts in the constant presence of GTP required for the fission activity. NT formed in the presence of both dynamin (0.4 μM) and GTP (1 mM) behaved differently from NT generated without GTP: we observed only a minor gradual decrease in the NT conductance terminated by an instantaneous drop to background level (Figure 4A, 14 out of 17 experiments). We interpret these acute conductance drops as a complete loss of connectivity through NT because (1) their kinetics were much faster than dynamin-induced tube squeezing (Figure 2A) and (2) the NT conductance did not change when the patch pipette was moved to impose different lengths (Figure 4B). When GTPγS replaced GTP, a gradual conductance decrement was detected instead of the instantaneous conductance drops (four experiments, data not shown), confirming that the NT closure required GTP hydrolysis. This irreversible closure of the NT indicates complete fission rather than merger of only the inner monolayer of the NT membrane (stable hemifission) because the hemifission intermediate is expected to spontaneously decay to complete fission for the NT under high lateral tension (Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003Kozlovsky Y. Kozlov M.M. Membrane fission: model for intermediate structures.Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We further monitored whether NT closure was accompanied by leakage. The NT conductance was measured simultaneously with the ionic current through the NT membrane. In previous studies (Frolov et al., 2003aFrolov V.A. Dunina-Barkovskaya A.Y. Samsonov A.V. Zimmerberg J. Membrane permeability changes at early stages of influenza hemagglutinin-mediated fusion.Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1725-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the sensitivity of such measurements (background noise of 20–50 pS r.m.s. at ∼0.5 ms time resolution) allowed us to detect small and transient pores in the membrane during leaky membrane fusion. No such pores were detected during the dynamin-driven closure of the NT in five out of five experiments (Figure 4C). The lack of detectable leakage strongly indicates that the dynamin-driven fission of the NT involves the hemifission intermediate. Interestingly, no spikes in the NT conductance accompanied the osmotic-driven fission of the NT (in five out of five cases, see Figure 3D), whereas such spikes, indicating the membrane leakage, were routinely detected when the NT was severed mechanically (Figure S3). Thus, the absence of the leakage during fission seemingly correlates with the critical squeezing of NT. Lack of pronounced narrowing of the NT prior to fission suggests that in the presence of GTP dynamin acts in small assemblies. To explore this possibility, we performed experiments on short NTs formed in the presence of dynamin (0.4 μM) and GTP (1 mM). These NTs were first pulled and then quickly shortened before dynamin-mediated fission had occurred. The shortening is seen as an increase of the NT conductance coinciding with the decrease of the NT length (Figure 4B). With no dynamin present, the NT shortened up to 0.5 μm had the conductance stable in time (Figure 4B, blue curve). When NT was shortened to less than 0.8 μm in the presence of dynamin and GTP (five cases in total), we detected slow wave-like conductance fluctuations followed by fission (Figure 4B, black curve). For longer NTs, such fluctuations were not resolved. There are two characteristic time scales for the NT conductance (Figure 4B). Slow wave-like events reflect reversible changes in the NT geometry. Fast conductance drops indicate the fission exclusively. The distribution of the lifetime of shortened NT (the lag time before the fission) was rather broad (Figure 4D) and showed no apparent correlation with NT length or radius, indicating the probabilistic nature of the NT fission. We further compared the lifetime of the shortened NTs with the characteristic time of squeezing of long (>3 μm) NTs by dynamin in the absence of GTP (Figure 4E, red and blue, respectively). This comparison shows that the lifetime of a short NT is often longer than the time needed to completely encage a long NT by dynamin. Yet, only minor narrowing of the NT was detected prior to the fission (Figures 4A and 4B, see also the histogram in Figure 5C). Thus, we deduce that GTP hydrolysis, triggered by self-assembly of a short dynamin scaffold, can result in either fast irreversible fission or slower reversible disassembly of dynamin without producing fission. Only a part of the NT membrane is covered by assembled dynamin scaffolds in each particular moment. Such an incomplete coverage of NT in the presence of GTP would well correspond to the “loose” and fragmented dynamin spirals seen by electron microscopy (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in dynamin: evidence for a mechanochemical molecular spring.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The transient formation of short dynamin scaffolds is expected to cause periodic variations of the NT conductance, and these were observed (Figure 4B). We calculated that localized squeezing of the NT lumen to 2 nm by a short collar-like dynamin structure (corresponding roughly to three rungs of a dynamin spiral or 40 nm length [Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar]) would result in ∼10 pS change in the NT conductance, providing that NT length is diminished to ∼1 μm. Changes of this magnitude were seen (Figure 4B). Thus, when GTP is present in solution, dynamin operates in short and transient assemblies, each attempting to mediate a localized fission reaction. To explore the effect of lipid composition on fission by short dynamin assemblies and GTP, we applied dynamin and GTP to wNT. We detected no breakage of wNT but only a moderately slow decrease of its conductance to a new steady-state level (Figure 5A) in six out of six experiments where dynamin (0.4 μM) and GTP (1 mM) were added together. The corresponding steady-state conductance was twice as high with GTP than without it (Figures 3A and 5B), suggesting that the assembled structures were short and did not cover the wNT completely. Indeed, under these conditions, dynamin did not restrict the wNT geometry, and its conductance could be experimentally manipulated (Figure 5A). This behavior further supports our observation that, in the presence of GTP, dynamin molecules acted in small assemblies, because no extended curvature scaffold was formed. The stationary conductance of wNT in the presence of dynamin and GTP is expected to be the same, regardless of the direction of approach to the steady state. To confirm this conjecture, we pulled wNT in the presence of dynamin (0.4 μM), and then, after the wNT squeezing by dynamin was completed, we applied GTP (1 mM) via a delivery pipette. Subsequently, the wNT conductance increased to the new stationary value similar to that achieved upon simultaneous addition of dynamin and GTP to wNT (Figure 5B, red curve). After removal of the delivery pipette, the wNT conductance returned to the level characteristic for dynamin squeezing in the absence of GTP (Figures 5B and 5C). Thus, GTP regulates dynamin's function not only in membrane fission but also in curvature scaffolding."
https://openalex.org/W2068676111,"Aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage are emerging as important pathological components in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that deregulation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) activity by p25/Cdk5 induces aberrant cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks leading to neurotoxicity. In a transgenic model for neurodegeneration, p25/Cdk5 activity elicited cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that preceded neuronal death. Inhibition of HDAC1 activity by p25/Cdk5 was identified as an underlying mechanism for these events, and HDAC1 gain of function provided potent protection against DNA damage and neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and an in vivo model for ischemia. Our findings outline a pathological signaling pathway illustrating the importance of maintaining HDAC1 activity in the adult neuron. This pathway constitutes a molecular link between aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage and is a potential target for therapeutics against diseases and conditions involving neuronal death."

We have developed fluid supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir, (SUPER) templates, to assay vesicle formation and membrane fission.

GTP addition triggers disassembly, but not membrane fission, arguing against models in which fission is mediated by concerted and global GTP-driven conformational changes. In contrast, under physiological conditions in the constant presence of GTP, dynamin mediates membrane fission. Under these conditions, fluorescently labeled dynamin cooperatively organizes into self-limited assemblies that continuously cycle at the membrane and drive vesicle release.

Vesicular transport and organelle biogenesis critically depend on membrane fission (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M.

During endocytosis, membrane fission is a regulated process dependent on the GTPase dynamin (Conner and Schmid, 2003Conner S.D. Schmid S.L.

Dynamin-1, the best-studied neuronal isoform, spontaneously self-assembles on favorable membrane templates to form helical spirals (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T.

It is assumed that a concerted nucleotide-dependent conformational change such as a GTP binding-dependent constriction (Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

Importantly, these models suggest that dynamin alone is insufficient and that fission requires other factors, such as a clathrin coat (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T.

GTP-dependent twisting of dynamin implicates constriction and tension in membrane fission.Nature. 2006; 441: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A preassembled state of dynamin is unlikely to exist in cells because GTP hydrolysis causes its rapid disassembly and dissociation from the membrane (Warnock et al., 1996Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Dynamin self-assembly stimulates its GTPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), resulting at steady state in the formation of dynamic, self-limited assemblies (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2008Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relevance of GTP-dependent global conformational changes and/or preassembled dynamin scaffold dynamics to membrane fission remains unclear. Likewise, whether the dynamic, self-limited assemblies of dynamin formed in the presence of GTP on a membrane template can mediate fission is not known. Analyzing dynamin behavior in the presence of GTP has been experimentally challenging because of the rapid kinetics of its membrane binding and dissociation. Furthermore, correlating previous models of dynamin organization and function to membrane fission is complicated by the absence of quantitative assays (Antonny, 2006Antonny B. Membrane deformation by protein coats.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fission, leading to the release of endocytic transport intermediates, has been studied with perforated cells and purified cell membranes (Schmid and Smythe, 1991Schmid S.L. Smythe E. Stage-specific assays for coated pit formation and coated vesicle budding in vitro.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Miwako and Schmid, 2005Miwako I. Schmid S.L. Clathrin-coated vesicle formation from isolated plasma membranes.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, because of the biochemical complexity of these systems, the minimum machinery required for fission remains undefined. On the other hand, partial reconstitution of transport processes with semipurified or purified coat and accessory proteins on protein-free liposomes have required electron microscopic (EM) analysis, thereby offering limited temporal resolution to analyze reaction intermediates (Takei et al., 1998Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P.

Light scattering has been used in potentially quantitative assays for membrane fission (Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

The stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin function is dependent on lipid bilayer curvature.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3483-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but changes in light scattering are difficult to interpret in heterogeneous mixtures. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that observed changes in light scattering reflect protein dissociation from the membrane and not membrane fission (Danino et al., 2004Danino D. Moon K.H. Hinshaw J.E.

Schmid S.L. Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have developed a robust model membrane system of negatively charged and fluid supported lipid bilayers with excess membrane reservoir on silica beads, potentially suitable for reconstitution of vesicular transport. A major advantage of this system is that it can be used interchangeably in real-time microscopy and quantitative biochemical assays, allowing us to analyze dynamin behavior on a membrane template under the constant presence of GTP. We first generated conventional supported bilayers using previously described methodologies (Galneder et al., 2001Galneder R. Kahl V. Arbuzova A. Rebecchi M. Rädler J.O. McLaughlin S.

Detection of molecular interactions at membrane surfaces through colloid phase transitions.Nature. 2004; 427: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Silica beads suspended in water were incubated with increasing concentrations of liposomes whose composition approximately reflects that of the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in terms of net charge (Lemmon, 2008Lemmon M.A. Membrane recognition by phospholipid-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The adsorbed liposomes rupture and fuse to form uniform bilayers around the beads, and unbound liposomes are removed by subsequent washes. Liposome binding isotherms indicate that, at saturation (Figure 1A), beads displayed fluorescence intensity equivalent to 2.5 ± 0.1 × 108 lipid molecules/bead, in agreement with the expected number of 2.4 × 108 assuming a single bilayer deposited around a 5 μm sphere and a lipid cross-sectional area of 65 Å2. Conventional supported bilayers are stable and lack excess reservoir. However, we found that when supported bilayers were prepared in high salt and subsequently washed with water to remove unbound liposomes and excess salt, each bead now displayed fluorescence intensity equivalent to 7.0 ± 0.3 × 108 lipid molecules/bead, which reflects an ∼3-fold increase in membrane reservoir. To distinguish these from conventional supported bilayers, we refer to them as supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir, or SUPER, templates. We monitored the susceptibility of a membrane-incorporated fluorescent lipid probe NBD-PE to dithionite-mediated fluorescence quenching (McIntyre and Sleight, 1991McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Fluorescence assay for phospholipid membrane asymmetry.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) to determine whether the excess membrane reservoir was indeed a bilayer. Addition of 5 mM dithionite caused quenching of NBD-PE fluorescence to ∼50%, with kinetics similar to that seen with extruded liposomes, indicating that SUPER templates are unilamellar (Figure 1B). When added to a drop of buffer on a glass coverslip, the excess membrane reservoir spilled out from the template and was visualized as a patch of membrane now adsorbed to the coverslip (Figure 1C, white arrows, and Movie S1 available online). Conventional supported bilayers did not show such a membrane spill (Figure 1D). Further, FRAP experiments established that the fluorescent lipid probe BODIPY FL C12-HPC in supported bilayers prepared under high-salt conditions on glass coverslips exhibited an apparent diffusion coefficient of 2.2 ± 0.7 μm2 s−1 and a mobile fraction of ∼100% (see Figure S1), confirming the fluidity of lipids in SUPER templates. SUPER templates were further characterized by membrane tether-pulling experiments. Membrane tethers could be easily pulled to several tens of microns in length without undergoing rupture (Figure 1E, Movie S2). The fluorescence intensity along the tether remained uniform during tether extension, further indicating that the membrane around these templates is unilamellar. Tethers pulled from SUPER templates did not appear taut; instead, they swayed gently (see Movie S2). On the basis of the premise that during extension, a build-up of tension over that already existing in the membrane would cause thinning (and hence a drop in fluorescence) of tethers, we analyzed the integrated fluorescence at a fixed region of interest (ROI) as it was extended. No significant decline in fluorescence was apparent even when tethers were extended up to 30 μm (Figure 1F). Interestingly, tether fluorescence showed an increase upon retraction (Figure 1F) and became thicker and more flaccid as it got closer to the bead (see Movie S2). This is possibly due to the speed of retraction not allowing the tether to be taken back completely into the template. As expected, we were unable to pull tethers from SUPER templates that had spilled their excess membrane reservoir on a glass surface (as in Figure 1C). SUPER templates therefore represent a robust and versatile supported bilayer system that possesses a large fluid reservoir of unilamellar membranes readily accessible to external manipulations. We first monitored the effect of dynamin on Rhodamine-PE- (RhPE)-containing SUPER templates in real-time using fluorescence microscopy. Templates were added to 100 μl buffer placed on a coverslip and allowed to settle. The coverslip was precoated with PEG-silane to prevent binding and spillover of the excess membrane reservoir. Dynamin was added from a stock solution at the side and allowed to diffuse slowly into the buffer to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 μM. Addition of dynamin led to the growth of numerous membrane tubules from the templates (Figure 2A, yellow arrows, and Movie S3), with the bead taking on a “hairy” appearance. Tubules grew to several microns in length and displayed heterogeneity in fluorescence. Initially faint tubules (Figure 2A, yellow arrows) growing from adjacent beads encountered each other, became intertwined and tethered between the templates to form thicker, brighter structures (Figure 2A, white arrow). Dynamin-dependent tubulation in this system, as in others (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T.

Schmid S.L.

Fluorescent BODIPY-labeled dynamin (BODIPY-dynamin) (Ramachandran et al., 2007Ramachandran R. Surka M. Chappie J.S. Fowler D.M. Foss T.R. Song B.D. Schmid S.L. The dynamin middle domain is critical for tetramerization and higher-order self-assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although enriched on these tubules, is also found on the relatively planar bead surface (Figures 2B and 2C). Negative-stain EM of SUPER templates incubated with dynamin showed that the bundles of membrane tubules seen with fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2A) are in fact coiled membrane tubules (Figures 2D and 2E). This is reminiscent of the microtubule bundling property originally reported for dynamin (Shpetner and Vallee, 1989Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Identification of dynamin, a novel mechanochemical enzyme that mediates interactions between microtubules.Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and suggests that lateral interactions can occur between assembled dynamin scaffolds. Individual membrane tubules showed a scaffold with an outer diameter of 45.5 ± 5.0 nm (mean ± SD, n = 19) and a characteristic striated appearance (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results indicate that SUPER templates respond to dynamin in a manner similar to conventional membrane templates like liposomes. Dynamin has been ascribed a GTP-dependent mechanochemical role in membrane fission (Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Dynamin undergoes a GTP-dependent conformational change causing vesiculation.Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H.

GTP-dependent twisting of dynamin implicates constriction and tension in membrane fission.Nature. 2006; 441: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, in each of these studies dynamin was preassembled on a membrane template before the addition of GTP. Indeed, the behavior of dynamin on a membrane template has not been observed in the presence of GTP, a more physiologically relevant condition. We therefore added dynamin to SUPER templates bathed in buffer containing 1 mM GTP. Under these conditions, we did not detect tubule formation. Instead, addition of dynamin led to the continuous release of numerous vesicles diffusing randomly in solution (Figure 3A, yellow arrows, and Movie S4). Similar experiments performed in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPPCP, or GDP led to the growth of shorter membrane tubules without release of vesicles (data not shown). Vesicle release in the presence of GTP is apparent from the cumulative increase in fluorescence intensity of the bathing solution (Figure 3B and Movie S4), which was not observed with dynamin alone or in the presence of GMPPCP or GDP (Figure 3B). Negative stain EM of the bathing solution in the presence of dynamin and GTP confirmed the presence of lipid vesicles (Figure 3C, black arrows), with an estimated size of 74 ± 33 nm (mean ± SD, n = 221) (Figure 3D). No vesicles were observed in the absence of GTP (Figure 3C, inset). The dark, negatively stained structures detected under both conditions probably correspond to small dynamin aggregates. These data show that dynamin alone is sufficient to catalyze membrane fission and vesiculation from a fluid membrane reservoir. We monitored the behavior of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled dynamin (Ax488 dyn) added to SUPER templates in the presence of GTP. Diffusion of Ax488 dyn into the field coincides with the appearance of fluorescent puncta most easily detected at the periphery of the bead (Figure 4A, yellow arrows, and Movie S5). Such a distribution of dynamin coincided with punctate, though less pronounced, RhPE fluorescence (Figure 4B, yellow arrows), which could represent short membrane tubules/buds formed as dynamin self-assembles on the membrane. Dynamin assemblies displayed fluctuations in fluorescence intensity that could reflect multiple rounds of assembly and disassembly (see Movie S5). These structures could represent intermediates in the fission process, which eventually produces vesicles from SUPER templates as seen in Figure 3A. With time, freely diffusing punctate dynamin fluorescence appeared in the bathing solution (Figure 4A, red arrows, and Movie S5) and colocalized with RhPE (Figure 4C, yellow arrows). These results suggest that small tubules/buds, formed because of dynamin self-assembly on the template, undergo fission and are released as vesicles. If so, in the presence of GTP, continuous cycling of such events should maintain a steady-state distribution of dynamin on the template and at the same time result in progressive depletion of the membrane reservoir. Quantitative analysis of Ax488 dyn and RhPE fluorescence on individual beads (n = 8) (Figure 4D) under these conditions indeed showed a continuous decline in the membrane reservoir while dynamin remained at steady state. SUPER templates dispersed in solution can be pelleted by a low speed spin, allowing us to unambiguously monitor membrane fission and vesicle release using a simple sedimentation assay (Figure 5A). After incubation of RhPE-labeled supported bilayers with buffer for 30 min at 25°C and sedimentation, a small level of fluorescence (∼4% of total) could be detected in the supernatant. This background corresponds to unbound liposomes still present after preparation of templates, as a similar level was detected after resedimentation of the stock solution of templates. There was no increased release of RhPE over background when templates were incubated in buffer containing dynamin alone, or in the presence of GDP or GMPPCP. Importantly, incubation of templates with buffer containing dynamin and GTP caused a significant (∼5 fold) increase in RhPE release (∼20% of total). The nucleotide dependence for fission seen with the microscopy-based assay (Figure 3) corresponded to that seen in the sedimentation assay (Figure 5A), establishing its validity. This quantitative assay was therefore used to explore the requirements for dynamin-catalyzed membrane fission. The extent of membrane fission displayed a linear dependence on dynamin concentration above 0.1 μM (Figure 5B). Given that dynamin shows a high degree of cooperativity in binding and self-assembly in the absence of GTP (Stowell et al., 1999Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in dynamin: evidence for a mechanochemical molecular spring.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), this linearity suggests that the presence of GTP regulates dynamin assembly to a critical number of molecules capable of mediating fission (seen in Figure 4A). These assemblies would remain constant in size but increase in abundance with an increase in protein concentration. The lack of significant fission at 0.1 μM could reflect its low membrane binding affinity and consequently reduced self-assembly on the membrane. The extent of membrane fission was also linearly dependent on the template concentration (Figure 5C). Membrane fission showed a linear increase with time (Figure 5D), although we observed burst phase kinetics at early time points (initial 10 min) (Figure 5D). At steady state, the rate of fission in the presence of 0.25 μM dynamin was 0.08 ± 0.01% total min−1 (mean ± SD, n = 3), which approximately doubled to 0.19 ± 0.02% total min−1 (mean ± SD, n = 3) in the presence of 0.5 μM dynamin. GTP hydrolysis occurred at a constant rate of 3.0 ± .09 min−1 (mean ± SD) in the presence of SUPER templates, which was ∼40 fold higher than dynamin's basal GTPase activity of 0.08 ± 0.01 min−1 (mean ± SD) (Figure 5E). Furthermore, the extent of membrane fission was linearly dependent on the PI-4,5-P2 density in the membrane (Figure 5F). The GTP-binding and self-assembling activities of dynamin were an absolute requirement for membrane fission. The S45N mutant, which is defective in GTP binding and inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in vivo (Damke et al., 2001Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Dynamin GTPase domain mutants block endocytic vesicle formation at morphologically distinct stages.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Marks et al., 2001Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. GTPase activity of dynamin and resulting conformation change are essential for endocytosis.Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), was unable to catalyze membrane fission (Figure 5G). However, it could effectively inhibit the fission activity of wild-type dynamin (Figure 5H). Since S45N can bind and tubulate SUPER templates even in the presence of GTP (see Movie S6), the inhibition by S45N could be due to coassembly with wild-type dynamin to interfere with the latter's fission activity (Figure 5D). The R399A mutant displays a severe defect in quaternary structure in solution and on membranes (Ramachandran et al., 2007Ramachandran R. Surka M. Chappie J.S. Fowler D.M. Foss T.R. Song B.D. Schmid S.L. The dynamin middle domain is critical for tetramerization and higher-order self-assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As expected, no detectable membrane tubulation was observed with R399A (Movie S7), nor was R399A capable of mediating membrane fission (Figure 5G). Consistent with its reduced ability to bind and self-assemble on membranes, R399A was also unable to inhibit fission catalyzed by wild-type dynamin (Figure 5H). Together, our biochemical assays establish that dynamin alone can catalyze membrane fission and vesicle formation from SUPER templates in a manner dependent on GTP binding, hydrolysis, and regulated self-assembly. Previous studies of dynamin-dependent membrane remodeling events have involved the preassembly of dynamin spirals in the absence of nucleotides. We therefore also examined the effects of nucleotides on dynamin preassembled on SUPER templates. As previously shown (Figure 2), addition of Ax488 dyn to SUPER templates led to the formation of dynamin-coated membrane tubules interconnecting the beads and forming an apparent network (Figure 6A, white arrows). Addition of GTP at this stage led to a rapid decrease in dynamin fluorescence on the templates (Figure 6A and Movie S8), with no significant change in RhPE fluorescence. Quantitative analysis of Ax488 dyn and RhPE fluorescence on individual beads (n = 8) showed that GTP addition causes a rapid (t1/2 ∼1 s) decline in dynamin fluorescence without a concomitant decrease in RhPE (Figure 6B), a kinetic trace quite different from that seen in the constant presence of GTP (Figure 4D). Nonetheless, GTP addition caused rapid contraction of the membrane tubules, drawing the templates closer together (see Movie S8). We analyzed the reason for this effect by examining bundled membrane tubules in greater detail (Figure 6C, white arrow). We find that GTP addition results in local increases in membrane density along the tubule (Figure 6C, yellow arrows, and Movie S9). The appearance of these varicosities is consistent with GTP-dependent dissociation of the dynamin scaffold detected spectroscopically with fluorescently-labeled dynamin (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2008Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and localized puckering of the lipid tubule detected by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Danino et al., 2004Danino D. Moon K.H. Hinshaw J.E. Rapid constriction of lipid bilayers by the mechanochemical enzyme dynamin.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This was followed by a rapid contraction of the tubule, drawing the templates closer together (see Movie S9), and accumulation of membranes at the ends of the tubule (Figure 6C, red arrows). Tubules eventually underwent retraction and breakage. Then, after a delay of several seconds, vesicle formation from templates resumed, although with much reduced efficiency (see Movie S9). These data suggest that after prolonged incubation in the absence of GTP, preassembled dynamin is kinetically trapped in an inactive state. Monitoring of fluorescently labeled dynamin under these conditions indeed shows that the retraction of the membrane tubule (Figure 6C) is due to partial disassembly and collapse of the dynamin scaffold (Figure 6D, yellow arrows, and Movie S10). After retraction, dynamin accumulates as large aggregates at the base of the membrane tubule (Figure 6D, red arrows), perhaps reflecting a kinetically trapped state. We also note that the addition of GMPPCP instead of GTP to bundled tubules (Figure S2, white arrow) caused the release of fainter tubules (Figure S2, yellow arrows) through a series of rotations, suggesting"
https://openalex.org/W2065359670,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is accompanied by dendritic spine growth and changes in the composition of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We find that activity-dependent growth of apical spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons is accompanied by destabilization of the PSD that results in transient loss and rapid replacement of PSD-95 and SHANK2. Signaling through PSD-95 is required for activity-dependent spine growth and trafficking of SHANK2. N-terminal PDZ and C-terminal guanylate kinase domains of PSD-95 are required for both processes, indicating that PSD-95 coordinates multiple signals to regulate morphological plasticity. Activity-dependent trafficking of PSD-95 is triggered by phosphorylation at serine 73, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) consensus phosphorylation site, which negatively regulates spine growth and potentiation of synaptic currents. We propose that PSD-95 and CaMKII act at multiple steps during plasticity induction to initially trigger and later terminate spine growth by trafficking growth-promoting PSD proteins out of the active spine.

Signaling through PSD-95 is required for activity-dependent spine growth and trafficking of SHANK2. N-terminal PDZ and C-terminal guanylate kinase domains of PSD-95 are required for both processes, indicating that PSD-95 coordinates multiple signals to regulate morphological plasticity. Activity-dependent trafficking of PSD-95 is triggered by phosphorylation at serine 73, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) consensus phosphorylation site, which negatively regulates spine growth and potentiation of synaptic currents. We propose that PSD-95 and CaMKII act at multiple steps during plasticity induction to initially trigger and later terminate spine growth by trafficking growth-promoting PSD proteins out of the active spine. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, each spine contains the postsynaptic density (PSD) associated with a single excitatory synapse, and developmental changes in the number and properties of these synapses are typically associated with concomitant changes in spine number and morphology. On a population level, large spines house large PSDs that contain higher numbers of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and support larger AMPAR-mediated currents (Harris and Stevens, 1989Harris K.M.

In addition, large spines are typically associated with high-release-probability presynaptic terminals that contain more active zone area (Harris and Stevens, 1989Harris K.M. Stevens J.K.

At the level of individual synapses, rapid changes in the number of synaptic AMPARs, such as following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD), are accompanied by increases or decreases, respectively, in the size of the associated spine (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

Moreover, for individual spines, the magnitude of spine head enlargement following LTP induction is directly correlated with the degree of potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

How such correlations between structure and function are maintained and what molecular mechanisms underlie LTP-associated spine growth are largely unknown. PSD-95/SAP90, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, is highly abundant in the PSD and has been proposed to regulate many aspects of synaptic transmission (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004Ehrlich I.

From biochemical and electrophysiological studies, it is clear that PSD-95-dependent protein complexes interact with both AMPARs and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and that PSD-95 regulates NMDAR-dependent changes in AMPARs number such as those that underlie LTP and LTD. However, since the number of PSD-95 molecules in the PSD is ∼10-fold larger than the number of synaptic glutamate receptors (Chen et al., 2005Chen X. Vinade L. Leapman R.D. Petersen J.D. Nakagawa T. Phillips T.M. Sheng M. Reese T.S. Mass of the postsynaptic density and enumeration of three key molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The number of glutamate receptors opened by synaptic stimulation in single hippocampal spines.J.

Through its modular structure, PSD-95 is found in complexes with many proteins that affect spine structure, such as karilin-7, SPAR, SynGAP, SPIN90/WISH, and SHANK (Kim et al., 1997Kim E. Naisbitt S.

PSD-95 is thus well positioned to link and coordinate multiple pathways regulating synapse structure and function, such as those that control activity-dependent spine growth and protein trafficking. Here, we deliver LTP-inducing stimuli to individual apical dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons while monitoring spine morphology and trafficking of PSD proteins. We find that PSD-95 is necessary for the transient and sustained phases of activity-dependent spine growth. Furthermore, PSD-95 is rapidly trafficked out of dendritic spines in response to activity, in a manner that depends on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and regulation of PSD-95 serine 73 (S73), a CAMKII phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation at this site inhibits both LTP and LTP-associated spine growth, indicating that CAMKII and PSD-95 likely act first to trigger and subsequently to terminate the growth process. In addition, PSD-95, in a guanylate kinase (GK) domain and S73-dependent manner, controls the activity-dependent trafficking of SHANK2, a growth-promoting molecule that links to the cytoskeleton. We propose that CaMKII and PSD-95 dynamically control the trafficking of PSD proteins to positively and negatively regulate the assembly of protein complexes necessary to promote and sustain structural and functional plasticity. To visualize neuronal morphology, we expressed the red fluorescent protein dsRed in hippocampal neurons in rat organotypic slice cultures. Transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons were selected for analysis, and two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was used to identify spines from primary and secondary branches of apical dendrites (Figure 1). Morphological changes of individual spines were triggered by glutamate uncaging in Mg-free solution using a protocol that has been previously described to induce LTP and spine growth (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

Protein synthesis and neurotrophin-dependent structural plasticity of single dendritic spines.Science. 2008; 319: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Each spine was stimulated 40 times by two-photon laser uncaging (2PLU) of 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-glutamate (MNI-glutamate) at 0.667 Hz using 500 μs pulses of 720 nm light. This stimulation protocol, referred to below as the “plasticity-inducing stimulus” (PS), induces an increase in the size of the stimulated spine head (Figure 1A). Spine growth can be separated into an initial, rapid phase visible at the end of the 1 min PS and a smaller, persistent phase visible 20 min after stimulation and maintained for up to 3 hr (Figure S2 available online). Changes in spine size were quantified by measuring the apparent area (Figure 1B) and volume of the spine head as a function of time (Figure S1). For statistical analysis, we calculated the percentage enlargement immediately after (Δarearapid and Δvolrapid) and averaged 20–30 min after (Δareapersistent and Δvolpersistent) the PS. In control cells, we observed statistically significant ∼60% rapid (Δarearapid = 63% ± 11%; Δvolrapid = 62% ± 11%) and ∼30% persistent (Δareapersistent = 28% ± 4%; Δvolpersistent = 29% ± 5%) increases in spine size, similar to what has been described previously (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

Nearby unstimulated spines do not, on average, experience significant morphological changes (Δarearapid = 1% ± 4%, Δareapersistent = 2% ± 4%; Δvolrapid = −3% ± 3%, Δvolpersistent = −1% ± 2%; p < 0.05 for each versus stimulated spines), and spine growth in the stimulated spine is blocked by the NMDAR antagonist CPP (Δarearapid = 4% ± 6%; Δareapersistent = −2% ± 4%; Δvolrapid = 1% ± 3%; Δvolpersistent = 0% ± 3%; p < 0.05 for each versus control conditions) (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1) (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

For brevity, only changes in spine head area are reported in the text. To confirm that PS induced LTP at the stimulated spine, we measured uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (uEPSCs) in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in Mg-free extracellular solution. Cells were loaded with the red fluorophore Alexa Fluor 594 through the pipette. Analysis of selected spines began within ∼2 min, and PS was delivered within 5–10 min of rupture of the patch (Figure 1C). Stimulated spines displayed a persistent increase in uEPSC amplitude (−13.2 ± 2.8 and −34.8 ± 2.9 pA before and 20–30 min after PS, respectively; p < 0.05) (Figures 1C and 1D) (Harvey and Svoboda, 2007Harvey C.D.

To investigate whether PSD-95 also regulates structural plasticity, neurons in which endogenous PSD-95 was knocked down by expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against PSD-95 (shPSD-95) were examined (Schluter et al., 2006Schluter O.M.

We found that knockdown of PSD-95 impaired early and late phases of spine growth (Δarearapid = 30% ± 9%, Δareapersistent = 16% ± 3%; p < 0.05 for each versus control stimulated spines) (Figures 1E and 1F), as suggested by analysis of chemically induced LTP (Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004Ehrlich I. Malinow R. Postsynaptic density 95 controls AMPA receptor incorporation during long-term potentiation and experience-driven synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These effects were rescued by introduction of PSD-95 carrying silent mutations in the region targeted by shPSD-95, confirming that the effects were due to knockdown of PSD-95 (Figure S2). Since knockdown of PSD-95 has minimal effects on NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (Schluter et al., 2006Schluter O.M. Xu W. Malenka R.C.

Several forms of synaptic plasticity involve the insertion or removal of proteins from the PSD (Gray et al., 2006Gray N.W. Weimer R.M. Bureau I. Svoboda K.

Although PSD-95 can influence the levels of synaptic proteins such as AMPARs, whether its own trafficking is regulated by activity is unknown. To monitor the dynamics of PSD-95 during activity-dependent synaptic growth, we tagged PSD-95 with photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) (Gray et al., 2006Gray N.W. Weimer R.M. Bureau I. Svoboda K.

In neurons expressing this construct and dsRed, minimal green fluorescence was detectable before photoactivation, consistent with the properties of PAGFP in its basal state (Figure 2A).

Svoboda K. Rapid redistribution of synaptic PSD-95 in the neocortex in vivo.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Since photoactivation of PAGFP reflects a covalent modification of the fluorophore, green fluorescence after photoactivation directly reports the distribution of tagged PSD-95 proteins that had been exposed to the photoactivating pulse. Green fluorescence within the spine head was expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence increase induced by the photoactivating pulse (FPAGFP) and reported as a function of time. Under our conditions, all of the PAGFP in the spine head is activated by the photoactivating pulse, and no significant photobleaching occurs during imaging (Figure S3). The majority of the PSD-95 in the spine in the first image acquired after the photoactivating pulse remained in the head 30 min later, such that green fluorescence decreased ∼15% during this time (Gray et al., 2006Gray N.W. Weimer R.M. Bureau I. Svoboda K. Rapid redistribution of synaptic PSD-95 in the neocortex in vivo.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e370Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Exchange of PAGFP-tagged proteins between this stable structure and an extra-spine pool of PSD-95-PAGFP was tested by delivery of a second photoactivating pulse after 30 min of imaging. This pulse produced an increase in green fluorescence that returned fluorescence to the levels seen after the first activation pulse (Figures 2A and 2C), indicating incorporation of unactivated PSD-95-PAGFP into the spine during the imaging period. Thus, a population of PSD-95 molecules is incorporated into a stable structure within the spine and is replaced at a basal rate of ∼0.5%/min. To determine whether the rate of exchange of PSD-95 is regulated by activity, we examined the trafficking of PSD-95-PAGFP in spines stimulated with PS. Since PSD-95 overexpression increases spine size and occludes LTP (Ehrlich et al., 2007Ehrlich I. Klein M. Rumpel S. Malinow R. PSD-95 is required for activity-driven synapse stabilization.Proc.

https://openalex.org/W2018213389,"Controversy revolves around the differential contribution of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, which coexist in principal forebrain neurons, to synaptic plasticity and learning in the adult brain. Here, we report genetically modified mice in which the NR2B subunit is selectively ablated in principal neurons of the entire postnatal forebrain or only the hippocampus. NR2B ablation resulted in smaller NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs with accelerated decay kinetics, as recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells. CA3-to-CA1 field LTP remained largely unaltered, although a pairing protocol revealed decreased NMDA receptor-mediated charge transfer and reduced cellular LTP. Mice lacking NR2B in the forebrain were impaired on a range of memory tasks, presenting both spatial and nonspatial phenotypes. In contrast, hippocampus-specific NR2B ablation spared hippocampus-dependent, hidden-platform water maze performance but induced a selective, short-term, spatial working memory deficit for recently visited places. Thus, both hippocampal and extra-hippocampal NR2B containing NMDA receptors critically contribute to spatial performance."
https://openalex.org/W2094008098,"Background Analysis of gene expression data using genome-wide microarrays is a technique often used in genomic studies to find coexpression patterns and locate groups of co-transcribed genes. However, most studies done at global “omic” scale are not focused on human samples and when they correspond to human very often include heterogeneous datasets, mixing normal with disease-altered samples. Moreover, the technical noise present in genome-wide expression microarrays is another well reported problem that many times is not addressed with robust statistical methods, and the estimation of errors in the data is not provided. Methodology/Principal Findings Human genome-wide expression data from a controlled set of normal-healthy tissues is used to build a confident human gene coexpression network avoiding both pathological and technical noise. To achieve this we describe a new method that combines several statistical and computational strategies: robust normalization and expression signal calculation; correlation coefficients obtained by parametric and non-parametric methods; random cross-validations; and estimation of the statistical accuracy and coverage of the data. All these methods provide a series of coexpression datasets where the level of error is measured and can be tuned. To define the errors, the rates of true positives are calculated by assignment to biological pathways. The results provide a confident human gene coexpression network that includes 3327 gene-nodes and 15841 coexpression-links and a comparative analysis shows good improvement over previously published datasets. Further functional analysis of a subset core network, validated by two independent methods, shows coherent biological modules that share common transcription factors. The network reveals a map of coexpression clusters organized in well defined functional constellations. Two major regions in this network correspond to genes involved in nuclear and mitochondrial metabolism and investigations on their functional assignment indicate that more than 60% are house-keeping and essential genes. The network displays new non-described gene associations and it allows the placement in a functional context of some unknown non-assigned genes based on their interactions with known gene families. Conclusions/Significance The identification of stable and reliable human gene to gene coexpression networks is essential to unravel the interactions and functional correlations between human genes at an omic scale. This work contributes to this aim, and we are making available for the scientific community the validated human gene coexpression networks obtained, to allow further analyses on the network or on some specific gene associations.

We determined whether the brain-specific disruption of the FKBP12 gene in mice altered mTOR signaling, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Biochemically, the FKBP12-deficient mice displayed increases in basal mTOR phosphorylation, mTOR-Raptor interactions, and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that FKBP12 deficiency was associated with an enhancement in long-lasting hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). The LTP enhancement was resistant to rapamycin, but not anisomycin, suggesting that altered translation control is involved in the enhanced synaptic plasticity. Behaviorally, FKBP12 conditional knockout (cKO) mice displayed enhanced contextual fear memory and autistic/obsessive-compulsive-like perseveration in several assays including the water maze, Y-maze reversal task, and the novel object recognition test. Our results indicate that FKBP12 plays a critical role in the regulation of mTOR-Raptor interactions, LTP, memory, and perseverative behaviors.

Our results indicate that FKBP12 plays a critical role in the regulation of mTOR-Raptor interactions, LTP, memory, and perseverative behaviors. FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) originally were described as ubiquitously expressed immunophillins that mediate the pharmacological activities of naturally occurring macrolide immunosuppressants such as FK506 and rapamycin. It is now known that FKBPs have a broader range of functions. FKBPs are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPiases) involved in the conversion of cis-proline residues to a less sterically restricted trans conformation. FKBPs also are involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium release, gene transcription, protein translation, and cellular trafficking (Harrar et al., 2001Harrar Y. Bellini C. Faure J.D. FKBPs: at the crossroads of folding and transduction.Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). FKBP12, the smallest of member of the FKBP family, has a basic domain, a PPiase catalytic domain, and a drug-binding pocket, all of which are characteristic of the FKBP family. FKBP12 modulates the activity of several receptor complexes, including ryanodine receptors (RyRs), transforming growth factor-β receptor complex, and inositol-P3-receptors (Harrar et al., 2001Harrar Y. Bellini C. Faure J.D. FKBPs: at the crossroads of folding and transduction.Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but also influences protein kinase signaling. FKBP12 bound to rapamycin regulates the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP or RAFT) (Jacinto and Hall, 2003Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Tor signalling in bugs, brain and brawn.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The regulation of mTOR and its downstream effectors are highly conserved from yeast to humans (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). The most studied function of mTOR is its role in regulating protein translation, primarily cap-dependent translation initiation. mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP, an inhibitory protein that acts to sequester the translation initiation factor eIF4E (Klann and Dever, 2004Klann E. Dever T.E. Biochemical mechanisms for translational regulation in synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Another important target of mTOR is p70 S6 kinase (S6K), which has been shown to phosphorylate and activate eIF4B, thereby stimulating the DEAD box helicase eIF4A to unwind the inhibitory secondary structure in the 5′ untranslated region of eukaryotic mRNAs (Raught et al., 2004Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Phosphorylation of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 4B Ser422 is modulated by S6 kinases.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of mTOR results in the stimulation of translation initiation via the regulation of both 4E-BP and S6K. FKBP12 is the intracellular receptor for rapamycin, a commonly utilized inhibitor of mTOR signaling. Rapamycin-bound FKBP12 binds and inhibits mTOR (Brown et al., 1994Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. A mammalian protein targeted by G1-arresting rapamycin-receptor complex.Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). mTOR is also regulated by other associated proteins (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar, Loewith et al., 2002Loewith R.

Raptor enhances the interaction of mTOR with S6K, promoting cell growth. mTORC1 formation is inhibited by rapamycin, but the extent of the inhibition is dependent on the nutrient state of the cell, suggesting the existence of variable mTOR-Raptor interaction states (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). New protein synthesis is required for many long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (LTM) (Kelleher et al., 2004bKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Tonegawa S. Translational regulatory mechanisms in persistent forms of synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2004; 44: 59-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Klann and Dever, 2004Klann E. Dever T.E. Biochemical mechanisms for translational regulation in synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Given the central role of mTOR in translation control, ascertaining its regulation in neurons is vital to elucidating the regulation of protein synthesis during synaptic plasticity and memory. We examined the effects of the genetic deletion of the FKBP12 protein on mTOR signaling, synaptic plasticity, and memory. In biochemical experiments we found that deletion of FKBP12 was associated with enhanced mTOR phosphorylation, an increase in the interaction between mTOR and Raptor, and enhanced phosphorylation of the mTOR target S6K. In electrophysiological studies we found that the deletion of FKBP12 resulted in enhanced late-phase LTP (L-LTP) that was resistant to rapamycin but blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Behavioral experiments revealed that the FKBP12 mutant mice exhibit enhanced contextual fear, repetitive behavior, and perseveration in several assays of memory, phenotypes that have been observed in several cognitive disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and Huntington's disease. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that FKBP12 normally acts to constrain mTOR signaling during long-term synaptic plasticity, memory, and perseverative behaviors. A general deficiency in FKBP12 produces an embryonic lethal phenotype due to altered cardiac development (Shou et al., 1998Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Cardiac defects and altered ryanodine receptor function in mice lacking FKBP12.Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For this reason, we employed a strategy of selective FKBP12 ablation using a floxed allele of FKBP12 (Fkbp12fl) crossed with a brain-specific Cre recombinase mouse line (T-29). The maximal onset of Cre recombinase expression in this mouse line is delayed until approximately 3 weeks after birth, allowing normal development in the presence of FKBP12. Furthermore, Cre expression is primarily restricted to area CA1 of the hippocampus and the forebrain (Tsien et al., 1996Tsien J.Z. Chen D.F. Gerber D. Tom C. Mercer E.H. Anderson D.J. Mayford M. Kandel E.R. Tonegawa S. Subregion- and cell type-restricted gene knockout in mouse brain.Cell. 1996; 87: 1317-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The presence of the Fkbp12fl allele or Cre transgene was determined using PCR-specific primers (Figure 1A). The absence of FKBP12 in hippocampal area CA1 was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining (Figures 1B and 1C). To examine the possibility that a closely related FKBP12 homolog, FKBP12.6, was upregulated by deletion of FKBP12, we utilized antibodies that detect both proteins (Figure 1B). Upregulation of FKBP12.6 did not occur in response to the genetic disruption of FKBP12. Given the recent finding that FKBP38 can function as a direct inhibitor of mTOR (Bai et al., 2007Bai X. Ma D. Liu A. Shen X. Wang Q.J. Liu Y. Jiang Y. Rheb activates mTOR by antagonizing its endogenous inhibitor, FKBP38.Science. 2007; 318: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we also examined FKBP38 levels in the brain and found that FKBP38 is expressed at low levels in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure S1D available online). Interestingly, in a survey of several tissues we found that FKBP12 levels were highest in the mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and were expressed in a pattern inversely correlated with that of FKBP38 (Figures 1E and S1D). In wild-type mice, FKBP12 protein expression was detected in the somatic layers in area CA1 of the hippocampus (Figure 1B) and in area CA3 (data not shown). In FKBP12 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, the staining for FKBP12 was nearly absent. Higher-resolution examination showed dense staining of FKBP12 in the soma, with less dense but punctate staining in the dendritic layer of stratum radiatum (Figures 1CA and 1CB). This staining was largely absent in FKBP12 mutant mice (Figures 1CC and 1CD). Fractionation experiments with hippocampal homogenates revealed that FKBP12 is normally present in the synaptoneurosome fraction and the cellular supernatant (Figure 1D). To determine whether the transgenic Cre line we used for this study was expressed in other parts of the brain, we examined FKBP12 levels in other brain regions and tissues. We found nearly normal levels of FKBP12 in the cerebellum but reduced levels of FKBP12 in the midbrain (Figure 1E). Strikingly, FKBP12 levels were reduced to ∼20% of wild-type levels in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, with expression reduced to levels similar to those displayed in hippocampal area CA1 of the cKO mice (Figure 1E). Finally, to confirm that the gene was not disrupted in other tissues, we examined FKBP12 levels in muscles and organs of the periphery and observed that FKBP12 expression was similar in mutant and wild-type mice (Figures 1E and 1F). We also examined basal FKBP12 expression in mice that were homozygous for the floxed FKPB12 allele but did not express Cre recombinase. We found that FKBP12 was expressed at similar levels to those in mice homozygous for the wild-type FKBP12 allele (Figure S1A). In addition, FKBP12 protein was removed from area CA1 as early as P14 (Figure S1B). However, the removal of FKBP12 did not occur early enough in development or to a degree sufficient to result in lethality, as expected numbers of cKO pups were generated (data not shown). In summary, forebrain-specific disruption of FKBP12 was achieved via bypassing the critical developmental period for which FKBP12 is required. FKBP12 serves as an intracellular receptor for rapamycin and mediates the activity of this immunosuppressant. Rapaymycin binds FKBP12 and occupies a conserved binding domain within mTOR, blocking its normal signaling (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Given the unlikely scenario that FKBP12 evolved to bind macrolide toxins, we hypothesized that the loss of FKBP12 might result in enhanced mTOR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the phosphorylation of mTOR at residues correlated with its activation in the FKBP12-deficient mice. In FKBP12 cKO mice, we observed an increase in the level of mTOR phosphorylation at serine-2448 in hippocampal area CA1 homogenates. These findings suggest that FKBP12 suppresses mTOR signaling even in the absence of rapamycin. We also examined the phosphorylation of several downstream targets of mTOR. Although we detected a trend toward increased levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP in the FKBP12 cKO mice, the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 2B). Another target of mTOR is S6K. It is phosphorylated at serine-389 by mTOR and threonine-421 by extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) (Zhang et al., 2001Zhang Y. Dong Z. Nomura M. Zhong S. Chen N. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Signal transduction pathways involved in phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K following exposure to UVA irradiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20913-20923Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We observed increased phosphorylation of S6K at threonine-389, but no difference in phosphorylation at threonine-421/424 (Figure 2B). These results indicate that although mTOR signaling may be enhanced homeostatically in the FKBP12 cKO mice, its downstream targets are differentially regulated. The complex formed by FKBP12-rapamycin occupies the same binding site within mTOR that is required for interaction with Raptor, a protein that facilitates mTOR signaling. Because the FKBP12-rapamycin complex displaces Raptor, we hypothesized that a deficiency in FKBP12 would enhance the interaction between mTOR and Raptor (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we isolated tissue from area CA1 and immunoprecipitated mTOR protein complexes using an mTOR antibody. We found increased levels of mTORC1 in FKBP12 cKO mice when compared with wild-type mice (Figure 2C). These differences were not due to alterations in total levels of either Raptor or mTOR. Similar results were obtained when we used a Raptor antibody for the immunoprecipitation (IP) (Figure 2C). Furthermore, when Raptor was examined in extracts obtained from the unbound IP supernatant, reduced Raptor levels were present in fractions from the cKO mice (Figure S1C). These increases were quantified and correlated with the levels of increased p-mTOR in the FKBP12 cKO mice. Moreover, because Raptor promotes mTOR binding to S6K, one would predict that the IPs prepared from FKBP12 cKO mice would yield increased S6K. Indeed, we observed an increase in S6K levels in the IPs from the FKBP12 mutant mice (Figure S1C). Together, these data support the idea that FKBP12 is normally involved in the suppression of mTOR activity and signaling. We next examined synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices from the FKBP12 mutant mice. Because the absence of FKBP12 can increase calcium leak from the RyR, an intracellular calcium release channel, it was possible that the loss of FKBP12 would affect basal synaptic function (Berridge, 1998Berridge M.J. Neuronal calcium signaling.Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). We found that basal synaptic transmission, measured as synaptic output in response to a stimulatory input, was normal in FKBP12 cKO mice (Figure 3A). We next examined whether FKBP12 was required for paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), a form of presynaptic plasticity evoked by two temporally linked stimuli (Katz and Miledi, 1968Katz B. Miledi R. The role of calcium in neuromuscular facilitation.J. Physiol. 1968; 195: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). PPF was normal in FKBP12 cKO mice when compared to that in wild-type mice at several time intervals (Figure 4B). The same measurements of synaptic function also were examined in FKBP12 heterozygote (αCaMKII-Cre+/Fkbp12fl/+) mice and were indistinguishable from those of both wild-type and FKBP12 homozygote cKO mice (data not shown).Figure 4FKBP12 cKO Mice Express Enhanced L-LTP and L-LTP Induction Stimulates mTOR-Raptor InteractionsShow full caption(A) Representative traces of fEPSPs in slices from wild-type (WT) and FKBP12 cKO (KO) mice that received four trains of HFS.(B) Four trains of HFS elicited L-LTP in FKBP12 KO mice that was enhanced compared with that evoked in WT mice.

We next examined early-phase LTP (E-LTP) in hippocampal slices prepared from the FKBP12 cKO mice. E-LTP was elicited by two different patterns of stimulation: one train of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) or a single pattern of theta-burst stimulation (TBS). A single train of either HFS (Figure 3C) or TBS (Figure 3D) elicited E-LTP in slices from the FKBP12 cKO mice that was indistinguishable from that of wild-type littermates. These results suggest that the loss of FKBP12 has no apparent effect on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of transient (protein-synthesis-independent) forms of hippocampal LTP. To determine whether the removal of FKBP12 altered L-LTP, we stimulated hippocampal slices with four spaced trains of HFS. Following this induction protocol, L-LTP in the FKBP12-deficient mice was significantly enhanced when compared with that of their wild-type littermates (representative traces are shown in Figure 4A). Cumulative data from several experiments indicated that L-LTP in FKBP12 cKO mice was increased for the duration of the 3 hr experiment compared with L-LTP in control mice (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained when L-LTP was elicited by multiple patterns of TBS (Figures 4C and 4D). These results indicate that the loss of FKBP12 enhances long-lasting forms of LTP in area CA1 that normally require protein synthesis. We also examined whether the relative levels of mTORC1 were dynamically regulated. To accomplish this, we elicited L-LTP in hippocampal slices using four trains of HFS, and immunoprecipitated mTOR protein complexes. Analysis of IP complexes isolated 10 min after the final train of HFS revealed a robust increase in the overall level of mTOR-Raptor binding (Figure 4E). The observed increase in mTORC1 formation was also specific to the L-LTP stimulation because the observed increase in mTOR-Raptor association was only observed in area CA1, and not in other regions of the hippocampus that were not stimulated (Figure 4F). Interestingly, we found no further increase in mTORC1 formation in FKBP12 mutant mice 10 min after HFS, suggesting that mTORC1 levels were near saturation (Figures 2C and 4E). However, when we examined mTORC1 levels 60 min post-HFS stimulation in wild-type slices, we found mTORC1 levels had returned to prestimulation levels, whereas mTORC1 levels in FKBP12 mutant slices remained elevated. Although not significantly different from unstimulated (no HFS) slices, the overall levels of mTORC1 in FKBP12 cKO slices at 60 min post-HFS were significantly higher than those 10 min post-HFS (Figure 4G), suggesting that newly formed mTORC1 in FKBP12-deficient mice is resistant to the molecular processes downregulating this interaction in wild-type mice. These data indicate that the interaction between Raptor and mTOR is dynamically regulated and that the modulation of this interaction is circuit specific. Rapamycin inhibits L-LTP without affecting the early phase of synaptic enhancement (Tang et al., 2002Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. A rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway contributes to long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that mTOR-dependent regulation of translation initiation is required for more durable, long-lasting forms of LTP. Because FKBP12 is the intracellular receptor that binds rapamycin, one would predict that L-LTP in the FKBP12-deficient slices would be resistant to rapamycin. Consistent with this prediction, rapamycin blocked L-LTP evoked by multiple trains of HFS in wild-type slices, but did not significantly affect L-LTP in slices from the FKBP12 cKO mice (Figures 6A and 6B). This result supports a role for FKBP12 as a mediator for rapamycin-dependent blockade of L-LTP and provides evidence that homologs of FKBP12, like FKBP12.6, do not play redundant molecular roles for FKBP12 during L-LTP. Under normal conditions, L-LTP is critically dependent on the de novo synthesis of mRNAs and proteins (Frey and Morris, 1997Frey U. Morris R.G. Synaptic tagging and long-term potentiation.Nature. 1997; 385: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Overlaying these processes are complex signal transduction cascades that regulate the synthesis of these new gene products. Because the loss of FKBP12 has the potential to not only influence protein synthesis by modulating mTOR signaling, but also affect calcium signaling via RyRs or phosphatase signaling via calcineurin, we next determined whether the enhanced L-LTP in FKBP12-deficient mice required protein synthesis. Incubation of slices with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin significantly attenuated L-LTP in both FKBP12 cKO and wild-type mice (Figures 5C and 5D). This was especially evident at later time points (t > 160 min), when L-LTP in slices from the FKBP12 mutant mice was indistinguishable from that in slices from wild-type mice (Figure 5D). There was a trend for enhanced potentiation during intermediate time points (t > 60 min and t < 160 min), indicating the possibility that the removal of FKBP12, in addition to altering mTOR signaling, might influence other molecules that contribute to the enhanced L-LTP observed in these mice. Although anisomycin treatment prevented the L-LTP enhancement in FKBP12 cKO slices following four trains of HFS, a significant enhancement was still observed in the early phase of potentiation following the induction of TBS-LTP (Figure 4D). This phase of LTP is resistant to inhibitors of protein synthesis; thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that in addition to enhancing protein-synthesis-dependent LTP, FKBP12 removal alters the kinetics of calcium signaling, possibly through altered RyR/IP3 receptor activity, in the early phase of potentiation following some patterns of stimulation. To determine whether the lack of FKBP12 alters associative learning and memory, we tested the FKBP12 cKO mice with a conditioned fear paradigm. In this paradigm, mice learn to fear an environmental context or an emotionally neutral conditioned stimulus (CS, white noise) resulting from its temporal association with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, foot shock). When exposed to the same environmental context (contextual conditioning) or CS (cued conditioning) at a later time, conditioned mice demonstrate a stereotypical fear response, termed freezing (Fanselow, 1984Fanselow M.S.

Differential contribution of amygdala and hippocampus to cued and contextual fear conditioning.Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). For contextual and cued conditioning, FKBP12 cKO mice and their wild-type littermates were trained with two CS-US pairings. Both groups of mice displayed similar levels of freezing prior to training (data not shown) and exhibited comparable short-term memory (STM) performance following both contextual training (1 hr after training) and cued training (2 hr after training) (Figure 6A). When combined, these results suggest that FKBP12-deficient mice can learn and remember to associate neutral stimuli with an aversive event when tested following a short delay interval. Importantly, these data also demonstrate that the FKBP12-deficient mice display similar levels of stereotypic freezing behavior relative to wild-type mice. When LTM was examined 24 hr after training, the FKBP12 cKO mice demonstrated a significant increase in freezing to the contex"

The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in the response and adaptation to environmental constraints. However, apart from the well established role of ABA in regulating gene expression programmes, little is known about its function in plant stress metabolism.Using an integrative multiparallel approach of metabolome and transcriptome analyses, we studied the dynamic response of the model glyophyte Arabidopsis thaliana to ABA and high salt conditions. Our work shows that salt stress induces complex re-adjustment of carbohydrate metabolism and that ABA triggers the initial steps of carbon mobilisation.These findings open new perspectives on how high salinity and ABA impact on central carbohydrate metabolism and highlight the power of iterative combinatorial approaches of non-targeted and hypothesis-driven experiments in stress biology."

However, the distributed nature of cortical representations implies that different neurons within a particular class may receive or generate distinct signals, raising the question of whether the individual neurons of a particular class adapt their intrinsic integrative properties according to the precise form of the input signals they receive or to the exact nature of the computation they perform (Laughlin, 1981Laughlin S.

How voltage-dependent conductances can adapt to maximize the information encoded by neuronal firing rate.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In sensory and motor systems, where there is clear topographical organization of neural representations, a corresponding organization of ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability suggests that nonsynaptic integrative properties are optimized according to the specific features of the external environment that a particular neuron represents (Barnes-Davies et al., 2004Barnes-Davies M.

Firing patterns of type II spiral ganglion neurons in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By contrast, computations underlying higher cognitive functions are usually modeled with networks of identical neurons (Hopfield, 1982Hopfield J.J.

Synaptic reverberation underlying mnemonic persistent activity.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), and little attention has been given to the possibility that in circuits that process polymodal information the rules that govern integration of synaptic inputs by each neuron may depend on the specific information that neuron represents. Neurons in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) represent an animal's spatial location using topographically organized grid-like firing fields (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). When an animal moves through its environment, the locations at which these neurons fire action potentials correspond to the apices of equilateral triangles ordered contiguously in a grid-like arrangement. Unlike neurons in sensory pathways, which encode a single sensory modality and form representations that are oriented to their sensory organ, superficial entorhinal neurons receive convergent polymodal inputs from the neocortex (Amaral and Witter, 1989Amaral D.G. Witter M.P. The three-dimensional organization of the hippocampal formation: a review of anatomical data.Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and encode representations that are oriented with respect to an animal's environment (Moser et al., 2008Moser E.I. Kropff E. Moser M.B. Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The outputs from these superficial entorhinal neurons are a primary source of information used by the hippocampus for encoding and storage of episodic-like memories (Dolorfo and Amaral, 1998Dolorfo C.L.

Recent studies demonstrate that the distance between the vertices of a neuron's grid field depends upon its location along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC. At the dorsal border of the MEC, neurons have firing fields that are separated by approximately 30 cm (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). This spacing becomes progressively larger for neurons located more ventrally, and is several meters for some neurons in the ventral MEC (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B.

The cellular mechanisms that underlie the formation of grid fields or that determine their spacing are not at all clear. Several distinct models have been proposed (Moser et al., 2008Moser E.I. Kropff E. Moser M.B. Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), and there is experimental data to support both single-cell models (Giocomo et al., 2007Giocomo L.M. Zilli E.A. Fransen E. Hasselmo M.E. Temporal frequency of subthreshold oscillations scales with entorhinal grid cell field spacing.Science. 2007; 315: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and recurrent-network models (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar S.S. Jin X. Buckmaster P.S. Huguenard J.R. Recurrent circuits in layer II of medial entorhinal cortex in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels expressed by stellate neurons have been suggested to correlate with the dorsal-ventral organization of grid fields (Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2008Giocomo L.M. Hasselmo M.E. Time constants of h current in layer ii stellate cells differ along the dorsal to ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9414-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This may support a corresponding organization of oscillatory membrane activity recorded from stellate neurons (Giocomo et al., 2007Giocomo L.M. Zilli E.A. Fransen E. Hasselmo M.E. Temporal frequency of subthreshold oscillations scales with entorhinal grid cell field spacing.Science. 2007; 315: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the rules whereby neurons in the MEC transform their synaptic inputs into patterns of output, or about whether this transformation differs according to the properties of grid fields at a particular location along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC. We have taken advantage of the anatomical organization of grid field representations within the MEC to directly address the organization of synaptic integration by stellate neurons and thereby explore the possibility that neurons that mediate higher cognitive processes integrate incoming synaptic activity according to the representations they encode. We show that integration of synaptic inputs varies as a function of a neuron's location along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC and provide evidence that this variation is accounted for by complementary gradients in a hyperpolarization-activated conductance and a leak K+ conductance. We developed a parasagittal brain slice preparation to enable recordings at well-defined locations along the full extent of the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC from adult mice (see Experimental Procedures). The major glutamatergic projection neurons within layer II of the MEC are stellate neurons (Alonso and Klink, 1993Alonso A. Klink R.

Morphological characteristics of layer II projection neurons in the rat medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 1997; 7: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which in this preparation demonstrated characteristic electrophysiological and morphological properties reported in previous studies (Figure 4, Figure 5, and S1 available online) (Alonso and Klink, 1993Alonso A. Klink R. Differential electroresponsiveness of stellate and pyramidal-like cells of medial entorhinal cortex layer II.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 128-143PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated spontaneous non-NMDA-glutamate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded from stellate neurons (Figure 1A). Consistent with our hypothesis that synaptic responses may be tuned to the spatial resolution of grid fields, we found a striking increase in the rise time (R2 = 0.19, p = 0.017) and half-width (R2 = 0.37, p = 7.8e−4) of spontaneous EPSPs with increasing distance of stellate neurons from the dorsal pole of the MEC (Figure 1B). The amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs did not appear to depend on location (R2 = −0.04, p = 0.76) (Figure 1B). The waveform of synaptic potentials can be determined by the time course of the opening of postsynaptic receptors and by nonsynaptic neuronal integrative properties (Jack et al., 1975Jack J.J.B. Noble D. Tsien R.W. Electric current flow in excitable cells. Clarendon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar, Koch, 1999Koch C. Biophysics of computation: information processing in single neurons. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). To substantially influence the duration of an EPSP, the kinetics of the synaptic current must be similar to or slower than the postsynaptic membrane time constant (Rall, 1960Rall W. Membrane potential transients and membrane time constant of motoneurons.Exp. Neurol. 1960; 2: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this case the recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and EPSPs will have similar kinetics. To investigate this possibility we recorded EPSPs and corresponding EPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation of layer I (see Experimental Procedures). Consistent with our observations of spontaneous EPSPs, we found a gradient in the half-width of evoked EPSPs (p = 0.0009) (Figures 1C and 1D). However, while the half-width of EPSPs recorded from stellate neurons ranged from 8.4 to 26.9 ms, the time course of the corresponding voltage-clamped EPSCs was several-fold faster (p < 1e−6), with half-widths that ranged from 1.5 to 5.9 ms and that did not vary significantly as a function of location (Figures 1C and 1D). While a somatic electrode does not perfectly control the voltage at distal synapses, an imperfect voltage-clamp will cause somatically recorded EPSCs to have slower kinetics than the underlying synaptic current (Hausser and Roth, 1997Hausser M. Roth A. Estimating the time course of the excitatory synaptic conductance in neocortical pyramidal cells using a novel voltage jump method.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7606-7625PubMed Google Scholar, Williams and Mitchell, 2008Williams S.R. Mitchell S.J. Direct measurement of somatic voltage clamp errors in central neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and therefore the difference between the kinetics of the somatically recorded EPSP and the underlying EPSC may be even larger than our estimates suggest. These observations also argue against the possibility that in neurons at different dorsal-ventral locations, the recorded synaptic potentials happen to arise at different dendritic locations, as in this case systematic differences in the voltage clamp would cause the waveform of EPSCs to show a similar location dependence to the EPSPs (Hausser and Roth, 1997Hausser M. Roth A. Estimating the time course of the excitatory synaptic conductance in neocortical pyramidal cells using a novel voltage jump method.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7606-7625PubMed Google Scholar, Williams and Mitchell, 2008Williams S.R. Mitchell S.J. Direct measurement of somatic voltage clamp errors in central neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in synaptic properties, such as receptor composition or time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, are unlikely to account for the dorsal-ventral gradient in the waveform of EPSPs. Does the variation in the waveform of EPSPs lead to differences in the temporal integration of synaptic inputs? By varying the interval between stimulation of two independent inputs, we determined the time window during which the earlier synaptic response could increase the peak depolarization obtained during the later synaptic response (Figure 2). The time window for integration of the two responses was narrowest in dorsal neurons (Figures 2A and 2C), increases steeply with distance from the dorsal border of the MEC, and is approximately three times wider in the most ventral cells compared with the most dorsal cells (slope = 12.9 ms mm−1, R2 = 0.9, p = 0.0002) (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E). The half-duration of EPSPs evoked by both inputs again increased with distance of the recorded cell from the dorsal border of the MEC (dorsal input: R2 = 0.73, p = 0.004; ventral input: R2 = 0.89, p = 0.0003) (Figure 2F), whereas the amplitude and rise time of the evoked EPSPs did not demonstrate a significant dependence on location (p > 0.4) (Figures 2G and 2H). Thus, the time window for detection of coincident inputs by a stellate neuron varies as a function of location along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC. While coincidence detection may be important for neural computations that rely on spike timing, other neural computations may instead rely on temporal summation of trains of input. Recordings from layer II of the MEC in freely behaving animals indicate that periods of gamma frequency (40–80 Hz) synaptic activity occur nested within theta frequency (5–10 Hz) oscillations (Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998Chrobak J.J. Buzsaki G. Gamma oscillations in the entorhinal cortex of the freely behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 388-398PubMed Google Scholar). We recorded membrane potential and membrane current responses to either 1 s trains of single stimuli at theta frequency (10 Hz) or brief trains of gamma frequency stimuli (either 40 Hz or 80 Hz, 50 ms duration) repeated at theta frequency for 1 s. Since responses showed short-term synaptic plasticity that stabilized within two or three theta cycles, we focus here only on responses during the final 500 ms of the stimulus train. In this time window responses to 10 Hz stimulation, and responses to brief gamma trains repeated at 10 Hz, had similar average amplitudes and were followed by a return to baseline (data not shown). By contrast, the membrane potential response within each gamma frequency stimulus train varied steeply as a function of neuronal location. In the most dorsal neurons, membrane potential responses to gamma frequency stimulus epochs showed little summation (Figure 3A), whereas summation of the gamma frequency responses became progressively larger for neurons at increasingly more ventral locations (Figure 3B). The dependence on dorsal-ventral location was steeper for inputs activated at 80 Hz (slope = 0.75 mm−1, R2 = 0.58, p = 0.0016) (Figure 3D) compared with inputs activated at 40 Hz (slope = 0.2 mm−1, R2 = 0.37, p = 0.016) (Figure 3C). Since short-term synaptic plasticity could cause differences in summation of synaptic inputs, we also made voltage-clamp recordings to examine the corresponding synaptic current responses. In contrast to the steep dorsal-ventral gradient in summation of EPSPs, we found no dependence on location of summation of the corresponding EPSCs activated at either 40 Hz (slope = 0.009 mm−1, R2 = −0.09, p = 0.92) or 80 Hz (slope = 0.088 mm−1, R2 = −0.02, p = 0.41) (Figures 3C and 3D). As a further test we minimized variability in the EPSC amplitude by selecting only neurons for which the final EPSC during the gamma epoch was within 20% of the amplitude of the first EPSC (open circles in Figures 3C and 3D). In this case the steep gradient in EPSP summation was maintained for responses to 40 Hz (slope = 0.18 mm−1, R2 = 0.70, p = 0.0032) and 80 Hz (slope = 0.69 mm−1, R2 = 0.62, p = 0.021) stimulus epochs. Thus, these data indicate that stellate neurons at different dorsal-ventral locations show systematic differences in their responsiveness to gamma frequency inputs that are not explained by differences in synaptic transmission. Together, these data indicate that the EPSP waveform, the time window for detection of coincident synaptic responses, and the integration of gamma frequency synaptic inputs depend on a neuron's location within the MEC. Importantly, the progressive slowing of temporal integration of synaptic inputs along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC maps onto the increasing spacing of grid fields found during recordings made in behaving animals from neurons in the same region (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B. Progressive increase in grid scale from dorsal to ventral medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). What are the cellular mechanisms responsible for the dorsal-ventral gradient in synaptic integration? Since differences in synaptic currents do not appear to account for the dorsal-ventral gradient in the EPSP waveform, we investigated nonsynaptic integrative properties of stellate neurons. To do this independently of synaptic activation, we evaluated membrane potential responses to current steps applied to stellate neurons from different locations along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC. To produce a given displacement of the membrane potential from rest required introduction of larger currents into neurons located at the dorsal end of the MEC (Figure 4A) than those in neurons from more ventral locations (Figure 4B). Estimates obtained from these experiments of membrane input resistance (slope = 18.3 MΩ mm−1, R2 = 0.62, p << 1e−6) and membrane time constant (slope = 5.5 ms mm−1, R2 = 0.48, p << 1e−6) increased steeply from the dorsal to the most ventral locations within the MEC (Figures 4C and 4D). By contrast, the resting membrane potential was independent of dorsal-ventral location (R2 = −0.009, p = 0.59) (Figure 4E). Stellate neurons at all locations along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC demonstrated characteristic membrane potential “sag” and “rebound” responses (Figures 4A and 4B), which are mediated by activation and deactivation of HCN channels (Dickson et al., 2000Dickson C.T. Magistretti J. Shalinsky M.H. Fransen E. Hasselmo M.E. Alonso A. Properties and role of I(h) in the pacing of subthreshold oscillations in entorhinal cortex layer II neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2562-2579PubMed Google Scholar, Nolan et al., 2007Nolan M.F. Dudman J.T. Dodson P.D. Santoro B. HCN1 channels control resting and active integrative properties of stellate cells from layer II of the entorhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12440-12451Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). While the relative amplitude of the membrane potential sag decreased with distance from the dorsal pole, this gradient was shallower than those for input resistance and time constant (R2 = 0.18, p = 2.8e−5) (Figure 4F). This striking anatomical organization of the integrative properties of stellate cells extended to measures of suprathreshold excitability. Thus, consistent with these cells' lower input resistance, the minimum amplitude of positive current steps required to evoke action potentials was much larger for neurons from dorsal locations as compared to that for ventral locations (R2 = 0.78, p = 3.8e−6) (Figures 4G and 4H). Importantly, while the current threshold for spiking decreased approximately 4-fold along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC (Figure 4I), the waveform of the action potential and the voltage threshold for action potential initiation did not depend on location (p > 0.25) (Figures 4J–4L), indicating that the gradient in current threshold is not secondary to changes in the spike generation mechanism, but rather reflects differential integration of the injected current. Since background synaptic activity can modify the resting integrative properties of some neurons, we carried out similar experiments in the presence of blockers of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors (Figures 4M–4O). Again, we found that input resistance (R2 = 0.62, p << 1e−6) (Figure 4M), membrane time constant (R2 = 0.39, p << 1e−6) (Figure 4N), and current threshold for action potential generation (R2 = 0.42, p << 1e−6) (Figure 4O) vary steeply as a function of location, whereas the resting potential and spike properties were independent of location (data not shown), indicating that the gradients in membrane properties are not a result of differences in background synaptic activation. Consistent with this conclusion, the gradients in input resistance (R2 = 0.49, p = 0.048, n = 7) and current threshold (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.03, n = 6) were maintained when synaptic transmission was abolished using a modified ACSF containing reduced Ca2+ and elevated Mg2+ (data not shown). To assess whether these integrative properties of stellate neurons vary continuously with location, as has been found for the dorsal-ventral organization of grid cell spacing (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B. Progressive increase in grid scale from dorsal to ventral medial entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), or if instead they reflect a modular organization, we reevaluated our largest data set, which is from recordings made in the presence of blockers of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors (Figures 4M–4O). Grouping the data in 500 μm length bins indicates a progressive change in the membrane properties of stellate neurons from bin to bin, which is consistent with a linear gradient (Figures 4M–4O). Nevertheless, this analysis does not rule out step-like changes or modular organization at finer spatial scales than the bin width of 500 μm. Differences between neurons in their intrinsic integrative properties could arise either through differences in the density or properties of ion channels in their membranes, or through differences in their morphology. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first reconstructed the morphology of the neurons that we recorded from. The morphology of stellate neurons along the full extent of the dorsal-ventral axis was similar to previous descriptions from other species (Figures 5A–5C) (Buckmaster et al., 2004Buckmaster P.S.

Primary dendrites extended in all directions from the cell body, while axons projected directly through the deep layers of the MEC toward the hippocampus. In many cases, axons had collaterals that branched extensively within layer II and layer V/VI, suggesting anatomical substrates for recurrent network activity within layer II (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar S.S.

It is unclear how microbial cells sense spaceflight-associated changes to their growth environment and orchestrate corresponding changes in molecular and physiological phenotypes relevant to the infection process. Here we report that spaceflight-induced increases in Salmonella virulence are regulated by media ion composition, and that phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses in a spaceflight analogue model. Using whole genome microarray and proteomic analyses from two independent Space Shuttle missions, we identified evolutionarily conserved molecular pathways in Salmonella that respond to spaceflight under all media compositions tested. Identification of conserved regulatory paradigms opens new avenues to control microbial responses during the infection process and holds promise to provide an improved understanding of human health and disease on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2039209617,"Glaucoma is a widespread ocular disease and major cause of blindness characterized by progressive, irreversible damage of the optic nerve. Although the degenerative loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and visual deficits associated with glaucoma have been extensively studied, we hypothesize that glaucoma will also lead to alteration of the circadian timing system. Circadian and non-visual responses to light are mediated by a specialized subset of melanopsin expressing RGCs that provide photic input to mammalian endogenous clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In order to explore the molecular, anatomical and functional consequences of glaucoma we used a rodent model of chronic ocular hypertension, a primary causal factor of the pathology. Quantitative analysis of retinal projections using sensitive anterograde tracing demonstrates a significant reduction (approximately 50-70%) of RGC axon terminals in all visual and non-visual structures and notably in the SCN. The capacity of glaucomatous rats to entrain to light was challenged by exposure to successive shifts of the light dark (LD) cycle associated with step-wise decreases in light intensity. Although glaucomatous rats are able to entrain their locomotor activity to the LD cycle at all light levels, they require more time to re-adjust to a shifted LD cycle and show significantly greater variability in activity onsets in comparison with normal rats. Quantitative PCR reveals the novel finding that melanopsin as well as rod and cone opsin mRNAs are significantly reduced in glaucomatous retinas. Our findings demonstrate that glaucoma impacts on all these aspects of the circadian timing system. In light of these results, the classical view of glaucoma as pathology unique to the visual system should be extended to include anatomical and functional alterations of the circadian timing system."
https://openalex.org/W1999141289,"KAP1 is an essential cofactor of KRAB-zinc finger proteins, a family of vertebrate-specific epigenetic repressors of largely unknown functions encoded in the hundreds by the mouse and human genomes. Here, we report that KAP1 is expressed at high levels and necessary for KRAB-mediated repression in mature neurons of the mouse brain. Mice deleted for KAP1 in the adult forebrain exhibit heightened levels of anxiety-like and exploratory activity and stress-induced alterations in spatial learning and memory. In the hippocampus, a small number of genes are dysregulated, including some imprinted genes. Chromatin analyses of the promoters of two genes markedly upregulated in knockout mice reveal decreased histone 3 K9-trimethylation and increased histone 3 and histone 4 acetylation. We propose a model in which the tethering of KAP1-associated chromatin remodeling factors via KRAB-ZFPs epigenetically controls gene expression in the hippocampus, thereby conditioning responses to behavioral stress."
https://openalex.org/W2111382819,"Spike generation in cortical neurons depends on the interplay between diverse intrinsic conductances. The phase response curve (PRC) is a measure of the spike time shift caused by perturbations of the membrane potential as a function of the phase of the spike cycle of a neuron. Near the rheobase, purely positive (type I) phase-response curves are associated with an onset of repetitive firing through a saddle-node bifurcation, whereas biphasic (type II) phase-response curves point towards a transition based on a Hopf-Andronov bifurcation. In recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices, cholinergic action, consistent with down-regulation of slow voltage-dependent potassium currents such as the M-current, switched the PRC from type II to type I. This is the first report showing that cholinergic neuromodulation may cause a qualitative switch in the PRCs type implying a change in the fundamental dynamical mechanism of spike generation."
https://openalex.org/W2077416773,"CREST plays a critical role in activity-dependent development, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we show that a CREST-BRG1 complex regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-fos promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-Rb-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, Rb becomes dephosphorylated at serine 795 by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CBP, suggesting that this mechanism may be generally involved in regulating calcium-dependent transcription of neuronal genes."

https://openalex.org/W2077846163,"Variant histone H2AZ-containing nucleosomes are involved in the regulation of gene expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin deposition of histone H2AZ is mediated by the fourteen-subunit SWR1 complex, which catalyzes ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for H2AZ. Previous work defined the role of seven SWR1 subunits (Swr1 ATPase, Swc2, Swc3, Arp6, Swc5, Yaf9, and Swc6) in maintaining complex integrity and H2AZ histone replacement activity. Here we examined the function of three additional SWR1 subunits, bromodomain containing Bdf1, actin-related protein Arp4 and Swc7, by analyzing affinity-purified mutant SWR1 complexes. We observed that depletion of Arp4 (arp4-td) substantially impaired the association of Bdf1, Yaf9, and Swc4. In contrast, loss of either Bdf1 or Swc7 had minimal effects on overall complex integrity. Furthermore, the basic H2AZ histone replacement activity of SWR1 in vitro required Arp4, but not Bdf1 or Swc7. Thus, three out of fourteen SWR1 subunits, Bdf1, Swc7, and previously noted Swc3, appear to have roles auxiliary to the basic histone replacement activity. The N-terminal region of the Swr1 ATPase subunit is necessary and sufficient to direct association of Bdf1 and Swc7, as well as Arp4, Act1, Yaf9 and Swc4. This same region contains an additional H2AZ-H2B specific binding site, distinct from the previously identified Swc2 subunit. These findings suggest that one SWR1 enzyme might be capable of binding two H2AZ-H2B dimers, and provide further insight on the hierarchy and interdependency of molecular interactions within the SWR1 complex."

We aimed to determine the nature of the tactile information encoded by neurons in the whisker somatosensory relay nucleus (VPm). We wanted to distinguish whether VPm neurons encode similar stimulus features, acting as a single information channel, or encode diverse features. We recorded responses to whisker deflections that thoroughly explored the space of temporal stimulus variables and identified features to which neurons were selective by reverse correlation. The timescale of the features was typically 1-2 ms, at the limit imposed by our experimental conditions, indicating highly acute feature selectivity. Sensitivity to stimulus kinetics was strikingly diverse. Some neurons (25%) only encoded velocity; others were sensitive to position, acceleration, or more complex features. A minority (19%) encoded two or more features. These results indicate that VPm contains a distributed representation of whisker motion, based on high-resolution kinetic features."
https://openalex.org/W2083364356,"Background The microenvironment plays a major role in the onset and progression of metastasis. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tends to metastasize to the peritoneal cavity where interactions within the microenvironment might lead to chemoresistance. Mesothelial cells are important actors of the peritoneal homeostasis; we determined their role in the acquisition of chemoresistance of ovarian tumours. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated an original type of stromal cells, referred to as “Hospicells” from ascitis of patients with ovarian carcinosis using limiting dilution. We studied their ability to confer chemoresistance through heterocellular interactions. These stromal cells displayed a new phenotype with positive immunostaining for CD9, CD10, CD29, CD146, CD166 and Multi drug resistance protein. They preferentially interacted with epithelial ovarian cancer cells. This interaction induced chemoresistance to platin and taxans with the implication of multi-drug resistance proteins. This contact enabled EOC cells to capture patches of the Hospicells membrane through oncologic trogocytosis, therefore acquiring their functional P-gp proteins and thus developing chemoresistance. Presence of Hospicells on ovarian cancer tissue micro-array from patients with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was also significantly associated to chemoresistance. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report of trogocytosis occurring between a cancer cell and an original type of stromal cell. This interaction induced autonomous acquisition of chemoresistance. The presence of stromal cells within patient's tumour might be predictive of chemoresistance. The specific interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells might be targeted during chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2000398434,"Poor angiogenesis is a major road block for tissue repair. The regeneration of virtually all tissues is limited by angiogenesis, given the diffusion of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products is limited to a few hundred micrometers. We postulated that co-transplantation of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells improves angiogenesis of tissue repair and hence the outcome of regeneration. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by using bone as a model whose regeneration is impaired unless it is vascularized. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) were isolated from each of three healthy human bone marrow samples and reconstituted in a porous scaffold. MSCs were seeded in micropores of 3D calcium phosphate (CP) scaffolds, followed by infusion of gel-suspended CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Co-transplantation of CD34+ HSCs and CD34− MSCs in microporous CP scaffolds subcutaneously in the dorsum of immunocompromized mice yielded vascularized tissue. The average vascular number of co-transplanted CD34+ and MSC scaffolds was substantially greater than MSC transplantation alone. Human osteocalcin was expressed in the micropores of CP scaffolds and was significantly increased upon co-transplantation of MSCs and CD34+ cells. Human nuclear staining revealed the engraftment of transplanted human cells in vascular endothelium upon co-transplantation of MSCs and CD34+ cells. Based on additional in vitro results of endothelial differentiation of CD34+ cells by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we adsorbed VEGF with co-transplanted CD34+ and MSCs in the microporous CP scaffolds in vivo, and discovered that vascular number and diameter further increased, likely owing to the promotion of endothelial differentiation of CD34+ cells by VEGF. Together, co-transplantation of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells may improve the regeneration of vascular dependent tissues such as bone, adipose, muscle and dermal grafts, and may have implications in the regeneration of internal organs."
https://openalex.org/W2121194451,"Animal studies have shown that acetylcholine decreases excitatory receptive field size and spread of excitation in early visual cortex. These effects are thought to be due to facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical connections. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the spatial spread of responses to visual stimulation in human early visual cortex. The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil was administered to normal healthy human subjects to increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil decreased the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in visual cortex, consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive field size of cortical neurons. Donepezil also reduced response amplitude in visual cortex, but the cholinergic effects on spatial spread were not a direct result of reduced amplitude. These findings demonstrate that acetylcholine regulates spatial integration in human visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1969536662,"The oxygen reactivity of flavoproteins is poorly understood. Here we show that a single Ala to Gly substitution in l-galactono-γ-lactone dehydrogenase (GALDH) turns the enzyme into a catalytically competent oxidase. GALDH is an aldonolactone oxidoreductase with a vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) fold. We found that nearly all oxidases in the VAO family contain either a Gly or a Pro at a structurally conserved position near the C4a locus of the isoalloxazine moiety of the flavin, whereas dehydrogenases prefer another residue at this position. Mutation of the corresponding residue in GALDH (Ala-113 → Gly) resulted in a striking 400-fold increase in oxygen reactivity, whereas the cytochrome c reductase activity is retained. The activity of the A113G variant shows a linear dependence on oxygen concentration (kox = 3.5 × 105 m-1 s-1), similar to most other flavoprotein oxidases. The Ala-113 → Gly replacement does not change the reduction potential of the flavin but creates space for molecular oxygen to react with the reduced flavin. In the wild-type enzyme, Ala-113 acts as a gatekeeper, preventing oxygen from accessing the isoalloxazine nucleus.

Besides producing this essential nutrient, GALDH is required for the accumulation of plant respiratory complex I (1Pineau B. Layoune O. Danon A. De Paepe R. J. Biol.

VAO family members include enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and lignin degradation and enzymes that participate in the synthesis of antibiotics and alkaloids (4Leferink N.G.H.

Most VAO members contain a covalently tethered FAD and act as oxidases that use molecular oxygen to reoxidize the flavin, resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide.

No crystal structure is available for the aldonolactone oxidoreductase subfamily, and little is known about the nature of the active site and the catalytic mechanism. GALDH is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it feeds electrons into the respiratory chain. Its subcellular localization could provide a rationale why GALDH is a dehydrogenase and not, like related enzymes, an oxidase. The latter activity would result in high levels of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide that promote GALDH inactivation (8Leferink N.G.H. Van den Berg W.A.M. Van Berkel W.J.H. Frago S. Gómez-Moreno C.

FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) but reacts 3–4 orders of magnitude slower with molecular oxygen than what is typically found for oxidases. The reaction of flavoprotein oxidases with molecular oxygen generally follows second order kinetics with rate constants in the range of 105 m-1 s-1 for most oxidases to 106 m-1 s-1 for glucose oxidase (12Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Up to now, there are no clear rules that enable us to predict whether or how a flavoprotein reacts with molecular oxygen. A combination of structural and dynamic features like properly positioned positive charges, solvation of the active site, and protein breathing might play a role (12Mattevi A. Trends Biochem.

The existence of (hydrophobic) oxygen channels from the surface to the active site has been proposed for several flavoenzymes, including the VAO members cholesterol oxidase (CO) (13Coulombe R.

Replacing a Lys in the active site of monomeric sarcosine oxidase decreased the oxygen reactivity by more than 1000-fold (18Zhao G. Bruckner R.C. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Slight improvements in the oxygen reactivity were reported for d-amino acid oxidase (19Pollegioni L. Rosini E. Pilone M.S. Orru R. Molla G. Frago S. Gómez-Moreno C. Medina M. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain2008: 497-502Google Scholar), where a directed evolution approach was followed to obtain variants with increased oxygen affinity. A Tyr to Lys mutation increased the oxygen reactivity of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase due to a better exposure of the flavin to solvent, but the reaction is far from efficient (20Zeng J. Liu Y. Wu L. Li D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants for the poor oxygen reactivity of GALDH from A. thaliana. Because structural information for the aldonolactone oxidoreductases is lacking, we used a structure-based multiple sequence alignment strategy to find structural correlations with oxidase activity within the VAO family. Strikingly, we found that nearly all oxidase members of the VAO family contain a glycine or proline at a structurally conserved position near the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin, whereas members that do not react with oxygen contain another residue at this position. The role of the corresponding residue in GALDH, Ala-113, in the reaction with molecular oxygen was addressed by site-directed mutagenesis. We describe for the first time the characterization of a GALDH variant capable of efficiently utilizing oxygen as electron acceptor, rendering a catalytically competent l-galactono-γ-lactone oxidase. Chemicals—Benzyl viologen, bovine heart cytochrome c, FAD, l-galactono-1,4-lactone, and xanthine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Resazurin was obtained from Acros Organics, and xanthine oxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals were from commercial sources and of the purest grade available. Sequence Comparisons—A structure-based multiple sequence alignment of the FAD domain of the VAO family was generated with the 3DM software (21Joosten H.J. Han Y. Niu W. Vervoort J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Schaap P.J. Proteins. 2008; 70: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 3DM alignment can be viewed at the 3DM Alignment Program page (FAD-linked oxidases database). Additional Clustal W multiple sequence alignments were performed to find corresponding residues at structurally conserved positions for VAO members lacking in the 3DM alignment. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding mature GALDH (At3g47930) has been cloned previously into the pET23a(+) vector (Novagen) to yield pET-GALDH-His6 (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The GALDH A113G variant was constructed using pET-GALDH-His6 as template with the QuikChange II method (Stratagene) using the oligonucleotides A113G_fw (forward) (5′-CTC TTC AGA ACT TTG GCT CCA TTA GAG-3′) and A113G_rv (reverse) (5′-CTG CTC TCT AAT GGA GCC AAA GTT CTG-3′). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by automated sequencing. The resulting construct pET-GALDH_ A113G-His6 was electroporated to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) for recombinant expression. Enzyme Production and Purification—For enzyme production, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, harboring a pET-GALDH plasmid, were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A600 of 0.7 was reached. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the incubation was continued for 16 h at 37 °C. The recombinant His6-tagged proteins were purified essentially as described before (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5% acrylamide slab gels essentially as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Total protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford protein assay from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as standard. Desalting or buffer exchange of small aliquots of enzyme was performed with Bio-Gel P-6DG columns (Bio-Rad). Spectral Analysis—Absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Spectra were collected and analyzed using the UV-visible ChemStation software package (Hewlett Packard). The molar absorption coefficient for the mutant protein was determined by recording absorption spectra in the presence and absence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS, assuming a molar absorption coefficient for free FAD of 11.3 mm-1 cm-1 at 450 nm. Enzyme concentrations were routinely determined by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 12.9 mm-1 cm-1 for wild-type GALDH (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Reduction Potential Determination—The reduction potentials of wild-type GALDH and the A113G variant were determined using the method of Massey (23Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co, Berlin and New York1990: 59-66Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-ml suba-sealed cuvette containing 5 μm GALDH, 400 μm xanthine, 2.5 μm benzyl viologen, and 5 μm redox dye in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was made anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. To scavenge final traces of oxygen, 1 mm vanillyl-alcohol and catalytic amounts of eugenol oxidase (24Jin J. Mazon H. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were added to the reaction mixture. To start the reaction, 2 μl of xanthine oxidase (20 units/ml) was added, and spectra were collected every 2 min during the reduction using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda Bio 40 spectrophotometer. The potentials at 50% reduction of GALDH (Em) were calculated using the Nernst equation, Eh=Em+2.303×(R×T/n×F)×log([ox]/[red]),(Eq. 1) where Eh is the measured potential, Em is the midpoint potential of the enzyme, R is the gas constant (8.31 J K-1 mol-1), T is the temperature in K, n is the number of electrons to go from the oxidized species to the reduced species, F is the Faraday constant (96.5 kJ V-1 mol-1), and [ox] and [red] are the concentrations of oxidized and reduced enzyme, respectively. Activity Measurements—GALDH activity was routinely assayed by following the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because dithiothreitol interferes with the reaction, it was removed from the enzyme solution by Bio-Gel P-6DG gel filtration immediately prior to use. Initial velocities were calculated using a molar difference absorption coefficient (Δ∊550) of 21 mm-1 cm-1 for reduced minus oxidized cytochrome c. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of l-galactono-1,4-lactone/min, which is equivalent to the reduction of 2 μmol of cytochrome c (25Ôba K. Ishikawa S. Nishikawa M. Mizuno H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reaction with molecular oxygen was assayed with a polarographic oxygen uptake assay using a Clark electrode in aerated buffer (0.25 mm oxygen at 25 °C) in the absence of cytochrome c. To identify the product of oxygen reduction, catalytic amounts of catalase (10 μg) or superoxide dismutase (10 μg) were added to the oxygen uptake assay mixture. Stopped-flow Kinetics—The reoxidation of wild-type GALDH and A113G with molecular oxygen was studied by stopped-flow kinetics using an Applied Photophysics SX17MV instrument. All experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Solutions were made anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. To scavenge final traces of oxygen, 1 mm vanillyl-alcohol and catalytic amounts of eugenol oxidase were added to the reaction mixture. Reduced enzyme was prepared by using 1.2 eq of substrate. The oxidative half-reaction was followed at 450 nm by mixing the substrate-reduced enzyme with buffer containing various concentrations of oxygen (0.25–1.25 mm). Obtained spectra were analyzed with the Pro-K software (Applied Photophysics), and single-wavelength traces were fitted to a double exponential function, At=A1×e(-k1×t)+A2×e(-k2×t)+C,(Eq. 2) where A is absorbance difference at 450 nm, k is the rate constant (s-1), and C the absorbance off-set at 450 nm. Structural Correlations with Oxidase Activity in the VAO Family—Most members of the VAO flavoprotein family are oxidases containing a covalently bound FAD cofactor (2Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Leferink N.G.H. Heuts D.P.H.M. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 474: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Inspection of the structure-based multiple sequence alignment of the FAD domain of many VAO members yielded another striking correlation with oxidase activity. All known oxidases, with the exception of alditol oxidase and xylitol oxidase, contain either a glycine or a proline residue at a structurally conserved position near the C4a locus of the flavin isoalloxazine ring that is potentially reactive toward molecular oxygen. GALDH and other dehydrogenases, like cytokinin dehydrogenases and d-lactate dehydrogenase, contain an alanine, threonine, or isoleucine at this position. The occurrence of amino acid residues at the structurally conserved position near flavin C4a in both oxidases and dehydrogenases of the VAO family is shown in the supplemental materials. Inspection of the known crystal structures of VAO members revealed that the residues at the conserved position near flavin C4a are located on the re-side of the flavin, opposite of the substrate binding site, which is on the flavin si-side in VAO members. In Fig. 1, the active sites of AldO and CO, the closest homologs of GALDH with a known three-dimensional structure are depicted. A high degree of conservation is observed between GALDH, AldO, and CO in the substrate binding site and the area around the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. AldO, although an oxidase, contains an alanine (Ala-105), analogous to Ala-113 of GALDH, near flavin C4a, whereas CO contains a proline (Pro-186) at this position. To address the potential oxidase activity of GALDH, an A113G variant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to create more space near flavin C4a. Spectral Properties—Mutation of Ala-113 in GALDH into Gly yielded a stable holoprotein, which could be expressed and purified in similar quantities as wild-type GALDH (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During the purification procedure, a significant fraction of the mutant protein (about one-third) lost its FAD cofactor, but the apoprotein was readily reconstituted to the holo form with commercial FAD. The Ala-113 to Gly replacement gives small spectral perturbations in the flavin optical spectrum, the maxima at 376 nm and 450 nm are red and blue shifted, respectively, and the shoulder at 475 nm is less pronounced (Fig. 2). The molar absorption coefficient of the mutant protein is 13.0 mm-1 cm-1 at 449 nm when compared with 12.9 mm-1 cm-1 at 450 nm for the wild-type protein. Catalytic Properties—The steady-state kinetic parameters of GALDH A113G for l-galactono-1,4-lactone were determined using both oxygen and cytochrome c as electron acceptor. The A113G mutation yields a striking increase in turnover rate with molecular oxygen, kcat = 42 s-1 when compared with 0.17 s-1 for wild-type, whereas retaining the cytochrome c reductase activity, kcat = 116 s-1 versus 134 s-1 for the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A). The Michaelis constant for l-galactono-1,4-lactone is slightly higher for the mutant protein than for the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The steady-state kinetic measurements with oxygen and cytochrome c suggest that in the A113G variant, the reoxidation with oxygen is the rate-limiting step during catalysis, and not flavin reduction or product release as is typical in flavoprotein oxidases (26Van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Eppink M.H.M. Fraaije M.W. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Flavoprotein Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 61-85Google Scholar).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of wild-type GALDH and A113G for l-galactono-1,4-lactone using cytochrome c or molecular oxygen (air saturated buffer) as electron acceptorWild-typeaData from Ref. 7A113GCytochrome c (50 μm) kcat (s-1)134 ± 5116 ± 5 Km, GAL (mm)0.17 ± 0.010.45 ± 0.03 kcat/Km, GAL (mm-1 s-1)7.7 × 1022.6 × 102Oxygen (0.26 mm) kcat (s-1)0.17 ± 0.0242 ± 6 Km, GAL (mm)NDbND, not detectable due to low oxygen consumption rates0.46 ± 0.10 kcat/Km, GAL (mm-1 s-1)NDbND, not detectable due to low oxygen consumption rates9.1 × 101a Data from Ref. 7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholarb ND, not detectable due to low oxygen consumption rates Open table in a new tab To determine whether hydrogen peroxide or superoxide is produced as a result of oxygen reduction by GALDH A113G, the oxygen uptake assay was performed in the presence of catalase, which converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, or superoxide dismutase, which converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. In the presence of catalase, the oxygen consumption rate was about half of the rate observed in the absence of catalase. Moreover, when catalase was added at the end of the reaction, about 50% of the consumed oxygen was regenerated. The addition of superoxide dismutase to the assay mixture had no effect on the oxygen consumption rate, confirming that hydrogen peroxide is indeed formed as a result of flavin reoxidation by the A113G variant. Also, for wild-type GALDH, no superoxide formation could be detected. Oxidative Half-reaction—The kinetics of reoxidation of wild-type GALDH and the A113G variant by molecular oxygen were studied in more detail by mixing substrate-reduced enzyme with aerated buffer in the stopped-flow apparatus. Diode-array detection revealed that flavin reoxidation did not involve spectral intermediates in both variants. Deconvolution of the spectra taken during reoxidation of wild-type GALDH revealed a single phase, whereas A113G showed two phases during the reoxidation, a fast phase (k =∼30 s-1) corresponding to flavin reoxidation and a second slower phase (k =∼7 s-1) (data shown in the supplemental materials). The effect of oxygen concentration on the reoxidation rate of A113G was studied by single wavelength detection. Traces were best fit to a double exponential function. The first fast phase represents the reoxidation event and shows a linear dependence on the oxygen concentration, giving a bimolecular rate constant of 3.4 × 105 m-1 s-1 for flavin reoxidation (Fig. 3B), a 400-fold increase when compared with wild-type GALDH, which has a bimolecular rate constant of 9.1 × 102 m-1 s-1. Reoxidation in the presence of excess product only had a minor effect on the rate of reoxidation of A113G, suggesting that the data presented reflect the oxygen reactivities of the free reduced enzymes. The second slower phase observed during the reoxidation of A113G accounts for maximally 10–15% of the total absorbance change. The corresponding rates were not dependent on the oxygen concentration and were around 5–10 s-1 in all cases. The nature of this phase is unclear; as it is slower than the observed kcat, it might represent a non-catalytic event. Alternatively, the A113G protein preparation might consist of two populations, a fast reacting species and a slow reacting one, because the spectral difference in both processes is the same. A similar slow phase (around 5 s-1) that is not dependent on the oxygen concentration was detected during the reoxidation of type II CO (17Piubelli L. Pedotti M. Molla G. Feindler-Boeckh S. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24738-24747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reduction Potential—The protein structure around the isoalloxazine moiety of the flavin controls both the catalytic function and the redox properties of the enzyme. To find out what is the basis for the observed increase in oxidase activity in the A113G mutant, the reduction potentials of wild-type GALDH and A113G were estimated using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase method (23Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co, Berlin and New York1990: 59-66Google Scholar), using resazurin/resorufin (Em resorufin =-51 mV) as the reference dye. Both wild-type and A113G were reduced in a single two-electron step, without the formation of a semiquinone species (Fig. 4). The reduction via a single two-electron process fits well with the catalytic function of GALDH, the two-electron oxidation of l-galactono-1,4-lactone. The midpoint reduction potentials of wild type and A113G could be estimated from the log (Eox/Ered) versus log (dyeox/dyered) plots and were -44 mV for wild-type GALDH and -63 mV for A113G. These values are in the same range as has been reported for other non-covalent flavoprotein dehydrogenases and oxidases (27Stankovich M.T. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 401-425Google Scholar), whereas covalent flavoproteins generally have higher reduction potentials (28Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Winkler A. Kutchan T.M. Macheroux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24437-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Ala-113 to Gly mutation lowers the midpoint reduction potential of GALDH by about 20 mV. Such a small decrease in reduction potential cannot account for the observed increase in oxidase activity. GALDH from A. thaliana is one of the few members of the VAO flavoprotein family that reacts poorly with molecular oxygen (7Leferink N.G.H. van den Berg W.A.M. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By performing a structure-based multiple sequence alignment (21Joosten H.J. Han Y. Niu W. Vervoort J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Schaap P.J. Proteins. 2008; 70: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of the FAD domain of known VAO family members, we found a striking correlation between the presence of a Gly or Pro residue at a structurally conserved position near the C4a locus of the flavin and the oxidase activity of these enzymes. Replacing the corresponding residue in GALDH (Ala-113) with Gly increased the oxygen reactivity of GALDH with several orders of magnitude, yielding a catalytically competent oxidase. All oxidases of the VAO family contain a covalently bound FAD (4Leferink N.G.H. Heuts D.P.H.M. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 474: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The properties of the GALDH A113G variant clearly show, however, that this feature is not essential for VAO members to acquire oxidase activity. Covalent flavinylation does not enhance the reactivity of the flavin with molecular oxygen but merely increases the flavin reduction potential, i.e. the power for substrate oxidation. The VAO H422A variant, which contains non-covalently bound FAD, has a much lower reduction potential than the wild-type enzyme but a nearly identical reaction rate with molecular oxygen (28Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, cytokinin dehydrogenase contains covalently linked FAD, accordingly has a relatively high reduction potential (+8 mV), but reacts poorly with molecular oxygen (30Frébortová J. Fraaije M.W. Galuszka P. Šebela M. Peč P. Hrbáč J. Novák O. Bilyeu K.D. English J.T. Frébort I. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above considerations, we found that the A113G mutation in GALDH results in a minor lowering of reduction potential of about 20 mV but a 400-fold increase in oxygen reactivity. Properly positioned positive charges are thought to enhance the oxygen reactivity of flavoenzymes, possibly by stabilization of the superoxide-flavin semiquinone radical pair generated after the first electron transfer from the reduced flavin to oxygen (12Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For glucose oxidase, it was demonstrated that a protonated His (His-516) in front of the N5-C4a flavin locus is solely responsible for the observed fast reaction with molecular oxygen (kox = 1.5 × 106 m-1 s-1) (31Roth J.P. Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similarly, Lys-265 was found to be responsible for oxygen activation in monomeric sarcosine oxidase. Replacing this Lys with a neutral residue resulted in an 8000-fold decrease in oxygen reactivity (18Zhao G. Bruckner R.C. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). GALDH contains two basic residues (Arg-388 and Lys-456) at the si-face of the flavin ring that are possibly important for the reaction with oxygen. These residues are conserved in AldO and CO (Fig. 1), where they are involved in substrate oxidation (14Forneris F. Heuts D.P.H.M. Delvecchio M. Rovida S. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In monomeric sarcosine oxidase, the sites for substrate oxidation and oxygen reduction are also found on opposite faces of the flavin (32Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As noted by Jorns and co-workers (18Zhao G. Bruckner R.C. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9124-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), such an arrangement might avoid steric crowding in the ternary complex. The chemical reaction of flavoprotein oxidases with molecular oxygen is not completely understood but involves the transfer of one electron from the reduced flavin to oxygen, resulting in the formation of a superoxide anion/flavin semiquinone radical pair. Next, the radical pair can dissociate to release the oxygen radical, it can undergo a second electron transfer to produce hydrogen peroxide, or it can form a covalent C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin species that can further dissociate to form hydrogen peroxide. This oxygen-flavin adduct is generally unstable but is a common feature in flavoprotein monooxygenases that use this intermediate to insert an oxygen atom into their substrates (33Van Berkel W.J.H. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). For oxidases, it is not clear whether the C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin is formed during the catalytic cycle. Recently, for the first time, such an intermediate has been experimentally detected in a flavoprotein oxidase: pyranose 2-oxidase (34Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The oxygenated flavin species decayed to form oxidized flavin and hydrogen peroxide, consistent with the inability of pyranose 2-oxidase to perform oxygenation reactions. Most flavoprotein oxidases show a linear dependence on oxygen concentration, reflecting a second order process, suggesting that the reaction is the result of a collision of oxygen and the reduced flavin cofactor and that oxygen can freely diffuse into the active site (12Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For AldO, where no C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate is detected during flavin reoxidation (35Heuts D.P.H.M. van Hellemond E.W. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20283-20291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was argued that the methyl side chain of Ala-105, homologous to Ala-113 in GALDH, could hamper the formation of the peroxy-flavin intermediate by steric hindrance (14Forneris F. Heuts D.P.H.M. Delvecchio M. Rovida S. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AldO and GALDH show 25% sequence identity, but a high degree of conservation between these enzymes is observed in the area around the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin, including several residues in the substrate binding pocket. This supports that the A113G mutation in GALDH creates space for molecular oxygen to reach and react with the N5-C4a locus of the reduced FAD cofactor. The created space likely results in a cavity big enough to accommodate a molecule of dioxygen. The acyl-CoA oxidases and dehydrogenases form another group of structurally similar flavoenzymes that use different electron acceptors. A distinct oxygen binding site near the C4a-N5 locus of the flavin was proposed for the acyl-CoA oxidases and assigned to the presence of a Gly (36Arent S. Pye V.E. Henriksen A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2008; 46: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Mackenzie J. Pedersen L. Arent S. Henriksen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 284: 31012-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The role of this residue in the oxygen reactivity was, however, never experimentally evaluated. Members of the FMN-dependent l-2-hydroxy acid oxidase family contain either a Gly or an Ala at the end of a four-residue loop in close proximity of the C4a-N5 locus of the flavin (12Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Changing this Gly to Ala in l-lactate monooxygenase significantly reduced the oxygen reactivity (38Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas for mandelate dehydrogenase, a slight increase was found (39Dewanti A.R. Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10692-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was argued that the oxidase activity in this family might be controlled by steric effects through the relative positions of the FMN and the four-residue peptide loop. Members with a poor oxygen reactivity show a more constrained geometry around the N5 position of the flavin (39Dewanti A.R. Xu Y. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10692-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that it is possible to convert a flavoprotein dehydrogenase into a catalytically competent oxidase. Our findings are of general relevance for the design of suitable biocatalysts because oxidases do not require expensive co-substrates or regeneration systems (40Joosten V. Van Berkel W.J.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Removal of the Ala-113 side chain of GALDH creates space and allows oxygen to reach the reduced flavin. The presence of such a gatekeeper residue in dehydrogenases is a key factor for preventing oxidase activity in the VAO flavoprotein family. The question remains whether oxygen reaches the active site through defined oxygen tunnels or via multiple entrances as the result of protein breathing. What seems to be of key importance is the presence of space for molecular oxygen to reach and attack the reduced flavin.

https://openalex.org/W2009292054,"Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has shown clinical success in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic mutations of EGFR were found in lung adenocarcinoma that lead to exquisite dependency on EGFR signaling; thus patients with EGFR-mutant tumors are at high chance of response to EGFR inhibitors. However, imaging approaches affording early identification of tumor response in EGFR-dependent carcinomas have so far been lacking.We performed a systematic comparison of 3'-Deoxy-3'-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([(18)F]FLT) and 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for their potential to identify response to EGFR inhibitors in a model of EGFR-dependent lung cancer early after treatment initiation. While erlotinib-sensitive tumors exhibited a striking and reproducible decrease in [(18)F]FLT uptake after only two days of treatment, [(18)F]FDG PET based imaging revealed no consistent reduction in tumor glucose uptake. In sensitive tumors, a decrease in [(18)F]FLT PET but not [(18)F]FDG PET uptake correlated with cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The reduction in [(18)F]FLT PET signal at day 2 translated into dramatic tumor shrinkage four days later. Furthermore, the specificity of our results is confirmed by the complete lack of [(18)F]FLT PET response of tumors expressing the T790M erlotinib resistance mutation of EGFR.[(18)F]FLT PET enables robust identification of erlotinib response in EGFR-dependent tumors at a very early stage. [(18)F]FLT PET imaging may represent an appropriate method for early prediction of response to EGFR TKI treatment in patients with NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2044503653,"Background Motor proteins from the kinesin-5 subfamily play an essential role in spindle assembly during cell division of most organisms. These motors crosslink and slide microtubules in the spindle. Kinesin-5 motors are phosphorylated at a conserved site by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) during mitosis. Xenopus laevis kinesin-5 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by Aurora A in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigate here the effect of these phosphorylations on kinesin-5 from Xenopus laevis, called Eg5. We find that phosphorylation at threonine 937 in the C-terminal tail of Eg5 by Cdk1 does not affect the velocity of Eg5, but strongly increases its binding to microtubules assembled in buffer. Likewise, this phosphorylation promotes binding of Eg5 to microtubules in Xenopus egg extract spindles. This enhancement of binding elevates the amount of Eg5 in spindles above a critical level required for bipolar spindle formation. We find furthermore that phosphorylation of Xenopus laevis Eg5 by Aurora A at serine 543 in the stalk is not required for spindle formation. Conclusions/Significance These results show that phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 has a direct effect on the interaction of this motor with microtubules. In egg extract, phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 ensures that the amount of Eg5 in the spindle is above a level that is required for spindle formation. This enhanced targeting to the spindle appears therefore to be, at least in part, a direct consequence of the enhanced binding of Eg5 to microtubules upon phosphorylation by Cdk1. These findings advance our understanding of the regulation of this essential mitotic motor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2014328392,"Background Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is a secreted protein that binds and regulates IGF actions in controlling growth, development, reproduction, and aging. Elevated expression of IGFBP-2 is often associated with progression of many types of cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the identification and characterization of two IGFBP-2 genes in zebrafish and four other teleost fish. Comparative genomics and structural analyses suggest that they are co-orthologs of the human IGFBP-2 gene. Biochemical assays show that both zebrafish igfbp-2a and -2b encode secreted proteins that bind IGFs. These two genes exhibit distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns. During embryogenesis, IGFBP-2a mRNA is initially detected in the lens, then in the brain boundary vasculature, and subsequently becomes highly expressed in the liver. In the adult stage, liver has the highest levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA, followed by the brain. Low levels of IGFBP-2a mRNA were detected in muscle and in the gonad in male adults only. IGFBP-2b mRNA is detected initially in all tissues at low levels, but later becomes abundant in the liver. In adult males, IGFBP-2b mRNA is only detected in the liver. In adult females, it is also found in the gut, kidney, ovary, and muscle. To gain insights into how the IGFBP-2 genes may have evolved through partitioning of ancestral functions, functional and mechanistic studies were carried out. Expression of zebrafish IGFBP-2a and -2b caused significant decreases in the growth and developmental rates and their effects are comparable to that of human IGFBP-2. IGFBP-2 mutants with altered IGF binding-, RGD-, and heparin-binding sites were generated and their actions examined. While mutating the RGD and heparin binding sites had little effect, altering the IGF binding site abolished its biological activity. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that IGFBP-2 is a conserved regulatory protein and it inhibits growth and development primarily by binding to and inhibiting IGF actions in vivo. The duplicated IGFBP-2 genes may provide additional flexibility in the regulation of IGF activities."
https://openalex.org/W2054801886,"Copper is an essential yet toxic trace element. The Ctr1 family of proteins plays a critical role for copper uptake in eukaryotes. However, the mechanisms of action of Ctr1 are largely unknown. Our previous data demonstrated that copper transport induces conformational changes in the cytosolic C terminus of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctr1. To define the physiological significance of this molecular event and gain better insights into the mechanism of Ctr1-mediated copper uptake, we have characterized the functional roles of the Ctr1 C terminus. A Ctr1 mutant lacking the entire C-terminal cytosolic tail is functional in high affinity copper uptake; however, yeast cells expressing this mutant are extremely sensitive to excess copper. Toxic copper uptake is not attributed to elevated expression or distinct subcellular localization of this mutant as compared with wild type Ctr1. Further characterization of the function of Ctr1 containing deletions or site-directed mutations at the C terminus indicates a structural role for the C terminus in controlling Ctr1 activities. In response to excess copper, Ctr1-mediated copper transport is rapidly blocked in a C terminus-dependent mechanism associated with direct binding of copper. We propose that conformational changes in the cytosolic tail of yeast Ctr1 by copper sensing within this domain lead to the inhibition of Ctr1-mediated copper transport.

Individuals diagnosed with Wilson disease experience abnormal copper accumulation in the liver due to a defect in its excretion, which in turn leads to hepatic dysfunction and neurological symptoms (6Gitlin J.D.

Identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in transport, distribution, and excretion of copper and also the regulation of these processes have revealed how cells maintain homeostatic copper metabolism (3Lee J.

Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Ctr1 (copper transporter 1) serves as a high affinity copper transporter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This yeast also expresses two additional Ctr1 family members, Ctr2 and Ctr3. Ctr3 is functionally redundant to Ctr1; however, Ctr3 expression in many yeast strains is blocked by a transposon element (10Knight S.A. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J.

After copper is transported across the cell membrane, it is incorporated into copper-requiring proteins via copper-delivery molecules and assembly factors (15Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L.

Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Given that copper levels in the environment likely fluctuate and excess copper is toxic, delicate control of copper uptake, distribution, and detoxification is necessary for copper homeostasis. Transcriptional regulation of genes encoding components of copper transport and detoxification via Mac1 and Ace1 has been characterized in yeast (3Lee J. Adle D. Kim H. Tamás M.J. Martinoia E. Molecular Biology of Metal Homeostasis and Detoxification. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2006: 1-36Google Scholar, 22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D.

Moreover, excess copper rapidly induces degradation of yeast Ctr1 (t½ < 30 min) in the apparent absence of endocytosis (24Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these data, another group reported that when excess copper is added to culture media, yeast Ctr1 is accumulated at the vacuole in an Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase and endocytosis-dependent mechanism (25Liu J. Sitaram A. Burd C.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ctr1 that accumulates within the vacuole is stable after 2 h. Two lysine residues (Lys-340 and Lys-345) at the C terminus are necessary for copper-dependent ubiquitination followed by the internalization of Ctr1 (25Liu J. Sitaram A. Burd C.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mode of post-translational regulation of yeast Ctr1 appears to occur in mammalian Ctr1 as well (26Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), although other research groups have reported contradictory data (28Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Eisses J.F. Chi Y. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9635-9639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Collectively, the nature and mechanisms of copper-dependent post-translational regulations of Ctr1 are not firmly established yet in both yeast and mammals. Ctr1 family members are integral membrane proteins possessing three predicted transmembrane domains (3Lee J. Adle D. Kim H. Tamás M.J. Martinoia E. Molecular Biology of Metal Homeostasis and Detoxification. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2006: 1-36Google Scholar, 4Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Conserved methionine residues, one at the extracellular N terminus and two that face into the periplasmic space in the predicted second trans-membrane domain, are proposed to be involved in copper translocation (30Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, overall sequence identity among Ctr1 family of proteins is minimal. In particular, the N-terminal extracellular domain and C-terminal cytosolic tail are distinct in length and amino acid sequence. The predicted C terminus of yeast Ctr1 and human Ctr1 encompass125 and 12 amino acids, respectively (3Lee J. Adle D. Kim H. Tamás M.J. Martinoia E. Molecular Biology of Metal Homeostasis and Detoxification. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2006: 1-36Google Scholar, 4Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, despite of this difference in length, many of Ctr1 family members possess potential metal binding residues at the N and C termini. For instance, the C-terminal cytosolic tail of yeast Ctr1 contains six Cys residues, and human Ctr1 possesses His-Cys-His residues at the C terminus (3Lee J. Adle D. Kim H. Tamás M.J. Martinoia E. Molecular Biology of Metal Homeostasis and Detoxification. Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, Germany2006: 1-36Google Scholar, 4Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Ctr1 forms a multimer complex (30Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 31Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 32Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed a projection structure of the human Ctr1 confirmed that Ctr1 forms a compact trimer with a novel channel-like architecture and no structural occlusion of the predicted pore for copper (33Aller S.G. Unger V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, it is largely unknown how Ctr1 transports copper. Our previous data demonstrate that copper induces conformational changes in the C terminus of yeast Ctr1, which is coupled with copper transport (34Sinani D. Adle D.J. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26775-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Ctr1 monomers fused with either cyan or yellow fluorescent protein resulted in fluorescence resonance energy transfer, which is consistent with multimer assembly of Ctr1 in situ (34Sinani D. Adle D.J. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26775-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Copper near the Km value of Ctr1 enhanced fluorescence resonance energy transfer in a manner that correlated with cellular copper uptake, which revealed an implication of structural remodeling of the C terminus in function and/or regulation of Ctr1 in yeast (34Sinani D. Adle D.J. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26775-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Copper translocation through the transmembrane pore within a homotrimer complex could culminate with a motion of the C terminus when copper is released into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, structural remodeling of Ctr1 could be implicated in regulation of Ctr1. Given that Ctr1 in yeast and mammalian cells might undergo copper-induced endocytosis and degradation (24Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Liu J. Sitaram A. Burd C.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Petris M.J. Smith K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a specific conformation induced in response to excess copper may recruit the machinery for internalization and degradation of Ctr1. It is also possible that the conformational change in the cytosolic C terminus controls the copper translocation across the transmembrane pore when cells accumulate sufficient copper. To gain better insights into the mechanisms of action and regulation of Ctr1 and the physiological significances of the conformational changes in the C terminus (34Sinani D. Adle D.J. Kim H. Lee J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26775-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we have characterized the functional roles for the C terminus of Ctr1 in yeast S. cerevisiae. Cells expressing Ctr1 lacking the entire C-terminal tail are active in high affinity copper uptake but extremely sensitive to excess copper. The yeast Ctr1 with serial deletion or site-directed mutations of residues within the C terminus indicates that in response to excess copper, the C terminus rapidly blocks Ctr1-mediated copper uptake with no significant changes in expression levels and subcellular distribution of Ctr1. Our data suggest a new regulatory mechanism of Ctr1 by which yeast cells prevent toxic accumulation of copper. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—A BY4741 haploid S. cerevisiae strain (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), in which the Ctr1 gene is deleted (ctr1::kanMX4) and the Ctr3 gene is silent (Open Biosystems), was used in this study.

In the rsp5/npi1 strain, expression of Rsp5/Npi1 is reduced >10-fold compared with isogenic wild type cells as a result of the insertion of a Ty1 element in its 5′ region (35Hein C. Springael J.Y.

Yeast cells were cultured with synthetic complete (SC) 2The abbreviations used are: SC, synthetic complete; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SOD1, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. media (2% dextrose, 0.2% amino acid mixture, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base) lacking uracil for plasmid selection (SC-ura) or YPD (2% dextrose, 2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract) media. Solid media was prepared with the supplementation of 1.5% agar. Cell growth on non-fermentable carbon sources was tested using YPEG media (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol, 1.5% agar). Yeast cells were cultured in SC-ura media at 30 °C if no media or temperature is specified. Plasmid Construction and Manipulation—If no expression vector is indicated, single copy yeast vectors (p416-TEF) (38Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) were used for a TEF2 gene promoter-driven constitutive expression. For triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagging at the N-terminal extracellular domain, a NotI restriction enzyme site was created between the 119th and 120th amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted by the primer overlap extension method (39Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol.

Common molecular biology techniques, including plasmid amplification and purification using Escherichia coli, followed previously established methods (40Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to confirm mutations and inframe fusion. Plasmid transformation into yeast was performed using the lithium acetate method (41Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Cell Growth Assays—The functionality of Ctr1 mutant alleles was determined by assessing the complementation of the growth defect of Δctr1 cells on YPEG media. Cells transformed with Ctr1 plasmid were cultured to mid-log phase in SC-ura media. Cells (5 μl diluted at 0.1 optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm (A600 = 0.1)) were spotted on solid YPEG media. To further deplete copper in this media, we supplemented copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) (20Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar or 50 μm). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days before photography. To determine copper toxicity conferred by the Ctr1 mutant alleles, cells were spotted on SC-ura media supplemented with copper (CuCl2) at concentrations indicated in figures. Cell growth was assessed after 1 day. Each assay was repeated at least two times to confirm results. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) and 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cell lysates were denatured in a SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (100 mm) for 15 min at 60 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. HA epitope-tagged Ctr1 was detected by chemiluminescence using anti-HA antibodies (Rockland) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz). Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) was probed as a loading control using anti-PGK antibodies (Molecular Probes) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (GE Healthcare). 64Cu Uptake Assays—Radioactive 64Cu (specific activity of 15–30 mCi/μg of CuCl2) (Isotrace Technique) was added to exponentially growing cells to the indicated concentrations, and then the cells were incubated for 10 min (for determining copper transport kinetics) or 5 min (for other copper uptake assays) at room temperature. 64Cu uptake into cells was quenched with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. These cells were filtered using nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm, Millipore) and washed twice with PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. Cell-associated 64Cu was quantified using a γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1470 WIZARD). 64Cu levels in Δctr1 cells expressing an empty vector (Ctr1-independend background uptake) were subtracted. Copper uptake was calculated using a standard curve and then normalized to the cell number. Apparent Vmax and Km were determined via extrapolation to zero in the reciprocal plot for velocity versus copper concentration using GraphPad PRISM™ software. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described previously (42Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. Exponentially growing cells were precultured with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 30 min and then cultured with or without copper supplementation (0.1 mm CuCl2, 30 min). Metabolic inhibitors (10 mm sodium azide and potassium fluoride) were added to cells, and then cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were washed 1 time with a breaking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science)). Cells were then vortexed with glass beads. After centrifugation for 3 min at 300 × g, the supernatant (0.5 ml) was loaded onto a linear sucrose gradient prepared by subsequently layering 10, 20, 35, or 60% sucrose to form an 9-ml step gradient. Samples were subjected to centrifugation (at 4 °C at 50,000 rpm for 14 h). Fractions (500 μl each) were collected from the top of the gradient. Aliquots of each fraction were denatured in an SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (100 mm) at 60 °C for 15 min. HA-tagged Ctr1 in these fractions was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. Lethality Assays—rsp5/npi1 (35Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1707-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) strains and their isogenic wild type strains were transformed with expression constructs of wild type Ctr1 or Ctr1 with C-terminal 106 amino acid deletion (Ctr1(300)). rsp5/npi1 cells grown to mid-log phase were cultured with and without supplementation of copper (CuCl2) at concentrations indicated in the figures (see Fig. 5, E and F) for 1 h at 30 °C. For experiments using temperature-sensitive end4-1 and chc1-1 mutant strains, cells were cultured at 25 °C and then shifted to a restrictive temperature (37 °C) for 30 min before adding copper to culture media. After culturing the cells with copper for 1 h, they were washed twice and diluted to the same cell density (A600 = 0.001), and then 100 μl were plated on solid YPD media. Our assumption is that cells accumulate toxic copper and/or are severely damaged during the culture in media supplemented with copper and are not able to grow on YPD plates. After 2 days, the colonies that had grown were counted, and colony numbers were then compared with those of control plates. Superoxide Dismutase Activity Assays—Cell lysates were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). We first inactivated manganese-containing superoxide dismutase as described previously (43Nebot C. Moutet M. Huet P. Xu J.Z. Yadan J.C. Chaudiere J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and then measured copper and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activities by determining the inhibition of nitrite formation from hydroxylamine in the presence of superoxide anion generator (44Oyanagui Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). SOD1 activities were normalized by protein concentrations and then converted to units using a standard curve of bovine liver SOD1 (Sigma). C-terminal Cytosolic Tail of Ctr1 Is Dispensable for Copper Transport—To determine the roles for the cytosolic C-terminal tail of Ctr1 in copper transport, we examined functionality of Ctr1 with deletion of the C terminus encompassing the last 106 amino acids (Ctr1(300)) (Fig. 1A). Δctr1 cells were not able to grow on the YPEG media containing solely non-fermentable carbon sources because of the defect in copper-requiring cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 1B). However, the expression of either full-length Ctr1 or Ctr1(300) complemented the growth defect of Δctr1 cells on YPEG media and the same media supplemented with BCS copper chelator that reduces bio-available copper (Fig. 1B). No difference in growth was observed between cells expressing either Ctr1 or Ctr1(300), which suggests that the C terminus of Ctr1 does not play a critical role in copper transport followed by its insertion into cytochrome c oxidase. Next, we measured the activities of copper-containing SOD1 in these cells. Although SOD1 activities in Δctr1 cells were hardly detectable, the expression of either Ctr1 or Ctr1(300) dramatically enhanced SOD1 activities (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, cells expressing Ctr1(300) exhibited higher SOD1 activities when compared with cells expressing the full-length Ctr1 (Fig. 1C). To directly monitor Ctr1 and Ctr1(300)-mediated cellular copper acquisition, we measured radioactive 64Cu uptake into cells. Cells were cultured to exponential growth phase in SC media supplemented with copper chelator BCS (10 μm) for 12 h, and then 64Cu (0.1 μm, 64CuCl2) uptake was measured for 5 min. Cellular 64Cu uptake was also higher in cells expressing Ctr1(300) when compared with cells expressing Ctr1 (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data suggest that the C-terminal tail of Ctr1 is dispensable for high affinity uptake and subsequent distribution of copper to copper-requiring proteins. Cells Expressing Ctr1 with a C Terminus Deletion Are Hypersensitive to Copper—Given that Ctr1(300) transports more copper as compared with Ctr1, we hypothesized that the C terminus may play a regulatory role in copper transport. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring cell growth on media containing toxic copper. Δctr1 cells transformed with an empty vector, Ctr1, or Ctr1(300) were cultured to mid-log phase, and then cells (5 μl cells diluted to A600 = 0.1) were spotted on SC media supplemented with excess copper. Indeed, cells expressing Ctr1(300) are extremely sensitive to copper. Although cells expressing empty vector or Ctr1 grow on media containing 2 mm copper, cells expressing Ctr1(300) could not grow even on media containing 0.1 mm copper (Fig. 1E). These cells were also hypersensitive to silver but not other metals tested, including zinc, iron, or cadmium (data not shown). Given that both Cu+ and Ag+ have been proposed as substrates of Ct"
https://openalex.org/W1977078117,"A paradoxical enhancement of the magnitude of the N1 wave of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been described when auditory stimuli are presented at very short (< 400 ms) inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Here, we examined whether this enhancement is specific for the auditory system, or whether it also affects ERPs elicited by stimuli belonging to other sensory modalities.We recorded ERPs elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli in 13 healthy subjects. For each sensory modality, 4800 stimuli were presented. Auditory stimuli consisted in brief tones presented binaurally, and somatosensory stimuli consisted in constant-current electrical pulses applied to the right median nerve. Stimuli were delivered continuously, and the ISI was varied randomly between 100 and 1000 ms. We found that the ISI had a similar effect on both auditory and somatosensory ERPs. In both sensory modalities, ISI had an opposite effect on the magnitude of the N1 and P2 waves: the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory N1 was significantly increased at ISI < or = 200 ms, while the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory P2 was significantly decreased at ISI < or = 200 ms.The observation that both the auditory and the somatosensory N1 are enhanced at short ISIs indicates that this phenomenon reflects a physiological property that is common across sensory systems, rather than, as previously suggested, unique for the auditory system. Two of the hypotheses most frequently put forward to explain this observation, namely (i) the decreased contribution of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to the recorded scalp ERPs and (ii) the decreased contribution of 'latent inhibition', are discussed. Because neither of these two hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the concomitant reduction of the auditory and the somatosensory P2, we propose a third, novel hypothesis, consisting in the modulation of a single neural component contributing to both the N1 and the P2 waves."
https://openalex.org/W2028189923,"Macrophages, key regulators of healing/regeneration processes, strongly infiltrate ischemic tissues from patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). However pro-inflammatory markers correlate with disease progression and risk of amputation, suggesting that modulating macrophage activation state might be beneficial. We previously reported that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is highly expressed in ischemic tissues during CLI in humans. TSP-1 is a matricellular protein that displays well-known angiostatic properties in cancer, and regulates inflammation in vivo and macrophages properties in vitro. We therefore sought to investigate its function in a mouse model of CLI.Using a genetic model of tsp-1(-/-) mice subjected to femoral artery excision, we report that tsp-1(-/-) mice were clinically and histologically protected from necrosis compared to controls. Tissue protection was associated with increased postischemic angiogenesis and muscle regeneration. We next showed that macrophages present in ischemic tissues exhibited distinct phenotypes in tsp-1(-/-) and wt mice. A strong reduction of necrotic myofibers phagocytosis was observed in tsp-1(-/-) mice. We next demonstrated that phagocytosis of muscle cell debris is a potent pro-inflammatory signal for macrophages in vitro. Consistently with these findings, macrophages that infiltrated ischemic tissues exhibited a reduced postischemic pro-inflammatory activation state in tsp-1(-/-) mice, characterized by a reduced Ly-6C expression and a less pro-inflammatory cytokine expression profile. Finally, we showed that monocyte depletion reversed clinical and histological protection from necrosis observed in tsp-1(-/-) mice, thereby demonstrating that macrophages mediated tissue protection in these mice.This study defines targeting postischemic macrophage activation state as a new potential therapeutic approach to protect tissues from necrosis and promote tissue repair during CLI. Furthermore, our data suggest that phagocytosis plays a crucial role in promoting a deleterious intra-tissular pro-inflammatory macrophage activation state during critical injuries. Finally, our results describe TSP-1 as a new relevant physiological target during critical leg ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1984201693,"We identified pyrvinium pamoate, an old anthelminthic medicine, which preferentially inhibits anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells over anchorage-dependent growth (∼10 fold). It was also reported by others to have anti-tumor activity in vivo and selective toxicity against cancer cells under glucose starvation in vitro, but with unknown mechanism. Here, we provide evidence that pyrvinium suppresses the transcriptional activation of GRP78 and GRP94 induced by glucose deprivation or 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor), but not by tunicamycin or A23187. Other UPR pathways induced by glucose starvation, e.g. XBP-1, ATF4, were also found suppressed by pyrvinium. Constitutive expression of GRP78 via transgene partially protected cells from pyrvinium induced cell death under glucose starvation, suggesting that suppression of the UPR is involved in pyrvinium mediated cytotoxicity under glucose starvation. Xenograft experiments showed rather marginal overall anti-tumor activity for pyrvinium as a monotherapy. However, the combination of pyrvinium and Doxorubicin demonstrated significantly enhanced efficacy in vivo, supporting a mechanistic treatment concept based on tumor hypoglycemia and UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2002313343,"Background Coccidiosis is a major global veterinary health problem in intensively reared chickens. It is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Eimeria. Principal Findings A subunit vaccine composed of purified antigens from the gametocytes of Eimeria maxima was used to stimulate the production and transfer of maternal antibodies between breeding hens and their hatchlings. The vaccine was injected into hens twice before they began laying eggs. Immunization had no adverse affects on egg laying or health of the hens and resulted in high antibody levels throughout the life of the hens. Progeny of immunized hens excreted significantly less oocysts of various species of Eimeria in their faeces than chicks from unvaccinated hens. Furthermore, the offspring of vaccinated hens developed stronger natural immunity to Eimeria, so that they were resistant to challenge infection even at 8 weeks of age, well after all maternal antibodies had left their circulation. Field trials were conducted in South Africa, Brazil and Thailand, involving at least 1 million progeny of vaccinated hens and at least 1 million positive control birds (raised on feed containing anticoccidial drugs or immunized with a live vaccine) in each country. Additionally, trials were carried out in Israel involving 60 million progeny of vaccinated hens and 112 million positive control birds. There were no significant differences in growth rate, feed conversion ratios or mortality in the offspring of vaccinated hens compared with the positive control chickens in any of these countries regardless of different management practices, different breeds of chickens or climate. Conclusions These results demonstrate that a vaccine composed of antigens purified from the gametocytes of Eimeria can be used safely and effectively to prevent the deleterious effects of coccidiosis. It is the first subunit vaccine against any protozoan parasite to be successfully applied on a commercial scale."

The FUT10 and FUT11 appeared 830 million years ago, whereas the other α1,3-fucosyltransferases emerged 450 million years ago. FUT10-391 and FUT10-419 were expressed in human embryos, whereas FUT10-479 was cloned from adult brain and was not found in embryos. Recombinant FUT10-419 and FUT10-479 have a type II trans-membrane topology and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a membrane retention signal at their NH2 termini. The FUT10-479 has, in addition, a COOH-ER membrane retention signal. The FUT10-391 is a soluble protein without a trans-membrane domain or ER retention signal that transiently localizes to the Golgi and then is routed to the lysosome. After transfection in COS7 cells, the three FUT10s and at least one FUT11, link α-l-fucose onto conalbumin glycopeptides and biantennary N-glycan acceptors but not onto short lactosaminyl acceptor substrates as do classical monoexonic α1,3-fucosyltransferases. Modifications of the innermost core GlcNAc of the N-glycan, by substitution with ManNAc or with an opened GlcNAc ring or by the addition of an α1,6-fucose, suggest that the FUT10 transfer is performed on the innermost GlcNAc of the core chitobiose. We can exclude α1,3-fucosylation of the two peripheral GlcNAcs linked to the trimannosyl core of the acceptor, because the FUT10 fucosylated biantennary N-glycan product loses both terminal GlcNAc residues after digestion with human placenta α-N-acetylglucosaminidase.

Fucosyltransferases are globular type II trans-membrane Golgi-resident proteins that catalyze the transfer of α-l-fucose from GDP-Fuc onto N- and O-linked glycans, free oligosaccharides, or lipids (1Oriol R.

This suggests that during development, the Lex or CD15 antigen (generated by FUT4 or FUT9) appears earlier than the sialyl-Lex (made by FUT5, FUT6, or FUT7) or the type 1 Lewis structures (Lea and Leb antigens, made by FUT3 or FUT5).

We investigated their subcellular distribution and their fucosyltransferase activity. In addition, we report an α1,3-fucosyltransferase activity for FUT11, with an acceptor pattern similar to FUT10. Fucosyltransferase Assays—Transfected COS7 cells were homogenized on ice in 2% Triton X-100, and protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad Bradford protein microassay. Each fucosyltransferase assay was performed, unless otherwise stated, in a total volume of 65 μl, containing 15 μg of cell protein extract, 65 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.25), 10 mm l-fucose, 7 μm GDP-[14C]l-fucose (29 × 104 dpm/test at 300 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 5 μl/test of a 1 mg/ml solution of acceptor substrate (Table 1). For α1,3-fucosyltransferase assays, we used the conditions already described for the α1,6-fucosyltransferase FUT8 (30Martinez-Duncker I. Michalski J.C. Bauby C. Candelier J.J. Mennesson B. Codogno P. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the activities were compared in the absence or presence of 20 mm MnCl2 as cofactor. The S.D. values of the mean value activities correspond to 10 independent tests for each enzyme. The mean of three independent enzymatic experiments is shown when there is no S.D. For kinetic studies, we used 25 μg of homogenate proteins, 3 μm GDP-[14C]l-fucose (125 × 103 dpm/test at 300 mCi/mmol) plus 125 μm cold GDP-Fuc (kindly provided by Claudine Augé, Paris-XI University of Sciences, Orsay, France).TABLE 1Acceptors used for the α1,3- and α1,6-fucosyltransferase activities Open table in a new tab The reactions were generally continued for 4 h at 37 °C, stopped by the addition of 3 ml of cold water, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a conditioned Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase chromatography cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) attached to a 10-ml syringe (19Cailleau-Thomas A.

Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The retained hydrophobic acceptors were separated from the unreacted GDP-[14C]fucose and its hydrolysis products by washing with 25 ml of H2O and then eluted with two 5-ml fractions of methanol and counted with 10 ml of Instagel-Plus (Hewlett-Packard, Evry, France) in a liquid scintillation β-counter (LS-6500; Beckman). The transfer of [14C]fucose was expressed in pmol/h/mg of protein, unless otherwise stated. Preparation of α1,3- and α1,6-Fucosyltransferase Acceptors—The biotin-labeled natural biantennary-glycoasparagine oligosaccharide acceptor was obtained from a pool of human plasma proteins by Pronase digestion followed by gel purification, desialylation, degalactosylation, and binding to biotin (BGA-biotin), as already described (30Martinez-Duncker I. Michalski J.C. Bauby C. Candelier J.J. Mennesson B. Codogno P. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Synthetic short amphiphilic oligosaccharide acceptors were synthesized as 8-methoxycarbonyl octyl glycosides also called oligosaccharide-O-grease (Ogr). 6The abbreviations used are: Ogr, oligosaccharide-O-grease; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cds, coding sequence; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MYA, millions of years ago; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMD, trans-membrane domain; NAG, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase; contig, group of overlapping clones. These acceptors were kindly provided by Ole Hindsgaul and Monica Palcic (Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark) (Table 1). Biantennary or other N-glycan-related acceptors, synthesized as biotinylated monomeric probes (0987-BM, 0988-BM, 0989-BM, 0990-BM, and chitobiose-BM), were bought from Lectinity Corp. (Moscow, Russia). They are synthesized with an elongated spacer linked to biotin (32Korchagina E.Y. Bovin N.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1992; 18: 283-298PubMed Google Scholar), giving them the possibility of being adsorbed on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges as described for the above mentioned hydrophobic acceptors. The biantennary derivative, where the innermost GlcNAc residue is substituted by an N-acetyl-mannosamine residue (referred as 7OS-ManNAc-BM), was obtained from free 7OS by alkali 2-epimerization followed by 1-amination, chloroacetylation, ammonolysis, and final biotinylation (32Korchagina E.Y. Bovin N.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1992; 18: 283-298PubMed Google Scholar). The “opened” amino-alditol-GlcNAc derivative of biantennary OS (referred as 7OS-amino-alditol-GlcNAc-BM) was obtained by reductive amination of free 7OS with NH3 in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, followed by biotinylation (32Korchagina E.Y. Bovin N.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1992; 18: 283-298PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). Preparation of the α1,6-Fucosylated 0989-BM Acceptor with the FUT8 Fucosyltransferase—The innermost GlcNAc residue of the 0989-BM acceptor (50 μg) was fucosylated in the α1,6-position with the recombinant FUT8 enzyme. The reaction conditions were as follows: 65 μl containing 80 μg of protein from the homogenate of COS7 cells transfected with FUT8 cDNA, 65 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.25), 10 mm l-fucose, 300 μm cold GDP-l-fucose, and 5 μg/test of the 0989-BM acceptor substrate (Table 1). After 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction is more than 97% complete, and the retained Fucα1,6-0989-BM product was purified as described above. The transfer of the [14C]fucose in position 3 of Fucα1,6-0989-BM by the different FUT10 isoforms was performed as described above with a 16-h incubation at 37 °C. The activity was expressed as dpm/reaction. Conalbumin Glycopeptide Acceptor Preparation for Fucosyltransferase Assay—Glycopeptides were prepared from 100 μg of chicken egg white conalbumin (P-7786; Sigma) after digestion with 7 units of Pronase (5 mg/ml; P-5147; Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C, in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, buffer. The reaction was stopped by heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Conalbumin glycopeptides were recovered from the supernatant, after a 10-min centrifugation at 4000 rpm, column-desalted, dried, and then used as a source for potential glycopeptide acceptors for α(1,3)- or α(1,6)-fucosyltransferase activities, as described above. Another fucosylation reaction was performed as described above, using 100 μg of native chicken egg white conalbumin. After terminating the fucosyltransferase incubation, Pronase was added, and the reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting [14C]fucosylglycopeptides (fractions 9-15) were separated from unreacted GDP-[14C]fucose and liberated [14C]fucose (fractions 18-26) on a Biogel P2 column (27 × 1 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 100 mm acetic acid. The resulting [14C]fucosyl-conalbumin glycopeptides were quantitated with a liquid scintillation β-counter. TLC—A fucosyltransferase assay using the homogenate derived from cells transfected with the FUT10-419 construct was performed for 6 or 16 h at 37 °C with the BGA-biotin acceptor. The radioactive oligosaccharide product was purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and eluted with methanol. After lyophilization, two-thirds of the radioactive product was digested overnight at 37 °C with 0.6 units of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) from human placenta (Sigma) in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. Subsequent to clean-up using Sep-Pak cartridges as described above, standards and NAG-treated 14C-fucosylated acceptor molecules were resolved on silica-coated plastic TLC sheets (Merck) developed in n-propyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (3:3:2 for 24 h) (33Moore S.E.H. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12715-12721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive components were visualized by fluorography after spraying the TLC plates with En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Standard oligosaccharides separated under the same conditions were Man5GlcNAc2 (34Saint-Pol A. Codogno P. Moore S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13547-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and 14C-labeled Gal2GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2, which was generated by incubating GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 (Dextra Laboratories) with UDP-[14C]galactose and bovine milk galactosyltransferase (Sigma). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Embryos aged from 50 to 70 days were obtained from legal abortions and stored at -80 °C as already described (19Cailleau-Thomas A. Couillin P. Candelier J.J. Balanzino L. Mennesson B. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Contaminating DNA was removed by digestion with RNase-free DNase I (10 units/μg of RNA from Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by 15 min of inactivation at 70 °C and purification of the RNA by phenol/chloroform extraction. Embryonic poly(A)+ mRNAs were double purified using oligo(dT)-cellulose (type 3; Sigma) chromatography. Poly(A)+ RNAs (4 μg/lane) were denatured and fractionated with 1.2% phosphate-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and immobilized by baking at 80 °C for 2 h. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed for 16 h at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× PE, 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10% dextran sulfate with the cds-FUT10 probe of 350 bp, obtained by PCR using primers sense F10-8s and antisense F10-4as (Table 2). The blots were first washed at low stringency: 2 × 15 min (in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 42 °C, followed by a single wash of 15 min (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C and autoradiographed. A last 15 min wash in (0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 60 °C was performed, and another autoradiography was made. The films were developed after 3 days at -80 °C.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide primer sequences used in this study for amplifications and sequencingPrimersas, sense; as, antisense.Sequence 5′-3′PositionsbEx, exon.F10-1s5′-CATGCTGCTTCCTCTCGATGCCAAGC-3′Ex 2, 19-44F10-8s5′-GTTCTTCCATGTGAAGTTGTCTCGGG-3′Ex 2, 180-205F10-479s5′-GTTAGCCCTCTGTCAGTCACCCAGG-3′Ex 2, 239-263F10-391s5′-TAGAAGGTCATGGTTGAGCTGGG-3′Ex 4, 55-60/Ex 5, 1-17F10-4as5′-GAGCATAATGGGGTAGCTGTCCAATTCC-3′Ex 5, 147-174F10-7s5′-ATCCAGCCTCTATGGATGCCGATGGC-3′Ex 6, 397-422F10-as25′-GAATCTATAGCTAGATCGTCTCCCTCC-3′Ex 6, 505-528F10-GFPas5′-GAGATGGCCAGCCTGCTGGCTCT-3′Ex 6, 860-882F10-12as5′-GCAGGAGAGCAGAGAACATCAAGATGG-3′Ex 6, 860-894F10-13as5′-CACTGATGAGGTGGCAACAACAGAAGG-3′Ex 6, 907-933F10-KIGFPas5′-TTCGGTCCTTGAATACTAGGCCCC-3′Ex 7, 206-230F11-ints5′-CGCCACACTCCGGTAGACTCC-3′Ex 1, 740-753/Ex 2, 1-7F11-intas5′-GAGTGATTGTTCGGCATCCAGTCC-3′Ex 2, 226-249a s, sense; as, antisense.b Ex, exon. Open table in a new tab Construction of cDNA Libraries—Poly(A)+ mRNAs (1 μg) from a single 50-day embryo and from an adult brain were used to initiate the first strand cDNA synthesis. They were reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 90 min, using the oligo(dT)-cDNA synthesis primer (52-mer) and 200 units of the Superscript-II RNase H-reverse transcriptase from the Superscript first strand cDNA synthesis system kit (Invitrogen). The embryonic and adult cDNA libraries were stored at -20 °C until used. The PCRs were carried out with primers specific for FUT10 (Table 2), the Klentaq mixture (Clontech), and 1 μl of cDNA templates from the 50-day embryo or from adult brain cDNA libraries for the first PCR and 1 μl of the first PCR product diluted 1:10 for the second PCR. The same amplification program with the Advantage cDNA amplification kit mix (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used. All PCRs were performed in 50 μl, with 1× Klentaq buffer, a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, 1 unit of Klentaq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 mm dNTP with the touch-down-RACE program: initial denaturation 94 °C for 90 s, followed by five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 4 min, and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 4 min. Cloning of the FUT10 Transcripts—Four FUT10 cDNA isoforms (FUT10-357, FUT10-391, FUT10-419, and FUT10-479) were amplified by a double PCR using the embryo and the adult cDNA libraries as templates. The FUT10-357 was a truncated variant of FUT10-391, lacking the conserved motifs I and II. It was devoid of enzyme activity and was not further analyzed. The primer associations F10-1s and F10-13as or F10-1s and F10-as2 were used for the first PCR, and distinct combinations of nested primers as F10-8s and F10-12as or F10-8s and F10-as2 were used for the second PCR (Table 2). With these two nested primer combinations, we obtained a broad PCR product of 1400 bp in the embryo cDNA with F10-8s and F10-12as and a product of 1800 bp from the adult cDNA library, with F10-8s and F10-as2 primers. These final PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the TA cloning vector PCR3.1 (Eukaryotic TA cloning kit; Invitrogen), and 20 plasmid clones were PCR-selected from each positive ligation and sequenced. To generate the FUT10-GFP-tagged transcripts, we amplified the three selected FUT10 constructs: FUT10-391 with primers F10-391s and F10-GFPas, FUT10-419 with primers F10-8s and F10-GFPas, and FUT10-479 with primers F10-479s and F10-K1GFPas, in the presence of the high fidelity Hotstart DNA polymerase (Accuprime-pFx DNA polymerase; Invitrogen). The PCR products were gel-purified and inserted into the mammalian pcDNA3.1-GFP vector (TOPO-CT-GFP-cloning kit; Invitrogen). The resulting GFP-COOH-tagged plasmids were selected by PCR, sequenced, and called FUT10-391-GFP, FUT10-419-GFP, and FUT10-479-GFP. Isolation of FUT11 cDNA Clones—The IMAGE clone 40005868 (BC100994) in a pCR-Blunt-TOPO vector encoding for a 476-amino acid protein and the IMAGE clone 5271548 (BC036037) in a pBluescriptR vector, encoding for a 492-amino acid protein, were obtained from Gene-service Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). The IMAGE clones were digested with EcoRI (NEB-Biolabs, Ozyme, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France). Two DNA fragments of 1730 and 1660 bp, corresponding to FUT11-476 and FUT11-492 cDNA, respectively, were purified and subcloned into the PCR3.1-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The presence of the inserts was verified by PCR with Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Euromedex, Strasbourg, France) and the internal primers F11-ints and F11-intas (Table 2). The correct orientation of FUT11-476 and FUT11-492 plasmids was checked with BamHI and EcoRI. DNA Sequencing—The different FUT10, FUT11, and pcDNA3.1-FUT10-GFP expression vectors were sequenced in both directions (Biofidal SARL, Vaulx-en-Velin, France). All of the full-length isoform constructs devoid of PCR errors were selected and used for transfection analysis. Transient Expression of FUT10, FUT11, and GFP-tagged-FUT10 cDNA Constructs in COS7 Cells—cDNA transcripts were inserted into PCR3.1 (TA-cloning System; Invitrogen) and transiently transfected into COS7 cells (20 μg of plasmid) with DEAE-dextran (19Cailleau-Thomas A. Couillin P. Candelier J.J. Balanzino L. Mennesson B. Oriol R. Mollicone R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 12, 18, 24, or 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for fucosyltransferase assays or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescent Localization of the GFP-tagged FUT10 Fusion Proteins—2 × 105 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 35-mm cell culture Petri dishes 24 h before transfection. Five μg of the GFP-tagged cDNA constructs were transfected into COS7 cells. After 12, 18, 24, or 48 h of growth, they were washed with PBS and then fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To quench residual paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated for 20 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Thereafter, they were permeabilized with 0.075% saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 15 min, followed by 1 h of incubation with primary antibodies at room temperature. The GFP-tagged FUT10 recombinant proteins were visualized with a Leica DMR epifluorescence microscope, with a PLAN-APO ×63/1.32-0.6 oil objective lens and an HC-PLAN ×10/25 ocular lens (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were captured with a LEI-750 CE digital camera and LIDA volume 54 Leica software and further processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Double immunofluorescence experiments were conducted using a Golgi-specific mouse monoclonal anti-giantin antibody kindly given by Hans-Peter Hauri (35Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (1:1000 in PBS plus 1% BSA) or an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:200 in PBS plus 1% BSA; StressGen, Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) or the lysosomal specific mouse monoclonal anti-Lamp-1 (BB6) antibody, kindly given by Sven Carlsson (1:1000 in PBS plus 1% BSA), and the GFP-tagged-FUT10 recombinant protein. After washing the cells three times in PBS plus 0.1% BSA, the anti-giantin and the anti-Lamp-1 antibodies were revealed with conjugated anti-mouse Ig-Cya3 red fluorochrome, diluted 1:200 (Jackson Laboratories, L'Arbresle, France), and the anti-calnexin antibody with anti-rabbit Ig-Cya3, diluted 1:200 (Jackson Laboratories). The secondary labeled antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by washing three times in PBS. The coverslips with the labeled cells were mounted on slides with Mowiol and observed using a Leica DMR epifluorescence microscope.

https://openalex.org/W1965166307,"Background Cigarette smoking adversely affects endochondral ossification during the course of skeletal growth. Among a plethora of cigarette chemicals, nicotine is one of the primary candidate compounds responsible for the cause of smoking-induced delayed skeletal growth. However, the possible mechanism of delayed skeletal growth caused by nicotine remains unclarified. In the last decade, localization of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a specific receptor of nicotine, has been widely detected in non-excitable cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that nicotine affect growth plate chondrocytes directly and specifically through nAChR to delay skeletal growth. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the effect of nicotine on human growth plate chondrocytes, a major component of endochondral ossification. The chondrocytes were derived from extra human fingers. Nicotine inhibited matrix synthesis and hypertrophic differentiation in human growth plate chondrocytes in suspension culture in a concentration-dependent manner. Both human and murine growth plate chondrocytes expressed alpha7 nAChR, which constitutes functional homopentameric receptors. Methyllycaconitine (MLA), a specific antagonist of alpha7 nAChR, reversed the inhibition of matrix synthesis and functional calcium signal by nicotine in human growth plate chondrocytes in vitro. To study the effect of nicotine on growth plate in vivo, ovulation-controlled pregnant alpha7 nAChR +/− mice were given drinking water with or without nicotine during pregnancy, and skeletal growth of their fetuses was observed. Maternal nicotine exposure resulted in delayed skeletal growth of alpha7 nAChR +/+ fetuses but not in alpha7 nAChR −/− fetuses, implying that skeletal growth retardation by nicotine is specifically mediated via fetal alpha7 nAChR. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that nicotine, from cigarette smoking, acts directly on growth plate chondrocytes to decrease matrix synthesis, suppress hypertrophic differentiation via alpha7 nAChR, leading to delayed skeletal growth."
https://openalex.org/W1985501875,"The humoral immune response critically relies on the secondary diversification of antibodies. This diversification takes places through somatic remodelling of the antibody genes by two molecular mechanisms, Class Switch Recombination (CSR) and Somatic Hypermutation (SHM). The enzyme Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) initiates both SHM and CSR by deaminating cytosine residues on the DNA of immunoglobulin genes. While crucial for immunity, AID-catalysed deamination is also the triggering event for the generation of lymphomagenic chromosome translocations. To address whether restricting the levels of AID expression in vivo contributes to the regulation of its function, we analysed mice harbouring a single copy of the AID gene (AID(+/-)). AID(+/-) mice express roughly 50% of normal AID levels, and display a mild hyperplasia, reminiscent of AID deficient mice and humans. Moreover, we found that AID(+/-) cells have an impaired competence for CSR and SHM, which indicates that AID gene dose is limiting for its physiologic function. We next evaluated the impact of AID reduction in AID(+/-) mice on the generation of chromosome translocations. Our results show that the frequency of AID-promoted c-myc/IgH translocations is reduced in AID(+/-) mice, both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, AID is haploinsufficient for antibody diversification and chromosome translocations. These findings suggest that limiting the physiologic levels of AID expression can be a regulatory mechanism that ensures an optimal balance between immune proficiency and genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1965961585,"Avian influenza virus (H5N1) has caused serious infections in human beings. This virus has the potential to emerge as a pandemic threat in humans. Effective vaccines against H5N1 virus are needed. A recombinant Bombyx mori baculovirus, Bmg64HA, was constructed for the expression of HA protein of H5N1 influenza virus displaying on the viral envelope surface. The HA protein accounted for approximately 3% of the total viral proteins in silkworm pupae infected with the recombinant virus. Using a series of separation and purification methods, pure Bmgp64HA virus was isolated from these silkworm pupae bioreactors. Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was used for an H5N1 influenza vaccine. Immunization with this vaccine at doses of 2 mg/kg and 0.67 mg/kg was carried out to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies, which protected monkeys against influenza virus infection. At these doses, the vaccine induced 1:40 antibody titers in 50% and 67% of the monkeys, respectively. The results of safety evaluation indicated that the vaccine did not cause any toxicity at the dosage as large as 3.2 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys and 1.6 mg/kg in mice. The results of dose safety evaluation of vaccine indicated that the safe dose of the vaccine were higher than 0.375 mg/kg in rats and 3.2 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. Our work showed the vaccine may be a candidate for a highly effective, cheap, and safe influenza vaccine for use in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2001097170,"Calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is required for LTP and experience-dependent potentiation in the barrel cortex. Here, we find that whisker deprivation increases LTP in the layer IV to II/III pathway and that PKA antagonists block the additional LTP. No LTP was seen in undeprived CaMKII-T286A mice, but whisker deprivation again unmasked PKA-sensitive LTP. Infusion of a PKA agonist potentiated EPSPs in deprived wild-types and deprived CaMKII-T286A point mutants but not in undeprived animals of either genotype. The PKA-dependent potentiation mechanism was not present in GluR1 knockouts. Infusion of a PKA antagonist caused depression of EPSPs in undeprived but not deprived cortex. LTD was occluded by whisker deprivation and blocked by PKA manipulation, but not blocked by cannabinoid antagonists. NMDA receptor currents were unaffected by sensory deprivation. These results suggest that sensory deprivation causes synaptic depression by reversing a PKA-dependent process that may act via GluR1."
https://openalex.org/W2113693365,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Activation of MAP kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in advanced and androgen-independent prostate cancers, although formal genetic proof has been lacking. In the course of modeling malignant melanoma in a tyrosinase promoter transgenic system, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of invasive prostate cancers, whereby an activating mutation of BRAF(V600E)--a mutation found in approximately 10% of human prostate tumors--was targeted to the epithelial compartment of the prostate gland on the background of Ink4a/Arf deficiency. These GEM mice developed prostate gland hyperplasia with progression to rapidly growing invasive adenocarcinoma without evidence of AKT activation, providing genetic proof that activation of MAP kinase signaling is sufficient to drive prostate tumorigenesis. Importantly, genetic extinction of BRAF(V600E) in established prostate tumors did not lead to tumor regression, indicating that while sufficient to initiate development of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma, BRAF(V600E) is not required for its maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1969791248,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three nevirapine-based antiretroviral treatments for adult antiretroviral-naïve Chinese patients with HIV-1 infection.This was a prospective, multicenter study. 198 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 positive subjects with CD4 lymphocyte counts between 100/ul and 350/ul and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels more than 500 copies/ml were randomized to start three NVP-based antiretroviral treatments: group A, NVP+AZT+ddI; group B, NVP+3TC+d4T; group C, NVP+AZT+3TC. Viral responses, immunologic responses, adverse events and drug resistance were monitored at baseline and the end of week 4, 12, 24, 36, 52. Viralogical response and immunological response were also compared in different strata of baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations. At baseline, the plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.44+/-0.68, 4.52+/-0.71 and 4.41+/-0.63 lg copies/ml in group A, B and C respectively (p = 0.628). At the end of the study, the plasma viral load reached 2.54+/-1.11, 1.89+/-0.46 and 1.92+/-0.58 lg copies/ml in group A, B and C respectively (p<0.001). At week 52, suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA to less than 50 copies/ml was achieved in more patients in group B and C than in group A (68.2%, 69% vs. 39.7%; p<0.001). In planned subgroup analyses, the decrease of viral response rate was seen in group A when CD4 cell count >200/ul (subgroup H). But in subgroup L, viral response rate of three groups has no significant statistic difference. There were no statistically significant differences among three groups in immunological response within any of the CD4 or pVL strata. 3 out of 193 patients with available genotype at baseline showed primary drug resistant. Of 26 patients with virologic failure, 17 patients showed secondary drug resistant, 16 subjects in group A and 1 subject in group B. Logistic regression analysis indicated that presence of hepatotoxicity was associated with HCV-Ab positive (OR = 2.096, 95%CI: 1.106-3.973, P = 0.023) and higher CD4 baseline (CD4 count >250/ul) (OR = 2.096, 95%CI: 1.07-4.107, P = 0.031).Our findings strongly support the use of 3TC+d4T and 3TC+AZT as the nucleoside analogue combination in NVP-based antiretroviral therapy. The regimen of AZT+ddI+NVP produced poor virological response especially in the stratum of CD4 count more than 200/ul. More patients showed secondary drug resistant in this arm too. Patients with HCV-Ab+ and CD4 count >250/ul appear to have significantly high risk of hepatoxicity.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00618176."
https://openalex.org/W2026231134,"Ceramidase (CDase; EC 3.5.1.23) hydrolyzes ceramide to generate sphingosine and fatty acid. The enzyme plays a regulatory role in a variety of physiological events in eukaryotes and also functions as an exotoxin in particular bacteria. The crystal structures of neutral CDase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaCD) in the C2-ceramide-bound and -unbound forms were determined at 2.2 and 1.4 A resolutions, respectively. PaCD consists of two domains, and the Zn(2+)- and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-binding sites are found within the center of the N-terminal domain and the interface between the domains, respectively. The structural comparison between the C2-ceramide-bound and unbound forms revealed an open-closed conformational change occurring to loop I upon binding of C2-ceramide. In the closed state, this loop sits above the Zn(2+) coordination site and over the opening to the substrate binding site. Mutational analyses of residues surrounding the Zn(2+) of PaCD and rat neutral CDase revealed that the cleavage or creation of the N-acyl linkage of ceramide follows a similar mechanism as observed for the Zn(2+)-dependent carboxypeptidases. The results provide an understanding of the molecular mechanism of hydrolysis and synthesis of ceramide by the enzyme. Furthermore, insights into the actions of PaCD and eukaryotic neutral CDases as an exotoxin and mediators of sphingolipid signaling are also revealed, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2024648214,"Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor is a common occurrence in human prostate cancer, particularly in advanced disease. In keeping with its role as a pivotal upstream regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, experimentally-induced deletion of Pten in the murine prostate invariably results in neoplasia. However, and unlike humans where prostate tumorigenesis likely evolves over decades, disease progression in the constitutively Pten deficient mouse prostate is relatively rapid, culminating in invasive cancer within several weeks post-puberty. Given that the prostate undergoes rapid androgen-dependent growth at puberty, and that Pten excisions during this time might be especially tumorigenic, we hypothesized that delaying prostate-specific Pten deletions until immediately after puberty might alter the pace of tumorigenesis. To this end we generated mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgene enabling temporal control over prostate-specific gene alterations. This line was then interbred with mice carrying floxed Pten alleles. Despite evidence of increased Akt/mTOR/S6K axis activity at early time points in Pten-deficient epithelial cells, excisions induced in the post-pubertal (6 wk-old) prostate yielded gradual acquisition of a range of lesions. These progressed from pre-malignant changes (nuclear atypia, focal hyperplasia) and low grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at 16–20 wks post-tamoxifen exposure, to overtly malignant lesions by ∼1 yr of age, characterized by high-grade PIN and microinvasive carcinoma. In contrast, when Pten excisions were triggered in the pre-pubertal (2 week-old) prostate, neoplasia evolved over a more abbreviated time-frame, with a spectrum of premalignant lesions, as well as overt PIN and microinvasive carcinoma by 10–12 wks post-tamoxifen exposure. These results indicate that the developmental stage at which Pten deletions are induced dictates the pace of PIN development."
https://openalex.org/W2111487603,"Although vaccines are important in preventing viral infections by inducing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), HIV-1 has proven to be a difficult target and escapes humoral immunity through various mechanisms. We sought to test whether HIV-1 Env mimics may serve as immunogens.Using random peptide phage display libraries, we identified the epitopes recognized by polyclonal antibodies of a rhesus monkey that had developed high-titer, broadly reactive nAbs after infection with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) encoding env of a recently transmitted HIV-1 clade C (HIV-C). Phage peptide inserts were analyzed for conformational and linear homology using computational analysis; some peptides mimicked various domains of the original HIV-C Env, such as conformational V3 loop epitopes and the conserved linear region of the gp120 C-terminus. Next, we devised a novel prime/boost strategy to test the immunogenicity of such phage-displayed peptides and primed mice only once with HIV-C gp160 DNA followed by boosting with mixtures of recombinant phages.This strategy, which was designed to focus the immune system on a few Env epitopes (immunofocusing), not only induced HIV-C gp160 binding antibodies and cross-clade nAbs, but also linked a conserved HIV Env region for the first time to the induction of nAbs: the C-terminus of gp120. The identification of conserved antigen mimics may lead to novel immunogens capable of inducing broadly reactive nAbs."
https://openalex.org/W2084175517,"Viral matrix (M) proteins bind the nucleoprotein core (nucleocapsid) to host membranes during the process of virus assembly by budding. Previous studies using truncated M proteins had implicated the N-terminal 50 amino acids of the vesicular stomatitis virus M protein in binding both membranes and nucleocapsids and a sequence from amino acids 75-106 as an additional membrane binding region. Structure-based mutations were introduced into these two regions, and their effects on membrane association and incorporation into nucleocapsid-M protein complexes were determined using quantitative assays. The results confirmed that the N terminus of M protein is involved in association with plasma membranes as well as nucleocapsids, although these two activities were differentially affected by individual mutations. Mutations in the 75-106 region affected incorporation into nucleocapsid-M complexes but had only minor effects on association with membranes. The ability of site-specific mutant M proteins to complement growth of temperature-sensitive M mutant virus did not correlate well with the ability to associate with membranes or nucleocapsids, suggesting that complementation involves an additional activity of M protein. Mutants with similar abilities to associate with membranes and nucleocapsids but differing in complementation activity were incorporated into infectious cDNA clones. Infectious virus was repeatedly recovered containing mutant M proteins capable of complementation but was never recovered with mutant M proteins that lacked complementation activity, providing further evidence for a separate activity of M protein that is essential for virus replication.

Most viruses that have a membrane or envelope as part of their structure acquire their envelopes by budding from the plasma membrane of the host cell. For budding to occur, the nucleoprotein core of the virus (nucleocapsid) must interact with the cytoplasmic surface of the host membrane. For many viruses this interaction is mediated by a matrix (M) 2The abbreviations used are: M, matrix; aa, amino acid; NCM, nucleocapsid-M protein complex; pfu, plaque-forming units; rwt, recombinant wild-type; VLP, virus-like particle; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; VV-T7, vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase; tsM, temperature-sensitive M protein. protein that binds to both the nucleocapsid and the host membrane (1Pornillos O.

Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity in the functions of viral M proteins, there is little structural or sequence similarity among the M proteins of different virus families (3Timmins J. Ruigrok R.W. Weissenhorn W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 233: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the relationship of structure to function must be undertaken for individual M proteins before the general principles involved in virus budding can be understood. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine sequences in the M protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) involved in binding to membranes and nucleocapsids. VSV is the prototype member of the Rhabdoviridae family and has been widely studied to determine mechanisms involved in virus budding (2Jayakar H.R. Jeetendra E. Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The core of the virus contains an ∼11-kilobase negative-stranded RNA genome covered by 1300 copies of a single nucleocapsid protein (4Thomas D. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 598-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleocapsid also contains lesser amounts of two proteins, P and L, which constitute the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The envelope contains a single species of transmembrane glycoprotein (G protein) that mediates virus attachment and entry into host cells. The virion contains ∼2000 copies of the M protein (4Thomas D. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 598-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which binds the nucleocapsid to the envelope and condenses the nucleocapsid into a tightly coiled helical nucleocapsid-M protein (NCM) complex that gives the virion its bullet-like shape (5Barge A.

In cells infected with VSV and in transfected cells that express M protein in the absence of other VSV components, M protein is present both in a soluble form and bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the host plasma membrane (9Chong L.D.

Virol. 1994; 68: 7386-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies, affinity labeling, and membrane reconstitution experiments have suggested that a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions mediate M protein binding to membranes by binding acidic phospholipids on the inner surface of the host plasma membrane (for review, see Ref. 19Lenard J. Virology. 1996; 216: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Binding of M protein to nucleocapsids is less well understood than its binding to membranes. Most of the M protein in isolated NCM complexes is bound in a rapidly reversible equilibrium (20Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, M protein does not bind to nucleocapsids from which all of the M protein has been dissociated or to intracellular nucleocapsids that have never been assembled with M protein (11Flood E.A. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1999; 261: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggests that binding of M protein to nucleocapsids in infected cells must be initiated in a separate step, after which most of the M protein is recruited into the NCM complex through the reversible binding step. M protein does not have separately folded domains that mediate binding to membranes versus nucleocapsids. The 229-amino acid (aa) M protein contains a positively charged N terminus (aa 1-50) that is highly exposed to proteolysis. The remainder of M protein (aa 51-229) is compactly folded to form a protease-resistant core (16Ogden J.R. Pal R. Wagner R.R. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gaudier M.

The ability to obtain crystals of M protein required proteolytic removal of both the N-terminal sequence (aa 1-47) and a hydrophobic sequence (aa 121-124) to prevent M protein self-association (21Gaudier M. Gaudin Y. Knossow M. Virology. 2001; 288: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Gaudier M. Gaudin Y. Knossow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2886-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, the resulting structure showed a single-domain fold for the crystallized portion of M. In the present study we focused on two regions of the M protein structure that had been suggested to be involved in binding to either membranes or nucleocapsids; 1) previous data had implicated the N-terminal sequence in binding to both nucleocapsids and membranes (9Chong L.D. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Connor J.H. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3701-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Ogden J.R.

Virol. 1990; 64: 3486-3491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) deletion mutagenesis studies had implicated an additional region from aa 75-106 in membrane binding (16Ogden J.R. Pal R. Wagner R.R. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, M protein sequence substitutions were made using a scanning approach in the N-terminal sequence, and substitutions were based on the crystal structure in the 75-106-aa region. These mutants were used to determine the specific amino acids involved in these interactions. The results confirm that the N terminus of M protein is involved in association with plasma membranes as well as nucleocapsids, although these two activities are differentially affected by individual mutations. Mutations in the 75-106-aa region affected incorporation into NCM complexes but had only minor effects on association with membranes. Furthermore, the ability of mutant M proteins to function in the context of virus infection suggested that a new activity of M protein that is separate from its ability to associate with membranes or NCM complexes is critical for virus assembly. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The M gene of the wild-type VSV was subcloned into pET21d vector as described (10Connor J.H. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3701-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A glycine at position 2 that was changed during cloning was mutagenized back to wild-type serine using the QuikChange II XL (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutations described in Fig. 1 were made using the corrected pET21d-M protein expressing plasmid using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. The M protein sequences were verified by automated sequence analysis. BHK cells were infected with vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase (VV-T7) at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell for 1 h and then transiently transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) with empty vector or with the M protein expression plasmid under the control of the T7 promoter for the times indicated in each of the figures (10Connor J.H. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3701-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling and Confocal Microscopy—BHK cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 105 cells/well in 2-well chamber slides (Nunc). After 24 h the cells were mock-infected, infected with a multiplicity of infection of 20 pfu/cell of VSV to ensure that cells were synchronously infected, or infected with VV-T7 and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutant M protein. After 4 h (infection) or 8 h (transfection), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (26Swinteck B.D. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5536-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cellular DNA was labeled with 0.5 μm topro-3-iodide (Invitrogen). Confocal images of labeled cells were used to analyze the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic labeling with laser-scanning microscope 5.0 software (Zeiss). Intersecting lines in the shape of an X were placed through each cell. Rhodamine labeling pixel intensity plots were made for each cross-section. The peak pixel intensity of the plasma membrane was collected at the four points where the X crossed the plasma membrane. Two cytoplasmic pixel intensity readings were collected at the 1/3 and the 2/3 distance between each plasma membrane reading and the nucleus. To avoid bias in selection of which points to quantify, the center of the X was placed in the center of the nucleus without rotating the original image. Metabolic Labeling and Determination of M Protein Turnover—BHK cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Incorporated) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cells were infected with VV-T7 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell and then 60 min of post-infection, and the cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of the appropriate pET21d-M plasmid. To determine total levels of M protein expression, cells were radiolabeled with media containing [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml) for 16 h. M protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described (27Kopecky S.A. Willingham M.C. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12169-12181Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), or cell lysates were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. No differences among mutant M proteins in immunoprecipitation efficiency were noted in these experiments. For analysis of M protein turnover cells were allowed to express M protein for 5 h. The cells were starved for methionine for 10 min and then pulsed with methionine-deficient medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for 30 min. The radioactive medium was replaced with nonradioactive medium, and at 0, 2, and 4 h post-labeling, the medium was removed, and M protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates as described (27Kopecky S.A. Willingham M.C. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12169-12181Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Membrane Flotation Assay—Analysis of M protein association with membranes by flotation in sucrose gradients was performed as described (10Connor J.H. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3701-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells at a density of 1 × 107 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were infected with VV-T7, and then 60 min post-infection, the cells were transfected with 15 μg of the appropriate pET21d-M plasmid. At 5 h post-transfection, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and then lysed in hypotonic buffer. Cell lysates were adjusted to 60% sucrose and were fractionated on a 60-40-10% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the top, and M protein was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Virus-like Particle (VLP) Release Assay—BHK cells were infected with VV-T7, transfected with the appropriate M plasmid, and radiolabeled with media containing [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml) for 16 h. The VLP-containing supernatants were collected, placed over a 15% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged to pellet the VLPs as described (6Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Kaptur P.E. Grant K.W. Jerome W.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). VLPs and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis. NCM Complex Exchange Assay—Radiolabeled wild-type or mutant M protein was synthesized by in vitro translation, and the ability to exchange with non-radiolabeled M protein in virion NCM complexes was assayed as described (11Flood E.A. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1999; 261: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled wild-type or mutant M protein was added to purified virions in buffer containing 120 mm NaCl. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% to solubilize the viral envelope. This concentration was found to be as effective as the 0.5% Triton X-100 used previously. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature to allow M protein exchange. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g using a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis. Complementation of Temperature-sensitive M Protein (tsM) Mutant Virus—The ability of plasmid-derived wild-type and mutant M protein to complement growth of tsO23 virus was assayed as described (6Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Kaptur P.E. Grant K.W. Jerome W.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells were infected with VV-T7 virus and transfected with plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutant M protein under control of the T7 promoter (1.5 μg/106 cells). Cells were coinfected with tsO23 virus at 39 °C, and the yields of infectious tsO23 virus progeny were determined by plaque assay at 32 °C. Incorporation of M Protein Mutations into Recombinant Viruses—M protein mutations were introduced into plasmids containing a full-length infectious cDNA clone of VSV, and recombinant viruses were isolated as described (27Kopecky S.A. Willingham M.C. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12169-12181Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis Strategy—Previous studies of VSV matrix function have used either protease-treated M protein or M protein deletion mutants to map the sequences involved in binding to nucleocapsids or membranes. In the studies reported here substitution mutagenesis was used to fine-map the putative binding sites more precisely while reducing the probability that the effects of mutation were due to misfolding (Fig. 1A). Our mutagenesis strategies were based on what was known from the crystal structure. Because the crystal structure did not contain the N terminus, amino acids starting after the initiator methionine were replaced in blocks of six aa with the hexamer sequence Asn, Ala, Ala, Ile, Arg, Ser (NAAIRS). The NAAIRS sequence has the ability to form different secondary structures, either an α-helix or a β-sheet, depending on the protein environment in which it resides (28Wilson I.A. Haft D.H. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Lerner R.A. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5255-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The NAAIRS flexibility in secondary structure has been used in mutational analysis in place of traditional alanine scanning to reduce the probability of mutation-based misfolding (29Armbruster B.N. Banik S.S. Guo C. Smith A.C. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The NAAIRS mutants are referred to by their location in the amino acid sequence; for example, 2-7NAAIRS is 2-7, etc. The sequence PPPY (aa 24-27) was not mutated, as it is known to mediate the late-budding function of M protein that results in virus release (2Jayakar H.R. Jeetendra E. Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutations at the second proposed plasma membrane binding site (aa 75-106) were based on the x-ray crystal structure of M protein. The mutations were targeted to change the side chains of surface-exposed amino acids to Ala in the proposed binding region. These mutants are referred to by the aa which were substituted with Ala (RRT, SD, HDH, YIG, and KR). Mutations in the 75-106 Region of M Protein, HDH, YIG, and KR, Cause Increased Turnover of M Protein—M protein mutants were analyzed for their levels of expression in transfected cells using the vaccinia virus T7 polymerase expression system, as this is the only transfection system in mammalian cells that we have found to express levels of M protein comparable with those in VSV-infected cells (6Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Kaptur P.E. Grant K.W. Jerome W.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Black B.L. Rhodes R.B. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Swinteck B.D. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5536-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Brown E.L. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3985-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of the mutant M proteins were expressed at the same levels as wild-type M protein, as determined by radiolabeling for 16 h and analysis of cell lysates by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging, except for three of the mutants containing substitutions in the 75-106 region, HDH, YIG, and KR, which were expressed at levels 10-30% that of wild-type M protein (not shown). Pulse-chase experiments were used to determine whether the lower level of expression was due to increased turnover of the mutant M proteins. BHK cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (VV-T7) and then were transfected with plasmids expressing the mutant M protein or wild-type M protein for 5 h. Cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine, then incubated in non-radiolabeled media for 0, 2, and 4 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-M protein antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorescence imaging. The only mutant M proteins that had turnover rates that were more than 2-fold that of wild type were the HDH, YIG, and KR mutants, as shown in Fig. 1B. The high turnover rates of these mutants may be due to misfolding. As shown below, these mutant M proteins do retain some ability to associate with membranes or nucleocapsids despite their high turnover. We were particularly interested in the YIG mutation because of the high degree of conservation of Tyr-95 and Gly-97 among M proteins of members of the Rhabdoviridae family (supplemental Fig. 1). Individual alanine substitutions were generated at positions 95, 96, and 97 (Y95A, I96A, and G97A mutants) as well as double substitutions at these positions. The levels of expression of these mutant M proteins were determined by labeling transfected cells continuously with [35S]methionine for 16 h followed by immunoprecipitation as above (Fig. 1C). Only the substitution of the nonconserved Ile-96 resulted in expression comparable with wild-type M protein, whereas substitution of Tyr-95 or Gly-97 resulted in expression comparable with the original YIG mutant. M Protein Mutants Have Altered Association with Host Plasma Membranes Compared with Wild-type M Protein—The association with host plasma membranes of wild-type and mutant M proteins was determined in transfected cells by three different experimental approaches. The first was quantitative analysis of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images. We have recently shown that this approach is highly effective in detecting quantitative differences in plasma membrane association of M protein provided that a sufficiently large number of cells are analyzed (26Swinteck B.D. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5536-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The second approach was flotation analysis of radiolabeled cellular membranes and cytosol. This approach has been used for many years to determine the membrane association of M protein (9Chong L.D. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Connor J.H. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3701-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Flood E.A. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1999; 261: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Flood E.A. McKenzie M.O. Lyles D.S. Virology. 2000; 278: 520-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Knipe D.M.

Virol. 1994; 68: 7386-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third approach was analysis of release of VLPs (6Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Kaptur P.E. Grant K.W. Jerome W.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Li Y. Luo L. Schubert M. Wagner R.R. Kang C.Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4415-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When M protein is expressed in transfected cells in the absence of other viral components, association with the plasma membrane results in release of membrane vesicles referred to as VLPs (6Lyles D.S. McKenzie M.O. Kaptur P.E. Grant K.W. Jerome W.G. Virology. 1996; 217: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Li Y. Luo L. Schubert M. Wagner R.R. Kang C.Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4415-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is because of the association of the PPPY sequence (aa 24-27) with host Nedd4-like proteins, which mediate the late-budding function of M protein that results in virus release (2Jayakar H.R. Jeetendra E. Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, the VLP release assay is a functional assay that requires both association of M protein with plasma membranes and association of the PPPY sequence of M protein with host proteins (2Jayakar H.R. Jeetendra E. Whitt M.A. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy analysis, BHK cells were infected with VV-T7 followed by transfection with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant M protein for 4 h. The deletion mutant, Δ4-21 (24Black B.L. Rhodes R.B. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is missing the positively charged N terminus of M protein, was used as a negative control for membrane association. The cells were fixed, permeabilized with saponin, and immunolabeled with primary anti-M protein antibody and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were labeled with TO-PRO-3-iodide (TO-PRO) to identify the position of the cell nucleus. In addition, TO-PRO also labeled DNA-containing vaccinia virus factories present in the cytoplasm. Confocal images were obtained with the equator of the cells in focus (Fig. 2A). There was little if any labeling of M protein in the nuclei, likely because of the inefficient permeabilization of the nuclear envelope by saponin (32Lyles D.S. Puddington L. McCreedy Jr., B.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4387-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type M protein labeling was apparent in both the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, with a higher intensity in the membrane. By contrast, Δ4-21 M protein labeling could not be distinguished between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. The labeling intensity of the remaining mutated M proteins was greater in the plasma membrane than the cytoplasm, indicating that they all have the ability to associate with host plasma membranes, including the M protein mutants with higher turnover rates, HGH, YIG, and KR. As an example, Fig. 2A shows results with the HDH mutant in which association with the membrane is apparent. Plasma membrane and cytoplasmic labeling intensities were quantified along intersecting lines in the shape of an X drawn through each cell. Graphs of pixel intensity versus distance along a line through representative cells are shown in Fig. 2B. The peak pixel intensity of the plasma membrane was collected at the four points where the X crossed the plasma membrane. Two cytoplasmic pixel intensity readings were collected at the 1/3 and the 2/3 distance between each plasma membrane reading and the nucleus. Boundaries of the nuclei were visualized from TO-PRO labeling. The ratios of membrane labeling to cytoplasmic labeling were calculated for each cell. For each mutant M protein as well as the positive and negative controls 10 cells were analyzed in each of 4 separate experiments (n = 40). Fig. 2C shows the average ratio of M protein plasma membrane/cytoplasm pixel intensity fo"

In the present study, we used computational screening to discover novel high-affinity agonists of an olfactory G protein-coupled receptor that recognizes amino acid ligands. Functional testing of the top candidates validated several agonists with potencies higher than any of the receptor's known natural ligands. Computational modeling revealed molecular interactions involved in ligand binding and further highlighted interactions that have been conserved in evolutionarily divergent amino acid receptors. Significantly, the top compounds display robust activities as odorants in vivo and include a natural product that may be used to signal the presence of bacteria in the environment. Our virtual screening approach should be applicable to the identification of new bioactive molecules for probing the structure of chemosensory receptors and the function of chemosensory systems in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2161072900,"Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells of the nervous system that produce the myelin sheaths surrounding the axons of neurons. Myelinating the axons increases the speed of nerve conduction and demyelination contributes to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocyte differentiation is specified early in development by the expression of the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 in the ventral region of the neural tube. Understanding how Olig2 expression is controlled is therefore essential for elucidating the mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte differentiation. A method is needed to identify potential regulatory sequences in the long stretches of adjacent non-coding DNA that flank Olig2.We identified ten potential regulatory regions upstream of Olig2 based on a combination of bioinformatics metrics that included evolutionary conservation across multiple vertebrate genomes, the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites and the existence of ultraconserved elements. One of our computational predictions includes a region previously identified as the Olig2 basal promoter, suggesting that our criterion represented characteristics of known regulatory regions. In this study, we tested one candidate regulatory region for its ability to modulate the Olig2 basal promoter and found that it represses expression in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.The regulatory region we identified modifies the expression regulated by the Olig2 basal promoter in a manner consistent with our current understanding of Olig2 expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Our results support a model in which constitutive activation of Olig2 by its basal promoter is repressed in undifferentiated cells by upstream repressive elements until that repression is relieved during differentiation. We conclude that the potential regulatory elements presented in this study provide a good starting point for unraveling the cis-regulatory logic that governs Olig2 expression. Future studies of the functionality of the potential regulatory elements we present will help reveal the interactions that govern Olig2 expression during development."

Methods such as serum withdrawal or use of drugs which block cells at specific points in the cell cycle alter cellular events upon re-entry into the cell cycle. Regulatory events occurring in early G1 phase of a new cell cycle could have been overlooked.We used a robotic mitotic shake-off apparatus to select cells in late mitosis for genome-wide gene expression studies. Two separate microarray experiments were conducted, one which involved isolation of RNA hourly for several hours from synchronous cell populations, and one experiment which examined gene activity every 15 minutes from late telophase of mitosis into G1 phase. To verify synchrony of the cell populations under study, we utilized methods including BrdU uptake, FACS, and microarray analyses of histone gene activity. We also examined stress response gene activity. Our analysis enabled identification of 200 early G1-regulated genes, many of which currently have unknown functions. We also confirmed the expression of a set of genes candidates (fos, atf3 and tceb) by qPCR to further validate the newly identified genes.Genome-scale expression analyses of the first two hours of G1 in naturally cycling cells enabled the discovery of a unique set of G1-regulated genes, many of which currently have unknown functions, in cells progressing normally through the cell division cycle. This group of genes may contain future targets for drug development and treatment of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964059526,"Wilms tumor protein (WT1) is a transcription factor selectively overexpressed in leukemias and cancers; clinical trials are underway that use altered WT1 peptide sequences as vaccines. Here we report a strategy to study peptide-MHC interactions by incorporating non-natural and photo-reactive amino acids into the sequence of WT1 peptides. Thirteen WT1 peptides sequences were synthesized with chemically modified amino acids (via fluorination and photo-reactive group additions) at MHC and T cell receptor binding positions. Certain new non-natural peptide analogs could stabilize MHC class I molecules better than the native sequences and were also able to elicit specific T-cell responses and sometimes cytotoxicity to leukemia cells. Two photo-reactive peptides, also modified with a biotin handle for pull-down studies, formed covalent interactions with MHC molecules on live cells and provided kinetic data showing the rapid clearance of the peptide-MHC complex. Despite ""infinite affinity"" provided by the covalent peptide bonding to the MHC, immunogenicity was not enhanced by these peptides because the peptide presentation on the surface was dominated by catabolism of the complex and only a small percentage of peptide molecules covalently bound to the MHC molecules. This study shows that non-natural amino acids can be successfully incorporated into T cell epitopes to provide novel immunological, biochemical and kinetic information."
https://openalex.org/W1966134665,"Ecological systems are always subjected to various environmental fluctuations. They evolve under these fluctuations and the resulting systems are robust against them. The diversity in ecological systems is also acquired through the evolution. How do the fluctuations affect the evolutionary processes? Do the fluctuations have direct impact on the species diversity in ecological systems? In the present paper, we investigate the relation between the environmental fluctuation and the evolution of species diversity with a mathematical model of evolutionary ecology. In the model, individual organisms compete for a single restricted resource and the temporal fluctuation in the resource supply is introduced as the environmental fluctuation. The evolutionary process is represented by the mutational change of genotypes which determines their resource utilization strategies. We found that when the environmental state is switched form static to fluctuating conditions, the initial closely related population distributed around the genotype adapted for the static environment is destabilized and divided into two groups in the genotype space; i.e., the evolutionary branching is induced by the environmental fluctuation. The consequent multiple species structures is evolutionary stable at the presence of the fluctuation. We perform the evolutionary invasion analysis for the phenomena and illustrate the mechanisms of the branchings. The results indicate a novel process of increasing the species diversity via evolutionary branching, and the analysis reveals the mechanisims of the branching preocess as the response to the environmental fluctuation. The robustness of the evolutionary process is also discussed."
