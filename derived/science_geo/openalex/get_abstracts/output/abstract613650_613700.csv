However, their lower open-circuit voltages result in lower power conversion efficiencies. Using mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite and a solution-processed secondary growth method, Luo et al. created a surface region in the perovskite film that inhibited nonradiative charge-carrier recombination. This kind of solar cell had comparable performance to that of conventional cells. Science , this issue p. 1442"

https://openalex.org/W2810164223,"Chiral amines are widely used as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis to activate carbonyl groups for α-functionalization. Carbonyl catalysis reverses that strategy by using a carbonyl group to activate a primary amine. Inspired by biological carbonyl catalysis, which is exemplified by reactions of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, we developed an N-quaternized pyridoxal catalyst for the asymmetric Mannich reaction of glycinate with aryl N-diphenylphosphinyl imines. The catalyst exhibits high activity and stereoselectivity, likely enabled by enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation of the substrates. Our work demonstrates the catalytic utility of the pyridoxal moiety in asymmetric catalysis."

Hong et al. developed a mesh electronics implant that is delivered by injection into mice retinas. With these devices, it is possible to obtain recordings from retinal ganglion cells over long time periods in awake, active mice. Both orientation- and direction-selective retinal ganglion cells can be monitored, as can the circadian modulation of retinal ganglion cell activity. Science , this issue p. 1447"

They provide excellent lubrication between two surfaces for both engineered and physiological materials. The packing of the brushes is sensitive to pH, temperature, or added salts. Yu et al. show that the presence of multivalent ions can cause brush collapse, similarly to monovalent ions (see the Perspective by Ballauff). Critically—and not observed with the addition of monovalent ions—very low concentrations of multivalent ions cause bridging between the brushes and increase friction between the surfaces to the extent that their value for biomedical devices is limited.

Sugawa et al. engineered a cold atom system with a nonzero second Chern number, in contrast to condensed matter physics, where only the first Chern number is usually invoked. The exotic topology relates to the emergence of a type of magnetic monopole called the Yang monopole (known from theoretical high-energy physics) in a five-dimensional space of internal degrees of freedom in a rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate. The results illustrate the potential of cold atoms physics to simulate high-energy phenomena. Science , this issue p. 1429"

The molecular mechanism underlying the rapid maturation of these endocytic pits is not known. Here we demonstrate that synaptojanin-1, and its partner endophilin-A, function in ultrafast endocytosis. In the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin, the membrane is rapidly invaginated, but pits do not become constricted at the base. The 5-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is involved in formation of the neck, but 4-phosphatase is not required. Nevertheless, these pits are eventually cleaved into vesicles; within a 30-s interval, synaptic endosomes form and are resolved by clathrin-mediated budding. Then synaptojanin and endophilin function at a second step to aid with the removal of clathrin coats from the regenerated vesicles. These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultrafast endocytosis.

These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultrafast endocytosis. Although classic ultrastructural studies suggest that synaptic vesicles are recycled by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Heuser and Reese, 1973Heuser J.E. Reese T.S.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), recent morphological studies indicate that synaptic vesicle membranes in at least several synaptic types are recycled by ultrafast endocytosis (Watanabe et al., 2013aWatanabe S. Liu Q. Davis M.W. Hollopeter G. Thomas N. Jorgensen N.B. Jorgensen E.M.

Optogenetic stimulation followed by rapid freezing, called “flash-and-freeze,” can capture the progress of endocytosis with millisecond temporal resolution in electron micrographs. Ultrafast endocytosis can recover membrane as rapidly as 30–300 ms after stimulation at the lateral edge of active zones. This rapid process of endocytosis does not require clathrin, but it is only observed at physiological temperatures; at room temperature, clathrin-mediated endocytosis prevails (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S. Trimbuch T. Camacho-Pérez M. Rost B.R. Brokowski B. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Felies A. Davis M.W. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ultrafast endocytosis can also be observed in low-noise capacitance measurements in cerebellar and hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (Delvendahl et al., 2016Delvendahl I. Vyleta N.P. von Gersdorff H. Hallermann S. Fast, Temperature-Sensitive and Clathrin-Independent Endocytosis at Central Synapses.Neuron. 2016; 90: 492-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After a 10-Hz stimulation, endocytosis slows to a fast time constant of 760 ms and a slow time constant of 26 s even at 37°C when measured using rapid quenching (Soykan et al., 2017Soykan T. Kaempf N. Sakaba T. Vollweiter D. Goerdeler F. Puchkov D. Kononenko N.L. Haucke V. Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis Occurs on Multiple Timescales and Is Mediated by Formin-Dependent Actin Assembly.Neuron. 2017; 93: 854-866.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After ultrafast endocytosis, the ∼80-nm vesicles translocate to the distal edge of the synapse (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S. Trimbuch T. Camacho-Pérez M. Rost B.R. Brokowski B. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Felies A. Davis M.W. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because the fluid phase marker ferritin is found in a large endosome-like structure (∼120 nm), either endocytic vesicles fuse together via homotypic fusion or fuse to a pre-existing organelle to form the synaptic endosome. Clathrin-coated vesicles then bud off from the synaptic endosomes, and synaptic vesicles are recovered by shedding these clathrin coats (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S. Trimbuch T. Camacho-Pérez M. Rost B.R. Brokowski B. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Felies A. Davis M.W. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Genetic knockout of AP2 results in the accumulation of endosomes in these terminals (Gu et al., 2008Gu M. Schuske K. Watanabe S. Liu Q. Baum P. Garriga G. Jorgensen E.M. Mu2 adaptin facilitates but is not essential for synaptic vesicle recycling in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Gu et al., 2013Gu M.

These data suggest that action potential-induced vesicle endocytosis is fast and clathrin-independent. Despite its rapid timescale, the coordinated actions of multiple proteins are likely required to generate vesicles via ultrafast endocytosis. Membrane invagination requires polymerized actin. Latrunculin-A sequesters monomeric G-actin and inhibits polymerization; when applied to mouse hippocampal neurons, membrane buckling fails completely (Watanabe et al., 2013bWatanabe S. Rost B.R. Camacho-Pérez M. Davis M.W. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Ultrafast endocytosis at mouse hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2013; 504: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Vesicle scission is likely mediated by dynamin because temperature-sensitive mutants or pharmacological inhibition of dynamin traps endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane (Watanabe et al., 2013aWatanabe S. Liu Q. Davis M.W. Hollopeter G. Thomas N. Jorgensen N.B. Jorgensen E.M. Ultrafast endocytosis at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions.eLife. 2013; 2: e00723Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 2013bWatanabe S. Rost B.R. Camacho-Pérez M.

However, apart from actin and dynamin, the protein machinery required for ultrafast endocytosis is not understood. Two proteins thought to function with dynamin are endophilin and synaptojanin. Endophilin-A (hereafter called endophilin) is composed of a Bin Amphiphysin, Rvs (BAR) domain and an SH3 domain (de Heuvel et al., 1997de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S.

Perturbation studies indicate that endophilin is required for endocytosis in lampreys (Gad et al., 2000Gad H. Ringstad N. Löw P. Kjaerulff O. Gustafsson J. Wenk M. Di Paolo G. Nemoto Y. Crun J.

In studies of synapses in endophilin mutants, there was a depletion of synaptic vesicles and an accumulation of coated vesicles. Furthermore, endophilin functions in clathrin-independent endocytosis to mediate rapid internalization of receptors from the surface (Boucrot et al., 2015Boucrot E. Ferreira A.P.A. Almeida-Souza L. Debard S. Vallis Y. Howard G. Bertot L. Sauvonnet N. McMahon H.T. Endophilin marks and controls a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway.Nature. 2015; 517: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, it is a particularly interesting candidate to investigate in the context of ultrafast endocytosis, in which the steps of membrane endocytosis and clathrin-mediated vesicle formation are separated in both time and space (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S.

Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of endophilin also binds the proline-rich domain of synaptojanin-1 (hereafter called synaptojanin) (Micheva et al., 1997Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S.

In studies of synapses, synaptojanin mutants exhibit a decrease in total synaptic vesicle numbers and an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles, like in endophilin mutants. Endophilin and synaptojanin work cooperatively in endocytosis and subsequent uncoating of clathrin because double mutants are identical to single mutants (Schuske et al., 2003Schuske K.R.

Synaptojanin contains two phosphoinositide phosphatase domains (McPherson et al., 1996McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y.

Both domains are critical for endocytosis and clathrin uncoating during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Cao et al., 2017Cao M. Wu Y. Ashrafi G. McCartney A.J. Wheeler H. Bushong E.A. Boassa D.

Here we use flash-and-freeze electron microscopy in mouse hippocampal neurons to examine the roles of synaptojanin and endophilin in ultrafast endocytosis. In both mutants, the endocytic membrane is stalled at the plasma membrane for an extended period of time (1–10 s) but is resolved by 30 s. In both endophilin and synaptojanin mutants, synaptic vesicles still form by clathrin-mediated budding from synaptic endosomes, but removal of clathrin from these vesicles is delayed. The failure to fully acidify synaptic vesicles in these mutants suggests that acidification of synaptic vesicles takes place after clathrin-coats are removed. Taken together, these data suggest that endophilin and synaptojanin play dual roles during synaptic vesicle recycling: neck formation during ultrafast endocytosis and clathrin uncoating following regeneration of synaptic vesicles from endosomes. Mice with null mutations in synaptojanin die perinatally (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Lüthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B.

To determine the role of synaptojanin in ultrafast endocytosis, we cultured hippocampal neurons from synaptojanin knockout animals (Synj1−/−; Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R.

Cultures were infected using a lentivirus expressing a variant of channelrhodopsin, ChetaTC (Berndt et al., 2011Berndt A. Schoenenberger P. Mattis J. Tye K.M. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Oertner T.G.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Cultured neurons were exposed to a 10-ms pulse of light, and the subsequent membrane dynamics were captured by freezing the neurons at defined time points from 30 ms to 30 s after stimulation (37°C, 4 mM Ca2+). In wild-type neurons, endocytic structures were observed at the lateral edge of the active zone 100 ms after stimulation in 27% of the synapses (58 of 215 synapses; Figures 1A and S1A), consistent with previous measures of ultrafast endocytosis (Watanabe et al., 2013bWatanabe S. Rost B.R. Camacho-Pérez M. Davis M.W. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Ultrafast endocytosis at mouse hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2013; 504: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). At this time, endocytic pits were typically deeply invaginated (pit depth, 71.0 ± 1.8 nm; 25 of 58 endocytic structures; Figure 1E) or fully internalized as large endocytic vesicles (diameter, 66.3 ± 1.9 nm; 33 of 58 endocytic structures; Figures 1A, 1C, 1G, and S1A). 300 ms after stimulation, endocytic pits were almost completely absent (endocytic pits, 3 of 208 synapses), and only large endocytic vesicles were present at endocytic sites (large endocytic vesicles near the active zone, 14 of 208 synapses; Figure 1C), suggesting that ultrafast endocytosis is largely complete by this time point. These endocytic vesicles were then translocated to the center of the bouton to fuse and become synaptic endosomes, which are plentiful from ∼300 ms to 1 s (300 ms, 56 of 208 synapses; 1 s, 57 of 210 synapses; and 3 s, 38 of 210 synapses). These synaptic endosomes were resolved by clathrin-mediated budding into coated vesicles starting at ∼3 s post-stimulation (Figures 1A, 1C, and S1A). In synaptojanin mutant neurons, endocytic pits also formed 100 ms after stimulation and were localized at the lateral edge of the active zone in 15% of the synapses (43 of 287 synapses; Figures 1B, 1D, and S1B). However, fully resolved large endocytic vesicles were rarely observed at these sites (2 of 43 endocytic structures; Figure 1G), and unresolved endocytic pits remained at the plasma membrane for 1–10 s (Figure 1D). These endocytic pits were slightly shallower and wider than in wild-type neurons (Figures 1E and 1F; pit depth: Synj1−/−, 62.4 ± 2.8 nm, wild-type [WT], 71.0 ± 1.8 nm, p < 0.05; pit width: Synj1−/−, 126.1 ± 5.4 nm, n = 44 pits; wild-type 111.7 ± 9.2 nm, n = 25 pits; p = 0.19). Moreover, in the wild-type neurons, necks narrowed to 0 nm; in synaptojanin mutants, the neck was never narrower than 38.3 nm. These data suggest that formation of a neck during vesicle invagination requires synaptojanin. Do the pits eventually resolve into endocytic vesicles or do they collapse back into the plasma membrane? Large endocytic vesicles were occasionally observed at synaptojanin mutant synapses between 100 ms and 10 s (17 of 1,034 synapses; Figure 1D). Because large endocytic vesicles are very transient (∼200 ms), they can only be observed immediately after their formation. The temporal resolution of our ultrastructural analysis is too coarse after 1 s to reliably capture such transient structures. However, the eventual appearance of synaptic endosomes and coated vesicles, albeit with a delay, suggests that endocytosis proceeds in synaptojanin mutants (Figures 1B, 1D, and S1B). To track endocytic structures, we applied cationized ferritin particles in the external solution and performed flash-and-freeze experiments (single stimulus, 37°C, 4 mM Ca2+). In wild-type neurons, ferritin particles are in endocytic vesicles at 100 ms (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S. Trimbuch T. Camacho-Pérez M. Rost B.R. Brokowski B. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Felies A. Davis M.W. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), endosomes at 1 s, and clathrin-coated vesicles at 3 s (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). Thus, the presence of ferritin particles in large endocytic vesicles or synaptic endosomes by 1 s poststimulation suggests successful completion of ultrafast endocytosis. In synaptojanin mutant neurons, ferritin particles are almost exclusively found in endocytic pits at 1 s (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2B). At 3 s, a decline in endocytic pits at the plasma membrane is observed in synaptojanin mutants, and this decrease is correlated with a concomitant increase in ferritin in organelles within the bouton (Figure 2D). These organelles include large endocytic vesicles (10 of 170 synapses, 60–80 nm), but they are not close to the plasma membrane (233.2 ± 26.3 nm on average), suggesting that they are rapidly trafficked away from the endocytic zone. Ferritin is also observed in large synaptic endosomes (>100 nm) at 3 s and in a few clathrin-coated vesicles that have budded from the synaptic endosomes. By contrast, clathrin-coated pits are not observed on the plasma membrane (Figure 2D), suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not compensating for defective ultrafast endocytosis in synaptojanin mutants. These results suggest that ultrafast endocytosis is slowed but not blocked in the absence of synaptojanin and that, eventually, vesicles are regenerated by clathrin-mediated budding from the synaptic endosome. There is a second requirement for synaptojanin during uncoating of vesicles. In wild-type synapses, clathrin-coated vesicles appear 3 s after stimulation and are largely gone by 10 s (Figures 1A and 1C). Synaptic endosomes exhibit a precursor-product relationship with coated vesicles because the decrease in synaptic endosomes with ferritin is associated with a concomitant increase in coated vesicles containing ferritin (Figures 2A and 2B). By contrast, in synaptojanin mutants, a high abundance of clathrin-coated vesicles is observed even in unstimulated synapses (Figure 1H). After stimulation, additional clathrin-coated vesicles began accumulating at 3 s and continued to increase at 30 s (Figures 1B, 1D, 2C, and 2D). Previous studies have demonstrated that coated vesicles accumulate in synaptojanin mutants at rest (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Lüthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L.

Our data extend these findings and demonstrate that synaptojanin is required for the uncoating of synaptic vesicles following ultrafast endocytosis after an acute stimulus. Synaptojanin contains two phosphoinositide phosphatase domains. The Sac1 phosphatase domain cleaves the 4-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and the 3-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), and the 5-phosphatase domain cleaves the 5-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (Guo et al., 1999Guo S.

To test whether the activities of these domains are required for ultrafast endocytosis, we generated full-length rescue constructs in the 145-kD isoform with either wild-type or mutant versions of each of the phosphatase active sites, as described previously (Mani et al., 2007Mani M.

https://openalex.org/W2810468570,"The interest in the promotion of entrepreneurship is significantly increasing, particularly in those countries, such as Italy, that suffered during the recent great economic recession and subsequently needed to revitalize their economy. Entrepreneurial intention (EI) is a crucial stage in the entrepreneurial process and represents the basis for consequential entrepreneurial actions. Several research projects have sought to understand the antecedents of EI. This study, using a situational approach, has investigated the personal and contextual determinants of EI, exploring gender differences. In particular, the mediational role of general self-efficacy between internal locus of control (LoC), self-regulation, and support from family and friends, on the one hand, and EI, on the other hand, has been investigated. The study involved a sample of 658 Italian participants, of which 319 were male and 339 were female. Data were collected with a self-report on-line questionnaire and analysed with SPSS 23 and Mplus 7 to test a multi-group structural equation model. The results showed that self-efficacy totally mediated the relationship between internal LoC, self-regulation and EI. Moreover, it partially mediated the relationship between support from family and friends and EI. All the relations were significant for both men and women; however, our findings highlighted a stronger relationship between self-efficacy and EI for men, and between support from family and friends and both self-efficacy and EI for women. Findings highlighted the role of contextual characteristics in addition to personal ones in influencing EI and confirmed the key mediational function of self-efficacy. As for gender, results suggested that differences between men and women in relation to the entrepreneur role still exist. Practical implications for trainers and educators are discussed."

We present safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acceptability and drug release data in healthy women. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We screened 86 women; 51 were randomized to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR [2:2:1] and 50 completed all visits, using the IVR for approximately 15 days. We assessed safety by adverse events, colposcopy, vaginal microbiota, epithelial integrity, mucosal histology and immune cell numbers and phenotype, cervicovaginal [CV] cytokines and antimicrobial proteins and changes in systemic laboratory measurements, and LNG and TFV pharmacokinetics in multiple compartments. TFV pharmacodynamic activity was measured by evaluating CV fluid [CVF] and tissue for antiviral activity using in vitro models. LNG pharmacodynamic assessments were timed based on peak urinary luteinizing hormone levels. All IVRs were safe with no significant colposcopic, mucosal, immune and microbiota changes and were acceptable. Among TFV containing IVR users, median and mean CV aspirate TFV concentrations remained above 100,000 ng/mL 4 hours post IVR insertion and mean TFV-diphosphate [DP] concentrations in vaginal tissue remained above 1,000 fmol/mg even 3 days post IVR removal. CVF of women using TFV-containing IVRs completely inhibited [94–100%] HIV infection in vitro. TFV/LNG IVR users had mean serum LNG concentrations exceeding 300 pg/mL within 1 hour, remaining high throughout IVR use. All LNG IVR users had a cervical mucus Insler score <10 and the majority [95%] were anovulatory or had abnormal cervical mucus sperm penetration. Estimated in vivo TFV and LNG release rates were within expected ranges. All IVRs were safe with the active ones delivering sustained high concentrations of TFV locally. LNG caused changes in cervical mucus, sperm penetration, and ovulation compatible with contraceptive efficacy. The TFV and TFV/LNG rings are ready for expanded 90 day clinical testing.

Previous models report weak flexion strength, which is partially due to lacking moment generating capacity in the upper cervical spine. Previous models have also lacked realistic hyoid muscles, which have the capability to improve flexion strength and control in the upper cervical spine. Suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles were incorporated in an OpenSim musculoskeletal model of the head and neck. This model was based on previous OpenSim models, and now includes hyoid muscles and passive elements. The moment generating capacity of the model was tested by simulating physical experiments in the OpenSim environment. The flexor and extensor muscle strengths were scaled to match static experimental results. Models with and without hyoid muscles were used to simulate experimentally captured motions, and the need for reserve actuators was evaluated. The addition of hyoid muscles greatly increased flexion strength, and the model is the first of its kind to have realistic strength values in all directions. Less reserve actuator moment was required to simulate real motions with the addition of hyoid muscles. Several additional ways of improving flexion strength were investigated. Hyoid muscles add control and strength to OpenSim musculoskeletal models of the head and neck and improve simulations of head and neck movements."
https://openalex.org/W2809967189,"Background and aim The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) are commonly used compound surrogates for advanced fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. However, the use of APRI and FIB-4 entails a risk of overestimating the fibrosis stage due to the impact of necroinflammatory activity on transaminases. We sought to investigate the optimal cutoff values of the two compound surrogates for predicting cirrhosis stratified by AST level. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 1716 treatment-naive CHC patients who underwent liver biopsy prior to interferon therapy from 1997–2010. Fibrosis was scored according to the modified Knodell classification. The upper limit for normal AST in our hospital is 37 IU/L. We stratified the enrolled patients into the categories of AST≤37 IU/L (N = 132), 37<AST≤74, (N = 501), 74<AST≤148 IU/L (N = 737), and AST>148 IU/L (N = 346). Results 436 patients had cirrhosis (F4). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis results distinguishing cirrhosis (F4) from non-cirrhosis (F0–F3) were 0.81 for APRI and 0.85 for FIB-4 in patients with AST≤37 IU/L; 0.71 for APRI and 0.72 for FIB-4 in patients with 37<AST≤74IU/L; 0.72 for APRI and 0.73 for FIB-4 in patients with 74<AST≤148 IU/L; and 0.68 for APRI and 0.70 for FIB-4 in patients with AST>148 IU/L. The optimal cutoff values of APRI and FIB-4 for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were 0.6 and 1.4, respectively, in patients with AST≤37 IU/L; 1.1 and 2.2, respectively, in patients with 37<AST≤74 IU/L; 2.2 and 3.4, respectively, in patients with 74<AST≤148 IU/L; and 3.4 and 5.5, respectively, in patients with AST>148 IU/L. Conclusions We provide optimal cutoff values of both APRI and FIB-4 to predict cirrhosis stratified by AST levels, which should be more feasible compared with the single cutoff values proposed in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W2810201178,"Hypertensive individuals are at greater risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reducing proteinuria has been suggested as a possible therapeutic approach to treat CKD. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of proteinuria in hypertensive conditions are incompletely understood. Cardiac and vascular dysfunction is associated with changes in the O-GlcNAcylation pathway in hypertensive models. We hypothesized that O-GlcNAcylation is also involved in renal damage, especially development of proteinuria, associated with hypertension. Using the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, we observed higher renal cortex O-GlcNAcylation, glutamine–fructose aminotransferase (GFAT), and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) protein expression, which positively correlated with proteinuria. Interestingly, this was observed in hypertensive, but not pre-hypertensive, rats. Pharmacological inhibition of GFAT decreased renal cortex O-GlcNAcylation, proteinuria, and albuminuria in SHR. Using a proximal tubule cell line, we observed that increased O-GlcNAcylation reduced megalin surface expression and albumin endocytosis in vitro, and the effects were correlated in vivo. Moreover, megalin is O-GlcNAcylated both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a new mechanism involved in hypertension-associated proteinuria."
https://openalex.org/W2810124194,"To solve the hidden danger of high methane and low permeability gas in the coal mining process, potentially affecting the safety production in an orderly way, we propose the use of deep hole blasting technology to improve the permeability of the coal seam gas drainage, increase the quantity and rate of extraction, and reduce methane output. Taking the geological conditions of the 201 working surface of Tingnan Coal Mine as an example, it is calculated that the single drilled fracture crack extension range is 3.11~5.24 m according to the coal seam deep-hole pre-splitting blasting joint mechanism and fracture propagation mechanics model, providing a theoretical basis for choosing the appropriate hole spacing. Using COMSOL simulation software to simulate the effective gas drainage radius of a coal seam from a two-dimensional perspective on a single borehole radial, the least squares fitting method was used to analyze the simulated data, and obtained the effective drilling extraction radius after pre-split blasting in a deep hole that is 3.6 m, which is in accordance with the theoretical calculations. In order to obtain accurate and scientific calculations, Fast lagrangian analysis of continua (FLAC3D) numerical simulation software was used. After simulating the distribution of plastic zone between two blast holes at different intervals from a three-dimensional angle, and evaluating the development of cracks in the blasting hole, the white zone of the blasting space was completely eliminated when the interval between blasting holes was 7 m, and the cracks could be propagated throughout the surroundings. Therefore, a blasting hole spacing of 7 m is optimal. On-site monitoring in the Nanting coal mine showed that the quantity and rate of extraction of the single hole after pre-splitting blasting were 2.36 times and 1.62 times as much as before. By integrating the borehole drainage amount and the optimized calculation equation, it could be concluded that the permeability coefficient of the coal seam after blasting was 7.78 times as much as before. The function of time-variated drilling methane emission was obtained using multivariate statistical regressions based on the on-site monitored borehole methane emission (qt), and the drilling limit after pre-splitting blasting revealed that the limitation of methane extraction volume was 5.27 times as much as before."

SA at the concentration of 0.1 μmol g-1 soil changed rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions, decreased bacterial community diversity but increased fungal community richness and diversity (P<0.05). Moreover, SA increased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and fungal classes Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Tremellomycetes and Eurotiomycetes, but decreased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Firmicutes and fungal class Sordariomycetes (P<0.05). At the genus level, SA decreased the relative abundances of microbial taxa with pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant growth promoting potentials, such as Pseudomonas spp. (P<0.05). Real-time PCR validated that SA decreased cucumber rhizosphere Pseudomonas spp. abundance (P<0.05). In vitro study showed that SA (0.01 to 10 mM) inhibited the growth of a strain of Pseudomonas spp. with pathogen-antagonistic activities to cucumber pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum Owen (P<0.05). Overall, SA changed cucumber rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions, which may exert negative effects on cucumber seedling growth through inhibiting plant-beneficial microorganisms."

Historical and recent outbreaks have been associated with dairy products, ground beef, and direct contact with cattle. Salmonella antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious concern that can reduce successful treatment of infections, increasing recovery time, medical costs, and mortality rates in humans and animals. This highlights the need to track AMR in Salmonella isolated from cattle to improve treatment plans, manage trends in AMR, and prevent future AMR development. A total of 242 Salmonella isolates were retrieved from 9,162 cattle fecal samples submitted to the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 2002 to 2016. These isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a standardized broth dilution panel. Multidrug resistance (MDR) to three or more classes of antimicrobials was observed in 50.8% of isolates, and the most common MDR pattern was amoxicillin-ampicillin-cefoxitin-ceftiofur-ceftriaxone-chloramphenicol-streptomycin-tetracycline (23.2%). There were significantly greater odds for antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.1-3.7), penicillins (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.007-3.5), and tetracyclines (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.017-3.4) for the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period. The most prevalent MDR serotypes were Newport (100% MDR, n = 52), Typhimurium (100%, n = 20), and Dublin (71% MDR, n = 46). Risk factors associated with higher odds for isolating MDR Salmonella included isolates from calves when compared to adult cattle (OR: 22.0; 95% C.I.: 3.9-125.7), and isolates obtained from cattle suspect of having salmonellosis versus from the infectious disease control surveillance program (OR:13.7; 95%C.I.: 2.8-66.8). Despite a temporal trend for reduced AMR to most antimicrobial drug classes, a lack of this observed in the 2002-2009 period when compared to the 2010-2016 period for important drug classes such as cephalosporins (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 0.87-3.1), and a trend for temporal increase in resistant to quinolones drugs (P value 0.004) highlight the relevance of AMR surveillance in cattle with Salmonella infections with the aim of targeting future prophylactic interventions."

Studies examining the effect of other support types on both positive and negative adjustment among infertile couples are scarce or non-existent. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of support receipt, provision, invisibility (the discrepancy between one partner’s received and the other partner’s provided support), and equity (the discrepancy between each partner’s received and provided support) on the positive (life purpose) and negative (depressive symptoms) indices of well-being in couples undergoing ART treatment. Methods Depressive symptoms (CES-D), life purpose (PIL), and social support (BSSS) were assessed among 31 married couples (mean age 32.67 years) undergoing ART treatment. Data were analyzed by applying the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model (APIM) using multilevel modeling. Findings Both receiving and providing support had beneficial effects in women and men. However, sub-analysis showed differences according to gender and the support exchange effects. Women reported higher depression and lower life purpose but benefited more from support, and their well-being was more dependent on their own perception of support provision and receipt. Men demonstrated higher adjustment to infertility but benefited less from support, and their well-being was mostly correlated with supportive behaviors of their wives. Discussion Adjustment mechanisms of women and men undergoing ART treatment vary considerably; thus, gender should be taken into consideration in interventions. Future studies should focus on costs/benefits and gender differences of visible and invisible support in infertility settings."

https://openalex.org/W2810738772,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry signals are mediated by plasma membrane Orai channels activated through intermembrane coupling with Ca2+-sensing STIM proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The nature of this elaborate Orai-gating mechanism has remained enigmatic. Based on the Drosophila Orai structure, mammalian Orai1 channels are hexamers comprising three dimeric subunit pairs. We utilized concatenated Orai1 dimers to probe the function of key domains within the channel pore and gating regions. The Orai1-E106Q selectivity-filter mutant, widely considered a dominant pore blocker, was surprisingly nondominant within concatenated heterodimers with Orai1-WT. The Orai1-E106Q/WT heterodimer formed STIM1-activated nonselective cation channels with significantly enlarged apparent pore diameter. Other Glu-106 substitutions entirely blocked the function of heterodimers with Orai1-WT. The hydrophobic pore-lining mutation V102C, which constitutively opens channels, was suppressed by Orai1-WT in the heterodimer. In contrast, the naturally occurring R91W pore-lining mutation associated with human immunodeficiency was completely dominant-negative over Orai-WT in heterodimers. Heterodimers containing the inhibitory K85E mutation extending outward from the pore helix gave an interesting partial effect on both channel activation and STIM1 binding, indicating an important allosteric link between the cytosolic Orai1 domains. The Orai1 C-terminal STIM1-binding domain mutation L273D powerfully blocked STIM1-induced channel activation. The Orai1-L273D/WT heterodimer had drastically impaired STIM1-induced channel gating but, unexpectedly, retained full STIM1 binding. This reveals the critical role of Leu-273 in transducing the STIM1-binding signal into the allosteric conformational change that initiates channel gating. Overall, our results provide important new insights into the role of key functional domains that mediate STIM1-induced gating of the Orai1 channel. Store-operated Ca2+ entry signals are mediated by plasma membrane Orai channels activated through intermembrane coupling with Ca2+-sensing STIM proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The nature of this elaborate Orai-gating mechanism has remained enigmatic. Based on the Drosophila Orai structure, mammalian Orai1 channels are hexamers comprising three dimeric subunit pairs. We utilized concatenated Orai1 dimers to probe the function of key domains within the channel pore and gating regions. The Orai1-E106Q selectivity-filter mutant, widely considered a dominant pore blocker, was surprisingly nondominant within concatenated heterodimers with Orai1-WT. The Orai1-E106Q/WT heterodimer formed STIM1-activated nonselective cation channels with significantly enlarged apparent pore diameter. Other Glu-106 substitutions entirely blocked the function of heterodimers with Orai1-WT. The hydrophobic pore-lining mutation V102C, which constitutively opens channels, was suppressed by Orai1-WT in the heterodimer. In contrast, the naturally occurring R91W pore-lining mutation associated with human immunodeficiency was completely dominant-negative over Orai-WT in heterodimers. Heterodimers containing the inhibitory K85E mutation extending outward from the pore helix gave an interesting partial effect on both channel activation and STIM1 binding, indicating an important allosteric link between the cytosolic Orai1 domains. The Orai1 C-terminal STIM1-binding domain mutation L273D powerfully blocked STIM1-induced channel activation. The Orai1-L273D/WT heterodimer had drastically impaired STIM1-induced channel gating but, unexpectedly, retained full STIM1 binding. This reveals the critical role of Leu-273 in transducing the STIM1-binding signal into the allosteric conformational change that initiates channel gating. Overall, our results provide important new insights into the role of key functional domains that mediate STIM1-induced gating of the Orai1 channel."

In this paper, a new design for an MI transmitter is presented. Unlike conventional MI transmitters that utilize coiled loops or solenoids to generate magnetic fields, we demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using a rotating permanent magnet. We also present and experimentally verify a modulation technique that does not involve changing the rotational speed of the magnet. By electrically changing the permeability of a surrounding shield, the fields from the rotating magnet are amplitude modulated. Our findings suggest that increased efficiency and bandwidth can be realized compared to conventional MI transmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2810499296,"We examined late Holocene (ca. 3300 yr BP to present-day) climate variability in the central Northwest Territories (Canadian Subarctic) using a diatom and sedimentological record from Danny’s Lake (63.48ºN, 112.54ºW), located 40 km southwest of the modern-day treeline. High-resolution sampling paired with a robust age model (25 radiocarbon dates) allowed for the examination of both lake hydroecological conditions (30-year intervals; diatoms) and sedimentological changes in the watershed (12-year intervals; grain size records) over the late Holocene. Time series analysis of key lake ecological indicators (diatom species Aulacoseira alpigena, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata and Achnanthidium minutissimum) and sedimentological parameters, reflective of catchment processes (coarse silt fraction), suggests significant intermittent variations in turbidity, pH and light penetration within the lake basin. In the diatom record, we observed discontinuous periodicities in the range of ca. 69, 88–100, 115–132, 141–188, 562, 750 and 900 years (>90% and >95% confidence intervals), whereas the coarse silt fraction was characterized by periodicities in the >901 and <61-year range (>95% confidence interval). Periodicities in the proxy data from the Danny’s Lake sediment core align with changes in total solar irradiance over the past ca. 3300 yr BP and we hypothesize a link to the Suess Cycle, Gleissberg Cycle and Pacific Decadal Oscillation via occasional inland propagation of shifting air masses over the Pacific Ocean. This research represents an important baseline study of the underlying causes of climate variability in the Canadian Subarctic and provides details on the long-term climate variability that has persisted in this region through the past three thousand years."
https://openalex.org/W2809716484,"Whether statins and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) / angiotensin receptor blockors (ARBs) are associated with reduced risks of infection events is still inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia among patients who had received treatment with ACEIs/ARBs and/or statins using a population-based dataset. This study included 19,281 patients as cases who were hospitalized for pneumonia and 19,281 controls. We used a logistic regression to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for having previously used statins or an ACEI/ ARB between patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia treatment and controls. We found there were significant associations between hospitalization for pneumonia and statin-only users (p<0.001), ACEI/ARB-only users (p<0.001), and statin and ACEI/ARB users (p<0.001). The logistic regression analysis suggested that statin-only users (adjusted OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.34~0.43), ACEI/ARB-only users (adjusted OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82~0.91), and statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.44~0.50) were all less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment than were non-users. Furthermore, we found that statin-only users (adjusted OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.40~0.50) and statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.52~0.58) were less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to ACEI-only users. However, combined statin and ACEI/ARB users (adjusted OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.10~1.40) were more likely to have been hospitalized for pneumonia treatment compared to statin-only users. Although we found use of both statins and ACEI/ARB were significantly associated with a lower risk of pneumonia, the combination of the two medications did not provide additional protection against pneumonia risk."
https://openalex.org/W2810649047,"Objective A quantitative basis for the use of dipstick urinalysis for risk assessment of all-cause mortality is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association between dipstick proteinuria and all-cause mortality in a general population and evaluated the effect of confounders on this association. Methods The study population included 17,342,956 adults who underwent health examinations between 2005 and 2008 under the National Health Insurance System. Proteinuria was determined using a single dipstick urinalysis, and the primary outcome of this study was all-cause mortality. The prognostic impact of proteinuria was assessed by constructing a multivariable Cox model. Results The mean age of the study population (53.24% male) was 46.06 years; 724,681 deaths from all causes occurred over a median follow-up period of 9.34 years (interquartile range 8.17–10.16), and the maximum follow-up was 12.12 years. After full adjustment for covariates, a higher level of dipstick proteinuria indicated a higher risk of all-cause death [Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals); 1.22 (1.20–1.24), 1.47 (1.45–1.49), 1.81 (1.77–1.84), 2.32 (2.24–2.41), 2.74 (2.54–2.96); trace to 4+, respectively], and various subgroup analyses did not affect the main outcome for the total population. ≥1+ proteinuria in the group without metabolic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity) resulted in higher hazard ratios than those in the group with metabolic diseases and negative or trace proteinuria. Conclusions Our study showed a strong association between dipstick proteinuria and all-cause mortality in this nationwide population-based cohort in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2810115514,"The calorific value (CAL, KJ g-1) of different plant organs are important plant traits. Variation in CAL among different plant organs reflects the energy utilization and distribution strategy of plant. Here, we explored how the CAL of different plant organs varies at the species and regional level in relation to vegetation type (3697 forests samples, 430 grasslands samples, and 146 deserts samples). The results showed that, in the forests and grasslands, CAL significantly differed among the different organs and functional types of plants. The CAL of different organs in forests was ordered as: leaf (19.71 ± 1.82 KJ g-1) > branch (19.33 ± 1.32 KJ g-1) > trunk (19.09 ± 1.44 KJ g-1) > root (19.02 ± 1.11 KJ g-1). For forests, the CAL of plant organs, except for the leaves of trees and shrubs, increased with increasing latitude (P < 0.01). In comparison, the CAL in the roots of shrubs and herbs decreased with increasing longitude (P < 0.01). Through delineating systematic references of CAL among different plant organs, our findings provide key parameters to improve estimates of biomass energy at regional and global scales."
https://openalex.org/W2810155000,"Pheromones are known to play an important role in butterfly courtship and may influence both individual reproductive success and reproductive isolation between species. Recent studies have focused on courtship in Hipparchia butterflies (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) emphasizing morphological and behavioural traits, as well as genetic differences. Behavioural observations suggested a role for chemical cues in mate and species recognition, where the androconial scales on the forewings of these species may be involved in chemical communication between individuals. Cchemical-mediated signals have received relatively little attention in this genus. Here, we report the results of a three-year investigation of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by Hipparchia fagi and H. hermione in order to identify differences in VOCs between these species where they live in syntopy. Our study was carried out using an array of cross-selective sensors known as an ""Electronic Nose"" (EN) that operates by converting chemical patterns into patterns of sensor signals. While the identity of volatile compounds remained unknown, sensor signals can be compared to identify similar or dissimilar chemical patterns. Based on the EN signals, our results showed that: 1) the two sexes have a similar VOCs pattern in H. fagi, while they significantly diverge in H. hermione; 2) VOCs patterns were different between females of the two species, while those of males were not."
https://openalex.org/W2811102305,"Considering that there is a lack of evidence regarding the contribution of library and information services to evidence-based medicine in actual clinical practice in Japan, the purpose of the study is to explore the current status of use and value of library and information services in clinical settings to examine the usefulness of information in implementing evidence-based medicine (EBM) into practice.A Web-based survey was conducted at seven sites (hospitals with 300-1,200 beds) and interviews conducted at five sites to investigate information behavior among health professionals (physicians, residents, and nurses) in 2016, replicating the Value Study carried out in the United States in 2010 and 2011. Using a critical incident technique, respondents answered questions about their information topics, information resources used, search location, access points, and evaluation of the information.Analysis from 598 valid responses (275 physicians, 55 residents, and 268 nurses) revealed the characteristics of information use and recognition of the value of information. Physicians and residents showed their information needs regarding clinical care using PubMed (80.4%, 65.5%), Ichushi-Web (61.8%, 63.6%), and UpToDate (40.4%, 65.5%). While physicians rely more on electronic journals (37.8%), residents use more hybrid resources including Japanese print books (38.2%) and online books (30.9% for Japanese, 32.7% for English) to confirm their knowledge. Nurses need more information close to patients and explore a wider variety of information resources such as Japanese print books (60.4%), Ichushi -Web (40.3%), Japanese online books (20.5%), and websites of academic organizations (19.0%). Although the overall recognition of the value of information was relatively modest, concrete changes in clinical practice were found in some areas. Environments with insufficient information and availability of electronic resources should be improved to increase the use of library and information services for implementing EBM."
https://openalex.org/W2811381024,"Here we provide new technology for generating human peptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons in a straightforward and efficient way. The cellular source, human epidermal neural crest stem cells (hEPI-NCSC), consists of multipotent somatic stem cells that reside in the bulge of hair follicles. hEPI-NCSC and primary sensory neurons have a common origin, the embryonic neural crest. For directed differentiation, hEPI-NCSC were exposed to pertinent growth factors and small molecules in order to modulate master signalling networks involved in differentiation of neural crest cells into postmitotic peptidergic sensory neurons during embryonic development. The neuronal populations were homogenous in regard to antibody marker expression. Cells were immunoreactive for essential master regulatory genes, including NGN1/2, SOX10, and BRN3a among others, and for the pain-mediating genes substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP) and the TRPV1 channel. Approximately 30% of total cells responded to capsaicin, indicating that they expressed an active TRPV1 channel. In summary, hEPI-NCSC are a biologically relevant and easily available source of somatic stem cells for generating human peptidergic nociceptive neurons without the need for genetic manipulation and cell purification. As no analgesics exist that specifically target TRPV1, a ready supply of high-quality human peptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons could open the way for new approaches, in a biologically relevant cellular context, to drug discovery and patient-specific disease modelling that is aimed at pain control, and as such is highly desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2811421300,"Chlamydia pecorum is a mucosal infection, which causes debilitating disease of the urinary tract, reproductive tract and ocular sites of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). While antibiotics are available for treatment, they are detrimental to the koalas’ gastrointestinal tract microflora leaving the implementation of a vaccine as an ideal option for the long-term management of koala populations. We have previously reported on the successes of an anti-chlamydial recombinant major outer membrane protein (rMOMP) vaccine however, recombinant protein based vaccines are not ideal candidates for scale up from the research level to small-medium production level for wider usage. Peptide based vaccines are a promising area for vaccine development, because peptides are stable, cost effective and easily produced. In this current study, we assessed, for the first time, the immune responses to a synthetic peptide based anti-chlamydial vaccine in koalas. Five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with two synthetic peptides derived from C. pecorum MOMP and another five healthy male koalas were vaccinated with full length recombinant C. pecorum MOMP (genotype G). Systemic (IgG) and mucosal (IgA) antibodies were quantified and pre-vaccination levels compared to post-vaccination levels (12 and 26 weeks). MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas produced Chlamydia-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, which were able to recognise not only the genotype used in the vaccination, but also MOMPs from several other koala C. pecorum genotypes. In addition, IgA antibodies induced at the ocular site not only recognised recombinant MOMP protein but also, whole native chlamydial elementary bodies. Interestingly, some MOMP-peptide vaccinated koalas showed a stronger and more sustained vaccine-induced mucosal IgA antibody response than observed in MOMP-protein vaccinated koalas. These results demonstrate that a synthetic MOMP peptide based vaccine is capable of inducing a Chlamydia-specific antibody response in koalas and is a promising candidate for future vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2810909336,"Little is known regarding consequences of climate change on riparian plant functional types (PFTs) related to leaf traits, with putative domino effects on stream food webs, plausible even if the tipping point of stream-desiccation is not reached. We hypothesized that, as stream food-webs are highly dependent on riparian subsidies, climate change might alter PFTs to the point of weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages. We conducted a gradient analysis to assess the relative effects of climate, soil and riparian physical characteristics on PFTs. If PFTs differ significantly in leaf traits and climate had major influences on them, we could assume space-for-time interchangeability forward in time to predict leaf traits changes, and consequences for stream food webs under future climate change scenarios. Results indicated a clear distinction in leaf traits among PFTs: woody deciduous plants showed leaf traits associated to high decomposability and nutritional value for invertebrate shredders compared to evergreen woody and giant graminoid groups. We found a prime role of climate predicting changes in abundance and diversity of PFTs: 1) a warming and precipitation-decline scenario, coupled with soil characteristics related to aridification, would have detrimental effects on deciduous plants, while fostering giant graminoids; 2) in a scenario of no precipitation-reduction in wetter areas, warming might promote the expansion of evergreen to the detriment of deciduous plants. In both scenarios the net outcome implies increasing recalcitrance of leaf litter inputs, potentially weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages in headwater streams."
https://openalex.org/W2811238638,"Dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in drug addiction; therefore, polymorphisms in stress-related genes may be involved in this disease. An analysis was performed to identify associations between variants in 11 stress-related genes, selected a priori, and heroin addiction. Two discovery samples of American subjects of European descent (EA, n = 601) and of African Americans (AA, n = 400) were analyzed separately. Ancestry was verified by principal component analysis. Final sets of 414 (EA) and 562 (AA) variants were analyzed after filtering of 846 high-quality variants. The main result was an association of a non-coding SNP rs255105 in the CRH (CRF) receptor 2 gene (CRHR2), in the discovery EA sample (Pnominal = .00006; OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.4–3.1). The association signal remained significant after permutation-based multiple testing correction. The result was corroborated by an independent EA case sample (n = 364). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SNP rs255105 is associated with the expression of a downstream long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) gene AC005154.6. AC005154.6 is highly expressed in the pituitary but its functions are unknown. LincRNAs have been previously associated with adaptive behavior, PTSD, and alcohol addiction. Further studies are warranted to corroborate the association results and to assess the potential relevance of this lincRNA to addiction and other stress-related disorders."

The purpose of this study was therefore to compare glycaemic control and albuminuria in HIV-positive and HIV-negative type 2 diabetic patients.Diabetic patients with and without HIV infection were recruited from a diabetic clinic at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Data was collected on weight, height, HbA1c, fasting glucose, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, HIV status, CD4 counts, viral load and concomitant therapies. Multivariable regression analysis was used to isolate the determinants of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels and risk factors for albuminuria.Data were collected from 106 HIV-positive and 214 HIV-negative diabetics. All HIV infected subjects were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. The determinants of fasting glucose levels (log) were HIV infection (β = 0.04, p = 0.01) and use of anti-hypertensive agents (β = 0.07, p = 0.0006), whilst for HbA1c levels (log) they were HIV infection (β = -0.03, p = 0.03), BMI (β = 0.004, p = 0.0005), statin use (β = 0.04, p = 0.002) and glucose levels (β = 0.01, p<0.0005). In HIV-positive subjects, CD4 counts were negatively associated with glucose levels (β = -0.0002, p = 0.03). The risk factors for albuminuria were (odds ratio [95% CIs]) dyslipidaemia (1.94 [1.09, 3.44], p = 0.02) and HbA1c levels (1.24 [1.12, 1.38], p<0.0001).These data suggest that glycaemic control is worse in type 2 diabetic subjects with HIV infection and that HbA1c underestimates glycaemia in these patients. Albuminuria was not associated with HIV-positivity. The negative relationship of CD4 counts with glucose levels may reflect viral removal and easing of the associated inflammatory response. It is possible that the association of statin and anti-hypertensive therapies with high HbA1c and glucose levels, respectively, is due to such therapies being given largely to subjects with poor glycaemic control."

https://openalex.org/W2810544040,"The increasing focus of healthcare systems worldwide on long-term care highlights the need for culturally sensitive Health-Related Quality of Life instruments to accurately capture perceived health of various populations. Such instruments require a contextualized conceptual framework of health domains, which is lacking in some socio-cultural contexts. We developed a comprehensive and culturally sensitive conceptual framework of health domains relevant to the Singaporean population. We recruited Singaporeans/ permanent residents, English/ Chinese-speaking, with/ without chronic illnesses to participate in focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs). We elicited health areas participants perceived to be important for them to be happy and satisfied with life. To encourage spontaneous emergence of themes, we did not specify any aspect beyond the broad domains of Physical, Mental, and Social health so as not to limit the emergence of new themes. Themes from the transcripts were distilled through open coding (two independent coders), then classified into more abstract domains (each transcript coded independently by two coders from a pool of six coders). From October 2013 to August 2014, 121 members of the general public participated in 18 FGDs and 13 IDIs (44.6% males, mean age: 53.3 years 77% Chinese, 9% Malay, 12% Indian, 63% with chronic illness) while 13 healthcare workers participated as patient-proxies in three FGDs. Thematic analysis identified 27 domains. The 15 physical domains included physical appearance, energy, physical fitness, and health and resistance to illness. The nine mental domains included emotions, self-esteem, and personal freedom. The three social domains were social contact, social relationships, and social roles. This conceptual framework reflected physical, mental, and social dimensions of well-being, suggesting that the Singapore population's views on health support the World Health Organization's definition of health as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity""."

Animal studies in bile duct ligated (BDL) mice suggest that cholestasis leads to an aggravation of hepatic bacterial infections. We have investigated the impact of cholestasis on mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced immune responses and viral replication. While MCMV did not aggravate BDL-induced liver damage, BDL markedly reduced MCMV-triggered chemokine expression and immune cell recruitment to the liver. MCMV-infected BDL mice showed diminished trafficking of Ly6C+/F4/80+ myeloid cells and NK1.1+ NK cells to the liver compared to MCMV infected control mice. Moreover, virus-driven expression of CCL7, CCL12, CXCL9 and CXCL10 was clearly impaired in BDL- compared to sham-operated mice. Furthermore, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was massively augmented in infected BDL mice. In contrast, intra- and extrahepatic virus replication was unaltered in BDL-MCMV mice when compared to sham-MCMV mice. Cholestasis in the BDL model severely impaired pathogen-induced chemokine expression in the liver affecting CCR2- and CXCR3-dependent cell trafficking. Cholestasis resulted in reduced recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and NK cells to the liver."

The main outcomes were mortality at 1 and 2 years after surgery. Background, clinical parameters, and diagnostic tests findings were evaluated as possible predictors. Multivariable multilevel logistic regression and survival models were used in the analyses to create the clinical prediction rules.

Study 1 used a between-participants design comparing four conditions: relief-based narrative, regret-based narrative, control (test-uptake only) narrative, and standard invitation material (no-narrative condition). Study 2 used a mixed design, with the narrative content as a within-participants factor and whether emotions were expressed by the narrative character or not as between-participants factor. The main outcome measures were: intention to undergo testing (Studies 1 and 2), knowledge, risk perception, proportion of informed choices (Study 1), subjective emotional responses, changes in skin conductance, heart rate, and corrugator muscle activity (Study 2). In Study 1, relative to the non-narrative condition (51%), only the relief-based narrative significantly increased intention to undergo testing (86%). Relative to the standard invitation material, the narrative conditions did not decrease knowledge, alter risk perception, or decrease the proportion of informed choices. In Study 2, the relief-based narrative elicited the lowest self-reported negative affect, and received greater implicit attention, as suggested by the larger heart rate decrease. Making the emotions experienced by the narrative character explicit decreased negative affect, as indicated by the lower skin conductance and corrugator responses during reading. Our findings provide support for the use of a relief-based narrative with emotions expressed by the character in addition to the standard information material to promote colorectal cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W2810809788,"Cytochromes P450 are enzymes that participate in a wide range of functions in plants, from hormonal signaling and biosynthesis of structural polymers, to defense or communication with other organisms. They represent one of the largest gene/protein families in the plant kingdom. The manual annotation of cytochrome P450 genes in the genome of Vitis vinifera PN40024 revealed 579 P450 sequences, including 279 complete genes. Most of the P450 sequences in grapevine genome are organized in physical clusters, resulting from tandem or segmental duplications. Although most of these clusters are small (2 to 35, median = 3), some P450 families, such as CYP76 and CYP82, underwent multiple duplications and form large clusters of homologous sequences. Analysis of gene expression revealed highly specific expression patterns, which are often the same within the genes in large physical clusters. Some of these genes are induced upon biotic stress, which points to their role in plant defense, whereas others are specifically activated during grape berry ripening and might be responsible for the production of berry-specific metabolites, such as aroma compounds. Our work provides an exhaustive and robust annotation including clear identification, structural organization, evolutionary dynamics and expression patterns for the grapevine cytochrome P450 families, paving the way to efficient functional characterization of genes involved in grapevine defense pathways and aroma biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2810530720,"KCa3.1 (also known as SK4 or IK1) is a mammalian intermediate-conductance potassium channel that plays a critical role in the activation of T cells, B cells, and mast cells, effluxing potassium ions to maintain a negative membrane potential for influxing calcium ions. KCa3.1 shares primary sequence similarity with three other (low-conductance) potassium channels: KCa2.1, KCa2.2, and KCa2.3 (also known as SK1-3). These four homotetrameric channels bind calmodulin (CaM) in the cytoplasmic region, and calcium binding to CaM triggers channel activation. Unique to KCa3.1, activation also requires phosphorylation of a single histidine residue, His358, in the cytoplasmic region, which relieves copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Near the cytoplasmic C-terminus of KCa3.1 (and KCa2.1-2.3), secondary-structure analysis predicts the presence of a coiled-coil/heptad repeat. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal coiled-coil region of KCa3.1, which forms a parallel four-helix bundle, consistent with the tetrameric nature of the channel. Interestingly, the four copies of a histidine residue, His389, in an 'a' position within the heptad repeat, are observed to bind a copper ion along the four-fold axis of the bundle. These results suggest that His358, the inhibitory histidine in KCa3.1, might coordinate a copper ion through a similar binding mode."
https://openalex.org/W2811372533,"Uncaria macrophylla Wall. is an important Chinese medicinal herb. Rhynchophylline (RIN) and isorhynchophylline (IRN) are its major active compounds. We investigated the influence of genetic differentiation and environmental factors on the RIN and IRN to find the main influencing factors of their contents and lay the foundation for the following cultivation and breeding. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to investigate the genetic diversity, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the contents of RIN and IRN in 200 samples of U. macrophylla obtained from nine natural populations, and then to analyze the correlation between genetic differentiation, environmental factors of sampling sites and the contents of RIN and IRN. We found that High intra-population (80.05%) and low inter-population (19.95%) genetic diversity existed in the samples of U. macrophylla. To some extent, genetic differentiation and the contents of RIN and IRN had correlation in individual populations (such as JH, MH, XM, and ML). The RIN and IRN contents were significant negatively correlated with the precipitation in May (RIRN = -0.771, p = 0.015) and June (RRIN = -0.814, p = 0.008; RIRN = -0.921, p = 0.000), indicating that precipitation was the main affecting factor of their contents. Interestingly, the analysis results showed that the RIN content had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.585, p = 0.000) with the IRN content (they are isomers); the proportion of RIN had a significant negative correlation with the sum of the two (r = –0.390, p<0.0001), while the proportion of IRN had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.390, p<0.0001). It meant that, with the total quantity of the two compounds increased, the proportion of RIN decreased and the proportion of IRN increased, illustrating that their conversion exist some regularity. Moreover, the content ratio of RIN and IRN was significant positively correlated with the January precipitation (r = 0.716, p = 0.030), implying that January may be the key period for the mutual transformation of RIN and IRN."

https://openalex.org/W2810265187,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in children. This study investigated the use of rehabilitation treatment in Taiwan. We selected children aged 3-12 years from the National Health Insurance Research Database from 2008 to 2012 and included them in the analysis. The children who received a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification were divided into two groups: ADHD and non-ADHD. We used the chi-squared test, independent sample t test, and multiple regression analysis to conduct the analysis. The utilisation of rehabilitation resources was higher in the ADHD group than in the non-ADHD group. The number of school-aged children with ADHD was higher than the number of preschool-aged children (p < 0.001). The highest utilisation of rehabilitation resources was observed in clinics (p < 0.001). In terms of region, Taipei exhibited the highest utilisation of rehabilitation resources, and the East exhibited the lowest resource utilisation (p < 0.001). Prediction of the use of rehabilitation resources, average cost, average frequency of visits, and total annual cost was affected by factors such as the average frequency of rehabilitation use, demographic characteristics, and the hospital characteristics and location (p < 0.001). The number of children with ADHD and rehabilitation use are increasing yearly; however, limitations in payment restrict the growth of rehabilitation resource use in hospitals. Supplementation of rehabilitation resources at clinics accounts for more than 60%, however, the total annual cost is less than what is observed for hospitals (p < 0.001). Policies should be established to aid in the early detection and treatment of children with ADHD to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the family burden and treatment expenditure in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2810408130,"The propagation of concepts in a population of agents is a form of influence spread, which can be modelled as a cascade from a set of initially activated individuals. The study of such influence cascades, in particular the identification of influential individuals, has a wide range of applications including epidemic control, viral marketing and the study of social norms. In real-world environments there may be many concepts spreading and interacting. These interactions can affect the spread of a given concept, either boosting it and allowing it to spread further, or inhibiting it and limiting its capability to spread. Previous work does not consider how the interactions between concepts affect concept spread. Taking concept interactions into consideration allows for indirect concept manipulation, meaning that we can affect concepts we are not able to directly control. In this paper, we consider the problem of indirect concept manipulation, and propose heuristics for indirectly boosting or inhibiting concept spread in environments where concepts interact. We define a framework that allows for the interactions between any number of concepts to be represented, and present a heuristic that aims to identify important influence paths for a given target concept in order to manipulate its spread. We compare the performance of this heuristic, called maximum probable gain, against established heuristics for manipulating influence spread."
