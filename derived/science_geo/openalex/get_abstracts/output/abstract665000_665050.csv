https://openalex.org/W3111517196,"Interactions between electrons and the topology of their energy bands can create unusual quantum phases of matter. Most topological electronic phases appear in systems with weak electron–electron interactions. The instances in which topological phases emerge only as a result of strong interactions are rare and mostly limited to those realized in intense magnetic fields1. The discovery of flat electronic bands with topological character in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has created a unique opportunity to search for strongly correlated topological phases2–9. Here we introduce a local spectroscopic technique using a scanning tunnelling microscope to detect a sequence of topological insulators in MATBG with Chern numbers C = ±1, ±2 and ±3, which form near filling factors of ±3, ±2 and ±1 electrons per moiré unit cell, respectively, and are stabilized by modest magnetic fields. One of the phases detected here (C = +1) was previously observed when the sublattice symmetry of MATBG was intentionally broken by a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, with interactions having a secondary role9. We demonstrate that strong electron–electron interactions alone can produce not only the previously observed phase, but also other unexpected Chern insulating phases in MATBG. The full sequence of phases that we observe can be understood by postulating that strong correlations favour breaking time-reversal symmetry to form Chern insulators that are stabilized by weak magnetic fields. Our findings illustrate that many-body correlations can create topological phases in moiré systems beyond those anticipated from weakly interacting models. Strong electron–electron interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene can fundamentally change the topology of the system’s flat bands, producing a hierarchy of strongly correlated topological insulators in modest magnetic fields."

https://openalex.org/W3112289427,"The cohesin complex has an essential role in maintaining genome organization. However, its role in gene regulation remains largely unresolved. Here we report that the cohesin release factor WAPL creates a pool of free cohesin, in a process known as cohesin turnover, which reloads it to cell-type-specific binding sites. Paradoxically, stabilization of cohesin binding, following WAPL ablation, results in depletion of cohesin from these cell-type-specific regions, loss of gene expression and differentiation. Chromosome conformation capture experiments show that cohesin turnover is important for maintaining promoter-enhancer loops. Binding of cohesin to cell-type-specific sites is dependent on the pioneer transcription factors OCT4 (POU5F1) and SOX2, but not NANOG. We show the importance of cohesin turnover in controlling transcription and propose that a cycle of cohesin loading and off-loading, instead of static cohesin binding, mediates promoter and enhancer interactions critical for gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3111461173,"Microglial surveillance is a key feature of brain physiology and disease. Here, we found that Gi-dependent microglial dynamics prevent neuronal network hyperexcitability. By generating MgPTX mice to genetically inhibit Gi in microglia, we show that sustained reduction of microglia brain surveillance and directed process motility induced spontaneous seizures and increased hypersynchrony after physiologically evoked neuronal activity in awake adult mice. Thus, Gi-dependent microglia dynamics may prevent hyperexcitability in neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3110957961,"Generating accurate genome assemblies of large, repeat-rich human genomes has proved difficult using only long, error-prone reads, and most human genomes assembled from long reads add accurate short reads to polish the consensus sequence. Here we report an algorithm for hybrid assembly, WENGAN, that provides very high quality at low computational cost. We demonstrate de novo assembly of four human genomes using a combination of sequencing data generated on ONT PromethION, PacBio Sequel, Illumina and MGI technology. WENGAN implements efficient algorithms to improve assembly contiguity as well as consensus quality. The resulting genome assemblies have high contiguity (contig NG50: 17.24-80.64 Mb), few assembly errors (contig NGA50: 11.8-59.59 Mb), good consensus quality (QV: 27.84-42.88) and high gene completeness (BUSCO complete: 94.6-95.2%), while consuming low computational resources (CPU hours: 187-1,200). In particular, the WENGAN assembly of the haploid CHM13 sample achieved a contig NG50 of 80.64 Mb (NGA50: 59.59 Mb), which surpasses the contiguity of the current human reference genome (GRCh38 contig NG50: 57.88 Mb)."
https://openalex.org/W3111798125,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective method for detecting lung illnesses, including COVID-19. However, the CT scan is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, this work focus on detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images because it is widely available, faster, and cheaper than CT scan. Many machine learning approaches such as Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine; have used X-ray for detecting the COVID-19. Although the performance of those approaches is acceptable in terms of accuracy, however, they require high computational time and more memory space. Therefore, this work employs an Optimised Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (OGA-ELM) with three selection criteria (i.e., random, K-tournament, and roulette wheel) to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The most crucial strength factors of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are: (i) high capability of the ELM in avoiding overfitting; (ii) its usability on binary and multi-type classifiers; and (iii) ELM could work as a kernel-based support vector machine with a structure of a neural network. These advantages make the ELM efficient in achieving an excellent learning performance. ELMs have successfully been applied in many domains, including medical domains such as breast cancer detection, pathological brain detection, and ductal carcinoma in situ detection, but not yet tested on detecting COVID-19. Hence, this work aims to identify the effectiveness of employing OGA-ELM in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In order to reduce the dimensionality of a histogram oriented gradient features, we use principal component analysis. The performance of OGA-ELM is evaluated on a benchmark dataset containing 188 chest X-ray images with two classes: a healthy and a COVID-19 infected. The experimental result shows that the OGA-ELM achieves 100.00% accuracy with fast computation time. This demonstrates that OGA-ELM is an efficient method for COVID-19 detecting using chest X-ray images."

Demographics, comorbidities, clinical course, outcomes and characteristics linked to hospitalization were analyzed including temporal survival analysis. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a least one major comorbidity. Mortality without comorbidity was in 3.8% patients. Further investigation of admission features and medical history was conducted. Comorbidities associated with mortality were diabetes (n = 54 deceased/73 diagnosed,74% tested POS;98.2% with diabetic history deceased; Wilcoxon p ( Wp ) = .044), hypertension (14/44,32% POS, 25.5%; Wp = 0.030), renal (6/16, 37.5% POS,11%; Wp = 0.000), and cardiac (6/21, 28.6% POS,11%; Wp = 0.015). Kaplan survival plots were statistically significant for these four indicators. Data suggested glucose &gt;215 or hemoglobin A1c &gt;9.5 for young adults on admission was associated with increased mortality. Clinically documented respiratory distress on admission was statistically significant outcome related to mortality ( X 2 = 236.6842, df = 1, p &lt; .0001). Overall, 28.9% required supportive oxygen beyond nasal cannula. Nasal cannula oxygen alone was required for 71.1%, who all lived. Non-invasive ventilation was required for 7.8%, and invasive mechanical ventilation 21.0% (in which 7.3% lived, 13.7% died). Temporal survival analysis demonstrated statistically significant response for Time to Death &lt;10 days ( X 2 = 18.508, df = 1, p = .000); risk lessened considerably for 21 day cut off ( X 2 = 3.464, df = 1, p = .063), followed by 31 or more days of hospitalization ( X 2 = 2.212, df = 1, p = .137)."
https://openalex.org/W3113041785,"There has been significant concern regarding fertility and reproductive outcomes during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2 , in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2 , Cathepsin B ( CTSB ), and Cathepsin L ( CTSL ) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2."
https://openalex.org/W3113005496,"Background Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of N95 respirators compared with medical masks to protect against acute respiratory infections. However, these studies are limited by modest sample sizes and inconclusive results. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to review the relevant and available published RCTs with the aid of the increased power of meta-analytic methods in order to assess the effectiveness of medical masks and N95 respirators in reducing the risk of respiratory infections. Methods This meta-analysis follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for conducting and reporting results. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception through April 1, 2020 to identify potentially relevant studies. Two authors (LS and JS) independently searched the titles and abstracts of the potentially eligible articles. They independently retrieved required data from the eligible trials; the data were initially tabulated for statistical analysis. Two authors (JRL and LS) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. Results Six articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed that N95 respirators did not reduce the risk of infection with respiratory viruses compared with medical/surgical masks (5.7% vs. 7.9%; RR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.88–1.41; p = 0.36); however, there was no statistically significant difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza between N95 and medical masks (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.07; p = 0.26). Medical masks provided similar protection against other viruses, including coronavirus (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.32–1.73; p = 0.49). Respiratory illness, as well as influenza-like illness were less frequently observed with N95 respirators. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that there are insufficient data to definitively determine whether N95 respirators are superior to medical masks in protection against transmissible acute respiratory infections. Further randomized trials are necessary to compare the above methods of respiratory protection in the context of COVID-19 incidence."
https://openalex.org/W3113105532,"Background and aim Nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) are common in cancer patients and the negative impacts on nutritional status indicate the need for research, diagnosis and nutritional intervention in order to reduce the risk of malnutrition. We aimed to verify the presence of malnutrition, the need for nutritional intervention, NIS and their influence on the nutritional status of surgical patients with cancer. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a public tertiary hospital, from March 2017 to October 2019. Nutritional status, the need for nutritional intervention and NIS were assessed through the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) in the first 48 hours of hospital admission. Results Among the 135 patients evaluated, 55.6% were elderly and 51.1% were male; patients had a median age of 62 years and a predominance of cancer located in the lower gastrointestinal tract (35.6%). Malnutrition and the need for nutritional intervention were identified in 60.0% and 90.4% of cases, respectively. The presence of three or more NIS was reported by 51.9% of patients. Significant differences in NIS were observed according to sex, PG-SGA classification and PG-SGA score. After logistic regression analysis, it was determined that the symptoms that increased the chances of malnutrition were anorexia, constipation, strange taste, mouth sores and others (depression, dental or financial problems). Conclusion Malnutrition, the need for nutritional intervention and the presence of three or more NIS were elevated in the patients evaluated. Malnutrition was associated with the presence of NIS, indicating the need for attention and care in antineoplastic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3111251072,"Introduction Information about how patients with advanced heart failure (HF) live and cope with their disease remains scarce. The objective of this study was to explore, from phenomenological and holistic perspectives, the experiences of patients suffering from advanced HF, attended at home in the primary care setting in 2018. Materials and methods Qualitative study conducted in 4 primary healthcare centers in Barcelona (Spain). Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted in advanced HF patients, aged over 65 and visited regularly at home. We developed a purposeful sampling, accounting for variability in gender, age, and socioeconomic level. Leventhal’s framework was used to analyze the interviews. Results Participants received insufficient and contradictory information about HF. They talked about their cognitive representation and claimed a better communication with healthcare professionals. Due to their advanced age, subjects considered their daily living limitations to be normal rather than as a consequence of HF. Gender differences in emotional representation were clearly observed. Women considered themselves the keystone of correct family “functioning” and thought that they were not useful if they could not correspond to gendered societal expectations. Cognitive coping strategies included specific diets, taking medication, and registering weight and blood pressure. Nevertheless, they perceived the locus of control as external and felt unable to manage HF progression. Their emotional coping strategies included some activities at home such as watching television and reading. Social support was perceived crucial to the whole process. Conclusions Locus of control in advanced HF was perceived as external. Healthcare professionals should adapt emotional health interventions in patients with advanced HF based on a gender perspective. Social support was found to be crucial in facing the disease. Patients reported poor communication with healthcare professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3112669406,"Brown rot fungi have great potential in biorefinery wood conversion systems because they are the primary wood decomposers in coniferous forests and have an efficient lignocellulose degrading system. Their initial wood degradation mechanism is thought to consist of an oxidative radical-based system that acts sequentially with an enzymatic saccharification system, but the complete molecular mechanism of this system has not yet been elucidated. Some studies have shown that wood degradation mechanisms of brown rot fungi have diversity in their substrate selectivity. Gloeophyllum trabeum , one of the most studied brown rot species, has broad substrate selectivity and even can degrade some grasses. However, the basis for this broad substrate specificity is poorly understood. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analyses on G . trabeum grown on media containing glucose, cellulose, or Japanese cedar ( Cryptomeria japonica ) as the sole carbon source. Comparison to the gene expression on glucose, 1,129 genes were upregulated on cellulose and 1,516 genes were upregulated on cedar. Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZyme) genes upregulated on cellulose and cedar media by G . trabeum included glycoside hyrolase family 12 (GH12), GH131, carbohydrate esterase family 1 (CE1), auxiliary activities family 3 subfamily 1 (AA3_1), AA3_2, AA3_4 and AA9, which is a newly reported expression pattern for brown rot fungi. The upregulation of both terpene synthase and cytochrome P450 genes on cedar media suggests the potential importance of these gene products in the production of secondary metabolites associated with the chelator-mediated Fenton reaction. These results provide new insights into the inherent wood degradation mechanism of G . trabeum and the diversity of brown rot mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3112593059,"Increased oxidative stress in obesity and diabetes is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. Levels of oxidative damage to DNA and RNA can be estimated through measurement of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2´-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) in urine. Both markers have been associated with type 2 diabetes, where especially 8-oxoGuo is prognostic for mortality risk. We hypothesized that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery that has considerable effects on bodyweight, hyperglycemia and mortality, might be working through mechanisms that reduce oxidative stress, thereby reducing levels of the urinary markers. We used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the content of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGuo in urinary samples from 356 obese patients treated with the RYGB-procedure. Mean age (SD) was 44.2 (9.6) years, BMI was 42.1 (5.6) kg/m 2 . Ninety-six (27%) of the patients had type 2 diabetes. Excretion levels of each marker before and after surgery were compared as estimates of the total 24-hour excretion, using a model based on glomerular filtration rate (calculated from cystatin C, age, height and weight), plasma- and urinary creatinine. The excretion of 8-oxodG increased in the first months after RYGB. For 8-oxoGuo, a gradual decrease was seen. Two years after RYGB and a mean weight loss of 35 kg, decreased hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, excretion levels of both markers were reduced by approximately 12% ( P &lt; 0.001). For both markers, mean excretion levels were about 30% lower in the female subgroup ( P &lt; 0.0001). Also, in this subgroup, excretion of 8-oxodG was significantly lower in patients with than without diabetes. We conclude, that oxidative damage to nucleic acids, reflected in the excretion of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGuo, had decreased significantly two years after RYGB—indicating that reduced oxidative stress could be contributing to the many long-term benefits of RYGB-surgery in obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3049631170,"Ablation of miR-144/451 disrupts homeostasis of erythropoiesis. Myc, a protooncogenic protein, is essential for erythroblast proliferation but commits rapid downregulation during erythroid maturation. How erythroblasts orchestrate maturation processes through coding and non-coding genes is largely unknown. In this study, we use miR-144/451 knockout mice as in vivo model, G1E, MEL erythroblast lines and erythroblasts from fresh mouse fetal livers as in vitro systems to demonstrate that targeted depletion of miR-144/451 blocks erythroid nuclear condensation and enucleation. This is due, at least in part, to the continued high expression of Myc in erythroblasts when miR-144/451 is absent. Specifically, miR-144/451 directly inhibits Myc in erythroblasts. Loss of miR-144/451 locus derepresses, and thus, increases the expression of Myc. Sustained high levels of Myc in miR-144/451-depleted erythroblasts blocks erythroid differentiation. Moreover, Myc reversely regulates the expression of miR-144/451, forming a positive miR-144/451-Myc feedback to ensure the complete shutoff of Myc during erythropoiesis. Given that erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA1 activates miR-144/451 and inactivates Myc, our findings indicate that GATA1-miR-144/451-Myc network safeguards normal erythroid differentiation. Our findings also demonstrate that disruption of the miR-144/451-Myc crosstalk causes anemia, suggesting that miR-144/451 might be a potential therapeutic target in red cell diseases."

This study compared the interrater reliability of novice examiners for the skinfold (SKF) and A-mode ultrasound (US) methods of body composition assessment. Undergraduate Kinesiology majors (48 males, 32 females) with minimal training took both SKF and US measurements at three sites (males: chest, abdomen, thigh; females: triceps, suprailiac, thigh). Interrater reliability was significantly better for US compared to SKF at the thigh (ICC US = 0.975, ICC SKF = 0.912) and abdomen (ICC US = 0.984, ICC SKF = 0.693) for men and suprailiac (ICC US = 0.978, ICC SKF = 0.883) for women. Additionally, interrater reliability of the US method was superior to the SKF method for the estimate of male body fat percentage (ICC US = 0.990, ICC SKF = 0.862). The 95% CI was generally narrower for the US method than the SKF method at each site. The interrater reliability of the US method was superior to or equal to the SKF method for measuring subcutaneous body fat when novice examiners took the measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3112075744,"This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of sulfonylurea (SU) use in patients with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis. From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012, we selected the data of 3781 propensity-score-matched SU users and nonusers from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. The mean follow-up time for this study was 5.74 years. Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich standard error estimates were used to compare the risks of main outcomes between SU users and nonusers. The incidence of mortality during follow-up was 3.24 and 4.09 per 100 person-years for SU users and nonusers, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, and decompensated cirrhosis in SU users relative to SU nonusers were 0.79 (0.71–0.88), 0.69 (0.61–0.80), and 0.82 (0.66–1.03), respectively. The SU-associated lower risks of death and cardiovascular events seemed to have a dose–response trend. This population-based cohort study demonstrated that SU use was associated with lower risks of death and major cardiovascular events compared with SU non-use in patients with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis. SUs may be useful for glycemic management for patients with liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W3112603398,"Infections of diabetic foot ulcers are common, generally recalcitrant and often complicated by antibiotic resistance. Alternative antimicrobial strategies are needed. Phage therapy is a promising alternative that is being rediscovered. Despite phage therapy's 100-year history, there have been no investigations into patient thoughts and concerns. This study aimed to explore patient awareness of and concern about antibiotic resistance and gain insight into the perceptions of phage therapy among a patient group that could potentially benefit from phage therapy. Patients with an active or resolved (healed or amputated) diabetic foot ulcer were eligible to participate. A survey was distributed digitally to eligible patients across Scotland via the NHS Research Scotland Diabetes Network and hard copies were available in diabetic foot clinics at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow. A focus group of five survey respondents was held in Glasgow. Fifty-five survey responses were obtained. There was a high level of awareness (76.4%; N = 55) and concern (83.3%; N = 54) about antibiotic resistance. While largely aware of viruses, most patients had not heard of phage or phage therapy. Patients were no more concerned about phage than antibiotic therapy, with most suggesting more information could alleviate any concerns. Patient acceptability of phage therapy was high, a finding confirmed by the focus group. Patients are concerned about antibiotic resistance and supportive of 'new' antimicrobials. We have demonstrated that patients are supportive, enthusiastic and accepting of phage therapy. Although 'Western' phage therapy remains in its infancy, an understanding of patient ideas, concerns and expectations will be important in eventually shaping and successfully reintroducing phage therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3111335680,"The genus Angelica encompasses 80 species worldwide. Among them, only Angelica sinensis is widely used in China and Japan. To explore the quality and geographical distribution of A . sinensis , we collected 1,530 plants from Gansu Province and analyzed them for their contents of chlorogenic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), senkyunolide I(SI), senkyunolide A(SA), senkyunolide H (SH), coniferyl ferulate (CF), ligustilide (LI), and butenyl phthalide (BP) using UPLC. We also assessed the relationship between the ecological environment and quality of A . sinensis through maximum entropy modeling and a geographical information system. The habitat suitability distribution demonstrated that the most influential ecological factors for the growth of A . sinensis were altitude, precipitation during March, May, and December, precipitation during the wettest month, and the soil pH. The most suitable areas for cultivation are concentrated to the south of Gansu Province, including Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Dingxi City, Tianshui City, south of Wuwei City, east of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, north of Longnan City, and northwest of Pingliang City. The quality suitability regionalization analysis divulged that the most influential ecological factors for the index components of A . sinensis were the altitude, sunshine, rainfall, temperature, and soil pH. The highest quality A . sinensis grow in Dingxi City, Tangchang, Lixian, and Wen counties in Longnan City, Wushan County in Tianshui City, Lintan, Zhouqu, and Zhuoni counties in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Kangle and Linxia counties in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The experiment yielded highly accurate results (accuracy of 0.955), suggesting that the results were consistent with the actual distribution of A . sinensis in Gansu. The inferences of this research will naturally draw the attention of the authorities in the fields of natural resources and agriculture departments and provide a scientific basis for the rational selection of A . sinensis cultivation areas."
https://openalex.org/W3113235424,"Post-intensive care unit (ICU) sequelae, including physical and mental health problems, are relatively unexplored. Characteristics commonly used to predict outcome lack prognostic value when it comes to long-term physical recovery. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the incidence of non-recovery in long-stay ICU-patients. In this single-centre study, retrospective data of adults with an ICU stay &gt;48 hours who visited the specialized post-ICU clinic, and completed the Dutch RAND 36-item Short Form questionnaire at 3 and 12 months post-ICU, were retrieved from electronic patient records. In cases where physical functioning scores at 12 months were below reference values, patients were allocated to the physical non-recovery (NR) group. Significantly different baseline and (post-)ICU-characteristics were assessed for correlations with physical recovery at 12 months post-ICU. Of 250 patients, 110 (44%) fulfilled the criteria for the NR-group. Neither the severity of illness, type of admission, nor presence of sepsis did not differ between groups. However, NR-patients had a higher age, were more often female, and had a higher incidence of co-morbidities. Shorter LOS ICU, lower incidence of medical comorbidities, and better physical performance at 3 months were significantly correlated with 1-year physical recovery. Comorbidities and reduced physical functioning at 3 months were identified as independent risk-factors for long-term physical non-recovery. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of long-stay ICU-patients who visited the standard care post-ICU clinic did not fulfil the criteria for full physical recovery at 12 months post-ICU. Commonly used ICU-characteristics, such as severity of illness, do not have sufficient prognostic value when it comes to long-term recovery of health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3111562627,"Assessing chronic pain is a challenge given its subjective dimension. In humans, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool although the results of various studies are contradictory. Spontaneous chronic pain is understudied in animals but could be of the highest interest for a comparative study. Riding horses show a very high prevalence of back disorders thought to be associated with chronic pain. Moreover, horses with known back problems show cognitive alterations, such as a lower attentional engagement. Therefore, we hypothesized that the individual EEG power profiles resting state ( i . e . quiet standing) of different horses could reflect the state of their back, that we measured using static sEMG, a tool first promoted to assess lower back pain in human patients. Results show that 1) EEG profiles are highly stable at the intra-individual level, 2) horses with elevated back tension showed resting state EEG profiles characterized by more fast (beta and gamma) and less slow (theta and alpha) waves. The proportion of theta waves was particularly negatively correlated with muscular tension along the spine. Moreover, elevated back tension was positively correlated with the frequency of stereotypic behaviours (an “addictive- like” repetitive behavior) performed by the horses in their stall. Resting state quantitative EEG appears therefore as a very promising tool that may allow to assess individual subjective chronic pain experience, beyond more objective measures of tension. These results open new lines of research for a multi-species comparative approach and might reveal very important in the context of animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3111712139,"Introduction Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) for respiratory virus testing is increasingly used in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), however data on one-year outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with reference to the causative pathogen are scarce. Materials and methods We performed a single-center retrospective study in 123 ICU patients who had undergone respiratory virus testing for CAP by mPCR and with known one-year survival status. Functional status including dyspnea (mMRC score), autonomy (ADL Katz score) and need for new home-care ventilatory support was assessed at a one-year post-ICU follow-up. Mortality rates and functional status were compared in patients with CAP of a bacterial, viral or unidentified etiology one year after ICU admission. Results The bacterial, viral and unidentified groups included 19 (15.4%), 37 (30.1%), and 67 (54.5%) patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, one-year mortality in the bacterial group was higher compared to the viral group (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.71–7.28, p = 0.02) and tended to be higher compared to the unidentified etiology group ( p = 0.06); but no difference was found between the viral and the unidentified etiology group ( p = 0.43). In 64/83 one-year survivors with a post-ICU follow-up consultation, there were no differences in mMRC score, ADL Katz score and new home-care ventilatory support between the groups ( p = 0.52, p = 0.37, p = 0.24, respectively). Severe dyspnea (mMRC score = 4 or death), severe autonomy deficiencies (ADL Katz score ≤ 2 or death), and major adverse respiratory events (new home-care ventilatory support or death) were observed in 52/104 (50.0%), 47/104 (45.2%), and 65/104 (62.5%) patients, respectively; with no difference between the bacterial, viral and unidentified group: p = 0.58, p = 0.06, p = 0.61, respectively. Conclusions CAP of bacterial origin had a poorer outcome than CAP of viral or unidentified origin. At one-year, impairment of functional status was frequently observed, with no difference according to the etiology."
https://openalex.org/W3112611717,"Backgrounds Sevoflurane is a most frequently used volatile anesthetics, but its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. We hypothesized that specific genes play regulatory roles in brain exposed to sevoflurane. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sevoflurane inhalation and identify potential regulatory genes by RNA-seq analysis. Methods Eight-week old mice were exposed to sevoflurane. RNA from medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus were analysed using RNA-seq. Differently expressed genes were extracted and their gene ontology terms were analysed using Metascape. These our anesthetized mouse data and the transcriptome array data of the cerebral cortex of sleeping mice were compared. Finally, the activities of transcription factors were evaluated using a weighted parametric gene set analysis (wPGSA). JASPAR was used to confirm the existence of binding motifs in the upstream sequences of the differently expressed genes. Results The gene ontology term enrichment analysis result suggests that sevoflurane inhalation upregulated angiogenesis and downregulated neural differentiation in each region of brain. The comparison with the brains of sleeping mice showed that the gene expression changes were specific to anesthetized mice. Focusing on individual genes, sevoflurane induced Klf4 upregulation in all sampled parts of brain. wPGSA supported the function of KLF4 as a transcription factor, and KLF4-binding motifs were present in many regulatory regions of the differentially expressed genes. Conclusions Klf4 was upregulated by sevoflurane inhalation in the mouse brain. The roles of KLF4 might be key to elucidating the mechanisms of sevoflurane induced functional modification in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3112854227,"Physical inactivity and sleep disturbances are major problems in an ageing society. There is increasing evidence that physical activity is associated with sleep quality. However, the association between daily walking steps and sleep remain unclear. This prospective study examined the relationship between objectively measured daily walking steps and sleep parameters in Japanese community-dwelling older adults. In total, 855 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and above, with an uninterrupted follow-up from August 2015 to March 2016, were enrolled. The participants wore a wristband sensor for an average of 7.8 days every three months. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between daily walking steps and sleep parameters, including the total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset (WASO), awakening time count during the night, and naptime. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age of the participants was 73 (69–78) years, with 317 (37.1%) men and 538 (62.9%) women. The median (IQR) educational level was 12 (11–12) years, and the median (IQR) Mini-Mental State Examination score was 29 (27–30) points. The number of daily walking steps showed a positive correlation with sleep efficiency and an inverse correlation with WASO, awakening time count, and naptime, after adjusting for covariates and correcting for the false discovery rate ( β = 0.098, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.034 to 0.162, p = 0.003; β = −0.107, 95% CI: −0.172 to −0.043, p = 0.001; β = −0.105, 95% CI: −0.17 to −0.04, p = 0.002; and β = −0.31, 95% CI: −0.371 to −0.249, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Our results can help promote walking as an intervention for preventing sleep disturbances in community-dwelling older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3111585833,"(4 S )-4-(3-[ 18 F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid ([ 18 F]FSPG) is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for measuring the system x C − transporter activity. It has been used for the detection of various cancers and metastasis in clinical trials. [ 18 F]FSPG is also a promising diagnostic tool for evaluation of multiple sclerosis, drug resistance in chemotherapy, inflammatory brain diseases, and infectious lesions. Due to the very short half-life (110 min) of 18 F nuclide, [ 18 F]FSPG needs to be produced on a daily basis; therefore, fast and efficient synthesis and analytical methods for quality control must be established to assure the quality and safety of [ 18 F]FSPG for clinical use. To manufacture cGMP-compliant [ 18 F]FSPG, all four nonradioactive stereoisomers of FSPG were prepared as reference standards for analysis. (2 S ,4 S )- 1 and (2 R ,4 R )- 1 were synthesized starting from protected L- and D-glutamate derivatives in three steps, whereas (2 S ,4 R )- 1 and (2 R ,4 S )- 1 were prepared in three steps from protected ( S )- and ( R )-pyroglutamates. A chiral HPLC method for simultaneous determination of four FSPG stereoisomers was developed by using a 3-cm Chirex 3126 column and a MeCN/CuSO 4(aq) mobile phase. In this method, (2 R ,4 S )- 1 , (2 S ,4 S )- 1 , (2 R ,4 R )- 1 , and (2 S ,4 R )- 1 were eluted in sequence with sufficient resolution in less than 25 min without derivatization. Scale-up synthesis of intermediates for the production of [ 18 F]FSPG in high optical purity was achieved via stereo-selective synthesis or resolution by recrystallization. The enantiomeric excess of intermediates was determined by HPLC using a Chiralcel OD column and monitored at 220 nm. The nonradioactive precursor with &gt;98% ee can be readily distributed to other facilities for the production of [ 18 F]FSPG. Based on the above accomplishments, cGMP-compliant [ 18 F]FSPG met the acceptance criteria in specifications and was successfully manufactured for human use. It has been routinely prepared and used in several pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma metastasis-related clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3112028671,"Masculinity-related morphological traits are supposed to be honest indicators of a man's biological quality. While some studies showed that sexually dimorphic traits are related to various aspects of biological condition such as general health, immunity or fertility, still little is known about the relationship between masculine traits and the effectiveness of innate and adaptive immunity in humans. The aim of this study was to see if masculine traits, which are dependent on androgen levels in foetal and pubertal stages of development, are related to the immune quality in healthy men. The immune quality was evaluated for 91 healthy men aged 19–36 years. Immunity measurements included innate and adaptive parameters. General health status, age, testosterone level, BMI, physical activity, and smoking were controlled. The shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), 2D:4D digit ratio and hand-grip strength (HGS) were used as markers of masculinization. The regressions showed that when controlling for confounds, masculinity-related traits were in general not related to innate and adaptive immunity. Only a weak association was observed for right 2D:4D ratio and T-lymphocyte counts (but it becomes non-significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Our results do not support the premise that masculinity is a cue for immunological quality in men. However, the positive association between right 2D:4D and T lymphocytes might suggest that further studies are needed to verify if androgen stimulation in prenatal development might be related to immunity in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3112074015,"Background Escherichia coli O157 is an emerging foodborne pathogen of great public health concern. It has been associated with bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Most human infections have been traced to cattle and the consumption of contaminated cattle products. In order to understand the risk associated with the consumption of cattle products, this study sought to investigate the prevalence and identify virulence genes in E . coli O157 from cattle in Cameroon. Method A total of 512 rectal samples were obtained and analysed using conventional bacteriological methods (enrichment on modified Tryptone Soy Broth and selective plating on Cefixime-Tellurite Sorbitol Mac-Conkey Agar) for the isolation of E . coli O157. Presumptive E . coli O157 isolates were confirmed serologically using E. COLIPRO TM O157 latex agglutination test and molecularly using PCR targeting the rfb gene in the isolates. Characterisation of the confirmed E . coli O157 strains was done by amplification of stx1 , stx2 , eaeA and hlyA virulence genes using both singleplex and multiplex PCR. Results E . coli O157 was detected in 56 (10.9%) of the 512 samples examined. The presence of the virulence genes stx2 , eaeA and hylA was demonstrated in 96.4% (54/56) of the isolates and stx1 in 40 (71.4%) of the 54. The isolates exhibited three genetic profiles (I-III) with I ( stx1 , stx2 , eaeA and hlyA ) being the most prevalent (40/56; 71.4%) while two isolates had none of the virulence genes tested. Conclusion A proportion of cattle slaughtered in abattoirs in Buea are infected with pathogenic E . coli O157 and could be a potential source of human infections. We recommend proper animal food processing measures and proper hygiene be prescribed and implemented to reduce the risk of beef contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3111623411,"A suite of factors may have contributed to declines in the tītī (sooty shearwater; Ardenna grisea ) population in the New Zealand region since at least the 1960s. Recent estimation of the magnitude of most sources of non-natural mortality has presented the opportunity to quantitatively assess the relative importance of these factors. We fit a range of population dynamics models to a time-series of relative abundance data from 1976 until 2005, with the various sources of mortality being modelled at the appropriate part of the life-cycle. We present estimates of effects obtained from the best-fitting model and using model averaging. The best-fitting models explained much of the variation in the abundance index when survival and fecundity were linked to the Southern Oscillation Index, with strong decreases in adult survival, juvenile survival and fecundity being related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Predation by introduced animals, harvesting by humans, and bycatch in fisheries also appear to have contributed to the population decline. It is envisioned that the best-fitting models will form the basis for quantitative assessments of competing management strategies. Our analysis suggests that sustainability of the New Zealand tītī population will be most influenced by climate, in particular by how climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of ENSO events in the future. Removal of the effects of both depredation by introduced predators and harvesting by humans is likely to have fewer benefits for the population than alleviating climate effects."

Fifty percent of respondents were aware of HIV/AIDS, with 21% and 22% exhibiting good knowledge and positive attitudes towards people with HIV/AIDS, respectively. When controlled for individual and community-level variables, younger women (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01–162), women with primary (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.86–2.58) and secondary (AOR = 4.48; 95% CI: 3.38–5.93) education, and those living in urban areas (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12–1.76) had significantly good knowledge. Women in the richer (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.08–2.36) and the richest (AOR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.35–3.02) wealth quintiles had significant positive attitudes towards people with HIV/AIDS. Well-designed social and behavioural campaigns targeting uneducated women and those living in rural and remote settings will enhance knowledge of perceived risk, awareness, and ability to carry out preventive behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3111388544,"Background Little is known about the effects of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and left atrial enlargement (LAE). Methods Data of patients with AF were retrieved from Chang Gung Research Database during 2007–2016. We excluded patients who were not using oral anticoagulants, used anticoagulants for &lt;30 days, used ≥2 agents concomitantly or switched anticoagulants, had left atrial diameter missing from their data, were aged &lt;65, had received valve surgeries, had mitral stenosis, or had a history of cancer. The primary outcomes were ischemic stroke (IS)/systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding, and death from any cause. Results We identified 40,777 patients who received a diagnosis of AF. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 6,445 patients remained, 4,922 with LAE, and they were followed up for 2.4 ±1.9 years. The mean age of the patients was 77.32 ± 0.18 in the NOAC group and 76.58 ± 6.91 in the warfarin group ( p &lt; 0.0001); 48.24% of patients in the NOAC group and 46.98% of patients in the warfarin group were men ( p &gt; 0.05). The mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.26 ± 1.05 in the NOAC group and 3.07 ± 1.12 in the warfarin group ( p &lt; 0.0001). The mean HAS-BLED score was 3.87 ± 3.81 in the NOAC group and 3.86 ± 3.80 in the warfarin group ( p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the mean LA diameter was 4.75 ± 0.63 cm in the warfarin group and 4.79 ± 0.69 cm in the warfarin group ( p &gt; 0.05). Among patients with LAE, NOAC was associated with significantly reduced IS/SE events (CRR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.52–0.77), no difference in major bleeding (CRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.78–1.05), and significantly reduced death from any cause (aHR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.52–0.80) compared with warfarin. Conclusions In elderly patients with AF and LAE, NOAC was associated with reduced IS/SE and death from any cause compared with warfarin, whereas no difference in major bleeding was observed between these treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3111786481,"Rising incidence of extended- spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) induced urinary tract infections (UTIs) is an increasing concern worldwide. Thus, it is of paramount importance to investigate novel approaches that can facilitate the identification and guide empiric antibiotic therapy in such episodes. The study aimed to evaluate the usability of antecedent ESBL-positive urine culture to predict the pathogenic identity of future ones. Moreover, the study evaluated the accuracy of selected empiric therapy in index episodes. This was a retrospective study that included 693 cases with paired UTI episodes, linked to two separate hospital admissions within 12 month-period, and a conditional previous ESBL positive episode. Pertinent information was obtained by reviewing patients’ medical records and computerized laboratory results. Multivariate analysis showed that shorter interval between index and previous episodes was significantly associated with increased chance of ESBL-positive results in current culture (OR = 0.912, 95CI% = 0.863–0.963, p = 0.001). Additionally, cases with ESBL-positive results in current culture were more likely to have underlying urological/surgical condition (OR = 1.416, 95CI% = 1.018–1.969, p = 0.039). Investigations of the accuracy of current empirical therapy revealed that male patients were less accurately treated compared to female patients (OR = 0.528, 95CI% = 0.289–0.963, p = 0.037). Furthermore, surgical patients were treated less accurately compared to those treated in internal ward (OR = 0.451, 95CI% = 0.234–0.870, p = 0.018). Selecting an agent concordant with previous microbiologic data significantly increased the accuracy of ESBL-UTIs therapy (p&lt;0.001). A quick survey of the previous ESBL urine culture results can guide practitioners in the selection of empiric therapy for the pending current culture and thus improve treatment accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W3112598031,"The morphological and morphometric characters of seeds belonging to 11 species of the subtribe Pleurothallidinae using light and scanning electron microscopy were studied to understand the in vitro germination process. Qualitative data (color, shape, ornamentation) and quantitative ones were also evaluated in seeds and embryos (length, width, volume and air space percentage between the integument and the embryo). The viability of the seeds was evaluated by in vitro germination in woody plant medium (WPM), and by analysis of the developmental stages of protocorms until seedling formation (two to 24 weeks). Morphometric data showed variations within the genus Acianthera and between species of different genera. The best germination and protocorm formation responses occurred with Acianthera prolifera (92%) and Acianthera ochreata (86%), with the formation of seedlings after 12 and 16 weeks of sowing, respectively. The seeds and embryos of A . prolifera and A . ochreata were larger (length, width, and volume) with a structural polarity that may have facilitated their germination comparing to others studied species. Other characteristics of A . prolifera seeds that may have contributed to these results include the presence of a thin testa without ornamentation and a suspensor. The protocorms of Anathalis obovata , Dryadella liliputiana , and Octomeria gracillis developed slowly in the WPM, not reaching the seedling stage in 24 weeks of cultivation. This morphological and morphometric study contributes to the understanding of asymbiotic germination of some micro-orchid species."

Design Retrospective cohort of 9,026 smear-positive patients aged 15–49 years. All-cause mortality during TB treatment was the outcome of interest. Time to start of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation was considered as a proxy for CD4 cell count. Those who took long to start of ART were assumed to have high CD4 cell count. Results Of the 9,026 observations analysed, 4,567(51%) and 4,459(49%) were women and men, respectively. Overall, out of the 9,026 patients, 8,154 (90%) had their treatment outcome as cured, the mean age in years (SD) was 33.3(7.5) and the mean body mass index (SD) was 18.2(3.4). Men were older (30% men’ vs 17% women in those ≥40 years, p = &lt;0.001) and had a lower BMI &lt;18.5 (55.3% men vs 50.6% women, p = &lt;0.001). Men tested later for HIV: 29% (1,317/4,567) of women HIV tested more than 3 months prior to TB treatment, as compared to 20% (912/4,459) men (p&lt;0.001). Mortality was higher in men 11% (471/4,459) compared to women 9% (401/4,567, p = 0.004). There was a 17% reduction in the risk of death among women (adjusted HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72–0.96; p = 0.013). Survival varied by age-groups, with women having significantly better survival than men, in the age-groups 40 years and over (log-rank p = 0.006). Conclusion Women with sputum positive PTB/HIV co-infection have a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality during TB treatment compared to men. Men were older, had lower BMI and tested later for HIV than women."
https://openalex.org/W3113209856,"Introduction The high failure rate of clinical trials in traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be attributable, in part, to the use of untested or insensitive measurement instruments. Of more than 1,000 clinical outcome assessment measures (COAs) for TBI, few have been systematically vetted to determine their performance within specific “contexts of use (COU).” As described in guidance issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the COU specifies the population of interest and the purpose for which the COA will be employed. COAs are commonly used for screening, diagnostic categorization, outcome prediction, and establishing treatment effectiveness. COA selection typically relies on expert consensus; there is no established methodology to match the appropriateness of a particular COA to a specific COU. We developed and pilot-tested the E vidence- B ased C linical O utcome assessment P latform (EB-COP) to systematically and transparently evaluate the suitability of TBI COAs for specific purposes. Methods and findings Following a review of existing literature and published guidelines on psychometric standards for COAs, we developed a 6-step, semi-automated, evidence-based assessment platform to grade COA performance for six specific purposes: diagnosis, symptom detection, prognosis, natural history, subgroup stratification and treatment effectiveness. Mandatory quality indicators (QIs) were identified for each purpose using a modified Delphi consensus-building process. The EB-COP framework was incorporated into a Qualtrics software platform and pilot-tested on the Glasgow Outcome Scale—Extended (GOSE), the most widely-used COA in TBI clinical studies. Conclusion The EB-COP provides a systematic methodology for conducting more precise, evidence-based assessment of COAs by evaluating performance within specific COUs. The EB-COP platform was shown to be feasible when applied to a TBI COA frequently used to detect treatment effects and can be modified to address other populations and COUs. Additional testing and validation of the EB-COP are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3111117942,"Background Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is an entrapment neuropathy, while ulnar nerve dislocation might also be involved in its incidence and severity. Wheelchair marathon athletes may be at an increased risk for Ulnar Neuropathy. However, there is a paucity of research into the prevalence of Ulnar Neuropathy and ulnar nerve dislocation in this population. Objective To investigate the prevalence of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow and ulnar nerve dislocation in wheelchair marathon athletes. Participants Wheelchair marathon athletes (N = 38) who participated in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 Oita International Wheelchair Marathon. 2 athletes participated only one time, 36 athletes repeatedly. Data from athletes`latest assessment were used. Methods The day before the race, questionnaires, physical examinations, and ultrasonography were conducted to screen for Ulnar Neuropathy in both upper limbs. Ulnar nerve dislocation was confirmed by physical examination and ultrasonography. Results 11 (29%) athletes were diagnosed with Ulnar Neuropathy. There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, Body Mass Index, or history of primary illness between athletes with and without Ulnar Neuropathy. In the group without Ulnar Neuropathy, 44% of athletes reported to have been engaging in other wheelchair sports, compared to 9% in the group with Ulnar Neuropathy (p = 0.037). Ulnar nerve dislocation was diagnosed in 15 (39%) athletes by ultrasonography. Out of the 14 elbows of 11 athletes diagnosed with Ulnar Neuropathy, 9 (64%) elbows had ulnar nerve dislocation. Conclusion The prevalence of Ulnar Neuropathy in wheelchair marathon athletes was higher than previously reported in able-bodied, non-athlete individuals and lower than in non-athletes with lower limb dysfunction. Therefore, while wheelchair sports may provide some protection against Ulnar Neuropathy, this study further supports the importance of screening for Ulnar Neuropathy, as well as for ulnar nerve dislocation as a potential risk factor for the development of Ulnar Neuropathy."

This study aimed to evaluate acid-base deteriorations in growing goats with experimentally induced NTM (nontuberculous mycobacteria) infections by application of the traditional Henderson-Hasselbalch approach and the strong ion model. NTM-challenged animals were orally inoculated with either Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH; n = 18) or Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP; n = 48). Twenty-five goats served as non-infected controls. Until 51 st week post-inoculation (wpi), blood gas analysis, serum biochemical analysis, and serum electrophoresis were performed on venous blood. Fifty percent (9/18) of goats inoculated with MAH developed acute clinical signs like apathy, fever, and diarrhea. Those animals died or had to be euthanized within 11 weeks post-inoculation. This acute form of NTM-infection was characterized by significantly lower concentrations of sodium, calcium, albumin, and total protein, as well as significantly higher concentrations of gamma globulin, associated with reduced albumin/globulin ratio. Acid-base status indicated alkalosis, but normal base excess and HCO 3 - concentrations, besides significantly reduced levels of SID (strong ion difference), A tot Alb (total plasma concentration of weak non-volatile acids, based on albumin), A tot TP (A tot based on total protein) and markedly lower SIG (strong ion gap). The remaining fifty percent (9/18) of MAH-infected goats and all goats challenged with MAP survived and presented a more sub-clinical, chronic form of infection mainly characterized by changes in serum protein profiles. With the progression of the disease, concentrations of gamma globulin, and total protein increased while albumin remained lower compared to controls. Consequently, significantly reduced albumin/globulin ratio and lower A tot Alb as well as higher A tot TP were observed. Changes were fully compensated with no effect on blood pH. Only the strong ion variables differentiated alterations in acid-base equilibrium during acute and chronic NTM-infection."
https://openalex.org/W3111380589,"Modern genomic data sets often involve multiple data-layers (e.g., DNA-sequence, gene expression), each of which itself can be high-dimensional. The biological processes underlying these data-layers can lead to intricate multivariate association patterns. We propose and evaluate two methods to determine the proportion of variance of an output data set that can be explained by an input data set when both data panels are high dimensional. Our approach uses random-effects models to estimate the proportion of variance of vectors in the linear span of the output set that can be explained by regression on the input set. We consider a method based on an orthogonal basis (Eigen-ANOVA) and one that uses random vectors (Monte Carlo ANOVA, MC-ANOVA) in the linear span of the output set. Using simulations, we show that the MC-ANOVA method gave nearly unbiased estimates. Estimates produced by Eigen-ANOVA were also nearly unbiased, except when the shared variance was very high (e.g., &gt;0.9). We demonstrate the potential insight that can be obtained from the use of MC-ANOVA and Eigen-ANOVA by applying these two methods to the study of multi-locus linkage disequilibrium in chicken ( Gallus gallus ) genomes and to the assessment of inter-dependencies between gene expression, methylation, and copy-number-variants in data from breast cancer tumors from humans ( Homo sapiens ). Our analyses reveal that in chicken breeding populations ~50,000 evenly-spaced SNPs are enough to fully capture the span of whole-genome-sequencing genomes. In the study of multi-omic breast cancer data, we found that the span of copy-number-variants can be fully explained using either methylation or gene expression data and that roughly 74% of the variance in gene expression can be predicted from methylation data."

In this study, we investigate whether the gamma distribution (GD) model is useful in this differentiation of PNCSLs and GBs. Twenty-seven patients with PCNSLs and 57 patients with GBs were imaged with diffusion-weighted imaging using 13 b-values ranging from 0 to 1000 sec/mm 2 . The shape parameter (κ) and scale parameter (θ) were obtained with the GD model. Fractions of three different areas under the probability density function curve (f1, f2, f3) were defined as follows: f1, diffusion coefficient (D) &lt;1.0×10 −3 mm 2 /sec; f2, D &gt;1.0×10 −3 and &lt;3.0×10 −3 mm 2 /sec; f3, D &gt;3.0 × 10 −3 mm 2 /sec. The GD model-derived parameters were compared between PCNSLs and GBs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to assess diagnostic performance. The correlations with intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters were evaluated. The PCNSL group's κ (2.26 ± 1.00) was significantly smaller than the GB group's (3.62 ± 2.01, p = 0.0004). The PCNSL group's f1 (0.542 ± 0.107) was significantly larger than the GB group's (0.348 ± 0.132, p&lt;0.0001). The PCNSL group's f2 (0.372 ± 0.098) was significantly smaller than the GB group's (0.508 ± 0.127, p&lt;0.0001). The PCNSL group's f3 (0.086 ± 0.043) was significantly smaller than the GB group's (0.144 ± 0.062, p&lt;0.0001). The combination of κ, f1, and f3 showed excellent diagnostic performance (area under the curve, 0.909). The f1 had an almost perfect inverse correlation with D. The f2 and f3 had very strong positive correlations with D and f, respectively. The GD model is useful for the differentiation of GBs and PCNSLs."
https://openalex.org/W3111825284,"Numerous studies have shown that high life expectancy is closely related to low life disparity. Unlike life expectancy, which can be increased by mortality decline at any age, life disparity can either increase or decrease in response to mortality decline. Disparity can thus be decomposed into two opposite components, called compression and expansion, depending on the effect of mortality decline on the age distribution of mortality. Without specifying the two components, various conventional measures of disparity may provide misleading information relating to how life chances in society can be equalized. Based on the relevant properties of changes in disparity, we develop a new measure of disparity—the ratio of expansion to compression—that can account for the relative importance of the two components. This simple measure not only provides a clear view of the evolution of disparity, but also permits changes in disparity related to mortality decline to be interpreted in a consistent manner similar to life expectancy. Simulations and an empirical analysis demonstrated the advantages of this new measure over conventional measures of disparity."

We reviewed 114 patients with LDH scheduled to undergo surgery at our hospital. We measured the degrees of 1) lower back pain, 2) lower limb pain, and 3) lower limb numbness using the visual analog scale before the surgery. All answers and physical function data were subjected to partial least squares regression analysis. The degrees of lower back and lower limb pain could be used as a regression model from the JOABPEQ and had a significant causal relationship with them. However, the degree of lower limb numbness could not be used for the same. Based on our results, the questions of the JOABPEQ can be used to multilaterally understand the degree of lower back pain and lower limb pain in patients with LDH. However, the degree of lower limb numbness has no causal relationship, so actual measurement is essential."
https://openalex.org/W3113222529,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 347 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class A and pre-TACE serum creatinine (SCr) ≤1.5 mg/dL undergoing TACE as an initial therapy 2000–2014 were analyzed. Overall survival with related risk factors including AKI was investigated. We assessed AKI based on the International Club of Ascites (ICA)-AKI criteria. The mean age was 60.9 years. Of 347 patients, death was observed in 109 patients (31.4%). The mean SCr levels at pre-TACE, one day, two months, and four months after TACE were 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. The AKI within four months after TACE developed in 37 patients (11%). The AKI stages were non-AKI in 310 (89%), stage 1 in 10 (3%), stage 2 in 10 (3%), and stage 3 in 17 patients (5%). Multivariable analysis showed that the risk factors for overall survival were serum albumin ≤3.5 g/dL (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, p = 0.027), BCLC stage B (HR 2.07, p = 0.008), BCLC stage C (HR 3.96, p &lt;0.001), bilobar tumor location (HR 1.66, p = 0.022), AKI stage 1 (HR 6.09, p &lt;0.001), AKI stage 2 (HR 8.51, p &lt;0.001), and AKI stage 3 (HR 17.64, p &lt;0.001). AKI is a crucial prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients undergoing TACE. The assessment of AKI based on the ICA-AKI criteria can facilitate evaluation of the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing TACE."
https://openalex.org/W3110825259,"Background Because there are no published biochemical reference intervals (RI) for pregnant Taiwanese women, we used an established islandwide birth cohort, the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study, to establish RIs for important biochemical parameters in women during their 3rd trimester in Taiwan. Additionally, we compared the differences in these biochemical parameters between early third trimester (weeks 28 to 31) and late third trimester (weeks 37 to 40) of pregnant women as well as the differences in them between the third trimester and after delivery. Methods Between 2012 and 2015, we recruited a total of 2,136 pregnant women from nine hospitals located in northern (n = 3), central (n = 3), southern (n = 2), and eastern Taiwan (n = 1) to receive regular prenatal health examinations during their third trimester (weeks 28 to 40). After exclusion, samples obtained from 993 eligible pregnant women were analyzed. Results There were increases in both lower and upper normal limits for blood neutrophil, thyroid profile (triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)), testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone and decreases for RBC, hemoglobin (Hb), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr) during their third trimesters. Women in their late third trimester (n = 378) had higher median RBC, Hb, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Cr, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone and lower median platelet and insulin, compared with those in their early third trimester (n = 490). Twenty-three of the women had both third trimester and post-pregnancy data. After delivery, the women had lower median AST, ALT, insulin, T3, T4, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone and higher median Cr, free T4, FSH, and luteinizing hormone (LH), compared to their third trimesters. Conclusions Gestation-related changes in important biochemical parameters should be considered when evaluating clinical laboratory values in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3111349286,"Introduction A sufficient oxygen supply to ischemic limb tissue is the most important requirement for wound healing and limb salvage. We investigated whether partial venous occlusion in the common iliac vein (CIV) causes a further increase of venous oxygenation in a porcine model of acute hindlimb ischemia. Materials and methods In 7 pigs, the model of acute hindlimb ischemia was created with intra-vascular embolization of the common iliac artery (CIA). The arterial and venous oxygen saturation was evaluated at different moments. Oxygen saturation was evaluated at baseline (T0), just after the arterial embolization (T1), at 10 minutes (T2), at 20 minutes (T3), and at 40 minutes (T4). Next, an intentional partial venous occlusion was achieved by inflating the vascular balloon at the level of the right CIV. Then, blood sampling was repeated at 5 minutes (T5), at 15 minutes (T6), and at 25 minutes (T7). Results The arterial oxygen saturation in the right SFA was similar during all phases. In contrast, after arterial embolization, an immediate reduction of venous oxygen saturation was observed (from 85.57 ± 1.72 at T0 to 71.86 ± 7.58 at T4). After the partial venous occlusion, interestingly, the venous oxygen saturations (T5-T7) were significantly increased, again. The venous oxygen saturations evaluated in the hindlimb ischemia with partial venous occlusion and in the control limb (without partial venous occlusion) were significantly over time. Venous oxygen saturations in the experimental limbs were higher than those in the control limbs (79.28 ± 4.82 vs 59.00 ± 2.82, p-value &lt;0.001, 79.71 ± 4.78 vs 60.00 ± 4.24 at T7, p-value &lt;0.001). Conclusions Partial venous occlusion results in an increase of venous oxygen saturation in the ischemic limb, while significant changes in venous oxygen saturation are not observed in the control limb. An explanation for this may be that the oxygen consumption in the limb tissue is increased because it gets congested with the partial venous occlusion in the right CIV."
https://openalex.org/W3111739445,"Recent research suggests that democratic presidential elections held using a runoff rule produce presidents that are more likely to protect human rights, in comparison to those elected under plurality rule; with this follow-up article, I seek to highlight the importance of advancing to a runoff round for those elections held using a runoff rule. I find that for presidential democracies that already have a runoff rule in place, country-years where the president has been elected after a runoff round are more likely to be associated with high government respect for human rights, in comparison to country-years where the president has been elected after only one round (that could have advanced to a runoff round, but did not). This article provides decision-makers with more information regarding the human rights consequences of runoff rounds, so that the costs and benefits of adopting (or retaining) variations of a runoff rule can be better weighed."
https://openalex.org/W3112075913,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic basidiomycetous yeast that primarily infects immunocompromised individuals. C . neoformans can thrive during infections due to its three main virulence-related characteristics: the ability to grow at host temperature (37°C), formation of carbohydrate capsule, and its ability to produce melanin. C . neoformans strains lacking septin proteins Cdc3 or Cdc12 are viable at 25°C; however, they fail to proliferate at 37°C and are avirulent in the murine model of infection. The basis of septin contribution to growth at host temperature remains unknown. Septins are a family of conserved filament-forming GTPases with roles in cytokinesis and morphogenesis. In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins are essential. S . cerevisiae septins form a higher order complex at the mother-bud neck to scaffold over 80 proteins, including those involved in cell wall organization, cell polarity, and cell cycle control. In C . neoformans , septins also form a complex at the mother-bud neck but the septin interacting proteome in this species remains largely unknown. Moreover, it remains possible that septins play other roles important for high temperature stress that are independent of their established role in cytokinesis. Therefore, we propose to perform a global analysis of septin Cdc10 binding partners in C . neoformans , including those that are specific to high temperature stress. This analysis will shed light on the underlying mechanism of survival of this pathogenic yeast during infection and can potentially lead to the discovery of novel drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W3112630238,"Establishing the cause of death (CoD) is critical to better understanding health and prioritizing health investments, however the use of full post-mortem examination is rare in most low and middle-income counties for multiple reasons. The use of minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) approaches, such as needle biopsies, presents an alternate means to assess CoD. In order to understand the feasibility and acceptability of MIA among communities in western Kenya, we conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews with next-of-kin of recently deceased persons, community leaders and health care workers in Siaya and Kisumu counties. Results suggest two conceptual framework can be drawn, one with facilitating factors for acceptance of MIA due to the ability to satisfy immediate needs related to interest in learning CoD or protecting social status and honoring the deceased), and one framework covering barriers to acceptance of MIA, for reasons relating to the failure to serve an existing need, and/or the exacerbation of an already difficult time."
https://openalex.org/W3112728688,"In a prior publication, we described a previously unknown eye movement phenomenon during the execution of actively performed multiaxial rotations in high level gymnasts. This phenomenon was consistently observed during the phase of fast free flight rotations and was marked by a prolonged and complete suppression of nystagmus and gaze stabilizing “environment referenced eye movements” (EREM; such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex, optokinetic reflex, smooth pursuit and others). Instead, these eye movements were coupled with intersegmental body movements. We have therefore called it “spinal motor-coupled eye movements” (SCEM) and have interpreted the phenomenon to likely be caused by anti-compensatory functions of more proprioceptive mediated reflexes and perhaps other mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation as part of a motor plan) to effectively cope with a new-orientation in space, undisturbed by EREM functions. In the phase before landing, the phenomenon was replaced again by the known gaze-stabilizing EREM functions. The present study specifically evaluated long-term measures of vestibulo-ocular reflex functions (VOR) in high level gymnasts and controls during both passively driven monoaxial rotations and context-specific multiaxial somersault simulations in a vestibular lab. This approach provided further insights into the possible roles of adaptive or mental influences concerning the VOR function and how they are associated with the described phenomenon of SCEM. Results showed high inter-individual variability of VOR function in both gymnasts and controls, but no systematic adaptation of the VOR in gymnasts, neither compared to controls nor over a period of three years. This might generally support the hypothesis that the phenomenon of SCEM might indeed be driven more by proprioceptively mediated and situationally dominant eye movement functions than by adaptative processes of the VOR."
https://openalex.org/W3112133572,"Background Access to healthcare services, from diagnosis through end of life (EOL), is important among persons living with Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). However, little is known about the availability of hospice services in Appalachian areas. Therefore, the objective of this study is to describe the geographic distribution of hospice, homecare and nursing home facilities in order to demonstrate current existence of and access to resources for EOL care among PLWHA in the Appalachian regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Methods This paper reports on the second aim of a larger sequential, mixed methods qualitative-quantitative (qual→quan) study. Data from advance care planning (ACP) surveys were collected by both electronic (n = 28) and paper copies (n = 201) and, among other things, obtained information on zip codes of residence of PLWHA. This enabled assessment of the geographic distribution of residences of PLWHA in relation to the distribution of healthcare services such as hospice and home healthcare services. Hospice and Home Healthcare data were obtained from the Tennessee and Alabama Departments of Health. The street addresses of these facilities were used to geocode and map the geographic distributions of the facilities using Street Map USA. Travel times to Hospice and Home Healthcare facilities were computed and mapped using ArcGIS 10.3. Results We identified a total of 32 hospice and 69 home healthcare facilities in the Tennessee Appalachian region, while the Alabama Appalachian region had a total of 110 hospice and 86 home healthcare facilities. Most care facilities were located in urban centers. The distribution of care facilities was worse in Tennessee with many counties having no facilities, requiring up to an hour drive time to reach patients. A total of 86% of the PLWHA indicated preference to die at home. Conclusions Persons living with HIV/AIDS in Appalachia face a number of challenges at the end of life that make access to EOL services difficult. Although respondents indicated a preference to die at home, the hospice/homecare infrastructure and resources are overwhelmingly inadequate to meet this need. There is need to improve access to EOL care in the Appalachian regions of both Tennessee and Alabama although the need is greater in Tennessee."
