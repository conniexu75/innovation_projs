https://openalex.org/W2013730676,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of blood vessel development in embryos and angiogenesis in adult tissues. Unlike VEGF, the related VEGF-C stimulates the growth of lymphatic vessels through its specific lymphatic endothelial receptor VEGFR-3. Here it is shown that targeted inactivation of the gene encoding VEGFR-3 resulted in defective blood vessel development in early mouse embryos. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis occurred, but large vessels became abnormally organized with defective lumens, leading to fluid accumulation in the pericardial cavity and cardiovascular failure at embryonic day 9.5. Thus, VEGFR-3 has an essential role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular system before the emergence of the lymphatic vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2062048451,"Toward a genetic dissection of the processes involved in aging, a screen for gene mutations that extend life-span in Drosophila melanogaster was performed. The mutant line methuselah ( mth ) displayed approximately 35 percent increase in average life-span and enhanced resistance to various forms of stress, including starvation, high temperature, and dietary paraquat, a free-radical generator. The mth gene predicted a protein with homology to several guanosine triphosphate–binding protein–coupled seven–transmembrane domain receptors. Thus, the organism may use signal transduction pathways to modulate stress response and life-span."

https://openalex.org/W2028343421,"Despite the innumerable ecological problems and large economic costs associated with biological invasions, the proximate causes of invasion success are often poorly understood. Here, evidence is provided that reduced intraspecific aggression and the concomitant abandonment of territorial behavior unique to introduced populations of the Argentine ant contribute to the elevated population densities directly responsible for its widespread success as an invader. In the laboratory, nonaggressive pairs of colonies experienced lower mortality and greater foraging activity relative to aggressive pairs. These differences translated into higher rates of resource retrieval, greater brood production, and larger worker populations."

https://openalex.org/W1967080458,"The status of p53 was investigated in breast tumours arising in germ-line carriers of mutant alleles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and in a control series of sporadic breast tumours. p53 expression was detected in 20/26 (77%) BRCA1-, 10/22 (45%) BRCA2-associated and 25/72 (35%) grade-matched sporadic tumours. Analysis of p53 sequence revealed that the gene was mutant in 33/50 (66%) BRCA-associated tumours, whereas 7/20 (35%) sporadic grade-matched tumours contained p53 mutation (P<0.05). A number of the mutations detected in the BRCA-associated tumours have not been previously described in human cancer databases, whilst others occur extremely rarely. Analysis of additional genes, p16INK4, Ki-ras and β-globin revealed absence or very low incidence of mutations, suggesting that the higher frequency of p53 mutation in the BRCA-associated tumours does not reflect a generalized increase in susceptibility to the acquisition of somatic mutation. Furthermore, absence of frameshift mutations in the polypurine tracts present in the coding sequence of the TGF β type II receptor (TGF β IIR) and Bax implies that loss of function of BRCA1 or BRCA2 does not confer a mutator phenotype such as that found in tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI). p21Waf1 was expressed in BRCA-associated tumours regardless of p53 status and, furthermore, some tumours expressing wild-type p53 did not express detectable p21Waf1. These data do not support, therefore, the simple model based on studies of BRCA−/− embryos, in which mutation of p53 in BRCA-associated tumours results in loss of p21Waf1 expression and deregulated proliferation. Rather, they imply that proliferation of such tumours will be subject to multiple mechanisms of growth regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2056570769,"The hepatitis B virus protein HBx is a promiscuous transactivator implicated in both cell growth and death and in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported that HBx can potentiate c-myc-induced liver oncogenesis in a transgenic model where low level expression of HBx induces no pathology. To assess if HBx could affect the hepatocyte turnover, we investigated the HBx-elicited apoptotic responses in transgenic livers and in primary hepatocyte cultures. Here we show that transgenic expression of HBx is associated with a twofold increase of spontaneous cell death in the mouse liver. The finding that apoptosis was enhanced to similar extents in HBx mice carrying homozygous p53 null mutations implied that functionally intact p53 was not required to transduce the death signal. A direct, dose-dependent apoptotic function of HBx was demonstrated in transient transfections of liver-derived cell lines. We further show that stable expression of HBx at low, presumably physiological levels in primary hepatocytes, induced cellular susceptibility to diverse apoptotic insults, including growth factor deprivation, treatment with anti-Fas antibodies or doxorubicine and oxidative stress. HBx expression, but not p53 status profoundly affected the commitment of cells to die upon apoptotic stimuli. These data strengthen the notion that HBX may contribute to HBV pathogenesis by enhancing apoptotic death in the chronically infected liver."
https://openalex.org/W2326093492,"p21Waf1/Cip1 is a major transcriptional target of p53 and has been shown to be one of the principal mediators of the p53 induced G1 cell cycle arrest. We show that in addition to the G1 block, p21Waf1/Cip1 can also contribute to a delay in G2 and expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 gives rise to cell cycle profiles essentially indistinguishable from those obtained following p53 expression. Arrest of cells in G2 likely reflects an inability to induce cyclin B1/cdc2 kinase activity in the presence of p21Waf1/Cip1, although the inefficient association of p21Waf1/Cip1 and cyclin B1 suggests that the mechanism of inhibition is indirect. Cells released from an S-phase block were not retarded in their ability to progress through S-phase by the presence of p21Waf1/Cip1, despite efficient inhibition of cyclin E, A and B1 dependent kinase activity, suggesting that p21Waf1/Cip1 is inefficient at inhibiting replicative DNA synthesis in vivo. Interestingly, significant numbers of cells released from the p21Waf1/Cip1 activated G2 block undergo endoreduplication, passing through another S-phase before undergoing mitosis. This supports a function of the mitotic kinases in both entry into mitosis, and also in preventing re-replication of DNA following S-phase and suggests a role for p21Waf1/Cip1 in coupling DNA synthesis and mitosis. Unlike p53, which induces apoptosis in these cells, extended expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 resulted in the expression of a senescent-like phenotype in these p53 null, pRB null tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021354656,"Smad family members are essential intracellular signaling components of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily involved in a range of biological activities. Two highly homologous molecules, Smad2 and Smad3, have so far been identified as receptor-activated Smads for TGF-β signaling and have become the focus of intensive studies. However, no definite differences in regulation or function have been established between these TGF-β signaling molecules. In the present study, we show that the expression of Smad3, but not its close relative, Smad2, is down-regulated by TGF-β mediated signals themselves in human lung epithelial cells. This down-regulation of Smad3 by TGF-β treatment did not appear to result from shortening of the half-life of Smad3 mRNA. Constitutive expression of Smad3 in the presence of TGF-β induced apoptotic cell death, with an adverse effect on the cell growth of human lung epithelial cells. Apoptotic cell death could also be induced by forced expression of Smad2 in the presence of TGF-β, but less efficiently than by that of Smad3. These findings clearly define the distinctions between Smad2 and Smad3 for the first time in that a qualitative difference was observed with regard to the regulation of their expression in response to TGF-β, while Smad2 and Smad3 appeared to have quantitatively different capabilities regarding the induction of apoptotic cell death in human lung epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2078468203,"Regulation of cell adhesion is important for immune system function. CD44 is a tightly regulated cell adhesion molecule present on leukocytes and implicated in their attachment to endothelium during an inflammatory immune response. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor–α, but not interferon-γ, was found to convert CD44 from its inactive, nonbinding form to its active form by inducing the sulfation of CD44. This posttranslational modification was required for CD44-mediated binding to the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan and to vascular endothelial cells. Sulfation is thus a potential means of regulating CD44-mediated leukocyte adhesion at inflammatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1971320218,"Apoptosis, the process whereby cells activate an intrinsic death program, can be induced in HeLa cells by TNF-α treatment. The aims of the present study were (i) to examine the precise role and the origin of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the TNF-α-induced programmed cell death, (ii) to characterize and order the morphological and mitochondrial changes associated with this process and (iii) to link these events with the activation of caspases. Analyses were performed on TNF-α-treated cells in the presence of an anti-oxidant, or of a general caspase inhibitor. To assess the role of mitochondria in the cell death signal transduction, these studies were also realized on HeLa-variant cell lines lacking functional mitochondrial respiratory chain. We show that at least two separate signaling cascades, both mediated by Z-VAD-sensitive caspase(s), contribute to the TNF-α-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. One signaling pathway involves an early mitochondria-dependent ROS production, the other being ROS-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2013958556,"Haldane's rule states that species hybrids of the XY sex are preferentially sterile or inviable. In all taxa known to obey this rule, the Y is inert and X-linked genes show full expression in XY individuals. Until recently, all theories of Haldane's rule depended on this hemizygosity. A test of Haldane's rule in animals lacking a hemizygous sex—mosquitoes having two functional sex chromosomes in both sexes—reveals that these species show Haldane's rule for sterility but not inviability. A related group having a “normal” hemizygous X obeys Haldane's rule for both sterility and inviability. These results support the faster male and dominance theories of Haldane's rule."

https://openalex.org/W2320296478,"Malignant transformation is associated with changes in the glycosylation of cell surface proteins. For example, the N-linked oligosaccharides containing the [GlcNAcβ(1,6)Man] branch are increased after transformation of many cell types by a number of tumor viruses and oncogenes which induce the expression of N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase V (GlcNAc-T V), the enzyme that adds this branch. A large percentage of human breast carcinomas have increased N-linked β(1,6) branches on glycoproteins, while up to 30% of breast carcinomas have amplified the oncogene her-2/neu (erb-B2). We tested the hypothesis that expression of her-2/neu stimulates GlcNAc-T V gene expression and increases the β(1,6) branching of N-linked oligosaccharides. We found that neu-transformed NIH3T3 cells have a threefold increase in GlcNAc-T V enzyme activity and increased β(1,6) branching on a specific set of glycoproteins. Promoter/reporter experiments showed that her-2/neu stimulates transcription from the human GlcNAc-T V promoter and that the her-2/neu response element was located about 400 bp 5′ of the transcription initiation site and includes three Ets transcription factor binding sequences. Co-transfections with dominant-negative Raf and Ets expression plasmids demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of the GlcNAc-T V promoter by neu is mediated by the Ras-Raf-Ets signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2328109056,"The EWS/FLI1 fusion gene found in Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is able to transform certain cell lines by acting as an aberrant transcription factor. The ability of EWS/FLI1 to modulate gene expression in cells transformed and resistant to transformation by EWS/FLI1, was assessed by Representational Difference Analysis (RDA). We found that the cyclin selective ubiquitin conjugase murine E2-C, was up regulated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by EWS/FLI1 but not in a nontransformed NIH3T3 clone expressing EWS/FLI1. We also found that mE2-C is upregulated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by other genes including activated cdc42, v-ABL and c-myc. We demonstrated that expression of mE2-C in both the EWS/FLI1 transformed and parent NIH3T3 lines varies with the cell cycle. Finally, dominant-negative mE2-C, created by changing a catalytic cysteine to serine, inhibits the in vitro ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin B in human HeLa cell extracts. These data suggest that part of the biologic effect of EWS/FLI1 could be to transcriptionally modulate genes involved in cell cycle regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2004151301,"Recent cytogenetic studies indicated that loss of the long arm of chromosome 10 is a frequent event in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and that a common region of the deletion is at 10q24-qter, which suggests the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene there. To map precise tumor-suppressor loci on the chromosome arm for further positional cloning efforts, we tested 46 primary SCLCs using microsatellite analysis. By analysing 11 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers located in 10q23-q26, we found that at least 78% (36/46) of the tumors exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q with at least two distinct minimally deleted regions. LOH at one region (10q24) was found in at least 74% (32/43) of informative cases with a minimally deleted region between D10S198 and D10S192 (about 2 cM); LOH at another region (10q24-q25) was observed in at least 66% (29/44) of informative tumors with a minimally deleted region between D10S221 and D10S587 (about 11 cM). LOH at both regions or across both regions was observed in at least 52% (24/46) of the tumors tested. However, no mutations or homozygous deletions were found in the coding region of MXI1, a candidate tumor suppressor gene at 10q24-q25, in a panel of SCLC cell lines. Our data demonstrate that at least two tumor-suppressor loci exist on 10q and that they may play an important role in SCLC tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020787235,"The 16 K subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (ductin) has been suggested to also play a role in gap junction channels. Since mutated 16 K subunits have transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells and since aberrant gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is a hallmark of cancer cells, we hypothesized that mutated 16 K subunits might transform these cells via alteration of GJIC. When GJIC was measured by the dye-transfer assay, NIH3T3 cells transfected with the mutant 16 K protein genes (deletion of the fourth transmembrane domain or a point mutation at codon 143 from glutamic acid to arginine) showed significantly lower levels of GJIC than those transfected with the vector alone or with the wild-type 16 K subunit gene. GJIC levels of NIH3T3 cells transformed by v-ras and v-src were not significantly decreased, suggesting that low GJIC levels are not necessarily the result of cell transformation per se. NIH3T3 cells express C x 43 as a major connexin gene. Although cells transfected with mutated 16 K subunits showed a level of C x 43 protein expression similar to non-transfectants, their C x 43 protein was localized aberrantly, i.e. intracytoplasmically. These results indicate that mutant 16 K subunits with transforming ability translocate C x 43 proteins, thus inhibiting GJIC of NIH3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049946159,"The KIT protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor family which regulates haematopoiesis, melanogenesis and gut and germ cell development. KIT regulates these diverse processes, at least in part, by inhibiting apoptosis. We have previously found that KIT can suppress p53-mediated apoptosis. The mechanism by which KIT suppresses apoptosis is, however, uncharacterized. Neither is it clear how p53 induces apoptosis. In this report we find that p53-dependent apoptosis proceeds through a pathway involving depolarization of the mitochondrial electropotential gradient (delta(psi)m) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). KIT activation suppresses p53-induced apoptosis in the mouse DP16 Friend erythroleukemia cell line by preventing delta(psi)m depolarization and ROS generation. Thus, the KIT kinase prevents apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial function and cellular redox state."
https://openalex.org/W2314934187,"p21ras is activated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and then co-ordinates important signaling pathways for T lymphocyte activation. Effector pathways for this guanine nucleotide binding protein in T cells are mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 and the Ras-related GTPase Rac-1. In fibroblasts, an important effector for the Ras oncogene is Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase). Activation of this lipid kinase is able to induce critical Rac-1 signaling pathways and can couple p21ras to cell survival mechanisms via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB. The role of PtdIns 3-kinase in Ras signaling in T cells has not been explored. In the present study, we examined the ability of PtdIns 3-kinase to initiate the Rac-1 signaling pathways important for T cell activation. We also examined the possibility that Akt/PKB is regulated by Ras signaling pathways in T lymphocytes. The results show that Ras can initiate a Rac-1 mediated pathway that regulates the transcriptional function of AP-1 complexes. PtdIns 3-kinase signals cannot mimic p21ras and induce the Rac mediated responses of AP-1 transcriptional activation. Moreover, neither TCR or Ras activation of AP-1 is dependent on PtdIns 3-kinase. PKB is activated in response to triggering of the T cell antigen receptor; PtdIns 3-kinase activity is both required and sufficient for this TCR response. In contrast, p21ras signals are unable to induce Akt/PKB activity in T cell nor is Ras function required for Akt/PKB activation in response to the TCR. The present data thus highlight that PtdIns 3-kinase and Akt/PKB are not universal Ras effector molecules. Ras can initiate Rac-1 regulated signaling pathways in the context of T cell antigen receptor function independently of PtdIns 3-kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1977285383,"The BRCA1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor that has been implicated in hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer. During S phase of the cell cycle, BRCA1 polypeptides are found in discrete nuclear bodies (`BRCA1 nuclear dots') together with HsRad51, a human homolog of the E. coli recA protein, and BARD1, a protein that interacts with BRCA1 to form a stable heterodimer. BARD1 is structurally similar to BRCA1 in that both molecules harbor an amino-terminal RING domain and two carboxy-terminal BRCT domains. Here we describe the amino acid sequence and expression pattern of murine Bard1. A comparison of the mouse and human sequences reveals that the recognizable protein motifs of BARD1 are well conserved, including the RING domain, the three tandem ankyrin repeats, and, to a lesser extent, the two BRCT domains. However, the remaining sequences of BARD1 display a markedly lower degree of phylogenetic conservation, comparable to those reported for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Moreover, murine Bard1 retains the ability to associate in vivo with BRCA1, and its expression pattern in adult mice mirrors that of Brca1, with elevated levels of RNA transcripts found in the testes and spleen. These data suggest that BRCA1 and BARD1 have co-evolved to participate in a common pathway of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2081278588,"From the genotyping of UK and US tylotic families with a high risk of oesophageal cancer we have previously localized the tylosis-associated cancer susceptibility gene (TOC gene, tylosis oesophageal cancer gene) to a 1 cM region on the long arm of chromosome 17 (Kelsell et al., 1996). In the present study we investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns of 35 sporadic squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus using six polymorphic microsatellite markers encompassing this locus. Twenty-four of the 35 cases (69%) revealed LOH at one or more loci. Deletion was most frequently observed with the marker D17S801 (64% LOH, informative cases), which shows significant linkage to the TOC locus. The LOH analysis in sporadic oesophageal cancer we report here is thus consistent with the hypothesis that the tylosis oesophageal cancer susceptibility gene is also involved in the pathogenesis of a proportion of sporadic squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus."

https://openalex.org/W2327366515,"Activating point mutations in the Ras oncogene occur in a large number of human tumors, especially of epithelial origin. In thyroid follicular cells, ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras results in growth factor-independent proliferation, loss of differentiation and tumor formation in nude mice. In fibroblasts concomitant activation of the MAP kinase cascade and the small GTPase Rac-1 leads to full malignant transformation. We have tested the effects of these key downstream mediators of Ras in thyroid epithelial cells, by stably expressing either a constitutively active form of MEK-1 (MEK(deltaN3/S218E/S222D)), a constitutively active form of Rac-1 (Val12-Rac), or both. While the activation of one molecule or the other results in a weak phenotype, concomitant activation of both MEK-1 and Rac-1 in thyroid cells leads to growth factor-independent proliferation, morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. However, in contrast to Ras-transformed thyroid cells, the ones expressing the constitutively active forms of MEK-1 and Rac-1 maintain their differentiate phenotype and fail to form tumors when injected into nude mice. Thus, in thyroid epithelial cells, concomitant activation of MEK-1 and Rac-1 can reproduce only a subset of the Ras-induced effects and is not sufficient to cause full malignant transformation. Significantly, Ras-mediated increased proliferation and loss of differentiation can be dissociated in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990192686,"We crossed transgenic mice overexpressing the N-ras proto-oncogene (RasTg) with mice carrying one inactivated copy of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene (NF1+/-) to assess their possible cooperation in tumorigenesis. We have found a significant increase in the incidence of lymphomas in animals with both lesions (RasTg NF1+/-), as compared with animals with single lesions. The mechanism of this cooperation appears to be independent of the NF1 GTPase activating activity since the level of Ras-GTP in primary cultures of tumor tissue do not differ among animals with double and with single lesions. Nevertheless, the finding of significantly higher levels of Erk-1 and Erk-2 activation in lymphomas in the RasTg NF1+/- than in the RasTg group suggests that this cooperative effect may be in part explained by increased signaling through the Erk pathways. Consistent with a role for Erk activation in transformation is the additional observation that Erk-1 and Erk-2 activation is significantly increased in lymphomas as compared with normal spleen. This activation is likely to occur by phosphorylation of previously synthesized and inactive Erk proteins since, despite differences in activation, Erk-1 and Erk-2 expression is similar in normal and lymphoid tissue in all groups. The observed cooperation in in vivo lymphomagenesis between N-ras overexpression and NF1 inactivation emphasizes the importance of searching for additional functions for the NF1 protein and of intensifying the screening for NF1 mutations in human lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2001460681,"The BCL6 gene, mapped at the chromosomal band 3q27, encodes a POZ/Zinc finger transcription repressor protein. It is frequently activated in Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) by translocations with breakpoints clustering in the 5′ major breakpoint region (MBR) as well as by mutations in the same region. The translocations lead to BCL6 activation by substitution of promoters of rearranging genes derived from the reciprocal chromosomal partners such as IG. We report the molecular genetic analysis of a novel t(2;3)(q21;q27) translocation subset in NHL comprising three cases without apparent BCL6 involvement in the translocation. Southern blot analysis of tumor DNAs utilizing BCL6 MBR probes revealed no rearrangement in two cases. Two rearranged bands in the third case resulted from a deletion in one allele and a mutation in the other allele. Southern blot analysis of DNA from one of the two tumors without BCL6 rearrangement, using a probe derived from the recently identified alternative breakpoint region (ABR), showed a rearrangement. The ABR is located 200–270 kb telomeric to MBR. Mutations were identified in the previously reported hypermutable region of BCL6 in all three tumors. In one, the mutant allele alone was found to be expressed by RT–PCR analysis of RNA. These results demonstrate the presence of 3q27 translocation breakpoints at a distance from BCL6 suggesting distant breaks that deregulate the gene or involvement of other genes that may be subject to rearrangement."

https://openalex.org/W2329056305,"Quiescent mammalian fibroblasts can be induced to re-enter the cell cycle by growth factors and oncoproteins. We studied the pathway(s) through which v-Src, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase encoded by the v-src oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus, forces serum-starved NIH3T3 cells to enter S-phase. To this purpose, we isolated and characterized a polyclonal population of NIH3T3 cells transformed by the MR31 retroviral vector, encoding G418 resistance and the v-src temperature-sensitive allele from the mutant ts LA31 PR-A. NIH(MR31) cells displayed a temperature-conditional transformed phenotype and could be made quiescent by serum deprivation at the restrictive temperature. Serum stimulation or thermolabile v-Src reactivation induced entry into S-phase to a comparable extent, although with different kinetics. The data suggest that v-Src mitogenic activity involves early activation of the Erk1/Erk2 MAP kinases with very little tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor proteins at least during the early stages of v-Src reactivation and that v-Src-induced S-phase entry was strongly inhibited by drugs affecting MEK or PI 3-kinase. Our results also suggest that down-regulation of gas1 gene expression plays an important role in regulating the efficiency of entry into S-phase triggered by reactivated v-Src and that Gas1 down-regulation does not require PI 3-kinase dependent signals."
