https://openalex.org/W2076075458,"The microparticle concentrations in three deep ice cores reveal a substantial increase in the concentration of insoluble particles in the global atmosphere during the latter part of the last major glaciation. The ratio of the average particle concentration in the late glacial strata to that in the Holocene strata is 6/1 for the core from Dome C, Antarctica, 3/1 for the core from Byrd Station, Antarctica, and 12/1 for the core from Camp Century, Greenland. Whether this temporal correlation between increased atmospheric particle load and the lower surface temperatures is directly causal is unknown; however, the variations in these two parameters must be satisfactorily resolved in any successful hypothesis that addresses the causes of climatic change."
https://openalex.org/W2083228888,Comparisons of reproductive behaviors of three age classes of California gulls demonstrate that reproductive effort increases with age in this seabird. These findings contradict the assumption that increased reproductive success with age results from increased experience and social status and demonstrate that selection for increased reproductive effort can occur in long-lived species.

https://openalex.org/W1992851980,"Carbonized remains of Canavalia beans were recovered from archaeological deposits excavated at Real Alto (OGCh-12), southwestern Ecuador. The identification, context and dating of the earliest beans from Real Alto demonstrate their use from the beginning of Valdivia (about 3300 B.C.) and the Early Formative in coastal Ecuador."

Approach of an animal wearing a small ferromagnetic collar unbalances an excited inductance bridge which triggers recording circuitry. In conjunction with conductance proximity sensing, the techniques can identify four individuals. Some results on the tendency of two females to follow one another are cited."
