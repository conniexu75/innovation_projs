https://openalex.org/W3092503590,"An urgent global quest for effective therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is ongoing. We previously described REGN-COV2, a cocktail of two potent neutralizing antibodies (REGN10987 and REGN10933) that targets nonoverlapping epitopes on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. In this report, we evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this antibody cocktail in both rhesus macaques, which may model mild disease, and golden hamsters, which may model more severe disease. We demonstrate that REGN-COV-2 can greatly reduce virus load in the lower and upper airways and decrease virus-induced pathological sequelae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in rhesus macaques. Similarly, administration in hamsters limits weight loss and decreases lung titers and evidence of pneumonia in the lungs. Our results provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of this antibody cocktail."
https://openalex.org/W3091991776,"Many approaches to identify therapeutically relevant neoantigens couple tumor sequencing with bioinformatic algorithms and inferred rules of tumor epitope immunogenicity. However, there are no reference data to compare these approaches, and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain unclear. Here, we assembled a global consortium wherein each participant predicted immunogenic epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes were subsequently assessed for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By integrating peptide features associated with presentation and recognition, we developed a model of tumor epitope immunogenicity that filtered out 98% of non-immunogenic peptides with a precision above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing model features had superior performance, and pipeline alterations leveraging them improved prediction performance. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor sequencing data and assessed for T cell binding. This data resource enables identification of parameters underlying effective anti-tumor immunity and is available to the research community."

https://openalex.org/W3091814780,"Mg2+ is the most abundant divalent cation in metazoans and an essential cofactor for ATP, nucleic acids, and countless metabolic enzymes. To understand how the spatio-temporal dynamics of intracellular Mg2+ (iMg2+) are integrated into cellular signaling, we implemented a comprehensive screen to discover regulators of iMg2+ dynamics. Lactate emerged as an activator of rapid release of Mg2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, which facilitates mitochondrial Mg2+ (mMg2+) uptake in multiple cell types. We demonstrate that this process is remarkably temperature sensitive and mediated through intracellular but not extracellular signals. The ER-mitochondrial Mg2+ dynamics is selectively stimulated by L-lactate. Further, we show that lactate-mediated mMg2+ entry is facilitated by Mrs2, and point mutations in the intermembrane space loop limits mMg2+ uptake. Intriguingly, suppression of mMg2+ surge alleviates inflammation-induced multi-organ failure. Together, these findings reveal that lactate mobilizes iMg2+ and links the mMg2+ transport machinery with major metabolic feedback circuits and mitochondrial bioenergetics."

Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice, multiple large virtual environments, and differing reward contingencies, we derived a unified probabilistic model of CA1 representations centered on a single feature—the field propensity. Each cell’s propensity governs how many place fields it has per unit space, predicts its reward-related activity, and is preserved across distinct environments and over months. Propensity is broadly distributed—with many low, and some very high, propensity cells—and thus strongly shapes hippocampal representations. This results in a range of spatial codes, from sparse to dense. Propensity varied ∼10-fold between adjacent cells in salt-and-pepper fashion, indicating substantial functional differences within a presumed cell type. Intracellular recordings linked propensity to cell excitability. The stability of each cell’s propensity across conditions suggests this fundamental property has anatomical, transcriptional, and/or developmental origins.

How the brain represents the world is a central question in neuroscience. Representations in many primary sensory areas display localized receptive fields organized topographically (Penfield and Boldrey, 1937Penfield W. Boldrey E.

In the hippocampus, an animal’s location in a given environment (context) is represented by place cells and their spatial receptive fields (place fields) (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J.

Unlike primary visual or somatosensory areas, however, hippocampal place cell representations are not topographically organized (e.g., nearby cells have fields that are far apart) (O’Keefe, 1976O’Keefe J. Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat.Exp. Neurol. 1976; 51: 78-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Furthermore, individual place cells can have multiple fields in an environment (O’Keefe, 1976O’Keefe J. Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat.Exp.

Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), fields of multi-field cells are randomly dispersed across the environment (Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D.

Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, hippocampal representations possess several features that appear random—something that is shared by association areas and other regions (Rigotti et al., 2013Rigotti M. Barak O. Warden M.R. Wang X.J. Daw N.D. Miller E.K. Fusi S. The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.Nature. 2013; 497: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Hippocampal representations also exhibit clearly nonrandom structure. In particular, use of large environments revealed fields are not distributed randomly across the population, which would yield a Poisson distribution of field numbers per neuron (Figure 1A, “equal Poisson”). Instead, the propensity of a hippocampal CA1 neuron (i.e., its probability of having a place field per unit of space) varies greatly across cells. Specifically, the distribution of propensities follows a highly skewed gamma distribution (Figure 1A) such that many cells have a low propensity, some have high propensity and others have in-between values (Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D. Liaw H.P. Lee A.K. Place cells. Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, given its propensity, a cell’s fields are distributed randomly in space (spatial Poisson) (Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D. Liaw H.P. Lee A.K. Place cells. Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, fields are distributed across the population according to a gamma-Poisson distribution—for each cell, its propensity value is drawn from a gamma distribution, then its fields occur in the environment as a spatial Poisson process with rate equal to the cell’s propensity. Similarly skewed distributions have been found in other hippocampal regions (Alme et al., 2014Alme C.B. Miao C. Jezek K. Treves A. Moser E.I. Moser M.B.

Trivedi V. et al.Nonuniform allocation of hippocampal neurons to place fields across all hippocampal subfields.Hippocampus. 2016; 26: 1328-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the olfactory system (Turner et al., 2008Turner G.C. Bazhenov M. Laurent G. Olfactory representations by Drosophila mushroom body neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), suggesting this may be a general property (Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014Buzsáki G. Mizuseki K. The log-dynamic brain: how skewed distributions affect network operations.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) of representations across many brain areas (where propensity would be the probability a cell participates in the representation for each item of concern). A potential function of a highly skewed distribution of field propensity is that the many low propensity cells result in a sparse code for location (e.g., a substantial fraction of cells have exactly one place field across a large extent of space). Sparse coding has desirable properties, including simple mechanisms for readout and forming associations, and increased memory storage and retrieval capacity (Tsodyks and Feigelman, 1988Tsodyks M. Feigelman M. Enhanced storage capacity in neural networks with low level of activity.Europhys. Lett. 1988; 6: 101-105Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar; Olshausen and Field, 2004Olshausen B.A. Field D.J. Sparse coding of sensory inputs.Curr. Opin.

Memory retrieval from first principles.Neuron. 2017; 94: 1027-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, for sparse coding to work in this way, the same cells would need to have low propensity across different environments and over time (Figure 1B), which has not been shown. More generally, if each cell’s propensity were preserved across different conditions, this would indicate a significant degree of structure underlying all hippocampal representations. Separately, hippocampal representations are influenced by sensory and value cues. CA1 place field density is elevated in consistently rewarded locations (Hollup et al., 2001Hollup S.A. Molden S.

In previous work on propensity, value was spatially homogeneous across the environment (Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D. Liaw H.P. Lee A.K. Place cells. Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Alme et al., 2014Alme C.B. Miao C.

Trivedi V. et al.Nonuniform allocation of hippocampal neurons to place fields across all hippocampal subfields.Hippocampus. 2016; 26: 1328-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). How do value-based modulations in overall field density relate to each cell’s propensity? If a cell’s reward activity was correlated with its field propensity, this would yield a sparse code for all locations, including rewarded ones (Figure 1C). This in turn could support the hippocampus’ role in navigation to spatial goals (Morris et al., 1982Morris R.G. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N. O’Keefe J. Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions.Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (4871) Google Scholar). Here, we bring together these features of hippocampal CA1 representations to develop a unified statistical description of place field structure with respect to time, context, and value. We employed two-photon calcium imaging of the hippocampus in awake head-fixed mice (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D. Tian L. Looger L.L. Tank D.W.

Large environments (Kjelstrup et al., 2008Kjelstrup K.B. Solstad T. Brun V.H. Hafting T. Leutgeb S. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.B. Finite scale of spatial representation in the hippocampus.Science. 2008; 321: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) allowed high-resolution measurement of field statistics such as propensity (Fenton et al., 2008Fenton A.A. Kao H.Y. Neymotin S.A. Olypher A. Vayntrub Y. Lytton W.W. Ludvig N.

Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and virtual reality enabled use of many large environmental contexts. Imaging also allowed propensities of large numbers of individual cells to be tracked for months (Ziv et al., 2013Ziv Y. Burns L.D. Cocker E.D. Hamel E.O. Ghosh K.K. Kitch L.J. El Gamal A.

Hippocampal ensemble dynamics timestamp events in long-term memory.eLife. 2015; 4: e12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This allowed us to test whether propensity is preserved across environments and time. Finally, by manipulating reward contingencies in these environments, we investigated the interaction of value and propensity. The result of our work is a simple probabilistic model centered on the field propensity that predicts the structure of hippocampal representations under a wide variety of conditions. In particular, we found that propensity is highly preserved across conditions including reward (via multiplicative scaling), thus simultaneously yielding a sparse code for all locations and a dense code among distinct sets of cells. Mice ran on a 40-cm spherical treadmill at the center of a half-cylindrical screen on which monochromatic virtual environments were projected (Figure 1D) (Harvey et al., 2009Harvey C.D. Collman F.

Experience-dependent shaping of hippocampal CA1 intracellular activity in novel and familiar environments.eLife. 2017; 6: e23040Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The animal’s view of an environment was updated based on treadmill movement. We designed 4 different environments with distinctly shaped ∼40 m-long tracks surrounded by unique objects (Figures 1D and S1). Each animal explored 3 environments (A, B, and C; A represents the first one explored regardless of identity; Figure 1E), each accompanied by a distinct odor cue. Animals ran the full track length in one direction then were teleported to the start for another run, for 4–8 runs total per environment (session). Animals explored each environment over multiple days. All analyses were performed on sessions where the environment was familiar (≥4 days of previous experience), unless otherwise noted. In the first set of experiments, water reward was provided at random locations that changed on each run. We imaged the calcium activity of dorsal hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in transgenic mice (n = 4) expressing GCaMP6f (Dana et al., 2014Dana H. Chen T.W. Hu A. Shields B.C. Guo C. Looger L.L. Kim D.S. Svoboda K. Thy1-GCaMP6 transgenic mice for neuronal population imaging in vivo.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e108697Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); 700–870 neurons were identified per session, and we could follow 125–430 neurons across all sessions for up to 3 months (Figure 1F). For the first element of the model, we quantified the distribution of the number of place fields per neuron. In agreement with Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D. Liaw H.P. Lee A.K. Place cells. Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, the field number distribution across the population was highly skewed, well-fit by a gamma-Poisson distribution, and far more spread out than predicted by a (equal-)Poisson distribution (Figures 1G and S2), which would be expected if each cell had the same propensity to have a place field per unit space. Therefore, different cells have clearly different field propensities. Furthermore, given its propensity, each cell’s fields were distributed randomly in space (spatial Poisson per cell, Figure S2 legend). Several features of fields (e.g., width) were similar for low and high propensity cells (Figures S1D–S1F). These calcium imaging results in head-fixed mice exploring familiar virtual environments thus match those from extracellular recordings in freely moving rats running on a novel 48 m track (Rich et al., 2014Rich P.D. Liaw H.P. Lee A.K. Place cells. Large environments reveal the statistical structure governing hippocampal representations.Science. 2014; 345: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the skewed field number distribution was unchanged by time or environmental context (Figures 1H and S2, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test, p > 0.15) and not explained by the change in mean field number along proximal-distal (Henriksen et al., 2010Henriksen E.J.

Superficial-deep location of each cell was estimated from a z stack of images taken above and below the imaging plane. The cells from 0%–35% of the way from the superficial to deep edges of the pyramidal cell layer were included in the superficial group, and from 65%–100% in the deep group. The cells from 40%–60% were included in the middle group. The different sizes of the ranges were used to balance the number of cells in each group. For the proximal-distal axis, we divided our imaging plane into 3 regions: 1/3 of anterior lateral region as proximal, 1/3 of posterior medial region as distal, and the rest 1/3 as center (our imaging plane is the left hemisphere dorsal CA1). Equal Poisson (blue) and gamma-Poisson (red) probability density functions were fit in each panel.

Superficial-deep location of each cell was estimated from a z stack of images taken above and below the imaging plane. The cells from 0%–35% of the way from the superficial to deep edges of the pyramidal cell layer were included in the superficial group, and from 65%–100% in the deep group. The cells from 40%–60% were included in the middle group. The different sizes of the ranges were used to balance the number of cells in each group. For the proximal-distal axis, we divided our imaging plane into 3 regions: 1/3 of anterior lateral region as proximal, 1/3 of posterior medial region as distal, and the rest 1/3 as center (our imaging plane is the left hemisphere dorsal CA1). Equal Poisson (blue) and gamma-Poisson (red) probability density functions were fit in each panel.

First, we checked the stability of field locations in each environment. As seen in freely moving animals exploring small (∼1 m) environments (Mankin et al., 2012Mankin E.A. Sparks F.T. Slayyeh B.

This was quantified using field center location, the correlation between population vectors (PVs) of the simultaneous activity pattern across all cells at corresponding locations, and Bayesian decoding of location (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J.

Although field locations changed such that decoding performance decreased to chance after ∼2 weeks, surprisingly each cell’s field propensity was preserved across months in an environment. Specifically, the Pearson correlation of each cell’s field number on different days (Figure 2E) was significantly above chance for intervals up to at least 2.5 months (Figure 2F). We next tested whether environmental context affects each cell’s propensity. We first checked if place field representations in different large environments were distinct (global remapping) (O’Keefe and Conway, 1978O’Keefe J. Conway D.H. Hippocampal"

These three genomes offer insights into and genomic resources for investigating the geneses of aerial roots, monoecy and dioecy, and codiversification in a symbiotic system. Banyan trees are tropical and subtropical plants that are notable for their numerous aerial roots and enormous canopies and are widely used for landscaping. Their aerial roots enable many Ficus species to live as hemi-epiphytes, as do the strangler figs often seen in tropical forests. Ficus is the largest genus in the Moraceae family, which consists of ∼800 species (Berg, 1989Berg C.C. Classification and distribution of Ficus.Experientia. 1989; 45: 605-611Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and it is also a relatively ancient genus that is approximately 75 million years old (Cruaud et al., 2012Cruaud A. Rønsted N. Chantarasuwan B. Chou L.S. Clement W.L. Couloux A. Cousins B. Genson G. Harrison R.D. Hanson P.E. et al.An extreme case of plant-insect codiversification: figs and fig-pollinating wasps.Syst. Biol. 2012; 61: 1029-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Ficus species are distributed across a wide variety of ecological niches, implying a high degree of adaptability to environments and their important roles in tropical and subtropical ecosystems (Harrison, 2005Harrison R.D. Figs and the diversity of tropical rainforests.Bioscience. 2005; 55: 1053-1064Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The year-round production of large fruits led to fig species being “keystone resources” in most tropical forests by sustaining a wide range of frugivores, including 1,200 recorded bird and mammal species that, in return, serve as seed dispersers, spreading fig plants across a wide range of habitats (Shanahan et al., 2001Shanahan M. So S. Compton S.G. Corlett R. Fig-eating by vertebrate frugivores: a global review.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2001; 76: 529-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Individual fig plants are also critical components of tropical forest restoration by attracting and supporting seed dispersers of many different species (Cottee-Jones et al., 2016Cottee-Jones H.E.W. Bajpai O. Chaudhary L.B. Whittaker R.J. The importance of Ficus (Moraceae) trees for tropical forest restoration.Biotropica. 2016; 48: 413-419Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Figs are among the earliest domesticated crops and are a recurring theme in religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism (Lev-Yadun et al., 2006Lev-Yadun S. Ne’eman G. Abbo S. Flaishman M.A. Comment on “Early domesticated fig in the Jordan Valley”.Science. 2006; 314: 1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Figs and their obligate pollinator wasp species are a model system for studying fundamental phenomena in ecology and evolution, including cooperation, coevolution, ecological networks, codiversification, and response to climate change (Dunn et al., 2019Dunn D.W. Zhang X. Wen X. Sun B. Wang R. Differential deployment of sanctioning mechanisms in male and female host trees in a gynodioecious fig–wasp mutualism.Bull. Ecol. Soc.

Evolutionary ecology of figs and their associates: Recent progress and outstanding puzzles.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2008; 39: 439-458Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The genus Ficus possesses several special characteristics, including an enclosed inflorescence, fig-wasp obligate mutualism, a sex determination system, and some species with a hemi-epiphytic habit. Hemi-epiphytic figs (strangler or banyan figs) are a fascinating form of plant life with seedlings that germinate and grow as epiphytes on the canopy branches of living host trees with extraordinary aerial roots that descend along the trunks of host trees into the soil. Ficus plants are easily recognized because they are defined by a unique enclosed inflorescence, the syconium or, commonly, fig. Because of the enclosed urn-shaped inflorescence, fig plants rely on specific insect pollinators and, in turn, provide nourishment and shelter for pollinators to reproduce. Morphological matching between figs and their pollinators is required for successful pollination and oviposition. The body shapes and sizes of pollinators correlate with the size of fig inflorescence (Verkerke, 1989Verkerke W. Structure and function of the fig.Experientia. 1989; 45: 612-622Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) attract these obligate pollinators (Chen et al., 2016Chen Y. Huang M. Wu W. Wang A. Bao T. Zheng C. Chou L. Tzeng H. Tu S. The floral scent of Ficus pumila var. pumila and its effect on the choosing behavior of pollinating wasps of Wiebesia pumilae.Acta Ecol.

Floral scents: their roles in nursery pollination mutualisms.Chemoecology. 2010; 20: 75-88Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This obligate mutualism is a fascinating case of extreme plant-insect codiversification and poses questions, including how the mutualism originated and evolved and what genes have contributed to coevolution. The genus Ficus can be classified into six subgenera, including two monoecious subgenera (Urostigma and Pharmacosycea) and four functionally dioecious subgenera (Sycomorus, Ficus, Synoecia, and Sycidium). About half of the Ficus species are functionally dioecious. The RAN1 gene has been reported to be responsible for sex determination in F. carica (Mori et al., 2017Mori K. Shirasawa K. Nogata H. Hirata C. Tashiro K. Habu T. Kim S. Himeno S. Kuhara S. Ikegami H. Identification of RAN1 orthologue associated with sex determination through whole genome sequencing analysis in fig (Ficus carica L.).Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 41124Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the only species distributed mainly in temperate zones. However, the RAN1 gene did not show clear sex and organ specificity in expression. F. microcarpa and F. hispida represent two different reproductive systems, monoecy and functional dioecy, and different growth forms, hemi-epiphytic and territorial. Despite the importance of the Ficus genus as an ideal model system for studying plant-insect interactions, genetic research of Ficus is far from well developed, with no high-quality reference genomes. The high-quality genomes of F. microcarpa and F. hispida will allow us to uncover the genetic mechanisms behind special features of this large genus, including aerial root development, sex determination, the origin and evolution of this genus, and the codiversification of fig species with their wasp pollinators. F. microcarpa and F. hispida represent two different reproductive systems and carry different numbers of chromosomes: 13 pairs in F. microcarpa and 14 pairs in F. hispida (Data S2A, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). The estimated genome sizes are 436 Mb for F. microcarpa and 370 Mb for F. hispida, based on flow cytometry, which is consistent with results from K-mer counting (Data S2B, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). A total of 36.87 and 36.12 Gb of subreads were generated on the PacBio RSII platform for sequencing the genomes of F. microcarpa and F. hispida, respectively (Data S1A, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). These two genomes were assembled de novo by incorporating sequence data from PacBio long reads and physical mapping information from high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C; Data S1A and S1B, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). The analyses yielded an assembly of 426 Mb with a contig N50 value of 908 kb for F. microcarpa, covering 97.7% of the estimated 436-Mb genome, and an assembly of 360 Mb with a contig N50 of 492 kb for F. hispida, covering 97.3% of the estimated 370-Mb genome (Table S1). The completeness of the assemblies was evaluated using 1,375 conserved embryophyta proteins collected from the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) program (Simão et al., 2015Simão F.A. Waterhouse R.M. Ioannidis P. Kriventseva E.V. Zdobnov E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness with single-copy orthologs.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 3210-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar), showing 95.6% and 97.4% completeness for F. microcarpa and F. hispida, respectively (Table S2). The assemblies were further assessed using assembled RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcripts and Illumina short reads (Table S3; Data S1C, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). Finally, 13 pseudo-chromosomes comprising 423 Mb in F. microcarpa and 14 chromosomes comprising 359 Mb in F. hispida were anchored using ALLHiC (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang X. Zhang S. Zhao Q. Ming R. Tang H. Assembly of allele-aware, chromosomal-scale autopolyploid genomes based on Hi-C data.Nat. Plants. 2019; 5: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Table 1; Figure 1; Figures S1A and S1B). Comparative analyses showed that the F. hispida Hi-C-based assembly and the high-density genetic map generated from a re-sequenced segregating population were highly consistent (Figures S1C and S1D).Table 1Statistics for Assembly and Annotation of the Fm and Fh GenomesFmFhChrIDNo. of ContigsLength (bp)No. of ContigsLength (bp)Chr124927,719,66118624,287,689Chr245934,781,30139224,073,434Chr359857,014,67316323,296,499Chr425522,703,96714220,182,075Chr546742,015,71523732,764,157Chr628922,471,60725823,181,460Chr736323,317,3066320,523,937Chr834425,036,67425421,896,636Chr944333,480,39616222,292,658Chr1034429,290,11215722,260,601Chr1128825,352,6409917,973,684Chr1217824,581,54954036,403,605Chr1346335,153,69749835,705,173Chr14NANA66334462318Total no. of contigs5,5364,194Total length of contigs (Mb)426369Total no. of anchored contigs4,7403,814Total length of chromosome-level assembly (Mb)403359Anchor rate (%)94.4397.17No. of protein-coding genes29,41627,211No. of known miRNAs125130 Open table in a new tab Figure S1Assessment of Chromosome-Level Genome Assemblies of the Two Ficus Species, Related to Figure 1Show full captionGenome-wide analysis of chromatin interactions at 150-kb resolution in F. microcarpa (A) and F. hispida (B) genomes.

Genome annotation yielded 29,416 and 27,211 protein-coding genes with 94.4% and 95.7% BUSCO completeness in F. microcarpa and F. hispida, respectively (Table 1; Table S4). Comparison of these two Ficus genomes showed that 17,052 gene pairs matched in conserved syntenic blocks and could thus be considered orthologous pairs, whereas 13,200 genes (23.31%) appeared to have been rearranged or originated from tandem or dispersed duplications (Table S5). We also annotated 125 and 130 known microRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by the F. microcarpa and F. hispida genomes, respectively (Table 1). By integrating the orthologous genes from multiple species, we analyzed their phylogenetic relationships and estimated that these two Ficus species diverged ∼40 million years ago (mya) (Figure S2A). We sequenced the genome of the wasp E. verticillata, the pollinator of F. microcarpa, and estimated its genome size to be 382 Mb with heterozygosity of 1.1% based on K-mer counting. We generated a total of ∼65 Gb of PacBio long reads with ∼170× sequencing coverage (Table 2). Initial assembly using CANU yielded 439 Mb of assembled sequence and accounted for 113% of the estimated genome. Redundant sequences were identified and removed using a whole-genome alignment strategy implemented using the Redundans program (Pryszcz and Gabaldón, 2016Pryszcz L.P. Gabaldón T. Redundans: an assembly pipeline for highly heterozygous genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: e113Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), resulting in an assembled genome of 387 Mb and a contig N50 of 3.1 Mb at 97.7% BUSCO completeness (1.4%; Table 2; Table S2). A combination of ab initio gene prediction, homologous protein evidence, and RNA-seq data led to annotation of 14,312 protein-coding genes.Table 2Statistics for Assembly and Annotation of the Draft Genome of the Wasp Eupristina verticillataSequencingE. verticillataSequencing platformPacBio SequelGenome sequencing depth (×)170Estimated genome size (Mb)382AssemblyAssembly size (Mbp)387% of estimated genome size101No. of contigs768N90 (bp)702,647N50 (bp)3,130,893Average length (bp)503,882No. of gaps0BUSCO completeness97.7AnnotationNo. of protein-coding genes14,312Average gene length (bp)6,612Average coding sequence length (bp)274Average exon number per gene4.62BUSCO completeness (%)96.7 Open table in a new tab Comparative analyses of the E. verticillata genome and the published genome of Ceratosolen solmsi, the pollinator of F. hispida (Xiao et al., 2013Xiao J.-H. Yue Z. Jia L.-Y. Yang X.-H. Niu L.-H. Wang Z. Zhang P. Sun B.-F. He S.-M. Li Z. et al.Obligate mutualism within a host drives the extreme specialization of a fig wasp genome.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: R141Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), revealed that these two wasp species diverged ∼41.5 mya (Figure S2C), similar to the estimate for the divergence of F. microcarpa and F. hispida of ∼40 mya. We found that the genomes of E. verticillata and C. solmsi contained 3,934 and 1,080 species-specific genes, respectively (Figure S2B). Analysis of the E. verticillata species-specific genes revealed that these genes were enriched in various Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (for instance, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and the Hedgehog signaling pathway; Data S2C, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1), suggesting their contribution to species divergence. Synteny analysis revealed a high degree of divergence of these genomes (Data S2D, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). However, these two species were likely undergoing convergent evolution because a substantially reduced number of chemosensory system genes were detected in both genomes compared with the genomes of other insects (Data S2E–S2I, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). We also observed several shared events of gene losses, such as clade 3 in the chemosensory protein (CSP) family and clade 2 in the odorant-binding protein (OBP) family, possibly attributable to ancestral divergence from other sister lineages. Alignment of the genomes of F. microcarpa and F. hispida revealed many structural variations (SVs). A chromosome fusion or fission event involving F. microcarpa chromosome 03 (FmChr03) and its homologs, F. hispida chromosomes 03 (FhChr03) and 07 (FhChr07), occurred and was followed by two inversions in each of the two chromosome fragments (Figure 1; Figure S2D). Homologous regions in FmChr03 covered 3.49 Mb with 200 overlapping genes, whereas homologous regions extended 1.34 Mb in FhChr03 and 1.12 Mb in FhChr07, involving a total of 300 genes (Data S1D, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). Comparisons of these two Ficus genomes with the Vitis vinifera genome revealed that most syntenic blocks were unique in F. microcarpa (Fm)-Vitis vinifera (Vv) or F. hispida (Fh)-Vv syntenic pairs, and no whole-genome duplication (WGD) was detected after the triplication event shared by eudicots (Figure S2E). Whole-genome alignment analysis showed that 116.5 Mb (27.5% of the assembled genome) covering 7,636 genes in Fm and 79.4 Mb (22.1%) containing 4,920 genes in Fh were segmental duplications (SDs), with ∼38 Mb of SDs shared between the two Ficus genomes, indicating that SD is a major contributor to genome size expansion (Data S1E, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). We annotated transposable elements (TEs) and found that they comprise 46.5% in Fm and 48.9% in Fh (Table S6). An opposite pattern between the distribution of class II TEs and gene-rich regions was observed in the two Ficus genomes (Figure 1), with a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of −0.78 in Fm and −0.66 in Fh. Kimura distance analysis (Kimura, 1980Kimura M. A simple method for estimating evolutionary rates of base substitutions through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences.J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21697) Google Scholar) was used to infer the evolutionary distance of the TEs based on calculation of the pairwise divergence between TE copies and the consensus sequences, showing that a very recent Ty1/copia burst event occurred in Fm but not in Fh (Figures S3A and S3B). Further, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) located in SD regions exhibit a similar expansion pattern in both genomes (Figures S3C and S3D). Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes within the rearranged regions of FmChr03 and FhChr03 were enriched in functions mainly related to plant immunity, whereas in the rearranged region of FhChr07, genes involved in plant nutrition were strongly overrepresented (Data S1F, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). Genes overlapping within the Fm SD regions were significantly enriched in monoterpene/terpene-related biological processes (Data S1G, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1; Fisher’s exact test, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01). The most noticeable feature of banyan Ficus species is their extraordinary aerial roots. In contrast, some Ficus species (e.g., Fh) do not have aerial roots. To investigate the pathways triggering aerial root formation in Fm, we identified 811 genes that were highly expressed in aerial root tips (Figure S4). These highly expressed genes were significantly enriched for a series of transport-related biological processes (Figure S4D; Fisher’s exact test, FDR < 0.05). Notably, PIN1, which encodes the auxin efflux carrier (Wisniewska et al., 2006Wisniewska J. Xu J. Seifertová D. Brewer P.B. Ruzicka K. Blilou I. Rouquié D. Benková E. Scheres B. Friml J. Polar PIN localization directs auxin flow in plants.Science. 2006; 312: 883Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and the GNOM gene, which plays important roles in endosomal recycling of PIN1 proteins to the basal plasma membrane (Richter et al., 2010Richter S. Anders N. Wolters H. Beckmann H. Thomann A. Heinrich R. Schrader J. Singh M.K. Geldner N. Mayer U. Jürgens G. Role of the GNOM gene in Arabidopsis apical-basal patterning--From mutant phenotype to cellular mechanism of protein action.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 89: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were highly expressed in aerial roots (Figure 2A), suggesting highly efficient acropetal auxin transport. Transcripts of the TAR and YUC genes, which are involved in auxin biosynthesis, and those of several transcription factors (TFs), including IAA14, ARF7/19, PLETHORA2 (PLT2), and WOX11, were also more abundant in aerial root tissues (Figure 2A). Substantial tandem duplications and SDs that have occurred in chromosomes 4, 8, and 10 involved auxin-related genes with 21 paralogs in Fm and four in Fh (Figure 2B; Data S2J and S2K, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/34zz94gkch.1). A total of 36 genes that were highly expressed in aerial roots belong to eight gene families, of which 8 (22.2%) were located in SD regions and 11 (30.6%) were tandemly duplicated, exceeding 50% combined. Phylogenetic analysis of the PIN family identified substantial copy number variations in PIN1 genes (four paralogs in Fm, two copies in Fh, and one in A. thaliana) and identified two evolutionary PIN1 subgroups (Figure 2C). The first group (PIN1a), identified in Fm, Fh, and A. thaliana, included singular PIN1 genes that likely represent the ancestral state. The second group (PIN1b), found specifically in the two Ficus species, included three duplicated copies in Fm and one copy in Fh. RNA-seq analysis showed that FmPIN1a was expressed in most of the tissue samples tested; however, FmPIN1b1, FmPIN1b2, and FmPIN1b3 were highly expressed in aerial root samples. Expansion of the TAR and YUC gene families has provided fundamental genetic materials for enhanced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis. The increased copy numbers of the light receptors CRY2 and PHR2 and increased expression of TAR-encoding (e.g., TAT2a, TAT2b, and TAT7b) and YUC-encoding genes (e.g., YUC6) further accelerate accumulation of IAA (Figures 2A and 2B).Figure 2Genomic Basis of Aerial Root Development in FmShow full caption(A) Highly expressed genes in Fm aerial roots compared with other tissues.

https://openalex.org/W3092499100,"Objectives During the course of the Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Italy has reported one of the highest number of infections. Nearly ten percent of reported coronavirus infections in Italy occurred in healthcare workers. This study aimed to understand physicians’ access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and to information about their use, risk perception and strategies adopted to prevent contracting the infection. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional, online self-reported survey implemented between March 31 and April 5 2020 of Italian physicians. Results Responses were received from 516 physicians, only 13% of which reported to have access to PPE every time they need them. Approximately half of the physicians reported that the information received about the use of PPE was either clear (47%) or complete (54%). Risk perception about contracting the infection was influenced by receiving adequate information on the use of PPE. Access to adequate information on the use of PPE was associated with better ability to perform donning and doffing procedures [OR = 2.2 95% C.I. 1.7–2.8] and reduced perception of risk [OR = 0.5, 95% C.I. 0.4–0.6]. Conclusions Results from this rapid survey indicate that while ramping up supplies on PPE for healthcare workers is certainly of mandatory importance, adequate training and clear instructions are just as important."

We measured the prevalence and risk factors of different forms of violence against women and girls in South Sudan, which has suffered decades of conflict, most recently in 2013.A population-based survey was conducted among women aged 15-64 in three conflict-affected sites in South Sudan: Juba, Rumbek, and the Protection of Civilian Sites (PoCs) in Juba between 2015 and 2016.A total of 2,244 women between the ages of 15-64 were interviewed. Fifty percent (in the Juba PoCs) to 65% (in Juba and Rumbek) of all female respondents experienced either physical or sexual violence from a partner or non-partner in the course of their lifetimes. Approximately 35% of respondents have experienced rape, attempted rape or other forms of sexual violence by a non-partner during their lifetime. For ever-partnered women, lifetime prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence ranged between 54% in the Juba PoCs and 73% in Rumbek. Restrictive marital practices and gender norms, and experiences of conflict were major drivers of both partner and non-partner violence.Women and girls in South Sudan suffer among the highest levels of physical and sexual violence in the world. Although the prevalence of sexual assault by non-partners is four times the global average, women are still at greatest risk of physical and sexual assault from intimate partners. Conflict-related and intimate partner violence reinforce each other and are upheld by restrictive gender norms and marital practices. Expansion of comprehensive services, including health and psycho-social support for survivors is urgently needed. Moreover, policies and laws to prevent violence against women and provide survivors with access to justice should be given high priority within the ongoing peacebuilding process in South Sudan."
https://openalex.org/W3092354153,"Therapy-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), an extremely aggressive variant of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is increasing in incidence with the widespread use of highly potent androgen receptor (AR)-pathway inhibitors (APIs) such as Enzalutamide (ENZ) and Abiraterone and arises via a reversible trans-differentiation process, referred to as neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). The molecular basis of NED is not completely understood leading to a lack of effective molecular markers for its diagnosis. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that lineage switching to NE states is accompanied by key miRNA alterations including downregulation of miR-106a~363 cluster and upregulation of miR-301a and miR-375. To systematically investigate the key miRNAs alterations driving therapy-induced NED, we performed small RNA-NGS in a retrospective cohort of human metastatic CRPC clinical samples + PDX models with adenocarcinoma features (CRPC-adeno) vs those with neuroendocrine features (CRPC-NE). Further, with the application of machine learning algorithms to sequencing data, we trained a ‘miRNA classifier’ that could robustly classify ‘CRPC-NE’ from ‘CRPC-Adeno’ cases. The performance of classifier was validated in an additional cohort of mCRPC patients and publicly available PCa cohorts. Importantly, we demonstrate that miR-106a~363 cluster pleiotropically regulate cardinal nodal proteins instrumental in driving NEPC including Aurora Kinase A, N-Myc, E2F1 and STAT3. Our study has important clinical implications and transformative potential as our ‘miRNA classifier’ can be used as a molecular tool to stratify mCRPC patients into those with/without NED and guide treatment decisions. Further, we identify novel miRNA NED drivers that can be exploited for NEPC therapeutic targeting."

A previously validated questionnaire was used for data collection. Behavioral and emotional problems were assessed using the Sinhala version of the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL-S/4-18). Constipation was diagnosed by applying the Rome III criteria.A total of 1000 questionnaires were distributed, and 913 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Sixty adolescents (6.5%) had functional constipation. Scores obtained for isolated psychological problems such as withdrawal (3.1 [3.1] vs. 1.9 [2.4], p<0.001), somatic complaints (3.2 [2.8] vs. 2.3 [2.5], p<0.05) anxiety/depression (5.8 [2.5] vs. 3.9 [3.6], p<0.001), social problems (3.0 [2.7] vs. 2.2 [1.9] p<0.001) and attention problems (5.4 [4.1] vs. 3.9 [3.4], p<0.001), and broadband scale of internalization (12.1 [8.4] vs. 8.3 [7.2], p<0.05) and mean total CBCL-S/4-18 score (29.4 [19.5] vs. 23.2 [17.0], p<0.001) were higher in adolescents with functional constipation. Clinical characteristics, socio-demographic and family factors and psychological maladjustment had no relationship with externalization, internalization and total CBCL-S/4-18 score. Internalization (-0.49, p<0.0001), externalization (-0.30, p<0.05), and total CBCL-S/4-18 (-0.44, p<0.001) scores had a negative impact on HRQoL of adolescents with functional constipation.Adolescents with functional constipation are suffering from significant behavioral and emotional problems.

However, the rural-urban differences in health outcomes, healthcare use, and expenditures among insured elders following China’s comprehensive healthcare reforms in 2009 remain unclear. Using the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Surveys data containing a sample of 2,624 urban and 6,297 rural residents aged 65 and older, we performed multivariable regression analyses to determine rural-urban differences in physical and psychological functions, self-reported access to care, and healthcare expenditures, after adjusting for individual socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions. Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate the changes in rural-urban differences between 2011 and 2014. Compared to rural residents, urban residents were more dependent on activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs. Urban residents reported better adequate access to care, higher adjusted total expenditures for inpatient, outpatient, and total care, and higher adjusted out-of-pocket spending for outpatient and total care. However, rural residents had higher adjusted self-payment ratios for total care. Rural-urban differences in health outcomes, adequate access to care, and self-payment ratio significantly narrowed, but rural-urban differences in healthcare expenditures significantly increased from 2011 to 2014. Our findings revealed that although health and healthcare access improved for both rural and urban older adults in China between 2011 and 2014, rural-urban differences showed mixed trends. These findings provide empirical support for China’s implementation of integrated rural and urban public health insurance systems, and further suggest that inequalities in healthcare resource distribution and economic development between rural and urban areas should be addressed to further reduce the rural-urban differences."
https://openalex.org/W3092254979,"Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) is a rich nutritious fruit crop owing to a markedly higher content of vitamin C and minerals. To promote fruit set and to increase the yield of kiwifruit, forchlorfenuron (CPPU) has been widely applied. However, the molecular details regarding CPPU controlling kiwifruit development, especially at the fastest fruit growth stage, remain unknown. In the present study, we measured the effect of CPPU on developmental regulation in red-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis ‘Hongyang’). Additionally, a cytological analysis was performed to clarify the precise changes in the cell structure of the CPPU-treated kiwifruits. Moreover, the concentration of endogenous phytohormones, including indoleacetic acid (IAA), zeatin (ZT), gibberellic acid 3 (GA3), and abscisic acid (ABA), were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Furthermore, RNA-Seq was performed to dissect the complicated molecular mechanisms, with a focus on biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling compounds, such as endogenous hormones, sugars, and L-ascorbic acid. Our results demonstrated that CPPU treatment not only regulates the size and weight of a single fruit but also improves the quality in ‘Hongyang’ kiwifruit through the accumulation of both soluble sugar and vitamin C. It was also seen that CPPU regulates kiwifruit development by enhancing cell expansion of epidermal cells and parenchyma cells, while, promoting cell division of subepidermal cells. Additionally, CPPU significantly increased the gibberellin and cytokinin biosynthetic pathway and signaling, while repressing auxin and ABA biosynthetic pathway; thus, signaling plays an essential role in CPPU controlling kiwifruit development. Notably, transcriptomic analysis revealed that a total of 2244 genes, including 352 unannotated genes, were differentially expressed in kiwifruits because of CPPU treatment, including 127 transcription factors. These genes are mainly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, photosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, starch and sucrose metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Overall, our results highlight that CPPU regulation of kiwifruit development is mainly associated with an antagonistic and/or synergistic regulatory role of endogenous phytohormones, and enhancing the energy supply. This provides new insights into the molecular details of CPPU controlling kiwifruit development at the fastest fruit growth stage, which is of agricultural importance for kiwifruit breeding and crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3092070807,"Rosetta is a computational software suite containing algorithms for a wide variety of macromolecular structure prediction and design tasks including small molecule protocols commonly used in drug discovery or enzyme design. Here, we benchmark RosettaLigand score functions and protocols in comparison to results of other software recently published in the Comparative Assessment of Score Functions (CASF-2016). The CASF-2016 benchmark covers a wide variety of tests including scoring and ranking multiple compounds against a target, ligand docking of a small molecule to a target, and virtual screening to extract binders from a compound library. Direct comparison to the score functions provided by CASF-2016 results shows that the original RosettaLigand score function ranks among the top software for scoring, ranking, docking and screening tests. Most notably, the RosettaLigand score function ranked 2/34 among other report score functions in CASF-2016. We additionally perform a ligand docking test with full sampling to mimic typical use cases. Despite improved performance of newer score functions in canonical protein structure prediction and design, we demonstrate here that more recent Rosetta score functions have reduced performance across all small molecule benchmarks. The tests described here have also been uploaded to the Rosetta scientific benchmarking server and will be run weekly to track performance as the code is continually being developed."
https://openalex.org/W3092613974,"Muscle spasticity after nervous system injuries and painful low back spasm affect more than 10% of global population. Current medications are of limited efficacy and cause neurological and cardiovascular side effects because they target upstream regulators of muscle contraction. Direct myosin inhibition could provide optimal muscle relaxation; however, targeting skeletal myosin is particularly challenging because of its similarity to the cardiac isoform. We identified a key residue difference between these myosin isoforms, located in the communication center of the functional regions, which allowed us to design a selective inhibitor, MPH-220. Mutagenic analysis and the atomic structure of MPH-220-bound skeletal muscle myosin confirmed the mechanism of specificity. Targeting skeletal muscle myosin by MPH-220 enabled muscle relaxation, in human and model systems, without cardiovascular side effects and improved spastic gait disorders after brain injury in a disease model. MPH-220 provides a potential nervous-system-independent option to treat spasticity and muscle stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W3092053271,"Background Overweight and obesity is a severe global health issue in both developed and developing nations. This study aims to estimate the national prevalence of overweight and obesity among school-aged children in Vietnam. Method We conducted a national cross-sectional study on 2788 children aged from 11–14 years old from September to November 2018. We applied the WHO 2007 and IOTF criteria to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity among participants. Poison regression analysis with cluster sampling adjustment was employed to assess associated factors with obesity and overweight. Metadata on sociodemographic characteristics, physical measurements, and lifestyle behaviors were also extracted to investigate these factors in association with overweight and obesity prevalence. Results The prevalences of overweight and obesity in Vietnamese children were 17.4% and 8.6%, respectively by WHO Z-score criteria, and 17.1% and 5.4%, according to the IOTF reference. Using WHO Z-score yielded a higher prevalence of obesity than the IOTF and CDC criteria of all ages and both sexes. The proportions of overweight and obesity were substantially higher among boys than girls across ages. Parental BMI was shown to be a significant factor associated with overweight/obesity status in both girls and boys. Only for boys, age (PR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.76–0.90) and belonging to ethnic minorities (PR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.24–0.76) were significant risk factors for overweight/obesity.

However, the molecular mechanism by which Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juzep exerts its hypolipidemic effects remains unclear. In this study, a diabetic rat model was established by feeding a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with a low-dose streptozotocin injection (HFS). Then the rats were treated with an A. orientale water extract (AOW), an A. orientale ethanolic extract (AOE) or metform (MET). The gut microflora and liver transcriptome were analyzed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry was employed to analyze the major compounds in the AOE. The results showed that the serum total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in rats of the AOE group (2.10 g/kg/day, 14 days) were significantly lower than those in the HFS group (p<0.01). Moreover, AOE treatment altered the gut microecology, particularly modulating the relative abundance of gut microflora involved in lipid metabolism compared with the HFS group. Furthermore, compared with the HFS group, the mRNA expression levels of Fam13a, Mapk7, Mpp7, Chac1, Insig1, Mcpt10, Noct, Greb1l, Fabp12 and Hba-a3 were upregulated after the administration of AOE. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of Lox, Mybl1, Arrdc3, Cyp4a2, Krt20, Vxn, Ggt1, Nr1d1 and S100a9 were downregulated. Moreover, AOE treatment for two weeks markedly promoted the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.0013). The triterpenoids contents in AOE were alisol A, alisol A 24-acetate, alisol B, alisol B 23-acetate, alisol C 23-acetate, alisol F, alisol F 24-acetate, and alisol G. Our findings above illustrated that the hypolipidemic effect of the triterpenoids of A. orientale is mediated mainly through alteration of the gut microecology and the regulation of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, especially Insig1."
https://openalex.org/W3092337304,"Voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1/VSOP), encoded by Hvcn1, are important regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in many types of immune cells. While in vitro studies indicate that Hv1/VSOP regulates ROS production by maintaining pH homeostasis, there are few studies investigating the functional importance of Hv1/VSOP in vivo. In the present study, we first show that Hv1/VSOP is functionally expressed in liver resident macrophage, Kupffer cells, regulating the hepatic oxidative stress in vivo. Our immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology data showed that Hvcn1 is specifically expressed in Kupffer cells, but not in hepatocytes. Furthermore, Hvcn1-deficiency drastically altered the hepatic oxidative stress. The Hvcn1-deficient mice showed high blood glucose and serum insulin but normal insulin sensitivity, indicating that these phenotypes were not linked to insulin resistance. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the gene expression of glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and Glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit (G6pc) were upregulated in Hvcn1-deficient liver tissues, and quantitative PCR confirmed the result for Pygl. Furthermore, we observed higher amount of glucose-6-phosphate, a key sugar intermediate for glucose in Hvcn1-deficient liver than WT, suggesting that glucose production in liver is accelerated in Hvcn1-deficient mice. The present study sheds light on the functional importance of Kupffer cells in hepatic oxidative stress and its potential relationship with glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3092602296,"Abstract Epigenetic regulations play crucial roles in leukemogenesis and leukemia progression. SUV39H1 is the dominant H3K9 methyltransferase in the hematopoietic system, and its expression declines with aging. However, the role of SUV39H1 via its-mediated repressive modification H3K9me3 in leukemogenesis/leukemia progression remains to be explored. We found that SUV39H1 was down-regulated in a variety of leukemias, including MLL -r AML, as compared with normal individuals. Decreased levels of Suv39h1 expression and genomic H3K9me3 occupancy were observed in LSCs from MLL -r-induced AML mouse models in comparison with that of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Suv39h1 overexpression increased leukemia latency and decreased the frequency of LSCs in MLL - r AML mouse models, while Suv39h1 knockdown accelerated disease progression with increased number of LSCs. Increased Suv39h1 expression led to the inactivation of Hoxb13 and Six1 , as well as reversion of Hoxa9/Meis1 downstream target genes, which in turn decelerated leukemia progression. Interestingly, Hoxb13 expression is up-regulated in MLL - AF9 -induced AML cells, while knockdown of Hoxb13 in MLL - AF9 leukemic cells significantly prolonged the survival of leukemic mice with reduced LSC frequencies. Our data revealed that SUV39H1 functions as a tumor suppressor in MLL - AF9 -induced AML progression. These findings provide the direct link of SUV39H1 to AML development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W3092215034,"Asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite are readily amenable to genetic modification via homologous recombination, allowing functional studies of parasite genes that are not essential in this part of the life cycle. However, conventional reverse genetics cannot be applied for the functional analysis of genes that are essential during asexual blood-stage replication. Various strategies have been developed for conditional mutagenesis of Plasmodium, including recombinase-based gene deletion, regulatable promoters, and mRNA or protein destabilization systems. Among these, the dimerisable Cre (DiCre) recombinase system has emerged as a powerful approach for conditional gene deletion in P. falciparum. In this system, the bacteriophage Cre is expressed in the form of two separate, enzymatically inactive polypeptides, each fused to a different rapamycin-binding protein. Rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of the two components restores recombinase activity. We have implemented the DiCre system in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei, and show that rapamycin-induced excision of floxed DNA sequences can be achieved with very high efficiency in both mammalian and mosquito parasite stages. This tool can be used to investigate the function of essential genes not only in asexual blood stages, but also in other parts of the malaria parasite life cycle."

Our study is the first to investigate the relationship between the gaze sequence in which consumers view a display (including gaze aversion away from products) and the influence of consumer (top down) characteristics on product choice. We conducted an in-lab 3 (display size: large, moderate, small) X 2 (price: sale, non-sale) within-subject experiment with 92 persons. After viewing the displays, subjects completed an online survey to provide demographic data, self-reported and actual product knowledge, and past purchase information. We employed a random forest machine learning approach via R software to analyze all possible three-unit subsequences of gaze fixations. Models comparing multiclass F1-macro score and F1-micro score of product choice were analyzed. Gaze sequence models that included gaze aversion more accurately predicted product choice in a lab setting for more complex displays. Inclusion of consumer characteristics generally improved model predictive F1-macro and F1-micro scores for less complex displays with fewer plant sizes Consumer attributes that helped improve model prediction performance were product expertise, ethnicity, and previous plant purchases."
https://openalex.org/W3092461657,"Kahweol is a diterpene found in coffee beans and unfiltered coffee drinks. Several studies have demonstrated that kahweol induces the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2/ hemeoxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway; however, the mechanisms involved are currently unknown. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) is a major regulator of Nrf2 expression and is degraded mostly by autophagy. The p62 protein enhances binding to Keap1 and contributes to the activation of Nrf2. Here, we examined the role of Keap1 regulation in the effect of kahweol on the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in hepatocytes. In AML12 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, kahweol increased the levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein without increasing expression of the Nrf2 mRNA. In addition, kahweol reduced Keap1 protein levels significantly without decreasing Keap1 mRNA levels. Although regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2-pathway by p62-dependent autophagy is well known, we confirmed here that the reduction of Keap1 protein levels by kahweol does not involve p62-dependent autophagy degradation or ubiquitination. In conclusion, kahweol increases the expression of Nrf2 in hepatocytes by inhibiting translation of the Keap1 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W3092031210,"The development of resistance to EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations is a critical limitation of this therapy. In addition to genetic alterations such as EGFR secondary mutation causing EGFR-TKI resistance, compensatory activation of signaling pathways without interruption of genome integrity remains to be defined. In this study, we identified S6K1/MDM2 signaling axis as a novel bypass mechanism for the development of EGFR-TKI resistance. The observation of S6K1 as a candidate mechanism for resistance to EGFR TKI therapy was investigated by interrogation of public databases and a clinical cohort to establish S6K1 expression as a prognostic/predictive biomarker. The role of S6K1 in TKI resistance was determined in in vitro gain-and-loss of function studies and confirmed in subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse lung cancer models. Blockade of S6K1 by a specific inhibitor PF-4708671 synergistically enhanced the efficacy of TKI without showing toxicity. The mechanistic study showed the inhibition of EGFR caused nuclear translocation of S6K1 for binding with MDM2 in resistant cells. MDM2 is a downstream effector of S6K1-mediated TKI resistance. Taken together, we present evidence for the reversal of resistance to EGFR TKI by the addition of small molecule S6K1/MDM2 antagonists that could have clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W3091908942,"Training in elite sport aims at the optimization of the athletic performance, and to control the athletes`progress in physiological, anthropometrical and motor performance prerequisites. However, in most sports, the value of longitudinal testing is unclear. This study evaluates the longitudinal development and the influence of intense training over 2-years on specific physiological performance prerequisites, as well as certain body dimensions and motor abilities in elite youth athletes. Recruited between 11–13 years of age at Shanghai Elite Sport school, the sample of student-athletes (N = 21) was categorized as the swimming group (10 athletes), and the racket sports group (11 players: 7 table tennis and 4 badminton players). The performance monitoring took place over two years between September 2016 and September 2018 and included 5 test waves. In all the test waves, the athletes were assessed by means of three physiological measurements (vital capacity, hemoglobin concentration, heart rate at rest), three anthropometric parameters (body height, body weight, chest girth), and two motor tests (back strength, complex reaction speed). Seven out of eight diagnostic methods exhibit medium to high validity to discriminate between the different levels of performance development in the two sports groups. The investigated development of the performance characteristics is attributed partly to the inherited athletic disposition as well as to the different sport-specific training regimens of the two sports groups."
https://openalex.org/W3092106290,"Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) is a liver-specific biomarker of hepatocellular damage currently undergoing qualification as a drug development tool. Since GLDH is located within the mitochondrial matrix, it has been hypothesized that it might also be useful in assessing mitotoxicity as an initiating event during drug-induced liver injury. According to this hypothesis, hepatocyte death that does not involve primary mitochondrial injury would result in release of intact mitochondria into circulation that could be removed by high speed centrifugation and result in lower GLDH activity measured in spun serum vs un-spun serum. A single prior study in mice has provided some support for this hypothesis. We sought to repeat and extend the findings of this study. Accordingly, mice were treated with the known mitochondrial toxicant, acetaminophen (APAP), or with furosemide (FS), a toxicant believed to cause hepatocyte death through mechanisms not involving mitotoxicity as initiating event. We measured GLDH levels in fresh plasma before and after high speed centrifugation to remove intact mitochondria. We found that both APAP and FS treatments caused substantial hepatocellular necrosis that correlated with plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and GLDH elevations. The plasma GLDH activity in both the APAP- and FS- treated mice was not affected by high-speed centrifugation. Interestingly, the ratio of GLDH:ALT was 5-fold lower during FS compared to APAP hepatotoxicity. Electron microscopy confirmed that both APAP- and FS-treatments had resulted in mitochondrial injury. Mitochondria within vesicles were only observed in the FS-treated mice raising the possibility that mitophagy might account for reduced release of GLDH in the FS-treated mice. Although our results show that plasma GLDH is not clinically useful for evaluating mitotoxicity, the GLDH:ALT ratio as a measure of mitophagy needs to be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W3092335085,"Glioblastoma (GBM), or grade IV astrocytoma, is a malignant brain cancer that contains subpopulations of proliferative and invasive cells that coordinately drive primary tumor growth, progression, and recurrence after therapy. Here, we have analyzed functions for megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (Mlc1), an eight-transmembrane protein normally expressed in perivascular brain astrocyte end feet that is essential for neurovascular development and physiology, in the pathogenesis of GBM. We show that Mlc1 is expressed in human stem-like GBM cells (GSCs) and is linked to the development of primary and recurrent GBM. Genetically inhibiting MLC1 in GSCs using RNAi-mediated gene silencing results in diminished growth and invasion in vitro as well as impaired tumor initiation and progression in vivo. Biochemical assays identify the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and its intracellular signaling effectors as important for MLC1 control of GSC invasive growth. Collectively, these data reveal key functions for MLC1 in promoting GSC growth and invasion, and suggest that targeting the Mlc1 protein or its associated signaling effectors may be a useful therapy for blocking tumor progression in patients with primary or recurrent GBM."

We aimed to identify predictors of renal and patient survival in patients with iMN, with a special focus on outcomes among older patients. Methods We retrieved data on 1,776 patients (mean age 53.0 ± 14.7 years; 1,075 [60.5%] males) diagnosed with iMN from the Korean GlomeruloNEphritis sTudy (KoGNET), a database compiled from 18 centers in Korea. Results The cohort included 428 (24.1%) patients over 65 years old. Compared to younger patients, this group had lower hemoglobin and serum albumin levels, a higher incidence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, and higher prevalences of hypertension and diabetes. At last follow-up, complete or partial remission rates were not significantly different between the older and younger groups. Older age (HR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97–0.99), elevated hemoglobin (HR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.72–0.93), high serum albumin (HR: 0.66, 95%CI: 0.44–0.99), and a high estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.95–0.97) at biopsy were good predictors of renal outcomes. Significant risk factors for patient survival were older age (HR: 1.04, 95%CI: 1.01–1.10) and hypertension at biopsy (HR: 2.76, 95%CI: 1.30–5.90). Conclusions Older patients with iMN had favorable renal outcomes, but poor patient survival, compared to younger patients. Prognostic information on outcomes in this study might be helpful for optimizing the management of patients with iMN."

The present study investigates the impact of symptoms of ADHD on impulsive buying and the use of financial decision styles. Furthermore, the influence of personality, symptoms of depression and demographics on the association between ADHD and these aspects of financial decision-making is evaluated. A community sample of 1292 participants (age range 18–93 years, 45.4% male) completed questionnaires related to ADHD, impulsive buying, financial decision styles, personal financial situation, depression and personality. Four groups were formed based on self-reported ADHD symptoms: an ‘ADHD’ group (n = 45), an ‘Adult-only ADHD’ group (n = 57), a ‘Subthreshold ADHD’ group (n = 162) and a ‘No ADHD’ group (n = 265). Groups were compared using ANOVA and chi-square tests. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses in the complete sample were employed to examine the association between ADHD and financial decision-making. The ADHD and Adult-only ADHD groups reported significantly more impulsive buying, used more often an avoidant or spontaneous decision style and less often saved money compared to the No ADHD group. Regression analyses revealed that impulsive buying and financial decision styles were not significantly associated with ADHD symptoms when controlling for personality, symptoms of depression and demographics. The present study confirms previous research on adults with ADHD by indicating more impulsive buying and a more frequent use of disadvantageous financial decision styles (i.e., avoidant and spontaneous styles) in individuals with an elevated number of current symptoms of ADHD compared to individuals without symptoms of ADHD. Personality and demographic variables were found to be related to both impulsive buying and the use of specific financial decision styles and might be of influence on the association between impulsive buying, the use of financial decision styles and ADHD."

Inhibition zones (IZs), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were measures of the antibacterial activity. Significant bacterial inhibitions resulted in a dose-and EO-dependent manner. At 128 μl/mL, IZs against S. mutans were 37.33 mm (Tar), 36.00 mm (Bal), 33.67 mm (Yil), 33.33 mm (Ofl), 30.00 (Ala), and 29.67 mm (Buta) and IZs against Lactobacillus were 31.00 mm (Tar), 30.67 mm (Yil), 27.67 (Bal), 27.00 (Buta), 26.67 (Ofl), and 21.33 (Ala). The respective inhibition zones due to 3% DMSO (negative control) and 3% H2O2 (positive control) were 0.00 mm/30.00 mm against S. mutans and 0.00 mm/29.00 mm against Lactobacillus.

Over 44,000 children in Ethiopia were living with HIV in the year 2019 with a variable level of disclosure, which ranges from 16.3% to 49%. Therefore, this study aimed to assess HIV-positive status disclosure and associated factors among HIV-infected children.A cross-sectional study was conducted in ten public health facilities providing pediatric antiretroviral therapy services. Systematic random sampling was used to select 221 caregivers of children aged 6-15 years. Face-to-face interviews were employed to generate the data. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the association between HIV-positive status disclosure to children and independent variables with statistical significance set at p-value <0.05.Out of the total, 134 (60.6%) of HIV-infected children knew about their HIV status. The mean age at disclosure was 10.71 years. Children aged older than 10 years [AOR = 22, 95% CI: 5.3-79.2], female children [AOR = 3; 95% CI = 1.2-8.7], children lost their family member by HIV [AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.2-10], caregiver's perception of child did not get stigmatized [AOR = 4, 95% CI: 1.6-11], and children's responsible for anti-retroviral therapy [AOR = 16, 95% CI: 5-50] were significantly associated with HIV positive status disclosure compared to their counterpart respectively. Children who stayed on anti-retroviral for 10-15 years were [AOR = 7; 95% CI: 2-27] more likely to know their HIV positive status compared to those staying on anti-retroviral therapy for <6 years.The proportion of disclosure of HIV-positive status among HIV-infected children was low. Factors associated were the age of the child, sex, existence of parent, stigma, ART duration, and responsibility of the child for his/her drugs. HIV care providers should consider these factors while supporting disclosure."

We examined whether this relationship hold true in older adults, who have a higher prevalence of both CKD and dementia. Design, setting, participants, and measurements We conducted a cross-sectional secondary analysis of an established observational cohort. We analyzed data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an NIH funded, multicenter longitudinal observational study, which includes participants with normal and impaired cognition and assesses cognition with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. We included a non-probability sample of all ADNI participants with serum creatinine measurements at baseline (N = 1181). Using multivariable linear regression analysis, we related the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation eGFR with validated composite scores for memory (ADNI-mem) and executive function (ADNI-EF). Results For the 1181 ADNI participants, the mean age was 73.7 ± 7.1 years. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 76.4 ± 19.7; 6% had eGFR<45, 22% had eGFR of 45 to <60, 51% had eGFR of 60–90 and 21% had eGFR>90 ml/min/1.73 m2. The mean ADNI-Mem score was 0.241 ± 0.874 and mean ADNI-EF score was 0.160 ± 1.026. In separate multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race education and BMI, there was no association between each 10 ml/ min/1.73 m2 higher eGFR and ADNI-Mem (β -0.02, 95% CI -0.04, 0.02, p = 0.56) or ADNI-EF (β 0.01, 95% CI -0.03, 0.05, p = 0.69) scores.

https://openalex.org/W3092402543,"Background Testing infants at birth and with more efficient point of care (POC) HIV diagnostic can streamline EID and expedite infant ART initiation. We evaluated the implementation of at birth and 6-week POC testing to assess the effectiveness and feasibility when implemented by existing hospital staff in Kenya. Methods Four government hospitals were randomly assigned to receive a GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual (n = 2) or Alere m-PIMA (n = 2) machine for POC testing. All HIV-exposed infants enrolled were eligible to receive POC testing at birth and 6-weeks of age. The primary outcome was repeat POC testing, defined as testing both at birth and 6-weeks of age. Secondary outcomes included predictors of repeat POC testing, POC efficiency (turnaround times of key services), and operations (failed POC results, missed opportunities). Results Of 626 enrolled infants, 309 (49.4%) received repeat POC testing, 115 (18.4%) were lost to follow up after an at-birth test, 120 (19.2%) received POC testing at 6-weeks only, 80 (12.8%) received no POC testing, and 2 (0.3%) received delayed POC testing (>12 weeks of age). Three (0.4%) were identified as HIV-positive. Of the total 853 POC tests run at birth (n = 424) or 6-weeks (n = 429), 806 (94.5%) had a valid result documented and 792 (98.3%) results had documented maternal notification. Mean time from sample collection to notification was 1.08 days, with 751 (94.8%) notifications on the same day as sample collection. Machine error rates at birth and 6-weeks were 8.5% and 2.5%, respectively. A total of 198 infants presented for care (48 at birth; 150 at 6-weeks) without receiving a POC test, representing missed opportunities for testing. Discussion At birth POC testing can streamline infant HIV diagnosis, expedite ART initiation and can be implemented by existing hospital staff. However, maternal disengagement and missed opportunities for testing must be addressed to realize the full benefits of at birth POC testing."
https://openalex.org/W3092149336,"Photo-identification (photo-id) is a method used in field studies by biologists to monitor animals according to their density, movement patterns and behavior, with the aim of predicting and preventing ecological risks. However, these methods can introduce subjectivity when manually classifying an individual animal, creating uncertainty or inaccuracy in the data as a result of the human criteria involved. One of the main objectives in photo-id is to implement an automated mechanism that is free of biases, portable, and easy to use. The main aim of this work is to develop an autonomous and portable photo-id system through the optimization of image classification algorithms that have high statistical dependence, with the goal of classifying dorsal fin images of the blue whale through offline information processing on a mobile platform. The new proposed methodology is based on the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) that, in conjunction with statistical discriminators such as the variance and the standard deviation, fits the extracted data and selects the closest pixels that comprise the edges of the dorsal fin of the blue whale. In this way, we ensure the elimination of the most common external factors that could affect the quality of the image, thus avoiding the elimination of relevant sections of the dorsal fin. The photo-id method presented in this work has been developed using blue whale images collected off the coast of Baja California Sur. The results shown have qualitatively and quantitatively validated the method in terms of its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy on the Jetson Tegra TK1 mobile platform. The solution optimizes classic SIFT, balancing the results obtained with the computational cost, provides a more economical form of processing and obtains a portable system that could be beneficial for field studies through mobile platforms, making it available to scientists, government and the general public."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of smartphone use on spatiotemporal gait parameters in healthy young people while walking. 42 healthy young adults were recruited and instructed to walk in four conditions (walking without using a smartphone, typing on a smartphone with both hands, typing on a smartphone with one hand, and texting posture with non-task). All spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured using the GAITRite walkway. Compared to walking without using a smartphone, the subjects walked with a slower cadence and velocity and changed stride length and gait cycle and spent more time in contact with the ground when using a smartphone (p < 0.05). In addition, even if a texting posture was taken without performing a task, a similar change was observed when using a smartphone (p < 0.05). This study found that a cautious gait pattern occurred due to smartphone use, and that a change in gait appeared just by taking a posture without using smartphone."
https://openalex.org/W3091822664,"Patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) are primary care delivery models that improve care access and population-level health outcomes, yet they have not been observed to narrow racial-ethnic disparities in the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) or other health systems. We aimed to identify and compare underlying drivers of persistent hypertension and diabetes control differences between non-Hispanic Black (Black) and Hispanic versus non-Hispanic White (White) patients before and after PCMH implementation in the VHA. Among Black and Hispanic versus White VHA primary care patients in 2009 (nhypertension = 26,906; ndiabetes = 21,141) and 2014 (nhypertension = 83,809; ndiabetes = 38,887), we retrospectively examined hypertension control (blood pressure<140/90) and diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c <9) obtained through random chart abstraction of patient health records nationally via VHA’s quality monitoring program. We fit linear probability regression models, adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Blinder-Oaxaca and Smith-Welch decomposition methods were used to parse out explained and unexplained contributors to health disparity between racial-ethnic groups pre- and post-PCMH implementation. Compared to White patients, hypertension and diabetes control remained significantly lower for Black (-6.2%[0.4%] and -3.1%[0.6%], respectively; p’s<0.001) and Hispanic (-1.4%[0.8%] and -4.0%[1.0%], respectively; p’s<0.001) patients following VHA PCMH implementation. Most racial-ethnic differences (55.7–92.3%; all p<0.05) were not attributed to age, gender, comorbidity, and SES. The contribution of explained versus unexplained factors did not significantly change over time. While many explanations for persistent racial-ethnic disparities in disease control among veterans exist, our study did not find that it was due to an influx of “sick” or “socioeconomically vulnerable” patients into the VHA following PCMH implementation. Instead, unexplained differences may be due to differential healthcare and community experiences (e.g., discrimination). Understanding underlying pathways leading to health disparities will better inform policy and clinical interventions to improve PCMH care delivery to racial-ethnic minority patients in health systems."

In this study, 396 acrylic specimens were manufactured (50% for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 50% for Staphylococcus aureus). For each bacterium, 66 specimens were subjected to biofilm formation on their surfaces for 24 hours, 66 specimens were subjected to biofilm formation on their surfaces for 48 hours, and 66 specimens were subjected to biofilm formation on their surfaces for 72 hours. Then, they were divided into groups according to disinfection method (n = 6): sterile distilled water for 10, 15, 30 min, and 6 hours (control); soap for 30 min (NES30); Opti-Free for 30 min (OPF30) and 6 h (OPF6); Efferdent for 15 min (EFF15); and 0.5%, 2%, and 4% chlorhexidine for 10 min (0.5% CHX10, 2% CHX10, and 4% CHX10). After the treatments, the specimens were vortexed to release the biofilm and the counting of bacterial colonies was performed (CFU/mL). Three-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test were used (α = 0.05). For Staphylococcus epidermidis, there was no significant difference between NES30, OPF30, and OPF6 with their respective control groups; nor between NES30, OPF30, and OPF6 themselves, regardless of the biofilm development period (P >0.05). For Staphylococcus aureus, there was no significant difference between NES30 and OPF30 with their control group; nor between NES30 and OPF30 themselves, regardless of the biofilm development period (P >0.05). For Staphylococcus aureus, OPF6 showed a significant reduction in the number of CFU/mL when compared with its control group, NES30, and OPF30, regardless of the biofilm development period (P <0.05). For both bacteria, 0.5% CHX10, 2% CHX10,4% CHX10, and EFF15 showed a significant reduction in the number of CFU/mL when compared with their control groups, NES30, OPF30, and OPF6, regardless of the biofilm development period (P <0.05). Therefore, EFF15 and CHX (0.5%, 2% and 4%) were effective in reducing Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus on acrylic surfaces. NES30 and OPF (30 and 6) are not recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3092307207,"Acclimation to environmental changes driven by alterations in gene expression will serve as an important response for some species facing rapid Anthropogenic climate change. Pikas, genus Ochotona, are particularly vulnerable to climate change and current trends suggest that only the highest, coldest elevations within their ranges may remain suitable habitat for these species. In this study we aimed to assess the role of changes in gene expression in potentially facilitating elevational movements in pikas by measuring gene expression in the only known captive pika population, Ochotona dauurica, in response to hypoxic conditions. Using a controlled experiment, we exposed four male pikas to oxygen concentrations characteristic of sea-level, 2,000 m, and 4,000 m for 5 days each. Using blood samples collected after each treatment, we used RNAseq to determine if candidate pathways were undergoing significant changes in gene expression at different levels of oxygen (~100%, ~77%, and ~61% of sea-level oxygen concentrations). Gene set enrichment analyses showed that gene sets associated with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and electron transport chain were significantly enriched for up-regulated genes in the 4,000 m samples compared to samples from the same individuals at lower-elevation conditions. Up-regulation of these pathways is consistent with known mechanisms of oxygen compensation. Our results suggest that these pikas have the acclimation capacity to tolerate oxygen concentrations characteristic of any elevation within their species range and that gene expression can be changed in a matter of days to accommodate drastically different oxygen concentrations. Thus, rapid and radical elevational movements that may be required of some pika species to avoid warmer temperatures in the Anthropocene will likely not be limited by hypoxic stress."

Prior work indicated that in vitro cultivated spirochetes remain infectious to mice by needle inoculation; however, the impact of laboratory propagation on the pathogens natural life cycle has not been determined. Our current study assessed the effect of serial cultivation on the natural tick-mammalian transmission cycle. First, we evaluated genomic DNA profiles from B. turicatae grown to 30, 60, 120, and 300 generations, and these spirochetes were used to needle inoculate mice. Uninfected nymphal ticks were fed on these mice and acquisition, transstadial maintenance, and subsequent transmission after tick bite was determined. Infection frequencies in mice that were fed upon by ticks colonized with B. turicatae grown to 30, 60, and 120 generations were 100%, 100%, and 30%, respectively. Successful infection of mice by tick feeding was not detected after 120 generations. Quantifying B. turicatae in tick tissues indicated that by 300 generations they no longer colonized the vector. The results indicate that in vitro cultivation significantly affects the establishment of tick colonization and murine infection. This work provides a foundation for the identification of essential genetic elements in the tick-mammalian infectious cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3092574912,"Background Tobacco Cessation on Prescription (TCP) is a new intervention that is being evaluated in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in Swedish primary health care (PHC). Patients’ perceptions of TCP are important to understand as this may have implications for the acceptability and adherence to treatment and explain cessation outcomes. Patients’ general experiences of tobacco cessation are also important to explore to improve cessation support in this setting. Aim To explore experiences of tobacco cessation and TCP among patients in Swedish PHC focusing on socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Methods Inductive content analysis of transcripts from eight semi-structured interviews with patients recruited from the intervention group in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of TCP in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in PHC in Stockholm. Results Two themes were identified: needing individualized support to quit, taking differences in patients’ experiences of tobacco use and cessation into account, acknowledging individual factors such as impact of health and wellbeing on tobacco use and differing attitudes towards tobacco and cessation and needing a supportive environment to facilitate tobacco cessation, taking contextual factors like professional support from the health care system, the importance of the social environment and supportive societal structures into account. Regarding TCP, the prescription form was perceived as useful for providers but did not appear to have a direct impact on tobacco cessation from the informants’ perspective. However, individualized counseling from a tobacco cessation specialist, an empathetic approach in the treatment and long-term follow-up was considered important. Conclusion A holistic approach may be needed in cessation treatment, combined with interventions outside the health care system, to facilitate tobacco cessation among patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in Swedish PHC. The TCP prescription form may be helpful for PHC providers but counseling and follow-up appear to be the most important components of TCP for patients in this setting."

We determined the intra-specific variability of germination base temperature among 13 arable weed species and the seedlings' early post-emergence relative growth rate among 21 species in climate chamber and green house experiments. Intra-specific variability was quantified with two seed populations (originating from contrasting climate in Germany & France) for the germination base temperature of 6 species and for the early growth rate of 16 species. Inter-specific variability for both traits was always higher than intra-specific variability. Within a given species, we found that germination base temperatures were higher in seeds stemming from colder climate populations. Seedling relative growth rates did not differ between seed populations. Models simulating weed growth should reflect these differences in germination traits among populations, especially when they are used for weed community assembly studies in a local to regional extent."
https://openalex.org/W3092030598,"Introduction Prior use of direct oral anticoagulants has been associated with reduced stroke severity in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) on stroke severity in patients who were receiving dabigatran or rivaroxaban at the time of stroke onset. Materials and methods We enrolled 107 patients with NVAF who developed acute ischemic stroke while on dabigatran or rivaroxaban and presented within 24 hours to nine hospitals between January 2014 and December 2018. The results of PT and aPTT assays were obtained within 24 hours of stroke onset in all patients. We analyzed PT and aPTT in relation to stroke severity and ischemic lesion volume using correlation and multivariable regression analyses. Results Of the 107 patients included, 46 (43.0%) were on dabigatran and 61 (57.0%) were on rivaroxaban. In patients with prior dabigatran use, while aPTT was inversely correlated with admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (r = -0.369, p = 0.012) and ischemic lesion volume (r = -0.480, p = 0.005), there was no correlation between PT and either of these variables. Multivariable analysis confirmed the existence of a significant independent inverse relationship between aPTT and NIHSS score at admission (B, -0.201; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.370 to -0.032; p = 0.005) and between aPTT and ischemic lesion volume (B, -0.076; 95% CI, -0.130 to -0.023; p = 0.007). In patients with prior rivaroxaban use, neither PT nor aPTT was associated with admission NIHSS score or ischemic lesion volume in the correlation and multivariable analyses. Conclusions In patients with NVAF who were receiving dabigatran, prolonged aPTT was associated with reduced stroke severity."
https://openalex.org/W3091871463,"Demand for heart transplants far exceeds supply of donated organs. This is attributed to the high percentage of donor hearts that are discarded and to the narrow six-hour time window currently available for transplantation. Ex-vivo heart perfusion (EVHP) provides the opportunity for resuscitation of damaged organs and extended transplantation time window by enabling functional assessment of the hearts in a near-physiologic state. Present work investigates the fluid mechanics of the ex-vivo flow loop and corresponding impact on cardiac performance. A mechanical flow loop is developed that is analogous to the region of the EVHP system that mimics in-vivo systemic circulation, including the body’s largest and most compliant artery, the aorta. This investigation is focused on determining the effect of mock aortic tubing compliance on pump performance. A custom-made silicone mock aorta was developed to simulate a range of in-vivo conditions and a physiological flow was generated using a commercial ventricular assist device (VAD). Monitored parameters, including pressure, tube distension and downstream velocity, acquired using time-resolved particle imaging velocimetry (PIV), were applied to an unsteady Bernoulli analysis of the flow in a novel way to evaluate pump performance as a proxy for cardiac workload. When compared to the rigid case, the compliant mock aorta case demonstrated healthier physiologic pressure waveforms, steadier downstream flow and reduced energetic demands on the pump. These results provide experimental verification of Windkessel theory and support the need for a compliant mock aorta in the EVHP system."

During this period, 662.3h of boat-based photo-identification survey effort was carried out during 189 surveys. The sighting histories of 817 identified individuals were used to estimate abundance using capture-recapture modelling. Using open population (POPAN) models, we estimated that 2,155 individuals (95% CI: 1,873–2,479) occurred in the study area, although many individuals appeared to be transients. We recorded smaller group sizes and an apparent decline in abundance in a subset of the study area (Plettenberg Bay) compared to estimates obtained in 2002–2003 at this location. We recorded declines of more than 70% in both abundance and group size for a subset of the study area (Plettenberg Bay), in relation to estimates obtained in 2002–2003 at this location. We discuss plausible hypotheses for causes of the declines, including anthropogenic pressure, ecosystem change, and methodological inconsistencies. Our study highlights the importance of assessing trends in abundance at other locations to inform data-driven conservation management strategies of T. aduncus in South Africa."
