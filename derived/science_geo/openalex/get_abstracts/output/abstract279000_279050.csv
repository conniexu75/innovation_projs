https://openalex.org/W2075991177,"The rate of ejection of alpha-recoil thorium-234 into solution from the surface of zircon sand gives an alpha-recoil range of 550 angstroms. The alpha-recoil thorium-234 atoms ejected into the groundwater may supply excess uranium-234. In pelagic sediments, ejected alpha-recoil thorium-234 may contribute to the supply of mobile uranium-234 in the sedimentary column."
https://openalex.org/W2064032797,"Mitochondria isolated from etiolated shoots of blight-susceptible and blight-resistant corn plants were subjected, in various respiratory states, to the pathotoxin released by Helminthosporium maydis (race T). The addition of the pathotoxin to susceptible mitochondria caused respiratory rate and oxidative phosphorylation changes. The addition of pathotoxin to susceptible mitochondria suspended in a potassium chloride reaction medium induced an immediate and irreversible swelling regardless of the respiratory state of the mitochondria. This membrane swelling correlates with the observed respiratory and coupling effects of the pathotoxin. In all instances, mitochondria isolated from blightresistant corn failed to exhibit any of the above responses to the pathotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1979835459,Moderate shaking of Liquidambar trunks for 30 seconds daily reduced height growth to only 20 to 30 percent of that of trees not shaken. Six of eight trees shaken set terminal buds within 3 weeks. The trees which were not shaken formed no terminal buds. An endogenous mechanism for regulating tree growth in windy situations is implicated.
https://openalex.org/W3210620217,"Research on holography has now grown to such dimensions that we have not been able to mention each of the numerous authors who have made significant contributions to it. Investigators from Bell Telephone Laboratories, the RCA, Xerox, and Westinghouse laboratories, Conductron Corporation, GC-Optronics, IBM, TRW Systems, the University of Michigan, and Stanford University have made particularly significant early contributions in the United States. Especially notable were the efforts of R. J. Collier, L. Lin, K. S. Pennington, D. Ansley, L. Siebert, R. M. Grant, A. Lohmann, R. F. Wuerker, K. Stetson, R. Powell, J. Goodman, and their co-workers, in addition to those already mentioned, among many others. Early work in many parts of the world also includes that in France by S. Lowenthal, G. Nomarski, and J. Viepsilonnot; in Germany by H. Nassenstein; in Great Britain by J. M. Burch; in Japan by J. Tsujiuchi and T. Tsuruta; and in the Soviet Union by Yu. Y. N. Denisyuk, I. Nalimov, and L. M. Soroko. For a fuller account of these developments, see (42) and other references."

(2) Treatment with certain liver fractions orally has succeeded in correcting the granulocytopenia in four days and the anemia in about 10 days in spite of continued ingestion by these animals of the sulfonamide-containing diet."
https://openalex.org/W2048347530,"A large ape existed in India at the close of the Miocene or the beginning of the Pliocene epochs; this ape shows a complex of anatomical structures at the opposite pole from its contemporary, Ramapithecus. Although found in the same beds, the two seldom occur at the same exact sites and levels. Considering the thickness of these beds, recovery close to Haritalyangar does not, of itself, prove sympatry of these two different kinds of Hominoidea. However, both are definitely present at one recently located site representing, most probably, a death assemblage."
