https://openalex.org/W2789887799,"Room-temperature operation is essential for any optoelectronics technology that aims to provide low-cost, compact systems for widespread applications. A recent technological advance in this direction is bolometric detection for thermal imaging, which has achieved relatively high sensitivity and video rates (about 60 hertz) at room temperature. However, owing to thermally induced dark current, room-temperature operation is still a great challenge for semiconductor photodetectors targeting the wavelength band between 8 and 12 micrometres, and all relevant applications, such as imaging, environmental remote sensing and laser-based free-space communication, have been realized at low temperatures. For these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible with high-temperature operation. Here we show that a long-wavelength (nine micrometres) infrared quantum-well photodetector fabricated from a metamaterial made of sub-wavelength metallic resonators exhibits strongly enhanced performance with respect to the state of the art up to room temperature. This occurs because the photonic collection area of each resonator is much larger than its electrical area, thus substantially reducing the dark current of the device. Furthermore, we show that our photonic architecture overcomes intrinsic limitations of the material, such as the drop of the electronic drift velocity with temperature, which constrains conventional geometries at cryogenic operation. Finally, the reduced physical area of the device and its increased responsivity allow us to take advantage of the intrinsic high-frequency response of the quantum detector at room temperature. By mixing the frequencies of two quantum-cascade lasers on the detector, which acts as a heterodyne receiver, we have measured a high-frequency signal, above four gigahertz (GHz). Therefore, these wide-band uncooled detectors could benefit technologies such as high-speed (gigabits per second) multichannel coherent data transfer and high-precision molecular spectroscopy."

However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species' entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world's jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000-208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km2) and low human densities (< 1 person/km2) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions."

It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout several years. With the exception of the coronaviruses, the study represents the first report of sequence data from several viral families within a Southern African insectivorous bat genus; highlighting the need for continued investigations in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W2792158976,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an epoxy resin-based (AH-Plus), a zinc oxide eugenol containing (Pulp-Canal-Sealer) and two calcium silicate containing (MTA-Fillapex and BioRoot-RCS) sealers on primary human osteoblasts (hOB) in freshly mixed and set state. All sealers were mixed strictly according to the manufacturers´ instructions and identically samples were produced. In a pretest cytotoxic sealer concentrations were determined. Thus, for the main cell culture study, dilutions of sealer extract 1:1, 1:2, and 1:10 were used. To simulate a clinical scenario, extracts from freshly mixed sealer were added to the cells on day one. Extracts form set sealers were used for subsequent culturing for 24h, 7d, 14d, and 21d. Cell viability was analyzed by living-cell-count, MTT-assay, and living/dead-staining, cytotoxicity by LDH-assay, and changes by Richardson-staining. All data were statistically evaluated by one way ANOVA and a posthoc analysis with Bonferroni-Holm testing (p<0.05). AH-Plus was cytotoxic in a freshly mixed state, but not when the sealer was set. MTA-Fillapex and Pulp-Canal-Sealer were cytotoxic in a fresh as well as in a set state. BioRoot-RCS showed the lowest toxicity in both states; where as a regeneration of the cells could be observed over time (p<0.05). Contact of freshly mixed AH-Plus to osteoblasts should be avoided. Pulp Canal Sealer and MTA-Fillapex showed no biocompatibility in contact with osteoblasts at all. BioRoot-RCS had a positive influence on the cell metabolism (bioactivity) and is biocompatible."

In Escherichia coli, a primary σ70 factor forms the RNAP holoenzyme to express housekeeping genes. The σ70 contains a large insertion between the conserved regions 1.2 and 2.1, the σ non-conserved region (σNCR), but its function remains to be elucidated. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the E. coli RNAP σ70 holoenzyme and its complex with promoter DNA (open complex, RPo) at 4.2 and 5.75 Å resolutions, respectively, to reveal native conformations of RNAP and DNA. The RPo structure presented here found an interaction between the σNCR and promoter DNA just upstream of the −10 element, which was not observed in a previously determined E. coli RNAP transcription initiation complex (RPo plus short RNA) structure by X-ray crystallography because of restraint of crystal packing effects. Disruption of the σNCR and DNA interaction by the amino acid substitutions (R157A/R157E) influences the DNA opening around the transcription start site and therefore decreases the transcription activity of RNAP. We propose that the σNCR and DNA interaction is conserved in proteobacteria, and RNAP in other bacteria replaces its role with a transcription factor.

https://openalex.org/W2789791362,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30-59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (>30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS."
https://openalex.org/W2790504144,"The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p<0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p<0.001, p = 0.020, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2791036967,"Novel rutin-loaded zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles (ZP) with antioxidant activity in aqueous medium were investigated. The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles’ characteristics. Concerning the antioxidant properties, the highest values of rutin loaded ZP obtained using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2 and 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) decolourisation assays were 52.7% and 71.2%, respectively, and the total antioxidant capacity was 0.40 nmol g-1. The results suggest that zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles can be used as a new nano carrier system for rutin or other water insoluble active ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W2793393903,"Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (Oryza sativa L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2794031605,"X-ray CT is a powerful technology to study root growth in soil in-situ. Root systems can be studied in its true 3D geometry over time. Hence, the same plant can be scanned multiple times during development. A downside is the potential of X-rays to interfere with biological processes and therefore plant growth. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of cumulative X-ray dose on Vicia faba and Hordeum vulgare during a growth period of 17 days. One control treatment without X-ray scanning was compared to two treatments being scanned every two and four days, respectively. Scanned treatments received a maximum cumulative dose of less than 8 Gy. Plant species differed in their susceptibility to X-ray dose. For Vicia faba, mean total root length was reduced significantly. Leave growth was reduced as well. Number and length of second order laterals was reduced significantly, as well as length of first order laterals. Hordeum vulgare showed no negative impact of X-ray dose on any of the root parameters. Large differences between the two species investigated were detected in respect to susceptibility to X-ray dose. Results indicate that for X-ray CT studies involving temporal resolution a control treatment without scanning is required."
https://openalex.org/W2791148865,"The purpose of this study was to explore the viewpoints of parents of young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in relation to their child's transition to adulthood.Data were collected during four structured focus groups with 19 parents of young people with ASD with average to high intellectual capacities. Condensed meaning units were identified and checked during focus groups, and were subsequently linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).Three major themes emerged: to be understood, to understand the world and to succeed. The ICF domains of activity and participation and environmental factors emerged as having the greatest potential to influence transition outcomes.Policies and services should focus on strengths to maximise participation in higher education, employment and independent living amongst young people with ASD. Interventions targeting environmental factors could be effective in improving participation in adult life. Person-centred and individualised approaches could further complement this approach supporting the transition to adulthood for people with ASD, ultimately improving outcomes in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2793475236,"A few studies have assessed the association between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and cognitive impairment (CI) in very old adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multinutrient supplementation rich in n-3 PUFA on the cognitive function in an institutionalized ≥75-year-old population without CI or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial was conducted between 2012 and 2013. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and after one year using 4 neuropsychological tests. Nutritional status was assessed using Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Interaction between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and nutritional status were analyzed using linear regression models. A total of 99 participants were randomized to receive placebo or pills rich in n-3 PUFA. After 1-year follow-up, both groups decreased their MMSE score (-1.18, SD:0. 53 and -0.82, SD:0. 63, p = 0.67 for the control and the intervention group respectively). The memory subscale of the MMSE showed an improvement (+0.26, SD:0.18) in the intervention group against a worsening in the control group (-0.11, SD: 0.14; p = 0.09 for differences between groups). Patients at intervention group with normal nutritional status (MNA ≥24) showed an improvement in the MMSE (+1.03, p = 0.025 for differences between 1-y and baseline measurements) against a worsening in the group with malnutrition (MNA<24) (-0.4, p = 0.886 for differences between 1-y and baseline; p of interaction p = 0.05). Supplementation with n-3 PUFA did not show an improvement in the global cognitive function in institutionalized elderly people without CI or with MCI. They only suggest an apparent improvement in memory loss if previously they were well nourished."
https://openalex.org/W2791844079,"Background Administrative data can be used to support research, such as in the UK Biobank. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are national data for England that include contain ICD-10 diagnoses for inpatient mental healthcare episodes, but the validity of these diagnoses for research purposes has not been assessed. Methods 250 peoples' HES records were selected based on a HES recorded inpatient stay at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a wider schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression. A gold-standard research diagnosis was made using Clinical Records Interactive Search pseudonymised electronic patient records using, and the OPCRIT+ algorithm. Results Positive predictive value at the level of lifetime psychiatric disorder was 100%, and at the level of lifetime diagnosis in the four categories of schizophrenia, wider schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar or unipolar depression was 73% (68–79). Agreement varied by diagnosis, with schizophrenia having the highest PPV at 90% (80–96). Each person had an average of five psychiatric HES records. An algorithm that looked at the last recorded psychiatric diagnosis led to greatest overall agreement with the research diagnosis. Discussion For people who have a HES record from a psychiatric admission with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression, HES records appear to be a good indicator of a mental disorder, and can provide a diagnostic category with reasonable certainty. For these diagnoses, HES records can be an effective way of ascertaining psychiatric diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2789765843,"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a prevalent method for gene expression analysis, depending on the stability of the reference genes for data normalization. Lagerstroemia indica and L. speciosa are popular ornamental plants which are famous for the long flowering period. However, no systematic studies on reference genes in Lagerstroemia have yet been conducted. In the present study, we selected nine candidate reference genes (GAPDH, TUA, TUB, 18S, RPII, EF-1α, ATC, EIF5A and CYP) and evaluated their expression stability in different tissues during floral development of L. indica and L. speciosa using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and, RefFinder). Results showed that RPII and EF-1α were the most stably expressed and suitable reference genes for both of Lagerstroemia species. Moreover, ACT exhibited high expression stability in L. indica and GAPDH was a suitable reference gene for L. speciosa in different flower development stages. TUB was an unsuitable reference gene for gene expression normalization due to significant variations in expression across all samples. Finally, we verified the reliability of the selected candidate reference genes by amplifying an AGAMOUS homolog (LsAG1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. This study provides a list of suitable reference genes, thereby broadening the genetic basis of the gene expression patterns in Lagerstroemia species."
https://openalex.org/W2794048794,"Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive Aedes mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of Aedes albopictus was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted Ae. albopictus haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian Aedes aegypti. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of Ae. aegypti, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian Ae. aegypti mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in Aedes mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America. Our results here should be considered in disease mitigation programs if emergent arboviruses are to be effectively diminished in Panama through vector suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2792142727,"Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) is a form of endocytosis that lacks a defined cytoplasmic machinery. Here, we asked whether glycan interactions, acting from the outside, could be a part of that endocytic machinery. We show that the perturbation of global cellular patterns of protein glycosylation by modulation of metabolic flux affects CIE. Interestingly, these changes in glycosylation had cargo-specific effects. For example, in HeLa cells, GlcNAc treatment, which increases glycan branching, increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) internalization but inhibited CIE of the glycoprotein CD59 molecule (CD59). The effects of knocking down the expression of galectin 3, a carbohydrate-binding protein and an important player in galectin–glycan interactions, were also cargo-specific and stimulated CD59 uptake. By contrast, inhibition of all galectin–glycan interactions by lactose inhibited CIE of both MHCI and CD59. None of these treatments affected clathrin-mediated endocytosis, implying that glycosylation changes specifically affect CIE. We also found that the galectin lattice tailors membrane fluidity and cell spreading. Furthermore, changes in membrane dynamics mediated by the galectin lattice affected macropinocytosis, an altered form of CIE, in HT1080 cells. Our results suggest that glycans play an important and nuanced role in CIE, with each cargo being affected uniquely by alterations in galectin and glycan profiles and their interactions. We conclude that galectin-driven effects exist on a continuum from stimulatory to inhibitory, with distinct CIE cargo proteins having unique response landscapes and with different cell types starting at different positions on these conceptual landscapes.

As a result, it is important to understand the cellular roles that glycans play. One of these roles that has recently received renewed focus is the mediation of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). 2The abbreviations used are: CIEclathrin-independent endocytosisCMEclathrin-mediated endocytosisCRDcarbohydrate-recognizing domainMHCImajor histocompatibility complex class IWGAwheat germ agglutininRCAR. communis agglutininPHA-LP. vulgaris leucoagglutininKDknockdownFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolRIPAradioimmune precipitation assayUEA1U. europaeus agglutinin 1. clathrin-independent endocytosis clathrin-mediated endocytosis carbohydrate-recognizing domain major histocompatibility complex class I wheat germ agglutinin R. communis agglutinin P. vulgaris leucoagglutinin knockdown fluorescence recovery after photobleaching glycosylphosphatidylinositol radioimmune precipitation assay U. europaeus agglutinin 1.

CME is known to have five defined stages: initiation, cargo selection, coat assembly, scission, and uncoating. CME is initiated by proteins that create membrane curvature. Adapter proteins like the AP2 complex then select specific cargo and link the cargo to clathrin and other accessory proteins. Clathrin self-assembles into a cytoplasmic coat around the growing pit, and then dynamin facilitates vesicle scission. The endosomes are then uncoated to produce the final cargo-containing endosome (10McMahon H.T. Boucrot E. Molecular mechanism and physiological functions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev.

Although its molecular mechanism and regulation are still under investigation, CIE is known to play important roles in cellular signaling, plasma membrane repair, polarization, cell adhesion, and migration (12Howes M.T.

Galectins are a family of galactoside-binding lectins with a conserved carbohydrate-recognizing domain (CRD) (15Leffler H. Carlsson S. Hedlund M. Qian Y. Poirier F.

There are three types of galectins: proto-type (galectins 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15) have a single CRD and can homodimerize; tandem repeat-type (galectins 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12) have CRDs at either end of the protein; and chimera-type (its only member galectin 3) has a single CRD but can multimerize to give rise to a pentameric galectin (15Leffler H.

One of the important functions galectins play extracellularly is in organizing the cell membrane via the formation of macroscale interaction networks often referred to as the galectin lattice (20Nabi I.R. Shankar J. Dennis J.W. The galectin lattice at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 (26092931): 2213-221910.1242/jcs.151159Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Galectin 3 is especially important in organizing the galectin lattice, as the multivalence of its pentameric form allows large networks of galectins to form (16Rabinovich G.A. Toscano M.A. Jackson S.S. Vasta G.R. Functions of cell surface galectin-glycoprotein lattices.Curr. Opin. Struct.

In the CLIC/GEEC (clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-enriched endocytic compartments) pathway, it was shown to stimulate internalization of the hyaluronan receptor (CD44) by promoting the formation of endocytic pits (21Johannes L.

Whereas these two modes of action act in opposite directions, there have been hints that these two functions may not be mutually exclusive but could rather represent two ends of a spectrum (23Lakshminarayan R.

Cell Biol. 2014; 16 (24837829): 595Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Here, we investigate whether the well-characterized CIE cargo proteins major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) and CD59 are sensitive to glycan interactions. Further, as depicted in Fig. 1A, the effect of galectin–glycan interactions on cargo internalization was characterized to determine whether these two specific endogenous cargo proteins were affected via similar or different modes of action and whether these modes of action were mutually exclusive. Protein glycosylation is a nontemplate-driven process, and as such, glycan patterns generated on specific proteins are sensitive to the levels of the glycosyltransferases as well as the metabolic flux of their substrates (the various sugar residues) (26Mathew M.P. Tan E. Saeui C.T. Bovonratwet P. Sklar S. Bhattacharya R. Yarema K.J.

Therefore, there are two primary approaches to altering glycan patterns: 1) altering the availability of the enzymes by altering their expression and 2) changing the metabolic flux through the glycosylation machinery by altering the availability of the sugar residues. In this study, the second approach was used to increase levels of GlcNAc in the cell by incubation with millimolar concentrations of the sugar residue. GlcNAc is essential for the branching of glycans, and hence increased availability of this sugar was expected to increase the branching of glycans (29Dennis J.W. Lau K.S. Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Adaptive regulation at the cell surface by N-glycosylation.Traffic. 2009; 10 (19761541): 1569-157810.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00981.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After incubation with 10 mm GlcNAc for 48 h, the cell-surface glycan patterns on HeLa cells were analyzed using lectin binding and flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). The binding of wheat germ (Triticum vulgaris) agglutinin (WGA) (which detects neuraminic/sialic acid as well as GlcNAc residues), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) (which detects terminal galactose residues), and Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) (which binds to tri- and tetra-antennary branched complex N-glycans) was significantly increased following GlcNAc treatment, whereas the binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA1) (which binds fucose) and concanavalin A (which binds high-mannose residues) was not significantly changed by GlcNAc treatment. These results demonstrate that the increased availability of GlcNAc led to increases in glycan branching. These data also indicated that other glycan pattern characteristics were not indirectly affected. Lactose is a competitive inhibitor of galectin–glycan interactions (23Lakshminarayan R. Wunder C.

RCA is a galactoside-binding lectin that binds the same epitope as galectins and hence was used to demonstrate the efficacy of lactose competitive inhibition on galectin binding. Lactose treatment during lectin binding completely inhibited RCA binding, with lactose-treated cells having fluorescent intensity histograms very similar to cells that were not subjected to lectin binding. This demonstrates the efficacy of lactose in blocking galectin–glycan interactions (Fig. 1C). The first question we addressed was whether endocytosis of specific CIE cargo proteins is affected by glycan interactions. To do this, two well-characterized CIE cargo proteins were selected: MHCI and CD59. These two proteins, although both CIE cargo, are considerably different structurally; MHCI is a type I transmembrane protein with a single lumenal site of N-glycosylation, and CD59 is a GPI-anchored protein with two sites of N-glycosylation. These distinct cargo proteins were chosen to address a second question: whether the effects of glycan interactions were uniform for different cargo proteins. The internalization of the two cargos in HeLa cells was measured using an antibody internalization assay in control cells or in cells treated for 48 h with GlcNAc (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that GlcNAc treatment resulted in an increase in MHCI internalization (Fig. 2A). A similar treatment of cells with 10 mm glucose had no effect on MHCI internalization, indicating that the increase was mediated by an increase in glycan branching and not merely due to an increase in nutrient availability. This observation suggests that increased glycan branching enhances MHCI entry into endocytic pits, consistent with the endocytic pit entry modality of glycosylation’s effect on endocytosis. Furthermore, lactose treatment during antibody internalization led to an ablation of the GlcNAc-mediated increase, whereas a similar treatment with sucrose had no effect on MHCI CIE (Fig. 2A). This indicates that the inhibition of all galectin–glycan interactions (and not nonspecific osmolarity effects) can counteract the effect of increased glycan branching on MHCI CIE, suggesting that this increase in internalization was mediated by extracellular galectin–glycan interactions. In contrast, increased glycan branching (by GlcNAc treatment) inhibited CD59 internalization, whereas the analogous treatment with glucose had no effect (Fig. 2B). This suggests that CD59 may be more susceptible to the cell-surface sequestration mode of action. Lactose treatment also inhibited CD59 internalization, whereas a similar sucrose treatment had no effect (ruling out possible effects of high osmolarity) (Fig. 2B). This indicates that glycan interactions are important for CD59 internalization, but if the level of interactions increases past a particular point, it starts to suppress internalization. The results in particular for CD59 suggest that proteins are not assigned a fixed glycan interaction mechanism that dictates internalization, but rather exist on a spectrum between the two and transition across the spectrum based on the level of glycan interactions. The results clearly indicate both that CIE cargo were sensitive to changes in glycosylation and, second, that changes in glycan interactions had cargo-specific effects. The effect of altering glycan interaction on CME was also studied by measuring the internalization of fluorescently labeled transferrin, which enters bound to the transferrin receptor by CME. In sharp contrast to MHCI and CD59, transferrin receptor internalization by CME was not affected in any way by changes in glycan interactions (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with the extensive cytoplasmic machinery that is known to help coordinate and regulate CME. Chemical inhibition of Golgi α-mannosidases by treating cells for 48 h with 2 μg/ml swainsonine leads to an inhibition in the production of complex glycoforms. Decreasing the number of complex glycoforms would decrease the number of epitopes for galectin binding and thus inhibit galectin–glycan interactions. Similar to the effect of lactose, swainsonine treatment leads to a significant inhibition of CD59 internalization (Fig. 2E) and no significant effect on MHCI (Fig. 2D) or transferrin internalization (Fig. 2F). These results further indicate that the internalization of CIE cargo can be mediated via galectin–glycan interactions, whereas CME is unaffected. A number of galectins have been reported to be present in HeLa cells, including galectin 1, 3, 8, and 9 (34Huang E.-Y. Chen Y.F. Chen Y.M. Lin I.H. Wang C.C. Su W.-H. Chuang P.C. Yang K.D.

Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (p<0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, p<0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design."
https://openalex.org/W2792351762,"Increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and activity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a lack of good animal models for examining the presence and catalytic activity of MPO in vascular lesions has impeded mechanistic studies into CKD-associated cardiovascular diseases. Here, we show for the first time that exaggerated atherosclerosis in a pathophysiologically relevant CKD mouse model is associated with increased macrophage-derived MPO activity. Male 7-week-old LDL receptor–deficient mice underwent sham (control mice) or 5/6 nephrectomy and were fed either a low-fat or high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks, and the extents of atherosclerosis and vascular reactivity were assessed. MPO expression and oxidation products—protein-bound oxidized tyrosine moieties 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine—were examined with immunoassays and confirmed with mass spectrometry (MS). As anticipated, the CKD mice had significantly higher plasma creatinine, urea nitrogen, and intact parathyroid hormone along with lower hematocrit and body weight. On both the diet regimens, CKD mice did not have hypertension but had lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels than the control mice. Despite the lower cholesterol levels, CKD mice had increased aortic plaque areas, fibrosis, and luminal narrowing. They also exhibited increased MPO expression and activity (i.e. increased oxidized tyrosines) that co-localized with infiltrating lesional macrophages and diminished vascular reactivity. In summary, unlike non-CKD mouse models of atherosclerosis, CKD mice exhibit increased MPO expression and catalytic activity in atherosclerotic lesions, which co-localize with lesional macrophages. These results implicate macrophage-derived MPO in CKD-accelerated atherosclerosis. Increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and activity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a lack of good animal models for examining the presence and catalytic activity of MPO in vascular lesions has impeded mechanistic studies into CKD-associated cardiovascular diseases. Here, we show for the first time that exaggerated atherosclerosis in a pathophysiologically relevant CKD mouse model is associated with increased macrophage-derived MPO activity. Male 7-week-old LDL receptor–deficient mice underwent sham (control mice) or 5/6 nephrectomy and were fed either a low-fat or high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks, and the extents of atherosclerosis and vascular reactivity were assessed. MPO expression and oxidation products—protein-bound oxidized tyrosine moieties 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine—were examined with immunoassays and confirmed with mass spectrometry (MS). As anticipated, the CKD mice had significantly higher plasma creatinine, urea nitrogen, and intact parathyroid hormone along with lower hematocrit and body weight.

Atherosclerosis, the major cause of CVD, is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration of lipids and inflammatory cells, such as monocyte-derived macrophages and T-lymphocytes, into the artery wall (18Ross R. Atherosclerosis–an inflammatory disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340 (9887164): 115-12610.1056/NEJM199901143400207Crossref PubMed Scopus (19200) Google Scholar). Although elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis greatly (19Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Koch's postulates for cholesterol.Cell. 1992; 71 (1423585): 187-18810.1016/0092-8674(92)90346-EAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in vitro studies suggest that LDL by itself is not atherogenic but must instead be oxidized to initiate atherosclerotic disease (20Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Binding site on macrophages that mediates uptake and degradation of acetylated low-density lipoprotein, producing massive cholesterol deposition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Invest. 1991; 88 (1752940): 1785-179210.1172/JCI115499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL is taken up by scavenger receptors of macrophages, which then become lipid-laden foam cells, the pathologic hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions (22Steinberg D. Atherogenesis in perspective: hypercholesterolemia and inflammation as partners in crime.Nat. Med. 2002; 8 (12411947): 1211-121710.1038/nm1102-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL has been isolated from human and animal atherosclerotic tissue, and immunohistochemical studies have detected oxidized lipids in atherosclerotic lesions, further substantiating the role of oxidative stress in atherosclerosis (23Haberland M.E. Fong D. Cheng L. Malondialdehyde-altered protein occurs in atheroma of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits.Science. 1988; 241 (2455346): 215-21810.1126/science.2455346Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 24Ylä-Herttuala S.

Invest. 1989; 84 (2794046): 1086-109510.1172/JCI114271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A primary source of oxidative stress is myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme peroxidase enzyme that is highly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (26Klebanoff S.J. Rosen H. The role of myeloperoxidase in the microbicidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Ciba Found. Symp. 1978; (225142): 263-284PubMed Google Scholar). Although essential for bacterial killing, unrestrained MPO can induce surrounding tissue damage. Tyrosine residues in proteins are susceptible to covalent oxidative modifications, including the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine (27Vivekanandan-Giri A. Byun J. Pennathur S. Quantitative analysis of amino acid oxidation markers by tandem mass spectrometry.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 491 (21329795): 73-8910.1016/B978-0-12-385928-0.00005-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because these modifications are stable covalent interactions, protein tyrosine modifications serve as a metric of oxidative injury. MPO catalyzes the conversion of chloride ions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to generate hypochlorous acid, a potent oxidant. Hypochlorous acid causes the post-translational modification 3-chlorotyrosine, a highly sensitive and specific marker of MPO activity (28Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. 3-Chlorotyrosine, a specific marker of myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation, is markedly elevated in low-density lipoprotein isolated from human atherosclerotic intima.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99 (9151778): 2075-208110.1172/JCI119379Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Similarly, MPO can generate nitrogen dioxide radical (NO2·) to form 3-nitrotyrosine and produce tyrosyl radicals from free tyrosine that can subsequently oxidize protein tyrosyl residues to form o,o′-dityrosine (29Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A.

These CKD mice exhibit all the biochemical features of CKD and demonstrate accelerated atherosclerosis without elevated blood pressure, diabetes, or worsened hyperlipidemia compared with non-CKD mice. Thus, the CKD LDLr−/− model is an excellent animal model for studying the effects of CKD on atherosclerosis without the concomitant added risk factors. In contrast to non-CKD models, we report robust MPO expression and catalytic activity as demonstrated by elevated MPO oxidation products that co-localize with macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. This implicates macrophage-derived MPO as a source of oxidants in the artery wall, which might propagate CKD-accelerated atherosclerosis.

A crucial part of the gut barrier is the mucus layer, a cross-linked gel on top of the intestinal epithelium that consists predominantly of the mucin glycoprotein MUC2. However, whether the mucin layer actively regulates intestinal immune cell responses is not clear. Because recent evidence suggests that intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) may be regulated by the mucus layer, we purified intestinal mucin, incubated it with human DCs, and determined the functional effects. Here we show that expression of the chemokine IL-8 and co-stimulatory DC markers CD86 and CD83 are significantly up-regulated on human DCs in the presence of intestinal mucins. Additionally, mucin-exposed DCs promoted neutrophil migration in an IL-8-dependent manner. The stimulatory effects of mucins on DCs were not due to mucin sample contaminants such as lipopolysaccharide, DNA, or contaminant proteins. Instead, mucin glycans are important for the pro-inflammatory effects on DCs. Thus, intestinal mucins are capable of inducing important pro-inflammatory functions in DCs, which could be important in driving inflammatory responses upon intestinal barrier damage."

The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness and reliability of spirometry before hospital discharge, comparing it to measurements obtained during clinical stability. Methods This prospective longitudinal observational study compares spirometry results before and 8 weeks after discharge in consecutive patients admitted for COPD exacerbation. Concordance between results was assessed by the Kappa index, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman graphs. Results From an initial population of 179 COPD patients, 100 completed the study (mean age 67.8 years, 83% men, 35% active smokers, FEV1 at clinical stability 40.3%). Forty-nine patients could not complete the study because they did not reach clinical stability. In three patients with obstructive spirometry during admission, the results were normal at follow-up. In the remaining patients, the COPD diagnosis was confirmed at stability with acceptable concordance. In 27 cases, spirometry improved more than 200 mL.No variables were found to be associated with this improvement or to explain it. Conclusions This study provides information on the role of spirometry prior to hospital discharge in patients admitted for COPD exacerbation, demonstrating that it is a valid and reproducible method, representing an opportunity toimprove COPD diagnosis."

Traditionally, the number of citations to national papers has been the evaluative measures of national scientific standings. We raise a different question: instead of analyzing the citations to a countries’ articles (the forward view), we examine references to prior publications from specific countries cited in the most elite publications (the backward—citing—view). “Elite publications” are operationalized as the top-1% most-highly cited articles. Using the articles published from 2004 to 2013, we examine the research referenced in these works. Our results confirm the well-known fact that China has emerged to become a major player in science. However, China still belongs to the low contributors when countries are ranked as contributors to the cited references in top-1% articles. Using this perspective, the results do not support a decreasing trend for the USA; in fact, the USA exceeds expectations (compared to its publication share) in terms of references in the top-1% articles. Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands also appear at the top of the list. However, the results for Germany are lower than statistically expected."

However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies in vivo. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC0-8 as DHB TD > BBR TD >> BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia."

We analyzed these data using SPSS version 20.0.Approximately 19.8% of these youth perceived themselves as underweight, 57.8% as normal weight, and 22.4% as overweight. In reality, 4.9% were underweight, 64.3% were normal weight, and 30.8% were overweight. Furthermore, approximately 66.4% of these Chinese youth correctly perceived their body image, 28.2% underestimated their true body image, and 5.4% overestimated their weight status.

Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that pan class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2790387313,"Background Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories. Results The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease. Conclusion TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2792538738,"Adipogenesis is a tightly regulated cellular process and is closely associated with obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. Multiple transcription factors and signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. Here, we report that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3), which was reported to play an important role in many cellular processes, is essential to adipocyte differentiation at early and terminal differentiation phases. Mechanistically, GSK3 modulates adipogenesis through regulation of both canonical Wnt pathways, which involve Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and noncanonical Wnt pathways, which include JNK and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate signaling. GSK3-regulated adipogenesis is also mediated by secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), especially SFRP1, the canonical Wnt antagonist. The obesity-induced increase of Sfrp1 expression can be reversed by the GSK3 inhibitor. GSK3-regulated expression of Sfrp is mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). We demonstrated that GSK3 activates STAT5 through regulation of its phosphorylation to bind to the promoter of Sfrp genes and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? gene to stimulate their expression, which could ultimately lead to a modulated adipogenic process. Our findings identify a GSK3/STAT5/SFRP/Wnt regulatory axis of adipogenesis and shed light on the molecular mechanism of adipogenesis by suggesting that different pathways and adipogenic regulators coordinately modulate adipocyte differentiation.—Wang L., Wang, Y., Meng, Y., Zhang, C., Di, L.

https://openalex.org/W2790235074,"Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied."
https://openalex.org/W2791114218,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, B. pseudomallei exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of B. pseudomallei were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by B. pseudomallei. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of B. pseudomallei and the related B. thailandensis under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, viz. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of B. pseudomallei in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm. In addition, MEM and IMI were able to inhibit B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis biofilm formation to a larger extend compared to CAZ and DOX. Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions. Since biofilm formation is believed to be involved in disease relapse, MEM and IMI may be better therapeutic options than CAZ for melioidosis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2790038689,"De novo formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets."

We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile. Subjects/Methods 5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests. Results Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction). Conclusions WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings."

Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay. Here, we study a simple cell cycle model that produces oscillations due to the presence of an ultrasensitive, time-delayed negative feedback loop. We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters. In doing so, we find that different implementations of the time delay can have a large impact on the resulting oscillations."

However, the underlying mechanisms, especially the initial sensors and transducers connecting the nuclear DNA damage signal with cytoplasmic NF-κB activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA), an established NF-κB activator in the cytosol, unexpectedly exhibited nuclear translocation and accumulation on damaged chromatin following genotoxic stress. Accordingly, we also found that DNA damage–induced transcriptional activation and the resulting secretion of classic NF-κB targets, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, was greatly enhanced in TIFA-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Mechanistically, DNA damage–induced TIFA phosphorylation at threonine 9 (pThr-9), and this phosphorylation event, involving the pThr-binding forkhead-associated domain, was crucial for its enrichment on damaged chromatin and subsequent NF-κB activation. Moreover, in conjunction with its partner protein, the E3 ligase TNF receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TIFA relayed the DNA damage signals by stimulating ubiquitination of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), whose sumoylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination were critical for NF-κB’s response to DNA damage. Consistently, TRAF2 knockdown suppressed TIFA overexpression–enhanced NEMO ubiquitination under genotoxic stress, and a unphosphorylatable Thr-9–mutated TIFA variant had only minor effects on NEMO poly-ubiquitination. Finally, in agreement with the model of DNA damage–associated secretory senescence barrier against carcinogenesis, ectopic TIFA expression limited proliferation of multiple myeloma cancer cells.

An emerging theme in DDR-induced cellular phenotypic change is the dramatically increased secretion of a myriad inflammatory factors, including cytokines, chemokines, and interferons, which contribute to cancer development and senescence progression in autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine fashions via their collaborations with DDR (1Lopez-Otin C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G.

Such secretome alternations are manifested in the conditions with oncogene overexpression or tumor suppressor inactivation, and hence are designated as “senescence-associated secretory phenotype” in the senescence barrier model of malignancy (2Coppe J.P.

The NF-κB family transcription factors are master regulators for transcriptional activation of secretory factors, especially during cellular response to the genotoxic stress (3McCool K.W. Miyamoto S. DNA damage-dependent NF-κB activation: NEMO turns nuclear signaling inside out.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246 (22435563): 311-32610.1111/j.1600-065X.2012.01101.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite the diversity of upstream stimuli, the NF-κB cascade shares a common activation scheme consisting of phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB (inhibitors of NF-κB) proteins, which result in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB with masked nuclear localization signal of IκB exposed (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132 (18267068): 344-36210.1016/j.cell.2008.01.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). A plethora of physical and chemical stresses engage specific receptors and intracellular adaptors to transduce signals, and they generally converge on activation of the IκB-kinase complex (IKK), which is composed by the catalytic subunit (IKKα or IKKβ) and the regulatory subunit (IKKγ, also known as NEMO) (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132 (18267068): 344-36210.1016/j.cell.2008.01.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). TRAF (TNF receptor–associated factor) family proteins, represented by TRAF2 and TRAF6 with a N-terminal RING finger domain, are key intermediates in many NF-κB signaling pathways, employing their E3 ligase activity to synthesize a regulatory lysine 63-linked poly-ubiquitin chain on target proteins (4Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132 (18267068): 344-36210.1016/j.cell.2008.01.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar, 5Chen Z.J.

The K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chain, critical for the assembly of TAK1-TAB2/TAB3 and IKK complexes, is directly bound by ubiquitin recognizing modules from TABs or NEMO, and the TAK1-TAB2/TAB3 complex could subsequently trigger IKK phosphorylation and activation (5Chen Z.J.

The “inside-out” transduction of DNA damage signals obliges nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mechanisms, and NEMO exploits its post-translational modifications to meet this requirement and hence takes center stage in DNA damage–induced NF-κB activation (3McCool K.W. Miyamoto S. DNA damage-dependent NF-κB activation: NEMO turns nuclear signaling inside out.Immunol.

Following genotoxic stress, NEMO in the nucleus is sequentially modified with sumoylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (7Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. Sequential modification of NEMO/IKKγ by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin mediates NF-κB activation by genotoxic stress.Cell. 2003; 115 (14651848): 565-57610.1016/S0092-8674(03)00895-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of WT NEMO promotes its nuclear localization, whereas the nonsumoylatable NEMO is almost exclusively retained in the cytoplasm and deficient for NF-κB activation following DNA damage (3McCool K.W.

The necessity of NEMO phosphorylation was demonstrated by the failure of the serine 85 to alanine mutant of NEMO for mono-ubiquitination and subsequent nuclear transport (8Wu Z.H. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. Miyamoto S. Molecular linkage between the kinase ATM and NF-κB signaling in response to genotoxic stimuli.Science. 2006; 311 (16497931): 1141-114610.1126/science.1121513Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). NEMO mono-ubiquitination occurs on the same lysine (277 and 309) as sumoylation, but functionally counteracts with the nuclear localization preference caused by sumoylation, thereby contributing to the propagation of DNA damage signals outside of the nucleus and to the ultimate IKK activation taking place in cytoplasm (3McCool K.W.

In early two-hybrid screening with TRAF2 or TRAF6 used as bait, TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) was first identified as a TRAF-interacting protein (9Kanamori M.

It contains a characteristic forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which specifically binds to phosphorylated threonine (11Pennell S. Westcott S. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Patel D. Li J. Nott T.J. Mohammed D.

The FHA domain is intimately linked to DNA damage–repair pathways due to the prevalence of phosphorylation events in multiprotein complex assembly following genotoxic stress, and such a significance could be demonstrated by several FHA-containing proteins, such as MDC1, NBS1, and CHK1 in DDR and cell-cycle checkpoint activation (12Reinhardt H.C. Yaffe M.B. Phospho-Ser/Thr-binding domains: navigating the cell cycle and DNA damage response.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Along with the critical function of TRAF in the NF-κB cascade, TIFA was reported to participate in the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by promoting oligomerization and ubiquitination of TRAF proteins (13Ea C.K. Sun L. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. TIFA activates IκB kinase (IKK) by promoting oligomerization and ubiquitination of TRAF6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interestingly, under tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulation, TIFA is phosphorylated at threonine 9, which could be recognized by its FHA domain. The resultant intermolecular binding between FHA and threonine phosphorylation leads to TIFA oligomerization and TIFA-mediated NF-κB activation (14Huang C.C. Weng J.H. Wei T.Y. Wu P.Y. Hsu P.H.

We identified TIFA as a novel regulator for this pathway and delineated the biochemical mechanisms underlying the TIFA-TRAF2 complex-mediated NF-κB activation following genotoxic stress. In an attempt to identify novel adaptors of DNA damage–induced NF-κB activation, we screened a panel of candidates from known NF-κB activators. We first monitored their localization following DNA damage, reasoning that initial sensors of genotoxic stress should be enriched in nucleus. Microscopic examination using FLAG-fused proteins revealed an established NF-κB regulator, TIFA, which was reported to be cytosolic under IL-1 and TNF stimulation (9Kanamori M. Suzuki H. Saito R. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. T2BP, a novel TRAF2 binding protein, can activate NF-κB and AP-1 without TNF stimulation.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This observation was independently supported with biochemical fractionation experiments using chromatins isolated from HeLa cells, as the loading of FLAG-tagged TIFA onto chromatin in ETO-treated cells was evident along with DNA damage–induced γH2AX enrichment compared with control cells (Fig. 1b). Another fractionation approach with nuclear lysis buffer containing 150 mm KOAc (22Zhao Q. Wang Q.E. Ray A. Wani G. Han C. Milum K. Wani A.A. Modulation of nucleotide excision repair by mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19740755): 30424-3043210.1074/jbc.M109.044982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) further confirmed that TIFA could be loaded onto damaged chromatin, with a corresponding decrease in cytoplasm (Fig. 1c). Moreover, TIFA enrichment on chromatin was not observed following LPS treatment, indicating translocation of TIFA is specific to DNA damage treatment (Fig. 1d). To better understand the function of TIFA, we generated an antibody against TIFA with high specificity (Fig. S1). We then consolidated DNA damage–induced TIFA enrichment on chromatin using this antibody and a pair of multiple myeloma cell lines (see below). The U266 cell lines with low endogenous TIFA expression were stably integrated with TIFA expression cassettes and the chromatin fractionation results confirmed the concomitant enrichment of TIFA and γH2AX when treated with ETO (Fig. 1e). Importantly, although RPMI-8226 cells bearing high endogenous TIFA expression showed chromatin-bound TIFA in the resting state correlating with their higher level of spontaneous DNA damages, ETO treatment caused increased TIFA loading onto chromatin, implying DNA damage–induced TIFA dynamics in in vivo settings (Fig. 1f). Although the implications of TIFA in canonical NF-κB pathways have been studied, there have been no reports on the role of TIFA in DNA damage–induced NF-κB activation, to our knowledge. Given the novel observations on nuclear translocation and chromatin accumulation of TIFA following DDR, we then examined NF-κB activation in DNA-damaged conditions with a gain-of-function model for TIFA. We first performed a luciferase reporter assay using the reporter construct with a classic NF-κB binding motif. In this experiment, the reporter was strongly activated in HeLa cells stably transfected with TIFA expression vector 6 h after ETO treatment, but such activation was barely detected in the control cells (Fig. 2a). Importantly, the critical event in NF-κB activation indicated by IκBα phosphorylation could only be observed in TIFA-transfected cells following ETO treatment (Fig. 2b). We then measured the mRNA expression level changes for three classic NF-κB targets, including IL-6, IL-8, and A20, following DNA damage and TIFA overexpression. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we found all the three genes were up-regulated after ETO treatment in the TIFA-overexpressed HeLa cells but not in their control cells (Fig. 2c). Quantitative assessment of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) further supported TIFA-promoted NF-κB activation following DDR, as the secretion of these two cytokines in TIFA-overexpressed cells relative to control cells was significantly increased when the cells were exposed to ETO (Fig. 2d). With the fact that TIFA could be accumulated on damaged DNA (Fig. 1) and the significance of FHA domain in DDR signaling pathways, it would be interesting to test the function of the FHA domain on TIFA-mediated NF-κB activation. Indeed, two groups of point mutations in the conserved residues of the FHA domain (MT1, R51A/K88A/N89A or MT2, G50E/S66A) (10Takatsuna H. Kato H. Gohda J. Akiyama T. Moriya A. Okamoto Y. Yamagata Y.

On the other hand, the sole FHA domain of TIFA also failed to induce IL-6 and IL-8 transcription (Fig. 3a). To understand the molecular basis for DNA damage–induced chromatin accumulation of TIFA, we first performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to test the physical association between TIFA and γH2AX, given the pivotal role of γH2AX in marking DNA damage and orchestrating numerous signaling pathways in DDR. The results indicated that the interaction between TIFA and γH2AX was increased upon ETO treatment, whereas the immunoprecipitation efficiency using FLAG antibody was comparable in control versus damaged conditions (Fig. 3b). This point was further supported by the epistasis test using cells co-transfected with TIFA and H2AX mutants (S139A or S139E). Quantitative RT-PCR results suggested that co-transfection of the phosphorylation mimicking mutant S139E of H2AX showed greater activation of IL-8 and A20, whereas the nonphosphorylatable mutant S139A of H2AX suppressed TIFA’s effect (Fig. 3c). These functional interactions could only be observed under DNA-damaged conditions but not in LPS-treated cells, implying the specific dependence of TIFA on H2AX in DNA damage–induced NF-κB activation. The direct intermolecular association between the FHA domain and the phosphothreonine (pThr-9) (14Huang C.C. Weng J.H. Wei T.Y. Wu P.Y. Hsu P.H. Chen Y.H. Wang S.C. Qin D. Hung C.C. Chen S.T.

Surprisingly, the single point mutation at Thr-9 (TIFA-T9A) was sufficient to abolish its enrichment on damaged chromatin (Fig. 3d). Consistent with this result, TIFA–T9A showed minimal effect on DNA damaged–induced NF-κB activation evidenced by decreased IκBα phosphorylation, sustained total IκBα protein levels (Fig. 3e), and blunted up-regulation of NF-κB targets (Fig. 3f) in TIFA–T9A–transfected cells compared with the WT TIFA–transfected cells. Examination of the phosphorylation state of TIFA suggested that DNA damage could effectively induce its phosphorylation (Fig. 3g). Importantly, such a phosphorylation event could not be detected by use of TIFA–T9A, indicating that DNA damage–elicited TIFA phosphorylation occurred at Thr-9 (Fig. 3g). These data collectively suggested that TIFA engages phosphorylation-triggered intermolecular FHA binding to propagate DNA damage signals to NF-κB. To understand the molecular function of endogenous TIFA in genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation, we then surveyed the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (24Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N.

We found TIFA was highly expressed in hematopoietic or lymphoid cell lines (Fig. 4a). With the antibody capable of efficiently probing endogenous TIFA proteins, we confirmed the high levels of TIFA in NALM-6 and RPMI-8226, which are both B cell-derived cancer cell lines (Fig. 4b). As a control, TIFA was lowly expressed in U266 cells. Consistent with the data in TIFA stably expressed HeLa cells, overexpression of TIFA in U266 cell lines using lentivirus caused efficient IκBα and IKK phosphorylation and significant up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 following ETO treatment (Fig. 4, c–e). To further explore TIFA-associated secretory changes, we screened a panel of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors identified previously (2Coppe J.P. Patil C.K. Rodier F. Sun Y. Munoz D.P. Goldstein J. Nelson P.S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J.

Consistently, ELISA results suggested that the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly increased in TIFA–overexpressed cells relative to control cells when they were exposed to ETO (Fig. 4g). To validate TIFA-induced NF-κB activation following DNA damage was indeed dependent on the IKK pathway, the IKKβ inhibitor IKK-16 (25Duckworth C. Zhang L. Carroll S.L. Ethier S.P. Cheung H.W. Overexpression of GAB2 in ovarian cancer cells promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by upregulating chemokine expression.Oncogene. 2016; 35 (26657155): 4036-404710.1038/onc.2015.472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and IKKα inhibitor PS-1145 (26Hideshima T.

As shown in Fig. 4h, TIFA-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation of total IκBα upon genotoxic stress were impaired by either IKK-16 or PS-1145 treatment. Consistently, TIFA-induced up-regulation of CXCL10 and GM-CSF following DNA damage were severely suppressed by PS-1145 (Fig. 4i). Together, these results suggested that TIFA-induced NF-κB activation under genotoxic stress depended on IKK activation. The necessity of TIFA for DNA damage–induced NF-κB activation was then determined using the RPMI-8226 cell line-based loss-of-function model. We transduced RPMI-8226 cells with lentiviral shRNA against TIFA or a nonsilenced control and the efficiency of TIFA depletion was validated by Western blotting (Fig. 4k, right). Importantly, both IκBα phosphorylation and up-regulation of CXCL10 were greatly suppressed upon TIFA removal (Fig. 4, j and k), supporting the essential function of endogenous TIFA in DNA damage–activated NF-κB cascade. We next sought to address the molecular mechanisms underlying TIFA-promoted NF-κB activation following DDR. NEMO as a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex is the controlling nexus for genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation (3McCool K.W. Miyamoto S.

https://openalex.org/W2793399084,"Background Heart failure (HF) is associated with considerable mortality. The electrocardiographic frontal QRS-T angle is a simple parameter to measure, reflects changes in the direction of the repolarization sequence and predicts outcome in patients with HF. Data regarding temporal changes in the frontal QRS-T angle in patients with HF and its impact on outcome is limited. Aim To evaluate temporal changes in the frontal QRS-T angle and its effect on survival in patients with HF. Methods Baseline and follow-up QRS-T angle were calculated from the frontal QRS and T axis of the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. Patients were followed for survival. Results 2,929 HF patients were evaluated. Median interval between baseline ECG and follow-up ECG was 895 days, median follow-up time was 1526 days. Overall, the QRS-T angle tended to be stable, with minor changes in the angle over time. The median QRS-T angle change was +3° (IQR -19° to +30°). Overall survival during follow-up was 60%. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for significant predictors demonstrated that the QRS-T angle was an incremental predictor of increased mortality. A widening of the QRS-T angle during follow-up was independently associated with an increase in mortality, evident with an increase of the QRS-T angle difference above 0° (P<0.0001 for the adjusted model). Conclusion QRS-T angle is relatively stable in patients with HF and is a powerful predictor of outcome. Widening of the QRS-T angle has predictive value and is an ominous sign."
https://openalex.org/W2789401454,"In our study we examined postural performance of young healthy persons (HY), elderly healthy persons (HE), and elderly persons at high risk of falling (FR). Anterio-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as linear displacements of the center of mass (COM) were assessed in persons standing with eyes either open or closed, while none, and 40 and 30 Hz vibrations were applied bilaterally to the ankle muscle gastrocnemius. During quiet standing with eyes open, balance parameters in FR group differed from those in healthy groups. ML ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as COM linear displacements were noticeably larger in FR group. During quiet standing with eyes closed, all balance parameters in participants of all groups had a clear trend to increase. During standing with eyes open, 40 Hz vibration increased all but one balance parameter within HY group, ankle angular deviations in HE group, but none in FR group. In response to 30 Hz vibration, only ankle angular deviations and COM linear displacements increased in HY group. There were no changes in both elderly groups. During standing with eyes closed, 40 and 30 Hz vibrations did not produce consistent changes in balance parameters in HY and HE groups. In FR persons, 40 Hz vibration did not change balance parameters. However, in FR groups, 30 Hz vibration decreased ankle and hip angular deviations, and COM linear displacements. The major result of the study is a finding that low intensity vibration of ankle muscles makes balance better in elderly persons at high risk of falling. This result is clinically relevant because it suggests that applying mild vibration to ankle muscles while standing and walking might benefit elderly persons, improving their postural performance and reducing a risk of unexpected falls."
https://openalex.org/W2792129483,"The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones."
https://openalex.org/W2790479531,"To investigate the factors associated with death and describe the gestational outcomes in pregnant women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we conducted a case-control study (deaths and recovered) in hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in the state of São Paulo from June 9 to December 1, 2009. All cases were evaluated, and four controls that were matched by the epidemiological week of hospitalization of the case were randomly selected for each case. Cases and controls were selected from the National Disease Notification System-SINAN Influenza-web. The hospital records from 126 hospitals were evaluated, and home interviews were conducted using standardized forms. A total of 48 cases and 185 controls were investigated. Having had a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for an influenza episode before hospital admission was a risk factor for death (adjusted OR (ORadj) of 7.93, 95% CI 2.19-28.69). Although not significant in the multiple analysis (ORadj of 2.13, 95% CI 0.91-5.00), the 3rd trimester deserves attention, with an OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.13-4.37 in the univariate analysis. Antiviral treatment was a protective factor when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset (ORadj = 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.50) and from 48 to 72 hours (ORadj = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.87). There was a higher proportion of fetal deaths and preterm births among cases (p = 0.001) and live births with low weight (p = 0.019), compared to control subjects who gave birth during hospitalization. After discharge, control subjects had a favorable neonatal outcome. Early antiviral treatment during the presence of a flu-like illness is an important factor in reducing mortality from influenza in pregnant women and unfavorable neonatal outcomes. It is important to monitor pregnant women, particularly in the 3rd trimester of gestation, with influenza illness for diagnosis and early treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2790574432,"Metabolic engineering focuses on rewriting the metabolism of cells to enhance native products or endow cells with the ability to produce new products. This engineering has the potential for wide-range application, including the production of fuels, chemicals, foods and pharmaceuticals. Glycolysis manages the levels of various secondary metabolites by controlling the supply of glycolytic metabolites. Metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis is expected to cause an increase in the secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we constructed a budding yeast strain harboring the combination of triple sirtuin gene deletion (hst3∆ hst4∆ sir2∆) and interruption of gluconeogenesis by the deletion of the FBP1 gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fbp1∆). hst3∆ hst4∆ sir2∆ fbp1∆ cells harbored active glycolysis with high glucose consumption and active ethanol productivity. Using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) analysis, hst3∆ hst4∆ sir2∆ fbp1∆ cells accumulated not only glycolytic metabolites but also secondary metabolites, including nucleotides that were synthesized throughout the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, although various amino acids remained at low levels. Using the stable isotope labeling assay for metabolites, we confirmed that hst3∆ hst4∆ sir2∆ fbp1∆ cells directed the metabolic fluxes of glycolytic metabolites into the PP pathway. Thus, the deletion of three sirtuin genes (HST3, HST4 and SIR2) and the FBP1 gene can allow metabolic reprogramming to increase glycolytic metabolites and several secondary metabolites except for several amino acids."

We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (p values<0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident. Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident."
https://openalex.org/W2789784582,"Our previous studies have shown that response gene to complement (RGC)-32 deficiency (Rgc32−/−) protects mice from diet-induced obesity and increases thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissues. However, the underlying mechanisms by which RGC-32 regulates thermogenic gene expression remain to be determined. In the present study, RGC-32 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) was suppressed during cold exposure-induced WAT browning. Rgc32−/− significantly increased thermogenic gene expression in the differentiated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of inguinal (i)WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Rgc32−/− and cold exposure regulated a common set of genes in iWAT, as shown by RNA sequencing data. Pathway enrichment analyses showed that Rgc32−/− down-regulated PI3K/Akt signaling-related genes. Akt phosphorylation was also consistently decreased in Rgc32−/− iWAT, which led to an increase in ß3-adrenergic receptor (ß3-AR) expression and subsequent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-1. ß3-AR antagonist SR 59230A and mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocked Rgc32−/−-induced thermogenic gene expression in both iWAT and inter-scapular BAT. These results indicate that RGC-32 suppresses adipose tissue thermogenic gene expression through down-regulation of ß3-AR expression and mTORC1 activity via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.—Chen, S., Mei, X., Yin, A., Yin, H., Cui, X.-B., Chen, S.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2789957932,"Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification."
https://openalex.org/W2791111344,"The cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa is an ecosystem engineer that builds reef structures on the seafloor. The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder Lophelia pertusa and the active suspension feeding sponge Hymedesmia coriacea as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of 13C-enriched bacteria/15N-enriched algae or 15N-enriched bacteria/13C-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold-water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2791451883,"S-allylmercapto-N-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Treatment of gst-4 reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of C. elegans strains N2 (wild type strain), gst-4 reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of C. elegans (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H2O2 (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. C. elegans nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in C. elegans nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan."

Significantly higher mortality rates (11.3% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.032) were recorded in the case of weekend admissions, with similar proportions of ICU admission and CPR events. The post-intervention cohort included 601 patients. No significant difference was recorded in any of the main outcomes between weekday and weekend admissions. PSM for pre-intervention and post-intervention cohort showed shorter LOS after intervention, with no difference in ICU admission, CPR, and morality for the weekday and weekend admissions, respectively. The three-year cohort that followed, consisting of 3315 patients, showed no difference of outcomes between weekday and weekend admissions. After PSM, there were no significant differences in ICU admission rates (1.0% vs. 1.8%), CPR (0.3% vs. 0.2%) events and hospital mortality rates (8.1% vs. 8.5%), when weekday and weekend admissions were compared.The seven-day hospitalist program shows potential in providing equally safe care for both weekday and weekend general medicine admissions with sustainable development."

Early detection to improve breast cancer survival as well as reducing risk factors remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of introducing a mammography screening program for Vietnamese women aged 45-64 years, compared to the current situation of no screening.Decision analytical modeling using Markov chain analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs were derived from published literature and the results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.The ICER per life year gained of the first round of mammography screening was US$3647.06 and US$4405.44 for women aged 50-54 years and 55-59 years, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, mammography screening in the 50-54 age group and the 55-59 age group were cost-effective in 100% of cases at a threshold of three times the Vietnamese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) i.e., US$6332.70. However, less than 50% of the cases in the 60-64 age group and 0% of the cases in the 45-49 age group were cost effective at the WHO threshold. The ICERs were sensitive to the discount rate, mammography sensitivity, and transition probability from remission to distant recurrence in stage II for all age groups.From the healthcare payer viewpoint, offering the first round of mammography screening to Vietnamese women aged 50-59 years should be considered, with the given threshold of three times the Vietnamese GDP per capita."
https://openalex.org/W2792250106,"This study was designed to assess the mechanical properties of two calcium carbonate tempers, limestone and burnt shell. These tempers have been previously compared, in separate studies, to silicate-based grit or sand temper and, relative to the latter, are assumed to possess similar mechanical properties. However, their simultaneous use at the Morrison Village site begs the question: do these two calcium carbonate tempers indeed possess similar mechanical properties? In order to assess their performance characteristics, a side-by-side controlled experimental test was conducted to determine the degree of similarity in providing increased vessel strength and toughness.Standardized ceramic test samples were systematically prepared via a set, explicit protocol. An Instron Series IX universal testing machine configured with a four-point flexural test jig was used to perform a flexural strength test of the test samples. The Instron load and deflection data were used to calculate three values related to mechanical performance: peak load, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity.All four comparative tests clearly show substantial differences in peak load, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity. These differences are statistically significant for each performance attribute in every iteration of the experiment and as indicated by Mann-Whitney U Tests.These results do not support the hypothesis that limestone and burnt shell offer the same performance characteristics. These results have implications for our understanding of prehistoric human selection of temper and the evolution of ceramic technology. Although both carbonate-based tempers are currently thought to offer the same benefits during the initial phase of pottery production, their contrasting post firing properties would have provided distinct benefits in different contexts. Future assessments of the Morrison Village ceramic assemblage should focus on residue analysis, or other functional indicators, to support or falsify this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2790516916,"Current approaches for DNA extraction and fragmentation from mammalian spermatozoa provide several challenges for the investigation of the oxidative stress burden carried in the genome of male gametes. Indeed, the potential introduction of oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, reducing agents (dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol), and DNA shearing techniques used in the preparation of samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing serve to cofound the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. Here we report optimised methodology that minimises, or completely eliminates, exposure to DNA damaging compounds during extraction and fragmentation procedures. Specifically, we show that Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion prior to cellular lysis generates a greater DNA yield with minimal collateral oxidation while randomly fragmenting the entire paternal genome. This modified methodology represents a significant improvement over traditional fragmentation achieved via sonication in the preparation of genomic DNA from human spermatozoa for downstream applications, such as next-generation sequencing. We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation."

Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that Neisseria meningitidis traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with."
https://openalex.org/W2791355099,"The asymmetry of autonomic arousal for potential losses and gains was assessed by the galvanic skin response (GSR) of participants playing classic and inverted versions of the Monty Hall problem (MHP). In both versions, the prize remained the same (a pen valued at £10 for the right answer), but in the modified version, prizes were received prior to choosing the door. Both experimental groups showed increased levels of GSR while completing the task, demonstrating increased autonomic arousal during the game. However, a robust difference in GSR was detected between classic and inverted versions of the MHP, thus demonstrating the differing autonomic arousal involved in deciding between the alternatives presented by the game. Participants experienced a stronger autonomic response when they could lose the prize than when they could win the prize. This experiment presents the first demonstration of this effect on the MHP. The stronger autonomic arousal for the inverted task may indicate a stronger emotional reaction and/or greater attentional focus than for the standard version of the task. These data demonstrate that potential losses increase arousal in more complex tasks than is typically shown."
