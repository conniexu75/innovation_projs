https://openalex.org/W3195627052,"The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines is a major public health breakthrough. However, members of US Black and Hispanic communities, already disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 virus, may be less willing to receive the vaccine. We conducted a broad, representative survey of US adults (N = 1,950) in order to better understand vaccine beliefs and explore opportunities to increase vaccine acceptance among these groups. The survey results suggested that Black and Hispanic individuals were less willing than Whites to receive the vaccine. US Blacks and Hispanics also planned to delay receiving the COVID-19 vaccine for a longer time period than Whites, potentially further increasing the risk of contracting COVID-19 within populations that are already experiencing high disease prevalence. Black respondents were less likely to want the COVID-19 vaccine at all compared with Whites and Hispanics, and mistrust of the vaccine among Black respondents was significantly higher than other racial/ethnic groups. Encouragingly, many Black and Hispanic respondents reported that COVID-19 vaccine endorsements from same-race medical professionals would increase their willingness to receive it. These respondents said they would also be motivated by receiving more information on the experiences of vaccine study participants who are of their own race and ethnicity. The results have implications for improved messaging of culturally-tailored communications to help reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3193479663,"Brain organoids represent a powerful tool for studying human neurological diseases, particularly those that affect brain growth and structure. However, many diseases manifest with clear evidence of physiological and network abnormality in the absence of anatomical changes, raising the question of whether organoids possess sufficient neural network complexity to model these conditions. Here, we explore the network-level functions of brain organoids using calcium sensor imaging and extracellular recording approaches that together reveal the existence of complex network dynamics reminiscent of intact brain preparations. We demonstrate highly abnormal and epileptiform-like activity in organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Rett syndrome, accompanied by transcriptomic differences revealed by single-cell analyses. We also rescue key physiological activities with an unconventional neuroregulatory drug, pifithrin-α. Together, these findings provide an essential foundation for the utilization of brain organoids to study intact and disordered human brain network formation and illustrate their utility in therapeutic discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3193986928,"Although three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is central to many aspects of nuclear function, it has been difficult to measure at the single-cell level. To address this, we developed 'single-cell split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension' (scSPRITE). scSPRITE uses split-and-pool barcoding to tag DNA fragments in the same nucleus and their 3D spatial arrangement. Because scSPRITE measures multiway DNA contacts, it generates higher-resolution maps within an individual cell than can be achieved by proximity ligation. We applied scSPRITE to thousands of mouse embryonic stem cells and detected known genome structures, including chromosome territories, active and inactive compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs) as well as long-range inter-chromosomal structures organized around various nuclear bodies. We observe that these structures exhibit different levels of heterogeneity across the population, with TADs representing dynamic units of genome organization across cells. We expect that scSPRITE will be a critical tool for studying genome structure within heterogeneous populations."
https://openalex.org/W3194385280,"The distributive power of the arithmetic operators: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, gives the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) its unique ability to find the global optimum for optimization problems used to test its performance. Several other mathematical operators exist with the same or better distributive properties, which can be exploited to enhance the performance of the newly proposed AOA. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the AOA called nAOA algorithm, which uses the high-density values that the natural logarithm and exponential operators can generate, to enhance the exploratory ability of the AOA. The addition and subtraction operators carry out the exploitation. The candidate solutions are initialized using the beta distribution, and the random variables and adaptations used in the algorithm have beta distribution. We test the performance of the proposed nAOA with 30 benchmark functions (20 classical and 10 composite test functions) and three engineering design benchmarks. The performance of nAOA is compared with the original AOA and nine other state-of-the-art algorithms. The nAOA shows efficient performance for the benchmark functions and was second only to GWO for the welded beam design (WBD), compression spring design (CSD), and pressure vessel design (PVD)."

Here we present clonotype neighbor graph analysis (CoNGA), a graph theoretic approach that identifies correlations between GEX profile and TCR sequence through statistical analysis of GEX and TCR similarity graphs. Using CoNGA, we uncovered associations between TCR sequence and GEX profiles that include a previously undescribed 'natural lymphocyte' population of human circulating CD8+ T cells and a set of TCR sequence determinants of differentiation in thymocytes. These examples show that CoNGA might help elucidate complex relationships between TCR sequence and T cell phenotype in large, heterogeneous, single-cell datasets."

https://openalex.org/W3195391036,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants influence the risk of late-onset human diseases, but the reasons for this are poorly understood. Undertaking a hypothesis-free analysis of 5,689 blood-derived biomarkers with mtDNA variants in 16,220 healthy donors, here we show that variants defining mtDNA haplogroups Uk and H4 modulate the level of circulating N-formylmethionine (fMet), which initiates mitochondrial protein translation. In human cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) lines, fMet modulated both mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins on multiple levels, through transcription, post-translational modification and proteolysis by an N-degron pathway, abolishing known differences between mtDNA haplogroups. In a further 11,966 individuals, fMet levels contributed to all-cause mortality and the disease risk of several common cardiovascular disorders. Together, these findings indicate that fMet plays a key role in common age-related disease through pleiotropic effects on cell proteostasis. The association between certain mitochondrial DNA variants and increased risk of late-onset diseases in humans could be explained by a direct role of mitochondrial DNA in the regulation of cellular proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3194558273,"Tree pruning is carried out to reduce conflict with infrastructure, buildings, and any other human activity. However, heavy pruning may result in a diminished tree crown capacity for sugar production and exposure to fungal infection. This risk leads to a decrease in tree stability or vigour. In this work, we analysed the effect of heavy pruning of roadside trees on the photosynthetic performance process compared to neighbouring unpruned trees. Four years of tree crown growth was studied by terrestrial imaging. Tree vitality (Roloff's classification) and risk (Visual Tree Assessment) were evaluated. Over-pruned trees showed intensified photosynthetic efficiency during the growing season following pruning. Particularly ET0/TR0 and PIABS tended to increase in pruned trees while higher Fv/Fm was noted only in late October, suggesting delayed leaf senescence. After four years, pruned trees rebuilt their crowns, however not in their entirety. Results obtained from biometric, vitality, and risk assessment showed high differentiation in pruned tree crown recovery. Our results revealed that despite the intensified efforts of trees to recover from wounding effects, severe pruning evokes dieback occurrence and a higher risk of failure in mature trees."
https://openalex.org/W3195853013,"Objectives This study objectives were to investigate maternal psychological distress, mothers’ fear of their children contracting COVID-19, mothers’ perceptions of the information available regarding children and COVID-19, changes in children’s behavior during lockdown, and concerns of pregnant women in Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study surveyed women aged 18 years and older who either had children under 10 years of age or were pregnant at the time of the survey. The outcomes included psychological distress, mothers’ fear of their children contracting COVID-19, change in children’s behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown and pregnant women’s concerns. Multivariable ordinary least squares regression models were employed to examine the adjusted associations between sociodemographic factors and psychological distress, as well as fear of COVID-19. Results Of 628 women, 11.8% ( n = 74) were pregnant at the time of survey. Most of the pregnant women (89.2%, n = 66) had some degree of concerns about their unborn babies getting infected during delivery in the hospital. Among mothers of children under 10 years of age ( n = 564), half ( n = 282) reported change in their children’s behavior during the lockdown. Most mothers and pregnant women (94.9%, n = 569) had some degree of psychological distress. Mothers and pregnant women with a college degree had significantly lower psychological distress (β = -1.346; p = 0.014) than women with a high school education or less. Similarly, mothers and pregnant women with monthly family income ≥ US$ 1,333 had lower psychological distress than those with &lt; US$ 1,333. Women with pre-existing chronic physical (β = 2.424; p &lt; 0.001) or mental (β = 4.733; p &lt; 0.001) conditions had higher psychological distress than those without these conditions. Having children in the house was a contributory factor for higher psychological distress. For example, mothers with one child (β = 2.602; p = 0.007) had significantly higher psychological distress compared to expectant mothers without children in the house. Conclusions Most mothers and expectant mothers in our study had moderate to high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Education, family income and chronic mental and physical conditions were associated with high psychological distress in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3194617525,"Refractory responses to standard-of-care oral metronidazole among recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) patients is not rare, and recurrence within a year is common. A better understanding of the bacterial determinants of these outcomes is essential. In this study we ask whether changes in specific species of Gardnerella are associated with poor short or long term clinical outcomes, and if and how resurgence of Lactobacillus species affects these outcomes. We quantify Lactobacillus isolates as a proportion of total vaginal bacteria using the LbRC5 qPCR assay, and 5 prevalent species of Gardnerella using primers that target species-specific polymorphisms within the cpn60 gene. The study includes 43 BV patients: 18 refractory, 16 recurrent, and 11 remission patients, sampled daily for up to two weeks post-treatment; clinical outcomes were tracked for up to 9 months. Persistently high titers of Gardnerella Gsp07 were associated with refractory responses, and persistently low abundance of Gardnerella Gsp07 and G. swidsinskii / G. leopoldii were associated with remission. Lactobacillus species abundance rose in 4-14 days after initiation of treatment in most but not all recurrent and remission patients, although increases were more sustained among remission patients. The findings suggest that Gardnerella Gsp07 and G. swidsinskii / G. leopoldii are markers of poor clinical outcome or may directly or indirectly suppress recovery of Lactobacillus species, thereby interfering with clinical recovery. Therapies that target these strains may improve patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3195308400,"The stability of a protein is regulated by a balance between its ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation. S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) is an oncogenic F-box protein that recognizes tumor suppressor substrates for targeted ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase SKP1-Cullin1-F-box and degradation by proteasome. SKP2 is itself ubiquitylated by the E3 ligases APC/CCDH1 and SCFFBXW2, and deubiquitylated by deubiquitylases (DUBs) USP10 and USP13. Given the biological significance of SKP2, it is likely that the other E3s or DUBs may also regulate its stability. Here, we report the identification and characterization of USP2 as a new DUB. We first screened a panel of DUBs and found that both USP2 and USP21 bound to endogenous SKP2, but only USP2 deubiquitylated and stabilized SKP2 protein. USP2 inactivation via siRNA knockdown or small-molecule inhibitor treatment remarkably shortened SKP2 protein half-life by enhancing its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Unexpectedly, USP2-stabilized SKP2 did not destabilize its substrates p21 and p27. Mechanistically, USP2 bound to SKP2 via the leucine-rich repeat substrate-binding domain on SKP2 to disrupt the SKP2-substrate binding, leading to stabilization of both SKP2 and these substrates. Biologically, growth suppression induced by USP2 knockdown or USP2 inhibitor is partially mediated via modulation of SKP2 and its substrates. Our study revealed a new mechanism of the cross-talk among the E3-DUB substrates and its potential implication in targeting the USP2-SKP2 axis for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3195795770,"Antibiotic misuse is a key contributor to antimicrobial resistance and a concern in long-term aged care facilities (LTCFs). Our objectives were to: i) summarise key indicators of systemic antibiotic use and appropriateness of use, and ii) examine temporal and regional variations in antibiotic use, in LTCFs (PROSPERO registration CRD42018107125).Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies published between 1990-2021 reporting antibiotic use rates in LTCFs. Random effects meta-analysis provided pooled estimates of antibiotic use rates (percentage of residents on an antibiotic on a single day [point prevalence] and over 12 months [period prevalence]; percentage of appropriate prescriptions). Meta-regression examined associations between antibiotic use, year of measurement and region. A total of 90 articles representing 78 studies from 39 countries with data between 1985-2019 were included. Pooled estimates of point prevalence and 12-month period prevalence were 5.2% (95% CI: 3.3-7.9; n = 523,171) and 62.0% (95% CI: 54.0-69.3; n = 946,127), respectively. Point prevalence varied significantly between regions (Q = 224.1, df = 7, p<0.001), and ranged from 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9-2.7) in Eastern Europe to 9.0% in the British Isles (95% CI: 7.6-10.5) and Northern Europe (95% CI: 7.7-10.5). Twelve-month period prevalence varied significantly between regions (Q = 15.1, df = 3, p = 0.002) and ranged from 53.9% (95% CI: 48.3-59.4) in the British Isles to 68.3% (95% CI: 63.6-72.7) in Australia. Meta-regression found no association between year of measurement and antibiotic use prevalence. The pooled estimate of the percentage of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions was 28.5% (95% CI: 10.3-58.0; n = 17,245) as assessed by the McGeer criteria. Year of measurement was associated with decreasing appropriateness of antibiotic use over time (OR:0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.91). The most frequently used antibiotic classes were penicillins (n = 44 studies), cephalosporins (n = 36), sulphonamides/trimethoprim (n = 31), and quinolones (n = 28).Coordinated efforts focusing on LTCFs are required to address antibiotic misuse in LTCFs. Our analysis provides overall baseline and regional estimates for future monitoring of antibiotic use in LTCFs."

The four-item medication adherence scale (4-IMAS) and the beliefs about medications questionnaire (BMQ) which includes necessity and concerns were used. Stepwise backward quartile regression models were conducted to evaluate variables associated with the Necessity and Concerns scores. Stepwise ordinal regression was conducted to evaluate variables associated with adherence.287 diabetic patients participated in the study. Almost half of the participants (46.5%) reported moderate adherence and 12.2% reported low adherence. Significant predictors of the adherence were necessity score (OR = 14.86, p <0.01), concern score (OR = 0.36, p <0.05), and frequency of medication administration (OR = 0.88, p- <0.01). Education was a significant predictor of Necessity and Concerns scores (β = 0.48, -0.2, respectively).Simplifying the medication regimen, emphasizing medication necessity and overcoming medication concerns should be targeted in future diabetes intervention programs to improve medication adherence and hence glycemic control among diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3194515655,"Malnutrition contributes to children's morbidity and mortality, and the situation undermines the economic growth and development of Bangladesh. Malnutrition is associated with lower levels of education that decrease economic productivity and leads to poverty. The global burden of malnutrition continues to be unacceptably high amid social and economic growth, including in Bangladesh. Therefore, identifying the factors associated with childhood malnutrition and poverty is necessary to stop the vicious cycle of malnutrition leaded poverty.The study utilized the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), accumulating 7,738 mother-child pairs. Associations between potential risk factors and nutritional status were determined using chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized on significant risk factors to measure their odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).The prevalence of moderate and severe wasting was 7.0% and 1.8%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of moderate and severe stunting was 19.2% and 8.0%, while 16.4% and 3.6% of children were moderately and severely underweight. Children from the poorest and poor households were suffering from at least one form of malnutrition. Adjusted ORs were estimated by controlling socio-economic and demographic risk factors, such as poor maternal body mass index, parents' lower education level, use of unhygienic toilet, child age in months, and recent experience of diarrhea and fever. The pattern was almost similar for each malnutrition status (i.e., stunting, underweight, and wasting) in the poorest and poor households.Bangladesh achieved the Millennium Development Goals, focusing primarily on health-related indicators and working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Even considering this success, the prevalence of malnutrition and poverty in same household remains relatively high compared to other developing countries. Therefore, the study recommends the implementation of nationwide systematic measures to prevent poverty and malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3194429602,"Ubiquitination is a crucial posttranslational protein modification involved in a myriad of biological pathways. This modification is reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) that deconjugate the single ubiquitin (Ub) moiety or poly-Ub chains from substrates. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been focused on targeting DUBs for drug discovery. However, most chemical compounds with inhibitory activity for DUBs suffer from mild potency and low selectivity. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a phage display-based protein engineering strategy for generating Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors, which was previously successfully applied to the Ub-specific protease (USP) family of cysteine proteases. In this work, we leveraged the UbV platform to selectively target STAMBP, a member of the JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) metalloprotease family of DUB enzymes. We identified two UbVs (UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3) that bind to STAMBP with high affinity but differ in their selectivity for the closely related paralog STAMBPL1. We determined the STAMBPL1-UbVSP.1 complex structure by X-ray crystallography, revealing hotspots of the JAMM-UbV interaction. Finally, we show that UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3 are potent inhibitors of STAMBP isopeptidase activity, far exceeding the reported small-molecule inhibitor BC-1471. This work demonstrates that UbV technology is suitable to develop molecules as tools to target metalloproteases, which can be used to further understand the cellular function of JAMM family DUBs."
https://openalex.org/W3194438328,"Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) can act synergistically, enhancing antitumor response beyond what either treatment can achieve separately. Anecdotal reports suggest that these results are in part due to the induction of an abscopal effect on non-irradiated lesions. Systematic data on incidence of the abscopal effect are scarce, while the existence and the identification of predictive signatures or this phenomenon are lacking. The purpose of this pre-clinical investigational work is to shed more light on the subject by identifying several imaging features and blood counts, which can be utilized to build a predictive binary logistic model.This proof-of-principle study was performed on Lewis Lung Carcinoma in a syngeneic, subcutaneous murine model. Nineteen mice were used: four as control and the rest were subjected to combined RT plus IT regimen. Tumors were implanted on both flanks and after reaching volume of ~200 mm3 the animals were CT and MRI imaged and blood was collected. Quantitative imaging features (radiomics) were extracted for both flanks. Subsequently, the treated animals received radiation (only to the right flank) in three 8 Gy fractions followed by PD-1 inhibitor administrations. Tumor volumes were followed and animals exhibiting identical of better tumor growth delay on the non-irradiated (left) flank as compared to the irradiated flank were identified as experiencing an abscopal effect. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to create models for CT and MRI radiomics and blood counts, which are predictive of the abscopal effect.Four of the treated animals experienced an abscopal effect. Three CT and two MRI radiomics features together with the pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio correlated with the abscopal effect. Predictive models were created by combining the radiomics with NLR. ROC analyses indicated that the CT model had AUC of 0.846, while the MRI model had AUC of 0.946.The combination of CT and MRI radiomics with blood counts resulted in models with AUCs of 1 on the modeling dataset. Application of the models to the validation dataset exhibited AUCs above 0.84, indicating very good predictive power of the combination between quantitative imaging and blood counts."

All patients with PSA were identified. A matched (age, gender, and type of the procedure) control group of 134 patients was created to reveal predictors of PSA formation.Single PSAs were found in 134 patients. Fifty-three PSAs developed after radiological procedures (53/6555 [0.8%]), 31 after coronary artery procedures (31/18038 [0.2%]), 25 after non-coronary artery cardiac procedures (25/5603 [0.4%]), and 25 due to procedures in which the arterial puncture was unintended. Thirty-four PSAs (25.4%) were localized to the upper extremity arteries (vascular closure device [VCD], N = 0), while 100 (74.6%) arose from the lower extremity arteries (VCD, N = 37). The PSA prevalence was 0.05% (10/20478) in the radial artery, 0.1% (2/1818) in the ulnar artery, 1.2% (22/1897) in the brachial artery, and 0.4% (99/22202) in the femoral artery. Treatments for upper and lower limb PSAs were as follows: bandage replacement (32.4% and 14%, respectively), ultrasound-guided compression (11.8% and 1%, respectively), ultrasound-guided thrombin injection (38.2% and 78%, respectively), and open surgery (17.6% and 12%, respectively). Reintervention was necessary in 19 patients (14.2%). The prevalence of PSA for the punctured artery with and without VCD use was 37/3555 (1%) and 97/27204 (0.4%), respectively (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.95-4.34; P<0.001). The effect of red blood cell (RBC) count (P<0.001), hematocrit value (P<0.001), hemoglobin value (P<0.001), international normalized ratio (INR; P<0.001), RBC count-INR interaction (P = 0.003), and RBC count-VCD use interaction (P = 0.036) on PSA formation was significant.Patients in whom the puncture site is closed with a VCD require increased observation. Preprocedural laboratory findings are useful for the identification of patients at high risk of PSA formation."

In addition, instruments to measure the expectations and acceptability of a smart nursing home are also lacking. The study aims to explore and determine the levels of these expectations, acceptability and the associated sociodemographic factors. This exploratory sequential mixed methods study comprises a qualitative study which will be conducted through a semi-structured interview to explore the expectations and acceptability of a smart nursing home among Chinese elderly people and their family members (Phase I). Next, a questionnaire will be developed and validated based on the results of a qualitative study in Phase I and a preceding scoping review on smart nursing homes by the same authors (Phase II). Lastly, a nationwide survey will be carried out to examine the levels of expectations and acceptability, and the associated sociodemographic factors with the different categories of expectations and acceptability (Phase III). With a better understanding of the Chinese elderly people's expectations and acceptability of smart technologies in nursing homes, a feasible smart nursing home model that incorporates appropriate technologies, integrates needed medical services and business concepts could be formulated and tested as a solution for the rapidly ageing societies in many developed and developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3195356423,"Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene are risk factors for chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. The gene product apoE is synthesized in many cell types and has both lipid transport-dependent and lipid transport-independent functions. Previous studies have shown that apoE expression in myeloid cells protects against atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic ApoE-/- mice. However, the mechanism of this protection is still unclear. Using human APOE gene replacement mice as models, this study showed that apoE2 and apoE4 expressed endogenously in myeloid cells enhanced the inflammatory response via mechanisms independent of plasma lipoprotein transport. The data revealed that apoE2-expressing myeloid cells contained higher intracellular cholesterol levels because of impaired efflux, causing increasing inflammasome activation and myelopoiesis. In contrast, intracellular cholesterol levels were not elevated in apoE4-expressing myeloid cells, and its proinflammatory property was found to be independent of inflammasome signaling and related to enhanced oxidative stress. When ApoE-/- mice were reconstituted with bone marrow from various human APOE gene replacement mice, effective reduction of atherosclerosis was observed with marrow cells obtained from APOE3 but not APOE2 and APOE4 gene replacement mice. Taken together, these results documented that apoE2 and apoE4 expression in myeloid cells promotes inflammation via distinct mechanisms and promotes atherosclerosis in a plasma lipoprotein transport-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3195966739,"Objective The molecular mechanisms of the degeneration of the aortic wall in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are poorly understood. The monomeric form of C-reactive protein (mCRP) is deposited in damaged cardiovascular organs and aggravates the prognosis; however, it is unknown whether mCRP is deposited in the degenerated aorta of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We investigated whether mCRP is deposited in AAA and examined the associated pathogenic signaling pathways. Methods Twenty-four cases of AAA were analyzed and their histological features were compared according to the level of serum CRP and the degree of mCRP deposition. Proteomic analysis was performed in AAA cases with strong and diffuse CRP immunopositivity (n = 7) and those with weak, focal, and junctional CRP immunopositivity (n = 3). Results mCRP was deposited in the aortic specimens of AAA in a characteristic pattern that coincided with the lesion of the diminished elastic layer of the aortic wall. High serum CRP level was associated with stronger mCRP immunopositivity and a larger maximal diameter of aortic aneurysm. Proteomic analysis in AAA showed that multiple proteins were differentially expressed according to mCRP immunopositivity. Also, ingenuity pathway analysis showed that pathways associated with atherosclerosis, acute phase response, complement system, immune system, and coagulation were enriched in AAA cases with high mCRP immunopositivity. Conclusions AAA showed a characteristic deposition of mCRP, and multiple potentially pathologic signaling pathways were upregulated in AAA cases with strong CRP immunopositivity. mCRP and the aforementioned pathological pathways may serve as targets for managing the progression of AAA."
https://openalex.org/W3195495929,"Networks science techniques are frequently used to provide meaningful insights into the populations underlying medical and social data. This paper examines SATHCAP, a dataset related to HIV and drug use in three US cities. In particular, we use network measures such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality to find central, important nodes in a network derived from SATHCAP data. We evaluate the attributes of these important nodes and create an exceptionality score based on the number of nodes that share a particular attribute. This score, along with the underlying network itself, is used to reveal insight into the attributes of groups that can be effectively targeted to slow the spread of disease. Our research confirms a known connection between homelessness and HIV, as well as drug abuse and HIV, and shows support for the theory that individuals without easy access to transportation are more likely to be central to the spread of HIV in urban, high risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W3195564191,"Natural history museum collections worldwide represent a tremendous resource of information on past and present biodiversity. Fish, reptiles, amphibians and many invertebrate collections have often been preserved in ethanol for decades or centuries and our knowledge on the genomic and metagenomic research potential of such material is limited. Here, we use ancient DNA protocols, combined with shotgun sequencing to test the molecular preservation in liver, skin and bone tissue from five old (1842 to 1964) museum specimens of the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis). When mapping reads to a T. sirtalis reference genome, we find that the DNA molecules are highly damaged with short average sequence lengths (38-64 bp) and high C-T deamination, ranging from 9% to 21% at the first position. Despite this, the samples displayed relatively high endogenous DNA content, ranging from 26% to 56%, revealing that genome-scale analyses are indeed possible from all specimens and tissues included here. Of the three tested types of tissue, bone shows marginally but significantly higher DNA quality in these metrics. Though at least one of the snakes had been exposed to formalin, neither the concentration nor the quality of the obtained DNA was affected. Lastly, we demonstrate that these specimens display a diverse and tissue-specific microbial genetic profile, thus offering authentic metagenomic data despite being submerged in ethanol for many years. Our results emphasize that historical museum collections continue to offer an invaluable source of information in the era of genomics."

With the onset of COVID-19 and related lockdown measures, there is evidence of a surge in crowdfunding use relating to the pandemic. This study gathered, classified, and analysed Canadian crowdfunding campaigns created in response to COVID-19 from GoFundMe.com, a popular crowdfunding platform. Spatio-temporal analysis of classified campaigns allowed for observation of emergent trends in the distribution of pandemic-related need incidence and financial support throughout the pandemic. Campaigns raising money on behalf of established charities were the most common in the sample, and accounted for the greatest portion of funding raised, while campaigns for businesses made up a small proportion. Dense metropolitan areas accounted for the vast majority of campaign locations, and total sample funding was disproportionately raised by campaigners in Ontario and British Columbia."
https://openalex.org/W3195074099,"The degradation of cholesterol and related steroids by microbes follows fundamentally different strategies in aerobic and anaerobic environments. In anaerobic bacteria, the primary C26 of the isoprenoid side chain is hydroxylated without oxygen via a three-step cascade: (i) water-dependent hydroxylation at the tertiary C25, (ii) ATP-dependent dehydration to form a subterminal alkene, and (iii) water-dependent hydroxylation at the primary C26 to form an allylic alcohol. However, the enzymes involved in the ATP-dependent dehydration have remained unknown. Here, we isolated an ATP-dependent 25-hydroxy-steroid kinase (25-HSK) from the anaerobic bacterium Sterolibacterium denitrificans. This highly active enzyme preferentially phosphorylated the tertiary C25 of steroid alcohols, including metabolites of cholesterol and sitosterol degradation or 25-OH-vitamin D3. Kinetic data were in agreement with a sequential mechanism via a ternary complex. Remarkably, 25-HSK readily catalyzed the formation of γ-(18O)2-ATP from ADP and the C25-(18O)2-phosphoester. The observed full reversibility of 25-HSK with an equilibrium constant below one can be rationalized by an unusual high phosphoryl transfer potential of tertiary steroid C25-phosphoesters, which is ≈20 kJ mol-1 higher than that of standard sugar phosphoesters and even slightly greater than the β,γ-phosphoanhydride of ATP. In summary, 25-HSK plays an essential role in anaerobic bacterial degradation of zoo- and phytosterols and shows only little similarity to known phosphotransferases."
https://openalex.org/W3195105047,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an increasingly frequent cause of blindness across populations; however, the events that initiate pathophysiology of DR remain elusive. Strong preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that abnormalities in retinal lipid metabolism caused by diabetes may account for the origin of this disease. A major arm of lipid metabolism, de novo biosynthesis, is driven by elevation in available glucose, a common thread binding all forms of vision loss in diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesized that aberrant retinal lipid biogenesis is an important promoter of early DR. In murine models, we observed elevations of diabetes-associated retinal de novo lipogenesis ∼70% over control levels. This shift was primarily because of activation of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenic pathway. Activation of FAS was driven by canonical glucose-mediated disinhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a major upstream regulatory enzyme. Mutant mice expressing gain-of-function FAS demonstrated increased vulnerability to DR, whereas those with FAS deletion in rod photoreceptors maintained preserved visual responses upon induction of diabetes. Excess retinal de novo lipogenesis-either because of diabetes or because of FAS gain of function-was associated with modestly increased levels of palmitate-containing phosphatidylcholine species in synaptic membranes, a finding with as yet uncertain significance. These findings implicate glucose-dependent increases in photoreceptor de novo lipogenesis in the early pathogenesis of DR, although the mechanism of deleterious action of this pathway remains unclear."

Second, a 2-year follow-up was also performed, in which patients were divided into three groups: those complicated by DRA from the beginning, those with newly developed DRA within the 2-year period, and those not complicated by DRA throughout the survey period; changes in the EQ-5D-3L utility score were compared. In the group already complicated by DRA at the survey baseline, changes in the EQ-5D-3L utility score were compared according to the dialysis treatment method.A total of 1,314 and 931 patients were included in the first and second studies, respectively. EQ-5D-3L utility scores among patients diagnosed with DRA were significantly lower than scores in those not diagnosed with DRA. The reduction in the EQ-5D-3L utility score over the 2-year follow-up was significantly greater in patients newly complicated by DRA during the follow-up period after enrollment but not in those complicated by DRA from the beginning, as compared with patients not complicated by DRA throughout the survey period. The reduction in utility score tended to be lower in patients routinely treated with a β2-microglobulin adsorption column than in untreated patients with DRA.Complication by DRA in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis was significantly associated with a decline in QOL."
https://openalex.org/W3195994785,"Loss-of-function mutation of the MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O ( Mlo ) gene confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew fungi in various plants, including barley. In combination with the intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat receptor ( NLR ) genes, which confer the race-specific resistance, the mlo alleles have long been used in barley breeding as genetic resources that confer robust non-race-specific resistance. However, a Japanese Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei isolate, RACE1, has been reported to have the potential to overcome partially the mlo -mediated penetration resistance, although this is yet uncertain because the putative effects of NLR genes in the tested accessions have not been ruled out. In this study, we examined the reproducibility of the earlier report and found that the infectious ability of RACE1, which partially overcomes the mlo -mediated resistance, is only exerted in the absence of NLR genes recognizing RACE1. Furthermore, using the transient-induced gene silencing technique, we demonstrated that RACE1 can partially overcome the resistance in the host cells with suppressed MLO expression but not in plants possessing the null mutant allele mlo -5."
https://openalex.org/W3196159534,"The study presents the first national assessment of a nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) population, conducted using a combination of transect surveys and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). Density of nurse sharks in Belize was found to be higher in reefs than in lagoons, and in the atolls furthest away from the mainland and human settlements. Only large and old protected areas were found to have a positive impact on nurse shark abundance. Absolute abundance of nurse sharks was estimated using distance sampling analysis, giving a total nurse shark population in the range of 3,858 to 14,375 sharks. Thanks to a vast area of suitable habitat for nurse sharks in the country and legislation already in place for the safeguard of the species, Belize could represent an important hotspot for nurse sharks in the Western Atlantic. The data presented here hence offers a baseline for the long-term monitoring of the Belizean nurse shark population and improves our understanding of nurse shark abundance and distribution in the wider Caribbean basin."
https://openalex.org/W3194271361,"Background Despite considerable efforts to promote condom use, sexually active people in sub-Sahara Africa still engage in risky sexual behaviours, with condom use relatively low. With this high vulnerability of these persons to HIV and sexually transmitted infections, research related to exposure to family planning messages to help curb this trend remains sparse. This study examined how exposure to family planning messages in the midst of some socio-demographic factors is associated with consistent condom use among sexually active never married men in Ghana. Methods Data were obtained from the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Ghana. Only never married men (15–64 years) who have had sexual experience in the last 12 months were included in the analysis (N = 971). Frequencies, percentages, chi-square tests and binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. Results of the binary logistic regression analysis were presented using crude odds ratios (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Results The results showed that only 26.15% of sexually active never married men in Ghana consistently used condom during sex. Men who were exposed to family planning messages were 51% more likely use condom consistently compared to those who are not exposed [aOR = 1.51, CI = 1.04–2.18]. In terms of the covariates, the likelihood of consistent condom use among men in Ghana was lower among those aged 35 years and above compared to those aged 15–24 [aOR = 0.46 CI = 0.21–0.99]. The odds of consistent condom use among men increased with level of education, with men with higher level of education having the highest odds of consistent condom use compared to those with no formal education [aOR = 9.98, CI = 2.05–48.46]. Men of the richest wealth quintile were more likely to use condom consistently compared to those of the poorest wealth quintile [aOR = 2.62, CI = 1.30–5.27]. Higher odds of consistent condom use was found among men who dwelled in the Central, Northern, and Upper East regions compared to those of the Western region. Conclusion Our findings have established a strong association between exposure to family planning messages alongside age, educational level, wealth, and region of residence and consistent condom use. Men exposed to family planning messages were more likely to use condoms consistently. Designed programs should use intervention strategies that focus on interactive and participatory educational activities to improve sexually active men’s interpersonal communication on family planning messages, especially on consistent condom use with their sexual partners."

Given the increase in clinical perspective of Acetylsalicylic acid in various diseases and cancer prevention, this study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory role of physiological Acetylsalicylic acid concentrations (0.005, 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml) in a human whole blood of infection-induced inflammation. We describe a simple, highly reliable whole blood assay using an array of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands 1–9 in order to systematically explore the immunomodulatory activity of Acetylsalicylic acid plasma concentrations in physiologically relevant conditions. Release of inflammatory cytokines and production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) were determined directly in plasma supernatant. Experiments demonstrate for the first time that plasma concentrations of Acetylsalicylic acid significantly increased TLR ligand-triggered IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, indomethacin did not exhibit this capacity, whereas cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAID, celecoxib, induced a similar pattern like Acetylsalicylic acid, suggesting a possible relevance of COX-2. Accordingly, we found that exogenous addition of COX downstream product, PGE 2 , attenuates the TLR ligand-mediated cytokine secretion by augmenting production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Low PGE 2 levels were at least involved in the enhanced IL-1β production by Acetylsalicylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W3195095602,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has detected changes in pancreas volume and other characteristics in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, differences in MRI technology and approaches across locations currently limit the incorporation of pancreas imaging into multisite trials. The purpose of this study was to develop a standardized MRI protocol for pancreas imaging and to define the reproducibility of these measurements. Calibrated phantoms with known MRI properties were imaged at five sites with differing MRI hardware and software to develop a harmonized MRI imaging protocol. Subsequently, five healthy volunteers underwent MRI at four sites using the harmonized protocol to assess pancreas size, shape, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), longitudinal relaxation time (T1), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and pancreas and hepatic fat fraction. Following harmonization, pancreas size, surface area to volume ratio, diffusion, and longitudinal relaxation time were reproducible, with coefficients of variation less than 10%. In contrast, non-standardized image processing led to greater variation in MRI measurements. By using a standardized MRI image acquisition and processing protocol, quantitative MRI of the pancreas performed at multiple locations can be incorporated into clinical trials comparing pancreas imaging measures and metabolic state in individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3195326853,"Background Activation of intravesical protease activated receptor 4 (PAR4) leads to release of urothelial macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF then binds to urothelial MIF receptors to release urothelial high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and elicit bladder hyperalgesia. Since MIF binds to multiple receptors, we investigated the contribution of individual urothelial MIF receptors to PAR4-induced HMGB1 release in vivo and in vitro and bladder pain in vivo . Methodology/Principal findings We tested the effect of intravesical pre-treatment with individual MIF or MIF receptor (CD74, CXCR4, CXCR2) antagonists on PAR4-induced HMGB1 release in vivo (female C57/BL6 mice) and in vitro (primary human urothelial cells) and on PAR4-induced bladder hyperalgesia in vivo (mice). In mice, PAR4 induced HMGB1 release and bladder hyperalgesia through activation of intravesical MIF receptors, CD74 and CXCR4. CXCR2 was not involved in these effects. In primary urothelial cells, PAR4-induced HMGB1 release through activation of CD74 receptors. Micturition parameters in mice were not changed by any of the treatments. Conclusions/Significance Urothelial MIF receptors CD74 and CXCR4 mediate bladder pain through release of urothelial HMGB1. This mechanism may set up persistent pain loops in the bladder and warrants further investigation. Urothelial CD74 and CXCR4 may provide novel targets for interrupting bladder pain."
https://openalex.org/W3195445400,"Grassland birds are declining faster than any other avian guild in North America and are increasingly a focus of conservation concern. Adaptive, outcome-based management of rangelands could do much to mitigate declines. However, this approach relies on quantitative, generalizable habitat targets that have been difficult to extrapolate from the literature. Past work relies heavily on individual versus population response, and direct response to management (e.g. grazing) versus response to outcomes. We compared individual and population-level responses to vegetation conditions across scales to identify quantitative targets of habitat quality for an imperiled grassland songbird, the chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus) in northern Montana, USA during 2017-2018. We estimated nest density and nest survival within 9-ha survey plots using open N-mixture and nest survival models, respectively, and evaluated relationships with plot- and nest-site vegetation conditions. Plot-scale conditions influenced nest density, whereas nest survival was unaffected by any measured condition. Nest-site and plot-scale vegetation measurements were only weakly correlated, suggesting that management targets based on nest sites only would be incomplete. While nest survival is often assumed to be the key driver of bird productivity, our results suggest that nest density and plot-scale conditions are more important for productivity of longspurs at the core of the breeding distribution. Habitat outcomes for grassland birds should incorporate nest density and average conditions at scale(s) relevant to management (e.g. paddock or pasture)."
https://openalex.org/W3196235439,"To investigate the mobility patterns of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe during the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition period, we applied strontium isotope analysis to Neanderthal (n = 3) and modern human (n = 2) teeth recovered from the site of Fumane Cave in the Monti Lessini region of Northern Italy. We also measured a large number of environmental samples from the region, to establish a strontium ‘baseline’, and also micromammals (vole teeth) from the levels associated with the hominin teeth. We found that the modern humans and Neanderthals had similar strontium isotope values, and these values match the local baseline values we obtained for the site and the surrounding region. We conclude that both groups were utilizing the local mountainous region where Fumane Cave is situated, and likely the nearby Lessini highlands and Adige plains, and therefore the strontium evidence does not show differening mobility patterns between Neanderthals and modern humans at the Fumane site."
https://openalex.org/W3195070871,"Hypoxia increases fetal hepatic insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) phosphorylation mediated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. Whether maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) causes fetal hypoxia remains unclear. We used fetal liver from a baboon (Papio sp.) model of intrauterine growth restriction due to MNR (70% global diet of Control) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells as a model for human fetal hepatocytes and tested the hypothesis that mTOR-mediated IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in response to hypoxia requires hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and regulated in development and DNA-damage responses-1 (REDD-1) signaling. Western blotting (n = 6) and immunohistochemistry (n = 3) using fetal liver indicated greater expression of HIF-1α, REDD-1 as well as erythropoietin and its receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor at GD120 (GD185 term) in MNR versus Control. Moreover, treatment of HepG2 cells with hypoxia (1% pO2) (n = 3) induced REDD-1, inhibited mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation (Ser101/Ser119/Ser169). HIF-1α inhibition by echinomycin or small interfering RNA silencing prevented the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 and induction of IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) induced HIF-1α and also REDD-1 expression, inhibited mTORC1 and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. Induction of HIF-1α (DMOG) and REDD-1 by Compound 3 inhibited mTORC1, increased IGFBP-1 secretion/ phosphorylation and protein kinase PKCα expression. Together, our data demonstrate that HIF-1α induction, increased REDD-1 expression and mTORC1 inhibition represent the mechanistic link between hypoxia and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. We propose that maternal undernutrition limits fetal oxygen delivery, as demonstrated by increased fetal liver expression of hypoxia-responsive proteins in baboon MNR. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology of restricted fetal growth."

However, there is no specific and effective solution to this problem. The purposes of this study were (1) to develop and pilot testing of an advance care planning simulation-based communication training program and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the program. This study was conducted in three phases. Phase 1: Developing an advance care planning simulation-based communication training program; Phase 2: Conducting a pilot test; Phase 3: Evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of the program. Twelve convenient participants from a medical center in central Taiwan were selected. The participants believed that team-based learning was beneficial for several reasons. First, it helped to clarify the participants’ understanding of advance care planning and improve their communication skills. Second, role-playing, as one of the components, was helpful for discovering their own shortcomings in communication skills while debriefing enabled them to identify their blind spots in the communication process. Finally, the reflection log documented their weekly performance so they were able to reflect upon their weekly performance, improve their performance, and become more confident. All twelve participants signed the consent form and completed the whole training program. The participants were satisfied with the program, affirming that the timing and content of the program were appropriate and that the expected learning outcomes could be achieved. According to participant feedback, the program was beneficial in improving their knowledge of advance care planning and confidence in communication. Thus, it is feasible and acceptable to introduce communication of advance care planning programs into the staff training protocols of healthcare organizations.

https://openalex.org/W3194155747,"Anthropogenic disturbance impacts the phylogenetic composition and diversity of ecological communities. While changes in diversity are known to dramatically change species interactions and alter disease dynamics, the effects of phylogenetic changes in host and vector communities on disease have been relatively poorly studied. Using a theoretical model, we investigated how phylogeny and extinction influence network structural characteristics relevant to disease transmission in disturbed environments. We modelled a multi-host, multi-vector community as a bipartite ecological network, where nodes represent host and vector species and edges represent connections among them through vector feeding, and we simulated vector preferences and threat status on host and parasite phylogenies. We then simulated loss of hosts, including phylogenetically clustered losses, to investigate how extinction influences network structure. We compared effects of phylogeny and extinction to those of host specificity, which we predicted to strongly increase network modularity and reduce disease prevalence. The simulations revealed that extinction often increased modularity, with higher modularity as species loss increased, although not as much as increasing host specificity did. These results suggest that extinction itself, all else being equal, may reduce disease prevalence in disturbed communities. However, in real communities, systematic patterns in species loss (e.g. favoring high competence species) or changes in abundance may counteract these effects. Unexpectedly, we found that effects of phylogenetic signal in host and vector traits were relatively weak, and only important when phylogenetic signal of host and vector traits were similar, or when these traits both varied."
https://openalex.org/W3194223344,"A cow with mastitis has a high somatic cell count (SCC) in its milk. Cow-share-contribution of somatic cells to the bulk milk tank (BMTSCC) refers to the relative addition made by each cow’s milk to the bulk tank’s SCC. Since bulk milk is graded and priced according to the BMTSCC, high-yielding cows with mastitis are the main contributors to penalizations in milk price. The benefits of acoustic pulse technology (APT) application to tissues are well documented, including its anti-inflammatory effect and restoration of tissue function by triggering natural healing processes. An APT-based device was developed specifically for treating mastitis in dairy cows. It enables rapid and deep penetration of the acoustic pulses over a large area of the udder in a single session. A study was performed on six farms with a total of 3,900 cows. One unit of cow-share-contribution equaled the addition of 1,000 cells to each mL of the bulk milk volume above the mean BMTSCC. A total of 206 cows were selected: 103 were treated with APT and 103 served as controls. All of the cows contributed over 1.5 units to the BMTSCC at the time of treatment. Seventy-five days after APT treatment, 2 of the 103 treated cows (1.9%) were culled, compared to 19 (18.5%) of the 103 control cows, as well as infected quarter dry-off in 5 others (4.85%). Overall success was defined as a decrease of &gt;75% in cow-share-contribution from treatment time in two of the three monthly milk recordings following treatment. Results indicated 57.3% success for the APT-treated cows vs. 14.6% for the untreated control groups. Highest share-contribution provide an additional tool for the farmer’s decision of how to control BMTSCC. Because the cow-share-contribution value is relative to herd size and BMTSCC, this study included a similar number of cows, with similar SCC and milk yield from each of the six herds."
https://openalex.org/W3194340662,"With globalization, the cases of Chinese enterprises' cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are increasing rapidly. The institutional environment of the host country has become an important factor influencing M&A performance, which has a profound impact on the success or failure of cross-border M&A. Based on this, for our study, we selected cases of cross-border M&A of listed companies in China from 2007 to 2018 as research samples to empirically test the impact of the host country's governance capacity on the cross-border M&A performance of acquirers. It was found that the host country's governance capacity has a negative effect on the M&A performance in the short term, but in the long term, it can effectively improve the cross-border M&A performance of acquirers. At the same time, specific to the relationship between the governmental governance capacity of six different dimensions and long-term M&A performance, the government effectiveness, regulation quality, and rule of law have the most significant promotional effect on long-term M&A performance. This implies that acquirers should focus on the long-term impact of governmental governance capacity on M&A, and consciously lean toward countries with strong governance capacity in order to obtain long-term value growth when arranging overseas M&A activities. The conclusion of this paper provides a reliable basis on which for companies to achieve sustainable growth in complex economic activities."
https://openalex.org/W3194395215,"Hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease is a common childhood illness. The paper aims to capture the spatiotemporal characters, and investigate the influence factors of the HFM epidemic in 15 regions of Xinjiang province from 2008 to 2017, China. Descriptive statistical analysis shows that the children aged 0-5 years have a higher HFM incidence, mostly boys. The male-female ratio is 1.5:1. Through the scanning method, we obtain the first cluster high-risk areas. The cluster time is usually from May to August every year. A spatiotemporal model is proposed to analyze the impact of meteorological factors on HFM disease. Comparing with the spatial model, the model is more effective in terms of R 2 , AIC, deviation, and mean-square error. Among meteorological factors, the number of HFM cases generally increases with the intensity of rainfall. As the temperature increases, there are more HFM patients. Some regions are mostly influenced by wind speed. Further, another spatiotemporal model is introduced to investigate the relationship between HFM disease and socioeconomic factors. The results show that socioeconomic factors have significant influence on the disease. In most areas, the risk of HFM disease tends to rise with the increase of the gross domestic product, the ratios of urban population and tertiary industry. The incidence is closely related to the number of beds and population density in some regions. The higher the ratio of primary school, the lower the number of HFM cases. Based on the above analysis, it is the key measure to prevent and control the spread of the HFM epidemic in high-risk areas, and influence factors should not be ignored."
https://openalex.org/W3195668579,"The constructive alignment (CA) of university teaching is designed to encourage students to adopt a deep learning approach, which supports meaningful learning. The evidence is mixed, however, with some studies showing that students may adopt a surface approach even when teaching promotes deep learning. To add to the understanding of the relationships between CA and learning approaches, we explored with quantitative measures two potential implications from prior qualitative research. First, we assessed with a novel questionnaire if students’ CA perceptions predicted adaptation towards a deep learning approach. Second, we explored relationships between deep approach adaptation and learning motivation, as well as perceived mental workload. 56 students from two second-year courses in different study programmes completed a learning approach questionnaire in the second (T 1 ), seventh (T 2 ), and the final fourteenth (T 3 ) course week. At T 2 and T 3, participants also rated the constructive alignment of the course, their learning motivation, and the mental workload. Regression analyses showed that ILO Clarity (i.e. being clear about the intended learning outcomes of the course) and receiving effective feedback were associated with a significant increase in deep approach scores from T 2 to T 3 . That deep approach adaptation was in turn positively related to learning motivation in terms of higher ratings of one’s competence, the importance of high course performance, and course usefulness. Moreover, deep approach adaptation went with higher satisfaction of having accomplished one’s learning goals, but also with stronger feelings of insecurity and stress. Our findings suggest that students’ CA perceptions are meaningful predictors of learning approach adaptation that might eventually be developed into indicators of the effectiveness of CA implementation at the course level."

We included 22,940 pregnancies among 19,669 women with at least one filled triptan prescription, a proxy for migraine, in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy. The population was classified into four groups: i) continuers; ii) discontinuers; iii) initiators, and vi) post-partum re-initiators. Participant characteristics and prescription fills for other drugs such as analgesics, antinauseants, and preventive drugs among the groups were examined, along with an array of triptan utilization parameters.In total, 20.0% of the women were classified as triptan continuers, 54.1% as discontinuers, 8.0% as initiators, and 17.6% as re-initiators. Extended use of triptans (≥15 daily drug doses/month) occurred among 6.9% of the continuers in the first trimester. The top 10% of triptan continuers and initiators accounted for 41% (95% CI: 39.2% - 42.5%) and 33% (95% CI: 30.3% - 35.8%) of the triptan volume, respectively. Triptan continuers and initiators had similar patterns of acute co-medication during pregnancy, but use of preventive drugs was more common among the continuers before, during, and after pregnancy.Among women using triptans before and during pregnancy, one in four continued triptan treatment during pregnancy, and extended triptan use was relatively low. Triptan discontinuation during and in the year after pregnancy was common. Use of other acute migraine treatments was higher among both continuers and initiators of triptans. Women using preventive migraine treatment were most commonly triptan continuers and re-initiators after pregnancy. Prescribing to and counseling of women with migraine should be tailored to the condition severity and their information needs to promote optimal migraine management in pregnancy."

The study examined changes in the start of the birch pollen season as well as determined the trend of these changes. Pollen monitoring was performed in Lublin (eastern Poland) in the period 2001-2019 using the volumetric method. The Makra-test was used to detect periods with significantly higher or lower average of the onset than the average for the whole dataset. Two significant falls in the average of the pollen season start were found in 2007 and 2014. Besides, taking into account the 2-3-year rhythm of high and low concentrations of birch pollen in the atmospheric air, linear trends were fitted for the subsets of high and low abundance seasons. Significant changes in Betula pollen season start dates were only determined for the highly abundance seasons, while the results for seasons with a low concentration did not allow rejecting the hypothesis about the lack of a linear trend in the changes in the studied parameter. Moreover, a significant polynomial relationship was found between the beginning of a pollen season and the average values of monthly temperatures preceded a season. These analyses show that the start dates of the Betula pollen season are getting significantly earlier. The dynamics of changes differ between seasons with high and low concentrations of pollen."

SLEs were performed at baseline and on day 5 pre- and 3 hours post-treatment.There was no significant difference between IOP in treated vs control eyes in the protocol. There were no adverse effects or toxicity as seen by SLE.The inability of the extract to lower IOP in monkeys, in contrast to ocular hypertensive cats in an earlier study, could be due to species differences or duration of treatment. Since no adverse effects were observed in the monkeys, further studies with varying durations and dosages are recommended."
