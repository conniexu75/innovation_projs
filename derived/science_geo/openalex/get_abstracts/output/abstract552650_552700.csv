https://openalex.org/W2261428502,"Until recently, complex multi-parameters were required for the isolation and identification of haematopoietic stem cells, complicating study of their biology in situ; here the authors have found that expression of a single gene, Hoxb5, defines haematopoietic stem cells with long-term reconstitution capacity, and that these cells are mainly found in direct contact with endothelial cells. Until recently, the isolation and recognition of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been a complex process involving the manipulation of multiple parameters, and this complicates the study of HSC biology in situ. In particular, it has been difficult to establish their relationship to the HSC niche, and how their self-renewal and differentiation properties are modulated by their environment. Here Irving Weissman and colleagues demonstrate that expression of a single gene, Hoxb5, defines cells with long-term reconstitution capacity, and show that these cells are mainly found directly in contact with endothelial cells. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are arguably the most extensively characterized tissue stem cells. Since the identification of HSCs by prospective isolation1, complex multi-parameter flow cytometric isolation of phenotypic subsets has facilitated studies on many aspects of HSC biology, including self-renewal2,3,4, differentiation, ageing, niche5, and diversity6,7,8. Here we demonstrate by unbiased multi-step screening, identification of a single gene, homeobox B5 (Hoxb5, also known as Hox-2.1), with expression in the bone marrow that is limited to long-term (LT)-HSCs in mice. Using a mouse single-colour tri-mCherry reporter driven by endogenous Hoxb5 regulation, we show that only the Hoxb5+ HSCs exhibit long-term reconstitution capacity after transplantation in primary transplant recipients and, notably, in secondary recipients. Only 7–35% of various previously defined immunophenotypic HSCs are LT-HSCs. Finally, by in situ imaging of mouse bone marrow, we show that >94% of LT-HSCs (Hoxb5+) are directly attached to VE-cadherin+ cells, implicating the perivascular space as a near-homogenous location of LT-HSCs."

In view of progress in stroke management, we aimed to assess the current burden of dysphagia in acute ischemic stroke.We studied 570 consecutive patients treated in a tertiary stroke center. Dysphagia was evaluated by using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS). We investigated the relationship of dysphagia with pneumonia, length of hospital stay and discharge destination and compared rates of favourable clinical outcome and mortality at 3 months between dysphagic patients and those without dysphagia.Dysphagia was diagnosed in 118 of 570 (20.7%) patients and persisted in 60 (50.9%) at hospital discharge. Thirty-six (30.5%) patients needed nasogastric tube because of severe dysphagia. Stroke severity rather than infarct location was associated with dysphagia. Dysphagic patients suffered more frequently from pneumonia (23.1% vs. 1.1%, p<0.001), stayed longer at monitored stroke unit beds (4.4±2.8 vs. 2.7±2.4 days; p<0.001) and were less often discharged to home (19.5% vs. 63.7%, p = 0.001) as compared to those without dysphagia. At 3 months, dysphagic patients less often had a favourable outcome (35.7% vs. 69.7%; p<0.001), less often lived at home (38.8% vs. 76.5%; p<0.001), and more often had died (13.6% vs. 1.6%; p<0.001). Multivariate analyses identified dysphagia to be an independent predictor of discharge destination and institutionalization at 3 months, while severe dysphagia requiring tube placement was strongly associated with mortality.Dysphagia still affects a substantial portion of stroke patients and may have a large impact on clinical outcome, mortality and institutionalization."

https://openalex.org/W2256548132,"The proteasome is a multi-component protease complex responsible for regulating key processes such as the cell cycle and antigen presentation. Compounds that target the proteasome are potentially valuable tools for the treatment of pathogens that depend on proteasome function for survival and replication. In particular, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to be toxic for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum at all stages of its life cycle. Most compounds that have been tested against the parasite also inhibit the mammalian proteasome, resulting in toxicity that precludes their use as therapeutic agents. Therefore, better definition of the substrate specificity and structural properties of the Plasmodium proteasome could enable the development of compounds with sufficient selectivity to allow their use as anti-malarial agents. To accomplish this goal, here we use a substrate profiling method to uncover differences in the specificities of the human and P. falciparum proteasome. We design inhibitors based on amino-acid preferences specific to the parasite proteasome, and find that they preferentially inhibit the β2-subunit. We determine the structure of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome bound to the inhibitor using cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle analysis, to a resolution of 3.6 Å. These data reveal the unusually open P. falciparum β2 active site and provide valuable information about active-site architecture that can be used to further refine inhibitor design. Furthermore, consistent with the recent finding that the proteasome is important for stress pathways associated with resistance of artemisinin family anti-malarials, we observe growth inhibition synergism with low doses of this β2-selective inhibitor in artemisinin-sensitive and -resistant parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that a parasite-selective inhibitor could be used to attenuate parasite growth in vivo without appreciable toxicity to the host. Thus, the Plasmodium proteasome is a chemically tractable target that could be exploited by next-generation anti-malarial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2264985423,"Crystal lattice disorder, which gives rise to a continuous diffraction pattern, is exploited to determine the structure of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II to a higher resolution than could be achieved using Bragg diffraction alone. Protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography is often limited by lack of access to high-quality crystals that generate sufficiently detailed diffraction patterns. However, X-ray patterns usually also contain continuous diffraction, which is largely ignored but could in principle provide sufficient information to overcome this limitation. Kartik Ayyer and colleagues now show that the continuous diffraction arising from lattice disorder indeed enables structure determination. They use data collected from imperfect crystals of the protein complex photosystem II to obtain an image at 3.5 Å resolution. The method puts great value in commonly encountered imperfect crystals, and is expected to enable direct high-resolution structure determination for a range of macromolecular systems. The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks1,2 suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone3. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed—and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins4—they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-ångström limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase5 the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 ångströms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 ångströms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing6,7."

https://openalex.org/W2263763112,"Respiratory viruses are a cause of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), but can be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variability of influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the duration of viral shedding in hematological patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from hematological patients were screened for influenza, parainfluenza and RSV on admission as well as on development of respiratory symptoms. Consecutive swabs were collected until viral clearance. Out of 672 tested patients, a total of 111 patients (17%) were infected with one of the investigated viral agents: 40 with influenza, 13 with parainfluenza and 64 with RSV; six patients had influenza/RSV or parainfluenza/RSV co-infections. The majority of infected patients (n = 75/111) underwent stem cell transplantation (42 autologous, 48 allogeneic, 15 autologous and allogeneic). LRTI was observed in 48 patients, of whom 15 patients developed severe LRTI, and 13 patients with respiratory tract infection died. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a variety of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza 3 and RSV A, B viruses. RSV A was detected in 54 patients, RSV B in ten patients. The newly emerging RSV A genotype ON1 predominated in the study cohort and was found in 48 (75%) of 64 RSV-infected patients. Furthermore, two distinct clusters were detected for RSV A genotype ON1, identical RSV G gene sequences in these patients are consistent with nosocomial transmission. Long-term viral shedding for more than 30 days was significantly associated with prior allogeneic transplantation (p = 0.01) and was most pronounced in patients with RSV infection (n = 16) with a median duration of viral shedding for 80 days (range 35-334 days). Long-term shedding of respiratory viruses might be a catalyzer of nosocomial transmission and must be considered for efficient infection control in immunocompromised patients."
https://openalex.org/W2269977421,"Both oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a purified catechin from green tea, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, it is unknown whether or not EGCG is effective in treating CIN. Our present study found that intravenous administration of EGCG, either before or just after the establishment of CIN, had a protective effect, determined by normalization of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, improvement in renal histopathological scoring and alleviation of apoptosis, accompanied by decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Because EGCG is a potent inducer of the antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), we studied HO-1 signaling in CIN. HO-1 levels were increased in CIN; treatment with EGCG further increased HO-1 levels, accompanied by an increase in Nrf2, a regulator of antioxidant proteins. Interestingly, blockade of HO-1 with protoporphyrin IX zinc(II) (ZnPP) prevented the protective effect of EGCG on CIN. ZnPP also blocked the ability of EGCG to increase the activity of an antioxidant (superoxide dismutase), and decrease markers of oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde) and inflammation (myeloperoxidase and IL-1β), indicating that HO-1 is the upstream molecule that regulates the EGCG-mediated protection. To determine further the role of HO-1 on the EGCG-mediated inhibition of inflammation, we studied the effect of EGCG on the NLRP3 inflammasome, an upstream signaling of IL-1β. EGCG down-regulated NLRP3 expression, which was blocked by ZnPP, indicating that HO-1 links EGCG with NLRP3. Therefore, EGCG, via up-regulation of HO-1, protects against CIN by amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammation."

Despite considerable recent progress, little is known about the regulatory mechanism that controls nuclear Hxk2 association with the SUC2 promoter chromatin and how this association is necessary for SUC2 gene repression. Our data indicate that in the SUC2 promoter context, Hxk2 functions through a variety of structurally unrelated factors, mainly the DNA-binding Mig1 and Mig2 repressors and the regulatory Snf1 and Reg1 factors. Hxk2 sustains the repressor complex architecture maintaining transcriptional repression at the SUC2 gene. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we discovered that the Hxk2 in its open configuration, at low glucose conditions, leaves the repressor complex that induces its dissociation and promotes SUC2 gene expression. In high glucose conditions, Hxk2 adopts a close conformation that promotes Hxk2 binding to the Mig1 protein and the reassembly of the SUC2 repressor complex. Additional findings highlight the possibility that Hxk2 constitutes an intracellular glucose sensor that operates by changing its conformation in response to cytoplasmic glucose levels that regulate its interaction with Mig1 and thus its recruitment to the repressor complex of the SUC2 promoter. Thus, our data indicate that Hxk2 is more intimately involved in gene regulation than previously thought.

https://openalex.org/W2254041544,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor regulating the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic response. Recent studies have suggested that AhR plays essential roles not only in xenobiotic detoxification but also energy metabolism. Thus, in this study, we studied the roles of AhR in lipid metabolism. Under high fat diet (HFD) challenge, liver-specific AhR knock-out (AhR LKO) mice exhibited severe steatosis, inflammation, and injury in the liver. Gene expression analysis and biochemical study revealed that de novo lipogenesis activity was significantly increased in AhR LKO mice. In contrast, induction of suppressor of cytokine signal 3 (Socs3) expression by HFD was attenuated in the livers of AhR LKO mice. Rescue of the Socs3 gene in the liver of AhR LKO mice cancelled the HFD-induced hepatic lipotoxicities. Promoter analysis established Socs3 as novel transcriptional target of AhR. These results indicated that AhR plays a protective role against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and the subsequent lipotoxicity effects, such as inflammation, and that the mechanism of protection involves the direct transcriptional regulation of Socs3 expression by AhR."
https://openalex.org/W2285181307,"Redox fluctuations within cells can be detrimental to cell function. To gain insight into how cells normally buffer against redox changes to maintain cell function, we have focused on elucidating the signaling pathways that serve to sense and respond to oxidative redox stress within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using yeast as a model system. Previously, we have shown that a cysteine in the molecular chaperone BiP, a Hsp70 molecular chaperone within the ER, is susceptible to oxidation by peroxide during ER-derived oxidative stress, forming a sulfenic acid (−SOH) moiety. Here, we demonstrate that this same conserved BiP cysteine is susceptible also to glutathione modification (−SSG). Glutathionylated BiP is detected both as a consequence of enhanced levels of cellular peroxide and also as a by-product of increased levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Similar to sulfenylation, we observe glutathionylation decouples BiP ATPase and peptide binding activities, turning BiP from an ATP-dependent foldase into an ATP-independent holdase. We show glutathionylation enhances cell proliferation during oxidative stress, which we suggest relates to modified BiP's increased ability to limit polypeptide aggregation. We propose the susceptibility of BiP to modification with glutathione may serve also to prevent irreversible oxidation of BiP by peroxide.

All consenting participants were screened for cough and by chest X-ray. Participants with presumptive TB submitted two sputum samples for smear microscopy, culture, and molecular testing if needed. The TB prevalence estimates were adjusted for missing data and the cluster design.Of 131,329 eligible individuals, 105,913 (81%) participated in the survey, of whom 10,471 (9.9%) were eligible for sputum examination. We found 341 bacteriologically positive TB cases of whom 233 had sputum smear-positive TB. The adjusted prevalence estimates for smear and bacteriologically positive TB were 270/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 217-323), and 398/100,000 (95% CI 333-463), respectively. Only 61% of the diagnosed TB cases screened positive on symptoms (cough >2wks), whereas the other TB cases were detected based on X-ray abnormalities. The TB prevalence increased with age and was 1.8 times higher among men than women. The prevalence-to-notification ratio of smear-positive TB was 3.1 (95% CI 2.5-3.7), was higher among men than women, and increased with age.Our data suggest that there is under-detection and/or -notification of TB, especially among men and elderly. TB control should be strengthened specifically in these risk groups. X-ray examination should be combined with symptom screening to enhance case detection."

The excellent reliability and reproducibility of the method largely depend on rigor in dog training. The present study describes the various steps of training that lead to high sensitivity scores, with dogs matching samples with 90% efficiency when the complexity of the scents presented during the task in the sample is similar to that presented in the in lineups, and specificity reaching a ceiling, with no false alarms in human scent matching-to-sample tasks. This high level of accuracy ensures reliable results in judicial human scent identification tests.

Using ChIP-exo, here we detail the interactions and genomic organization of initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, and Pol II at mRNA genes and within CpG islands. We find that when Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, TBP/TFIIB remain at the promoter. We show that TBP and TFIIB bound to the core promoter at two separate, resolvable locations that coincided with sites of divergent transcription initiation. We also examine the precise binding of TBP at Pol III transcribed tRNA genes. We find that TBP crosslinked to tRNA genes in a similar manner as at Pol II transcribed genes. This comprehensive and high resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation events humans at Pol II coding and Pol III transcribed tRNA genes."

This observation has historically been attributed to the influence of attention on memory as opposed to subjective visual experience. We recently challenged this view by showing that cueing attention after the stimulus can improve the perception of a single Gabor patch at threshold levels of contrast. Here, we test whether this retro-perception actually increases the frequency of consciously perceiving the stimulus, or simply allows for a more precise recall of its features. We used retro-cues in an orientation-matching task and performed mixture-model analysis to independently estimate the proportion of guesses and the precision of non-guess responses. We find that the improvements in performance conferred by retrospective attention are overwhelmingly determined by a reduction in the proportion of guesses, providing strong evidence that attracting attention to the target’s location after its disappearance increases the likelihood of perceiving it consciously."
https://openalex.org/W2269976823,"CUG-BP, Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1) is a highly conserved RNA binding protein that regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, and translation. In the heart, CELF1 is expressed in the myocardium, where its levels are tightly regulated during development. CELF1 levels peak in the heart during embryogenesis, and aberrant up-regulation of CELF1 in the adult heart has been implicated in cardiac pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy type 1, as well as in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Either inhibition of CELF activity or over-expression of CELF1 in heart muscle causes cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice. Nonetheless, many of the cardiac targets of CELF1 regulation remain unknown. In this study, to identify cardiac targets of CELF1 we performed cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) for CELF1 from embryonic day 8 chicken hearts. We identified a previously unannotated exon in MYH7B as a novel target of CELF1-mediated regulation. We demonstrated that knockdown of CELF1 in primary chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes leads to increased inclusion of this exon and decreased MYH7B levels. We also investigated global changes in the transcriptome of primary embryonic cardiomyocytes following CELF1 knockdown in a published RNA-seq dataset. Pathway and network analyses identified strong associations between CELF1 and regulation of cell cycle and translation. Important regulatory proteins, including both RNA binding proteins and a cardiac transcription factor, were affected by loss of CELF1. Together, these data suggest that CELF1 is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte gene expression."

Rats were divided in 5 groups: sham, UUO, MSC treated-UUO, ACEi treated-UUO, MSC+ACEi treated- UUO. Data were collected at 1, 7, 21 days. UUO induced monocyte renal infiltration, tubular cell apoptosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and overexpression of TGFβ, Renin mRNA (RENmRNA), increase of Renin, Angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone serum levels. Both lisinopril (ACEi) and MSC treatment prevented monocyte infiltration, reduced tubular cell apoptosis, renal fibrosis and TGFβ expression. Combined therapy provided a further suppression of monocyte infiltration and tubular injury. Lisinopril alone caused a rebound activation of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), while MSC suppressed RENmRNA and Renin synthesis and induced a decrease of AII and aldosterone serum levels. Furthermore, in in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, MSC inhibit Human antigen R (HuR) trascription, an enhancer of RENmRNA stability by IL10 release. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in UUO MSC prevent fibrosis, by decreasing HuR-dependent RENmRNA stability. Our findings give a clue to understand the molecular mechanism through which MSC may prevent fibrosis in a wide and heterogeneous number of diseases that share RAS activation as common upstream pathogenic mechanism."

It has been reported that the EAT volume is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, little is known about which phenotypes of COPD are associated with increased EAT. Methods One hundred and eighty smokers who were referred to the clinic were consecutively enrolled. A chest CT was used for the quantification of the emphysematous lesions, airway lesions, and EAT. These lesions were assessed as the percentage of low attenuation volume (LAV%), the square root of airway wall area of a hypothetical airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm (√Aaw at Pi10) and the EAT area, respectively. The same measurements were made on 225 Vietnamese COPD patients to replicate the results. Results Twenty-six of the referred patients did not have COPD, while 105 were diagnosed as having COPD based on a FEV1/FVC<0.70. The EAT area was significantly associated with age, BMI, FEV1 (%predicted), FEV1/FVC, self-reported hypertension, self-reported CVD, statin use, LAV%, and √Aaw at Pi10 in COPD patients. The multiple regression analyses showed that only BMI, self-reported CVD and √Aaw at Pi10 were independently associated with the EAT area (R2 = 0.51, p<0.0001). These results were replicated in the Vietnamese population. Conclusions The EAT area is independently associated with airway wall thickness. Because EAT is also an independent predictor of CVD risk, these data suggest a mechanistic link between the airway predominant form of COPD and CVD."

The human NPS (hNPS) receptor has been shown to dually couple to Gαs- and Gαq-dependent signaling pathways. The human NPS analog hNPS-(1–10), lacking 10 residues from the C terminus, has been shown to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization in a manner comparable with full-length hNPS in vitro but seems to fail to induce biological activity in vivo. Here, results derived from a number of cell-based functional assays, including intracellular cAMP-response element (CRE)-driven luciferase activity, Ca2+ mobilization, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, show that hNPS-(1–10) preferentially activates Gαq-dependent Ca2+ mobilization while exhibiting less activity in triggering Gαs-dependent CRE-driven luciferase activity. We further demonstrate that both Gαq- and Gαs-coupled signaling pathways contribute to full-length hNPS-mediated activation of ERK1/2, whereas hNPS-(1–10)-promoted ERK1/2 activation is completely inhibited by the Gαq inhibitor UBO-QIC but not by the PKA inhibitor H89. Moreover, the results of Ala-scanning mutagenesis of hNPS-(1–13) indicated that residues Lys11 and Lys12 are structurally crucial for the hNPS receptor to couple to Gαs-dependent signaling. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that hNPS-(1–10) is a biased agonist favoring Gαq-dependent signaling. It may represent a valuable chemical probe for further investigation of the therapeutic potential of human NPS receptor-directed signaling in vivo.

The first structures of ΔN123-GBD-CD2 in complex with d-glucose, isomaltosyl, or isomaltotriosyl residues were solved. The glucose complex revealed three glucose-binding sites in the catalytic gorge and six additional binding sites at the surface of domains B, IV, and V. Soaking with isomaltotriose or gluco-oligosaccharides led to structures in which isomaltosyl or isomaltotriosyl residues were found in glucan binding pockets located in domain V. One aromatic residue is systematically identified at the bottom of these pockets in stacking interaction with one glucosyl moiety. The carbohydrate is also maintained by a network of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. The sequence of these binding pockets is conserved and repeatedly present in domain V of several GH70 glucansucrases known to bind α-glucans.

https://openalex.org/W2253143618,"Occupational contact with livestock is an established risk factor for exposure to livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), particularly among industrial swine workers. While S. aureus is known to infect cattle, livestock-associated S. aureus carriage among workers in the beef production chain has received limited attention. Beefpacking workers, who slaughter, butcher and process cattle, have intensified exposure to potentially infectious animal materials and may be at risk of livestock-associated S. aureus exposure. We conducted a cross-sectional study of beefpacking workers (n = 137) at an industrial slaughterhouse in the Midwestern United States to evaluate prevalence and characteristics of S. aureus nasal colonization, specifically the absence of the scn gene to identify putative association with livestock, antibiotic susceptibility, presence of Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) genes lukS-PV and lukF-PV, and spa type. Overall prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage was 27.0%. No workers carried livestock-associated MRSA. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates (MSSA) recovered from five workers (3.6%) lacked the scn gene and were considered putative livestock-associated S. aureus (pLA-SA). Among pLA-SA isolates, spa types t338, t748, t1476 and t2379 were identified. To our knowledge, these spa types have not previously been identified as associated with livestock. Prevalence of human-adapted MRSA carriage in workers was 3.6%. MRSA isolates were identified as spa types t002, t008 and t024, and four of five MRSA isolates were PVL-positive. To date, this is the first study to indicate that industrial beefpacking workers in the United States may be exposed to livestock-associated S. aureus, notably MSSA, and to spa types not previously identified in livestock and livestock workers. Occupational exposure to livestock-associated S. aureus in the beef production chain requires further epidemiologic investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2277680545,"We replicated the study conducted by Wielgus and Peebles (2014) on the effect of wolf mortality on livestock depredations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho states in the US. Their best models were found to be misspecified due to the omission of the time index and incorrect functional form. When we respecified the models, this replication failed to confirm the magnitude, direction and often the very existence of the original results. Wielgus and Peebles (2014) reported that the increase in the number of wolves culled the previous year would increase the expected number of livestock killed this year by 4 to 6%. But our results showed that the culling of one wolf the previous year would decrease the expected number of cattle killed this year by 1.9%, and the expected number of sheep killed by 3.4%. However, for every wolf killed there is a corresponding 2.2% increase in the expected number of sheep killed in the same year. The increase in sheep depredation appears to be a short term phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2281618066,"Significant progress has been made in understanding the roles of crucial residues/motifs in the channel function of P2X receptors during the pre-structure era. The recent structural determination of P2X receptors allows us to reevaluate the role of those residues/motifs. Residues Arg-309 and Asp-85 (rat P2X4 numbering) are highly conserved throughout the P2X family and were involved in loss-of-function polymorphism in human P2X receptors. Previous studies proposed that they participated in direct ATP binding. However, the crystal structure of P2X demonstrated that those two residues form an intersubunit salt bridge located far away from the ATP-binding site. Therefore, it is necessary to reevaluate the role of this salt bridge in P2X receptors. Here, we suggest the crucial role of this structural element both in protein stability and in channel gating rather than direct ATP interaction and channel assembly. Combining mutagenesis, charge swap, and disulfide cross-linking, we revealed the stringent requirement of this salt bridge in normal P2X4 channel function. This salt bridge may contribute to stabilizing the bending conformation of the β2,3-sheet that is structurally coupled with this salt bridge and the α2-helix. Strongly kinked β2,3 is essential for domain-domain interactions between head domain, dorsal fin domain, right flipper domain, and loop β7,8 in P2X4 receptors. Disulfide cross-linking with directions opposing or along the bending angle of the β2,3-sheet toward the α2-helix led to loss-of-function and gain-of-function of P2X4 receptors, respectively. Further insertion of amino acids with bulky side chains into the linker between the β2,3-sheet or the conformational change of the α2-helix, interfering with the kinked conformation of β2,3, led to loss-of-function of P2X4 receptors.

It is known that the genetic polymorphism at the highly conserved residue (R307Q) causes loss-of-function of the human P2X7 (hP2X7) receptor and is associated with the lack of ATP-stimulated phospholipase D activity in lymphocytes (29Gu B.J.

Before the structural determination of zfP2X4, it was thought that the polymorphism interrupted ATP binding of hP2X7 receptors, resulting in dysfunction of hP2X7. However, the crystal structures of the zfP2X4 receptor revealed that the shortest distance between the guanidinium group of Arg-312 (equivalent to the Arg-307 of hP2X7) and the triphosphate group of ATP is 12.7 Å (Fig. 1A), which is too far to produce direct interactions between the residues and the ATP. Instead, the guanidinium (RNHC(NH2)2+) of Arg-312 interacts with the anionic carboxylate (R-COO−) of Asp-88, another highly conserved residue throughout the P2X family, forming a salt bridge in both resting and open states of zfP2X4 receptors (Fig. 1B). Salt bridges, commonly formed by a combination of non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions) between acidic and alkaline amino acids, play important roles in maintaining the structures and functions of enzymes, receptors, and other proteins (30Dibb K.M.

Therefore, the reason why the polymorphism of one residue of this salt bridge induced loss-of-function in human P2X receptors should be reevaluated. Also, the functional roles of this highly conserved salt bridge in P2X receptors also need to be elucidated. Combining mutagenesis, disulfide cross-linking, electrophysiology, Western blotting, and molecular modeling, we suggest here the critical role of this highly conserved salt bridge in protein stability and channel gating via a mechanism of stabilizing the kinked conformation of the β2,3-sheet, a structural element covalently coupled with one residue of this salt bridge. As we described previously (39Zhao W.S. Wang J. Ma X.J. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Fan Y.Z. Cheng X.Y. Chen H.Z. Wang R. Yu Y. Relative motions between left flipper and dorsal fin domains favour P2X4 receptor activation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Transfections of plasmids were performed with Hilymax (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Most of the drugs were purchased from Sigma. The plasmids pcDNA3-rP2X4, pcDNA3-rP2X2, and pcDNA3-rP2X7 were kindly gifted by Drs. Alan North and Lin-Hua Jiang. The cDNA of zfP2X4.1 was obtained from Dr. Eric Gouaux and was then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The cDNA of hP2X1 was purchased from JiKai Gene and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. All mutants were obtained using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit and subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. As we previously described (39Zhao W.S. Wang J. Ma X.J. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Fan Y.Z.

Commun. 2014; 5: 4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed 24–48 h after transient transfection at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) using Axon 200B under the voltage clamp. The recording electrodes were filled with a pipette solution, and the resistance was between 3 and 5 megohms. Membrane current signals were amplified by using a patch clamp amplifier (Axon 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. All currents were sampled and analyzed using a Digidata 1440 interface and a computer running the Clampex and Clampfit 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). Solutions were applied using a “Y-tube” method throughout the experiments. The external solution contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2·2H2O, 10 HEPES, and 1 MgCl2·6H2O; the pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.4. Pipette solutions contained (in mm) 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 1 MgCl2·6H2O, 0.1 CaCl2·2H2O, and 5 EGTA; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 using Tris-base. Cells were patched and held at −60 mV throughout the experiment under voltage clamp conditions. Drugs were dissolved in external solutions. By using nystatin (0.1 μg/μl) in high potassium pipette solutions, perforated patch clamp was employed when ATP was administered repeatedly to avoid the desensitization of P2X receptors. High potassium pipette solutions contained (in mm) 75 K2SO4, 55 KCl, 5 MgSO4, 10 HEPES. The interval time between ATP delivery was 8–15 min to avoid receptor desensitization. The maximal currents of WT and mutated channels were measured using standard whole-cell recordings, whereas the nystatin-perforated patch clamp was used for recordings of dose-dependent response curves and the current comparison before and after DTT application. Surface biotinylation and Western blotting were performed according to our previous description (39Zhao W.S. Wang J. Ma X.J. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Fan Y.Z. Cheng X.Y. Chen H.Z. Wang R. Yu Y.

In brief, the transfected HEK-293 cells were washed in chilled PBS and then incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) dissolved in chilled PBS+/+ (containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0). The reaction was terminated by incubating the cells with glycine (20 mm) in PBS and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then collected and lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific). With centrifugation, 10% of the volume of the supernatant was diluted with SDS loading buffer and used as the total protein fraction. The remaining biotinylated proteins were adsorbed to agarose resin linked to NeutrAvidin by 3–5 h of incubation at 4 °C and subsequently washed with chilled PBS 3–5 times. All of the Western blotting protein samples were boiled with SDS loading buffer with (for reducing experiment) or without (for non-reducing experiments) β-mercaptoethanol (1%) for 5 min. Bound proteins were used as surface proteins. Protein samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using an 8–10% main gel and a 4% stacking gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk at room temperature for 1–2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-EE tag (1:1,000; Abcam) or anti-GAPDH (1:2,000; Sungene Biotech) antibodies dissolved in 5% milk. Then the membrane was washed and incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for EE tag (25 °C, 1 h, 1:1,000; goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L)-HRP; Sungene Biotech) or GAPDH (25 °C, 1 h, 1:3,000, goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L)-HRP; Sungene Biotech) and finally visualized using an ECL solution (Thermo) and exposure with ImageQuant RT ECL system (GE Healthcare) for 1–3 min. The results were then analyzed using ImageQuant software. The homology models of rP2X4 and mutants were created based on the crystal structures (Protein Data Bank entries 4DW0 and 4DW1) using Modeler 9.9 following our previous description (39Zhao W.S.

A fast, scalable method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with a constant number of particles, pressure (1 bar), and temperature (300 K) and periodic boundary conditions, which uses a particular “neutral territory” method called the midpoint method to efficiently exploit a high degree of computational parallelism (41Shaw D.E.

A default OPLS_2005 force field, following the functional form of the OPLS-AA family of force fields, was used for the protein and ATP molecules. The energy-minimized structures by DESMOND 3.0 were used as the starting structures for MD simulations (41Shaw D.E. A fast, scalable method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A large dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer was constructed to generate a suitable membrane system in which the transmembrane domain of the rP2X4 could be embedded. The protein/dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine system was subsequently dissolved in simple point charge water molecules. Counter ions were then added to compensate for the net negative charge of the system. NaCl (150 mm) was added into the simulation box that represented background salt at physiological conditions. All of the MD simulations were run on the DAWNING TC2600 system. Preparation, analysis, and visualization were performed on a DELL T7500 graphic working station. All static results were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices). Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test. The significant levels were considered statistically as follows: *, p < 0.05, and **, p < 0.01. Concentration-response relationships for ATP activation of wild-type or mutant receptors were performed by administration of ATP with different concentrations, and data were obtained from 4–12 cells in at least three different batches of transfections. All of the results used to generate a concentration-response relationship were from the same group. Currents induced by each concentration were normalized by the maximal current, and then data were pooled for statistical analysis. The data were fitted to the Hill equation, I/Imax = 1/(1 + (EC50/[ATP])n), where I is the normalized current at a given concentration of ATP; Imax is the maximum normalized current; EC50 is the concentration of ATP yielding a current that is half of the maximum, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The crystal structure of the zfP2X4 receptor revealed that the guanidinium (RNHC(NH2)2+) of Arg-312 in one subunit interacts with the anionic carboxylate (R-COO−) of Asp-88 in another subunit, with the N—O bond distances of 1.79 and 1.74 Å, respectively, forming a salt bridge, both at resting and open states (Fig. 1B). Additionally, a cation-π interaction was also observed between Arg-312 and Trp-167 (Fig. 1B). Alanine substitutions on these three residues (R312A, D88A, and W167A) led to significantly decreased maximal currents (Imax) of zfP2X4 receptors induced by saturated ATP (10 mm), indicating the important roles of those residues in P2X4 function (Imax = 1.2 ± 0.6, 3.12 ± 1.3, 1.37 ± 0.44 pA/pF, for R312A, D88A, and W167A, respectively, versus Imax = 14.6 ± 1.0 pA/pF for WT, respectively, n = 7, p < 0.01; Fig. 1, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W2264539706,"Mutations of the huntingtin protein (HTT) gene underlie both adult-onset and juvenile forms of Huntington's disease (HD). HTT modulates mitotic spindle orientation and cell fate in mouse cortical progenitors from the ventricular zone. Using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) characterized as carrying mutations associated with adult-onset disease during pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, we investigated the influence of human HTT and of an adult-onset HD mutation on mitotic spindle orientation in human neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from hESCs. The RNAi-mediated silencing of both HTT alleles in neural stem cells derived from hESCs disrupted spindle orientation and led to the mislocalization of dynein, the p150Glued subunit of dynactin and the large nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein. We also investigated the effect of the adult-onset HD mutation on the role of HTT during spindle orientation in NSCs derived from HD-hESCs. By combining SNP-targeting allele-specific silencing and gain-of-function approaches, we showed that a 46-glutamine expansion in human HTT was sufficient for a dominant-negative effect on spindle orientation and changes in the distribution within the spindle pole and the cell cortex of dynein, p150Glued and NuMA in neural cells. Thus, neural derivatives of disease-specific human pluripotent stem cells constitute a relevant biological resource for exploring the impact of adult-onset HD mutations of the HTT gene on the division of neural progenitors, with potential applications in HD drug discovery targeting HTT-dynein-p150Glued complex interactions."

Cellular FLIP (cFLIP) forms are also known to activate the NF-κB pathway via IKK activation.

Our results further reveal that cFLIPL requires the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex and the kinase TAK1 for activation of the IKK kinase. Similarly, cFLIPS and p22-FLIP also require TAK1 but do not require LUBAC. In contrast, these isoforms are both components of complexes that incorporate Fas-associated death domain and RIP1, which appear essential for kinase activation.

Inclusion criteria were presence of pulmonary embolism, availability of patient records and 30-day follow-up. The following clinical scores were calculated: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, original and simplified pulmonary embolism severity index, Glasgow Coma Scale, and euroSCORE II. Results In the study group of 365 patients 39 patients (10.7%) died within 30 days due to pulmonary embolism. From all examined scores and parameters the best predictor of 30-day mortality were the Glasgow Coma scale (≤ 10) and parameters of the circulatory system including presence of mechanical ventilation, arterial pH (< 7.335), and systolic blood pressure (< 99 mm Hg). Conclusions Easy to ascertain circulatory parameters have the same or higher prognostic value than the clinical scores that were applied in this study.

HJURP (Holliday Junction-Recognizing Protein) plays dual roles in DNA repair and in accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. We examined whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HJURP were associated with the risk of occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers from well-known high-risk regions for HCC in China.


Methods 
Twenty-four haplotype-tagging SNPs across HJURP were selected from HapMap data using the Haploview software. We genotyped these 24 SNPs using the using Sequenom's iPLEX assay in the Fusui population, consisting of 348 patients with HCC and 359 cancer-free controls, and further investigated the significantly associated SNP using the TaqMan assay in the Haimen population, consisting of 100 cases and 103 controls. The genetic associations with the risk of HCC were analyzed by logistic regression.


Results 
We observed an increased occurrence of HCC consistently associated with A/C or C/C genotypes of the non-synonymous SNP rs3771333 compared with the A/A genotype in both the Fusui and Haimen populations, with a pooled odds ratio 1.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.33–2.49; P = 1.9 × 10−4). Case-only analysis further indicated that carriers of the at-risk C allele were younger than those carrying the A/A genotype (P = 0.0016). In addition, the expression levels of HJURP in C allele carriers were lower than that in A/A genotype carriers (P = 0.0078 and 0.0010, for mRNA and protein levels, respectively).


Conclusion 
Our findings suggest that rs3771333 in HJURP may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to HCC among Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2273567523,"Perennial cellulosic feedstocks may have potential to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by offsetting fossil fuels. However, this potential depends on meeting a number of important criteria involving land cover change, including avoiding displacement of agricultural production, not reducing uncultivated natural lands that provide biodiversity habitat and other valued ecosystem services, and avoiding the carbon debt (the amount of time needed to repay the initial carbon loss) that accompanies displacing natural lands. It is unclear whether recent agricultural expansion in the United States competes with lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstocks. Here, we evaluate how recent land cover change (2008-2013) has affected the availability of lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstock production in the U.S. Lake States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan) and its impact on other natural ecosystems. The region is potentially well suited for a diversity of bioenergy production systems, both grasses and woody biomass, due to the widespread forest economy in the north and agricultural economy in the south. Based on remotely-sensed data, our results show that between 2008 and 2013, 836,000 ha of non-agricultural open lands were already converted to agricultural uses in the Lake States, a loss of nearly 37%. The greatest relative changes occurred in the southern half that includes some of the most diverse cultivable lands in the country. We use transition diagrams to reveal gross changes that can be obscured if only net change is considered. Our results indicate that expansion of row crops (corn, soybean) was responsible for the majority of open land loss. Even if recently lost open lands were brought into perennial feedstock production, there would a substantial carbon debt. This reduction in open land availability for biomass production is closing the window of opportunity to establish a sustainable cellulosic feedstock economy in the Lake States as mandated by current Federal policy, incurring a substantial GHG debt, and displacing a range of other natural ecosystems and their services."

https://openalex.org/W2417607067,"Many studies have demonstrated changes in the levels of several ions during apoptosis, but a few recent studies have reported conflicting results concerning the changes in water content in apoptotic cells. We used a correlative light and cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy method to quantify water and ion/element contents simultaneously at a nanoscale resolution in the various compartments of cells, from the onset to the end of apoptosis. We used stably transfected HeLa cells producing H2B-GFP to identify the stages of apoptosis in cells and for a targeted elemental analysis within condensed chromatin, nucleoplasm, mitochondria and the cytosol. We found that the compartments of apoptotic cells contained, on average, 10% more water than control cells. During mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, we observed a strong increase in the Na+ and Cl- contents of the mitochondria and a strong decrease in mitochondrial K+ content. During the first step in apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), Na+ and Cl- levels decreased in all cell compartments, but remained higher than those in control cells. Conversely, during the second step of AVD, Na+ and Cl- levels increased considerably in the nucleus and mitochondria. During these two steps of AVD, K+ content decreased steadily in all cell compartments. We also determined in vivo ion status during caspase-3 activity and chromatin condensation. Finally, we found that actinomycin D-tolerant cells had water and K+ contents similar to those of cells entering apoptosis but lower Na+ and Cl- contents than both cells entering apoptosis and control cells."

A total of 28 hla genotypes were found, including three unique to isolates from China, 20 found only in the global genomes and five found in both. The hla genotype generally correlated with the clonal background, particularly the multilocus sequence type, but was not related to geographic origin, host source or methicillin-resistance phenotype. In addition, the hla gene showed greater diversity than the seven loci utilized in the MLST scheme for S. aureus.

Many different genetic mutations have been shown to associate with different types of cataracts in humans and in animal models. βA3/A1-crystallin has four Greek key-motifs that organize into two crystallin domains. It shown to bind calcium with moderate affinity and has putative calcium-binding site. Other than in the lens, βA3/A1 is also expressed in retinal astrocytes, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and retinal ganglion cells. The function of βA3/A1-crystallin in the retinal cell types is well studied; however, a clear understanding of the function of this protein in the lens has not yet been established. In the current study, we generated the βA3/A1-crystallin knockout (KO) mouse and explored the function of βA3/A1-crystallin in lens development. Our results showed that βA3-KO mice develop congenital nuclear cataract and exhibit persistent fetal vasculature condition. At the cellular level KO lenses show defective lysosomal clearance and accumulation of nuclei, mitochondria, and autophagic cargo in the outer cortical region of the lens. In addition, the calcium level and the expression and activity of calpain-3 were increased in KO lenses. Taken together, these results suggest the lack of βA3-crystallin function in lenses, alters calcium homeostasis which in turn causes lysosomal defects and calpain activation. These defects are responsible for the development of nuclear cataract in KO lenses."
https://openalex.org/W2284718991,"Silicon (Si) is suggested to be an important/essential nutrient for bone and connective tissue health. Silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) has silicate ions incorporated into its lattice structure and was developed to improve attachment to bone and increase new bone formation. Here we investigated the direct adsorption of silicate species onto an HA coated surface as a cost effective method of incorporating silicon on to HA surfaces for improved implant osseointegration, and determined changes in surface characteristics and osteoblast cell adhesion. Plasma-sprayed HA-coated stainless steel discs were incubated in silica dispersions of different concentrations (0-42 mM Si), at neutral pH for 12 h. Adsorbed Si was confirmed by XPS analysis and quantified by ICP-OES analysis following release from the HA surface. Changes in surface characteristics were determined by AFM and measurement of surface wettability. Osteoblast cell adhesion was determined by vinculin plaque staining. Maximum Si adsorption to the HA coated disc occurred after incubation in the 6 mM silica dispersion and decreased progressively with higher silica concentrations, while no adsorption was observed with dispersions below 6 mM Si. Comparison of the Si dispersions that produced the highest and lowest Si adsorption to the HA surface, by TEM-based analysis, revealed an abundance of small amorphous nanosilica species (NSP) of ~1.5 nm in diameter in the 6 mM Si dispersion, with much fewer and larger NSP in the 42 mM Si dispersions. 29Si-NMR confirmed that the NSPs in the 6 mM silica dispersion were polymeric and similar in composition to the larger NSPs in the 42 mM Si dispersion, suggesting that the latter were aggregates of the former. Amorphous NSP adsorbed from the 6 mM dispersion on to a HA-coated disc surface increased the surface's water contact angle by 53°, whereas that adsorbed from the 42 mM dispersion decreased the contact angle by 18°, indicating increased and decreased hydrophobicity, respectively. AFM showed an increase in surface roughness of the 6 mM Si treated surface, which correlated well with an increase in number of vinculin plaques. These findings suggest that NSP of the right size (relative to charge) adsorb readily to the HA surface, changing the surface characteristics and, thus, improving osteoblast cell adhesion. This treatment provides a simple way to modify plasma-coated HA surfaces that may enable improved osseointegration of bone implants."

https://openalex.org/W2268531778,"Background The accurate evaluation of favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is critical to determine the extent of surgery. We investigated independent clinicopathological and radiological predictors to discriminate no residual carcinoma (ypT0) from residual ductal carcinoma in situ (ypTis) in breast cancer patients who received NCT. Patients and Methods Parameters of 117 patients attaining pathological complete response (CR) in the breast after NCT between January 2010 and December 2013 were retrospectively evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. All patients underwent mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after NCT. Results There were 67 (57.3%) patients with ypT0. These patients were associated with hormone receptor-negative status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative tumors, and a higher likelihood of breast-conservation surgery. Baseline mammographic and MRI presentation of the main lesion, absence of associated microcalcifications, shape, posterior features, and absence of calcifications on ultrasound were significantly associated with ypT0. CR in mammography, ultrasound, or MRI after NCT was also related to ypT0. By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of ypT0 were the triple-negative subtype [Odds ratio (OR), 4.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11–16.09] and CR in MRI after NCT (OR, 5.23; 95% CI, 1.53–17.85). Stratified analysis by breast cancer subtype demonstrated that MRI well predicted ypT0 in all subtypes except the HER2-positive subtype. In particular, of 40 triple-negative subtypes, 22 showed CR in MRI and 21 (95.5%) were ypT0 after NCT. Conclusion Among imaging modalities, breast MRI can potentially distinguish between ypT0 and ypTis after NCT, especially in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. This information can help clinicians evaluate tumor response to NCT and plan surgery for breast cancer patients of all subtypes except for those with HER2-enriched tumors after NCT."

In the current study we constructed a unique experimental model which allowed for the investigation of electrotactic movement of cells of the same origin but representing different modes of cell migration: weakly adherent, spontaneously blebbing (BC) and lamellipodia forming (LC) WC256 cells. We report that both BC and LC sublines show robust cathodal migration in a physiological EF (1–3 V/cm). The directionality of cell movement was completely reversible upon reversing the field polarity. However, the full reversal of cell direction after the change of EF polarity was much faster in the case of BC (10 minutes) than LC cells (30 minutes). We also investigated the distinct requirements for Rac, Cdc42 and Rho pathways and intracellular Ca2+ in electrotaxis of WC256 sublines forming different types of cell protrusions. It was found that Rac1 is required for directional movement of LC to a much greater extent than for BC, but Cdc42 and RhoA are more crucial for BC than for LC cells. The inhibition of ROCK did not affect electrotaxis of LC in contrast to BC cells. The results also showed that intracellular Ca2+ is essential only for the electrotactic reaction of BC cells. Moreover, inhibition of MLCK and myosin II did not affect the electrotaxis of LC in contrast to BC cells. In conclusion, our results revealed that both lamellipodia and membrane blebs can efficiently drive electrotactic migration of WC 256 carcinosarcoma cells, however directional migration is mediated by different signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2261846688,"Background 
Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a conditionally essential sulfur-containing amino acid, is mainly obtained from diet in humans. Experimental studies have shown that taurine’s main biological actions include bile salt conjugation, blood pressure regulation, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation.


Methods 
We conducted a prospective case-control study nested in the New York University Women’s Health Study, a cohort study involving 14,274 women enrolled since 1985. Taurine was measured in pre-diagnostic serum samples of 241 stroke cases and 479 matched controls.


Results 
There was no statistically significant association between serum taurine and stroke risk in the overall study population. The adjusted ORs for stroke were 1.0 (reference), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.59–1.28), and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.69–1.54) in increasing tertiles of taurine (64.3–126.6, 126.7–152.9, and 153.0–308.5 nmol/mL, respectively). A significant inverse association between serum taurine and stroke risk was observed among never smokers, with an adjusted OR of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.37–1.18) and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.26–0.94) for the second and third tertile, respectively (p for trend = 0.01), but not among past or current smokers (p for interaction < 0.01).


Conclusions 
We observed no overall association between serum taurine and stroke risk, although a protective effect was observed in never smokers, which requires further investigation.

Design A cross-sectional assessment of young people currently receiving social services. Methods Young people age 15–18 participated in a study where a translated and adapted version of the YSR was administered by trained nurses, followed by an assessment by Ethiopian psychiatrists. Internal reliability of YSR syndrome scales were assessed using Chronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was assessed through repeating the YSR one month later. To assess validity, analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of the YSR compared to the psychiatrist assessment was conducted. Results Across the eight syndrome scales, the YSR best measured the diagnosis of anxiety/depression and social problems among young women, and attention problems among young men. Among individual YSR syndrome scales, internal reliability ranged from unacceptable (Chronback’s alpha = 0.11, rule-breaking behavior among young women) to good (α≥0.71, anxiety/depression among young women). Anxiety/depression scores of ≥8.5 among young women also had good sensitivity (0.833) and specificity (0.754) to predict a true diagnosis. The YSR syndrome scales for social problems among young women and attention problems among young men also had fair consistency and validity measurements. Most YSR scores had significant positive correlations between baseline and post-one month administration. Measures of reliability and validity for most other YSR syndrome scales were fair to poor. Conclusions The adapted, personally administered, Amharic version of the YSR has sufficient reliability and validity in identifying young vulnerable women with anxiety/depression and/or social problems, and young men with attention problems; which were the most common mental health disorders observed by psychiatrists among the migrant populations in this study. Further assessment of the applicability of the YSR among vulnerable young people for less common disorders in Ethiopia is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2256190006,"Deprivation of one modality can lead to the improvement of other intact modalities. We have previously reported that visual deprivation drives AMPA receptors into synapses from layer4 to 2/3 in the barrel cortex and sharpens functional whisker-barrel map at layer2/3 2 days after the beginning of visual deprivation. Enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission at layer4-2/3 synapses is transient and returns to the base line level a week after the beginning of visual deprivation. Here we found that sharpened whisker-barrel function is maintained at least for a week in visually deprived animals. While increased AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at layer4-2/3 synapses dropped to the base line a week after the beginning of visual deprivation, lateral inhibitory synaptic transmission onto the neighboring barrel was kept strengthened for a week of visually deprived animals. Thus, transient strengthening of excitatory synapses at layer4-2/3 in the barrel cortex could trigger the enhancement of inhibitory inputs to neighboring barrel, and sustained lateral inhibition can maintain the sharpening of whisker-barrel map in visually deprived animals."
https://openalex.org/W2268664989,"In order to better understand pathogenicity of Helicobacter pylori, particularly in the context of its carcinogenic activity, we analysed expression of virulence genes: cagA, virB/D complex (virB4, virB7, virB8, virB9, virB10, virB11, virD4) and vacA in strains of the pathogen originating from persons with gastric diseases. The studies were conducted on 42 strains of H. pylori isolated from patients with histological diagnosis of non-atrophic gastritis—NAG (group 1, including subgroup 1 containing cagA+ isolates and subgroup 2 containing cagA- strains), multifocal atrophic gastritis—MAG (group 2) and gastric adenocarcinoma—GC (group 3). Expression of H. pylori genes was studied using microarray technology. In group 1, in all strains of H. pylori cagA+ (subgroup 1) high expression of the gene as well as of virB/D was disclosed, accompanied by moderate expression of vacA. In strains of subgroup 2 a moderate expression of vacA was detected. All strains in groups 2 and 3 carried cagA gene but they differed in its expression: a high expression was detected in isolates of group 2 and its hyperexpression in strains of group 3 (hypervirulent strains). In both groups high expression of virB/D and vacA was disclosed. Our results indicate that chronic active gastritis may be induced by both cagA+ strains of H. pylori, manifesting high expression of virB/D complex but moderate activity of vacA, and cagA- strains with moderate expression of vacA gene. On the other hand, in progression of gastric pathology and carcinogenesis linked to H. pylori a significant role was played by hypervirulent strains, manifesting a very high expression of cagA and high activity of virB/D and vacA genes."
https://openalex.org/W2270264810,"Nitrile hydratase metalloenzymes are unique and important biocatalysts that are used industrially to produce high value amides from their corresponding nitriles. After more than three decades since their discovery, the mechanism of this class of enzymes is becoming clear with evidence from multiple recent studies that the cysteine-derived sulfenato ligand of the active site metal serves as the nucleophile that initially attacks the nitrile. Herein we describe the first direct evidence from solution phase catalysis that the source of the product carboxamido oxygen is the protein. Using(18)O-labeled water under single turnover conditions and native high resolution protein mass spectrometry, we show that the incorporation of labeled oxygen into both product and protein is turnover-dependent and that only a single oxygen is exchanged into the protein even under multiple turnover conditions, lending significant support to proposals that the post-translationally modified sulfenato group serves as the nucleophile to initiate hydration of nitriles."
https://openalex.org/W2259487388,"Elevated blood lead levels (BLL) and malaria carry an important burden of disease in West Africa. Both diseases might cause anemia and they might entail long-term consequences for the development and the health status of the child. Albeit the significant impact of malaria on lead levels described in Nigeria, no evaluation of the effect of elevated BLL on malaria risk has been investigated so far.Between 2010 and 2012, blood lead levels of 203 Beninese infants from Allada, a semi-rural area 50km North from Cotonou, were assessed at 12 months of age. To assess lead levels, blood samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In parallel, clinical, microbiological and hematological data were collected. More precisely, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, CRP, vitamin B12, folate levels, and Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia were assessed and stool samples were also analyzed.At 12 months, the mean BLL of infants was 7.41 μg/dL (CI: 65.2; 83), and 128 infants (63%) had elevated blood lead levels, defined by the CDC as BLL>5 μg/dL. Lead poisoning, defined as BLL>10 μg/dL, was found in 39 infants (19%). Twenty-five infants (12.5%) had a positive blood smear at 12 months and 144 infants were anemic (71%, hemoglobin<110 g/L). Elevated blood lead levels were significantly associated with reduced risk of a positive blood smear (AOR = 0.38, P-value = 0.048) and P. falciparum parasite density (beta-estimate = -1.42, P-value = 0.03) in logistic and negative binomial regression multivariate models, respectively, adjusted on clinical and environmental indicators.Our study shows for the first time that BLL are negatively associated with malarial risk considering other risk factors. Malaria is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in infants under 5 years worldwide, and lead poisoning is the 6th most important contributor to the global burden of diseases measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) according to the Institute of Health Metrics. In conclusion, due to the high prevalence of elevated BLL, health interventions should look forward to minimize the exposure to lead to better protect the population in West Africa."
