https://openalex.org/W2082740501,"Since the discovery of NAD-dependent deacetylases, sirtuins, it has been recognized that maintaining intracellular levels of NAD is crucial for the management of stress response of cells. Here we show that agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with loss of intracellular levels of NAD, but not exercise-induced physiologic hypertrophy. Exogenous addition of NAD was capable of maintaining intracellular levels of NAD and blocking the agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophic response in vitro as well as in vivo. NAD treatment blocked the activation of pro-hypertrophic Akt1 signaling, and augmented the activity of anti-hypertrophic LKB1-AMPK signaling in the heart, which prevented subsequent induction of mTOR-mediated protein synthesis. By using gene knock-out and transgenic mouse models of SIRT3 and SIRT1, we showed that the anti-hypertrophic effects of exogenous NAD are mediated through activation of SIRT3, but not SIRT1. SIRT3 deacetylates and activates LKB1, thus augmenting the activity of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. These results reveal a novel role of NAD as an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophic signaling, and suggest that prevention of NAD depletion may be critical in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W1988926458,"Adipocyte death has been reported in both obese humans and rodents. However, its role in metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation associated with obesity has not been studied. We now show using real-time reverse transcription-PCR arrays that adipose tissue of obese mice display a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Moreover, caspase activation and adipocyte apoptosis were markedly increased in adipose tissue from both mice with diet-induced obesity and obese humans. These changes were associated with activation of both the extrinsic, death receptor-mediated, and intrinsic, mitochondrial-mediated pathways of apoptosis. Genetic inactivation of Bid, a key pro-apoptotic molecule that serves as a link between these two cell death pathways, significantly reduced caspase activation, adipocyte apoptosis, prevented adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, and protected against the development of systemic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis independent of body weight. These data strongly suggest that adipocyte apoptosis is a key initial event that contributes to macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis associated with obesity in both mice and humans. Inhibition of adipocyte apoptosis may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic complications.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in most of the Western World. With obesity comes a variety of adverse health outcome such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis, which are grouped into the so-call metabolic syndrome (1Staels B.

It has become clear that a state of low grade chronic inflammation typically associated with obesity and characterized by macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue (AT) 2The abbreviations used are: ATadipose tissueATMadipose tissue macrophagesTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingBSAbovine serum albuminSCDstearoyl-CoA desaturaseFFAfree fatty acidsNAFLDnonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseNASHnonalcoholic steatohepatitisH&Ehematoxylin and eosinHFAThigh fatHSDhigh sucroseCTLcontrolTGtriglyceridesDAPI4′,6-di amidino-2-phenylindoleILinterleukinTNFtumor necrosis factor. and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines plays a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance (7Schenk S.

Indeed, in both humans and rodents, adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) accumulate in AT with increasing body weight, and preventing the accumulation of ATM protects against the obesity-associated inflammatory state and development of insulin resistance (10Weisberg S.P.

The pathogenic mechanisms resulting in ATM recruitment are under intense investigation and remain incompletely understood. Increased production and release of certain chemokines by adipocytes potentially as a result of local hypoxia in an expanding adipose tissue bed has been implicated (14Ye J. Gao Z. Yin J. He Q. Am.

More recently, adipocyte necrotic cell death with formation of “crown-like structures” characterized by dead adipocytes surrounded by macrophages has been described in both adipose tissue from obese mice and humans (16Strissel K.J.

However, whether adipocyte necrosis is a late consequence of the adipose tissue expansion and inflammation or an upstream event that initiates ATM recruitment remain unanswered. Moreover, the molecular signaling events resulting in adipocyte cell death, and the occurrence and significance of apoptosis in this context, remain completely unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increased adipocyte apoptosis results in recruitment of macrophages to adipose tissue and is a key link between obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. These experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Cleveland Clinic. Male C57BL/6 mice, 20 to 25 g of body weight, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. C57BL/6 Bid knockout (generously provided by Dr. Xiao-Ming Yin from the University of Pittsburgh) mice were described previously (19Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Mice were placed on two different diets that allow us to study the spectrum of human obesity. Mice were fed either a high fat (HFAT) diet (consisting of 42% Kcal from fat, 42.7% carbohydrate, 15.2% protein, 4% mineral mixture, TD 88137, Teklad Mills, Madison, WI), or a high sucrose (HSD) diet (consisting of 65% sucrose, 20% casein, 5% corn oil, 4% mineral mixture, TD 98090, Teklad Mills, Madison, WI) (n = 5–6 in each group) that result in obesity, hepatic steatosis, and systemic insulin resistance (20Nanji A.A.

Control mice were fed a standard diet consisting of 5% fat (TD 2918, Teklad Mills, Madison, WI) (n = 6). Total body weight was measured weekly. Animals in each group were sacrified after 6 weeks on respective diets. The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all patients gave written informed consent for participation in medical research. We examined omental fat biopsies from obese subjects (n = 8) undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute and from lean healthy controls (n = 7) undergoing abdominal surgery for unrelated reasons. Adipose tissue was cut into small pieces and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C or fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h at 4 °C for histological, immunohistochemical analysis. Adipose tissue apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay, and macrophage infiltration was assessed by CD68 immunostaining. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells and CD68-positive cells in adipose tissue were determined for each patient and related to the presence of insulin resistance syndrome (BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance). Adipose (epididymal) and liver tissue were collected under deep anesthesia after a 6-h fast as previously described in detail (23Feldstein A.E. Werneburg N.W. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Tissue Path (Fisher Scientific). Tissue sections (4 μm) were prepared, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of adipose and liver sections, as well as Oil Red O-stained liver specimens were evaluated by light microscopy(24Li Z.Z. Berk M. McIntyre T.M. Feldstein A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5637-5644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The presence of macrophage infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry F4/80 and Mac3 antibodies, two known markers of activated macrophages (10Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M.

Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The total number of nuclei and the number of nuclei of F4/80- and MAC3-expressing cells were counted in 4 random fields (×10) for each adipose specimen. The fraction of F4/80-Mac3-expressing cells was calculated for each sample. Double immunostaining was performed to enable simultaneous detection of apoptotic cells (TUNEL assay) and adipocytes (perilipin). Apoptotic cells were identified using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as detailed below. Sections were stained for perilipin A and B using a rabbit anti-perilipin A/B antibody. The epididymal fat pad was isolated and placed in warm (37 °C) KRH/BSA buffer, pH 7.4 (1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.4 mm KCl, 2 mm pyruvic acid, 20 mm HEPES, 24 mm NaHCO3, 130 mm NaCl, 1% BSA). The tissue was minced until homogenous. The lower medium containing nonfat tissue was removed. Minced fat tissue was placed in KRH/BSA buffer containing 1 mg/ml of CLS type 1 collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp, cat. LS004194) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Digested fat tissue was filtered using nylon cloth filter (Fisher Scientific). Filtered adipocytes were washed with KRH/BSA buffer and centrifuged. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) containing protease inhibitors (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein concentration was subsequently measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). After homogenization by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and sonication, total RNA was isolated from adipose tissue of mice on either control or HFAT diet. cDNA was transcribed using an RT2 Reaction Ready First Strand Synthesis kit (SuperArray Bioscience) and was analyzed using the mouse apoptosis PCR array (cat. no. APM-012A, SuperArray Bioscience, Frederick, MD) focusing on gene families relevant to the induction and inhibition of apoptosis, and the RT2 SYBR Green/Rox PCR master mix (cat. no. PA-012, SuperArray Bioscience) on a 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized using multiple housekeeping genes (β-actin, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), HPRT1, HSP90AB1), and analyzed by comparing 2ΔΔCt of the normalized sample. The TUNEL assay was performed in each sample following the manufacturer’s instructions (in situ cell death detection kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Adipocyte apoptosis in adipose tissue sections was quantitated by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in 10 random microscopic fields (×40), as previously described (26Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Angulo P. Taniai M. Burgart L.J. Lindor K.D. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using whole cell lysates. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with appropriate primary antibodies. The membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution, BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), and the bound antibody was visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The antibodies used included: rabbit anti-Bid (cat. 2003, dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-caspase 8 (cat. 4927, dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-Bax (cat. 2772, dilution 1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-FAS (X-20, dilution 1:1000), goat polyclonal anti-actin (C-11, dilution 1:1000) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FasL (ab15285, dilution 1:1000) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-BCL-XL (cat. 556499, dilution 1:1000) was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved Bid (Ab-1, cat. PC645, dilution 1:1000) was from EMD Calbiochem. Total RNA was isolated from adipose tissue using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The reverse transcript (the cDNA) was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR quantification was performed. Briefly, 25 μl of reaction mix contained: cDNA, Syber Green buffer, Gold Taq polymerase, dNTPs, and primers at final concentrations of 200 μm. The sequences of the primers used for quantitative PCR were as follows: TNF-α 5′-CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT and 5′-GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG; IL-6 5′-TAGTCCTTCCTACCCCAATTTCC and 5′-TTGGTCCTTAGCCACTCCTTC; IL-1β 5′-GCAACTGTTCCTGAACTCAACT and 5′-ATCTTTTGGGGTCCGTCAACT; iNOS 5′-GTTCTCAGCCCAACAATACAAGA and 5′-GTGGACGGGTCGATGTCAC; Arginase-1 5′-CTCCAAGCCAAAGTCCTTAGAG and 5′-AGGAGCTGTCATTAGGGACATC; TGF-β 5′-CTCCCGTGGCTTCTAGTGC and 5′-GCCTTAGTTTGGACAGGATCTG. RT-PCR was performed in the Mx3000P cycler (Stratagene): 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C followed by 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 95 °C. The fold change over control samples was calculated using CT, ΔCT, and ΔΔCT values using MxPro software (Stratagene). 18 S ribosomal RNA (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX) was used as an endogenous control. Mice were fasted overnight and then received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg of glucose/g of body weight. Blood was collected from the tail vein in conscious mice at 0-, 15-, 45-, and 120-min postinjection. Glucose was measured using a One Touch Ultra2 blood glucose monitoring system (Johnson & Johnson, Langhorne, PA). Serum assays of metabolic and inflammatory mediators, including serum insulin, IL-6, and TNF-α levels (plasma and tissue lysates) were measured after a 6-hour fast using commercially available mouse insulin (Crystal Chem Inc, Downers Grove, IL), IL-6, and TNF-α (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) ELISA kits, respectively. Serum fasting glucose concentrations were measured using a gluco-analyzer (Roche) whereas liver and plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels were measured using commercially available assays: triglyceride-SL assay (Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd), and NEFA C (Wako Chemicals). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey’s adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to estimate the association of TUNEL-positive cells and degree of insulin resistance, steatosis, and ATM infiltration. A type I error rate of 0.05 was used for all analyses. SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to perform all analyses, and R 2.0.1 software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used to construct all graphs. Mice fed either an HFAT or an HSD for 6 weeks developed marked obesity compared with animals kept on a standard control diet (37.3 ± 1.5 versus 31 ± 0.9 versus 28.7 ± 0.8 g body weight, respectively, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A). Histological examination of adipose tissue showed a correlation between the magnitude of weight gain and adipocyte hypertrophy with the mean adipocyte cross-sectional area being significantly higher in those mice fed either the HFAT or HSD compared with mice on the control diet (HFAT > HSD > CTL) (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, feeding mice an HFAT resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of Mac3-positive cells compared with mice fed the CTL diet. These results were similar in the mice on the HSD (data not shown). In agreement with previous reports, clusters of ATM forming the so call “crown-like structures” were noted in AT of animals on HFAT but not in those on the CTL diet (Fig. 1, C and D). The increase in ATM was also associated with macrophage polarization toward a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype characterized by a significant increase in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β (Fig. 1, F and G), as well as an increase in the ratio of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) to arginase 1 (ARG1) (Fig. 1F). We did not detect changes in the expression levels of IL-10; however, TGF-β expression was increased in adipose tissue from mice on the HFD compared with the CTL diet (Fig. 1F). To explore the impact of the changes observed in adipose tissue in obese animals on the transcriptional profile of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis, we used quantitative real-time PCR microarrays to catalog gene expression levels of a total of 84 genes in epididymal adipose tissue from mice on either the CTL or HFAT diet. Strikingly, mice on the HFAT diet demonstrated a pro-apoptotic gene expression profile characterized by a marked down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes compared with mice on the CTL diet (Fig. 1G). Supplemental Table S1 shows the fold difference in the expression of each gene analyzed between the HFAT and CTL mice. We next examined the effects of the different diets on systemic insulin resistance, lipid profile, and hepatic steatosis. Although the fasting plasma glucose levels were similar in the three groups of mice, the fasting insulin levels were markedly increased in mice on either HFAT or HSD compared with mice on the control diet (HFAT > HSD > CTL) (Fig. 2A). The serum TG and FFA levels were also significantly increased compared with controls (Fig. 2B). The animals on the HFAT manifested glucose intolerance in glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 2C). Finally, the animals on both the HFAT and HSD diets developed marked hepatic steatosis, with increases in hepatic TG levels compared with the mice on the control diet (Fig. 2, D–F).FIGURE 1Adipose tissue expansion, macrophage infiltration, and inflammation during diet-induced obesity are associated with a pro-apoptotic phenotype.

In adipose tissue specimens from lean mice on the CTL diet, only a few isolated TUNEL-positive cells were identified (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, TUNEL-positive cells were readily observed in adipose tissue from both HFAT- and HSD-fed animals (Fig. 3A). Quantitation of TUNEL-positive cells showed an 8-fold increase of apoptotic cells in these mice compared with the lean mice on the CTL diet (HFAT: 42 ± 4.9 versus HSD: 38 ± 10.6 versus CTL 6 ± 5% positive cells, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). To confirm the presence of apoptosis, we next examined the expression and degree of activation of caspase 3, a key effector caspase that executes the apoptotic program. Immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3 showed that the immunoreactive product for activated caspase 3 was readily identified in adipocytes from obese animals on both HFAT and HSD but not in lean mice on the CTL diet (Fig. 3C). Caspase 3 activity was also increased by more than 2-fold in the obese animals compared with the lean controls (Fig. 3D). The morphologic appearance and distribution of TUNEL-positive cells suggested that these were predominantly adipocytes. To further establish adipocyte apoptosis versus apoptosis occurring in other cell types in adipose tissue, we used two different approaches. First, in selective experiments, the epididymal fat pad from CTL and HFAT-fed animals was fractionated into adipocytes and nonadipocytes fractions. Consistent with the results shown above for whole adipose tissue, caspase 3 activity was markedly increased in adipocyte fractions from HFAT-fed animals compared with the CTL mice (Fig. 3E). Second, we performed double staining experiments to identify simultaneously apoptotic cells and adipocytes in epididymal fat sections from mice on the CTL or HFAT diet. Mice on the HFAT diet showed significantly increased apoptosis (Fig. 3F) compared with controls that were mainly adipocyte in origin. To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the increased apoptosis observed in the adipose tissue of obese mice, the expression of key proteins involved in the signal transduction of the two main apoptotic pathways were evaluated in obese and lean mice. By Western blot analysis, we found that Fas and FasL protein expression was significantly increased in the AT of obese animals compared with lean mice (Fig. 4A). This observation was further supported by Fas and FasL immunostaining in adipose tissue of mice on the HFAT and HSD diet (data not shown). These changes were associated with activation of Fas signaling as shown by detection of the activated form of caspase 8 and a marked increase in the cleaved, truncated Bid (tBid), a BH3-only protein of the Bcl-2 family that plays a central role as a regulator of the interaction between the extrinsic (death-receptor mediated) and the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways of apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Finally, we also noted changes in two other Bcl-2 family members that play a key role in the initiation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, including Bax and Bcl-XL, (Fig. 4B). We observed a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-XL ratio (Fig. 4C), which has been shown in various experimental models to result in mitochondrial permeabilization as well as increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis (27Green D.R. Cell. 2005; 121: 671-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The findings of marked increased adipocyte apoptosis in two models of diet-induced obesity in mice and the activation of two key signaling pathways of apoptosis in these animals led us to further examine the role of adipocyte apoptosis by using Bid-null mice. Bid−/− mice and their wild-type controls were placed on either HFAT or control diet for 6 weeks. Bid knockouts showed similar weight gain as their wild-type littermates when placed on the HFAT diet (Fig. 5A). However, genetic inactivation of Bid proved to protect from caspase 3 activation in adipocytes and significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells detected in the adipose tissue of these mice (Fig. 5, B and C). These changes were associated with a marked decreased in ATM (Fig. 5D) and inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5E). Moreover, Bid knockouts were resistant to diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (Fig. 5, F–J). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that adipocyte apoptosis is an early event that results in ATM recruitment and development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.FIGURE 5Inactivation of Bid protects from caspase 3 activation, adipocyte apoptosis, and metabolic complications from diet-induced obesity.

However, it remains unknown whether mammalian FIP200 regulates autophagy in vivo. Here we show that neural-specific deletion of FIP200 resulted in cerebellar degeneration accompanied by progressive neuronal loss, spongiosis, and neurite degeneration in the cerebellum. Furthermore, deletion of FIP200 led to increased apoptosis in cerebellum as well as accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates without any deficiency in proteasome catalytic functions. We also observed an increased p62/SQSTM1 accumulation in the cerebellum and reduced autophagosome formation as well as accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the mutant mice. Lastly, analysis of cerebellar neurons in vitro showed reduced JNK activation and increased susceptibility to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in cerebellar neurons from the mutant mice. Taken together, these results provide strong genetic evidence for a role of FIP200 in the regulation of neuronal homeostasis through its function in autophagy in vivo.

Damages to cerebellum caused by either injury or neurodegeneration are associated with various degrees of ataxia phenotype both in humans as well as mouse models. Previous studies have identified various gene mutations underlying the different neurodegenerative disorders and also revealed a potentially common cellular mechanism of these diseases, i.e. the accumulation of abnormal proteins aggregation. Protein quality control mechanisms, including ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, have been shown to play crucial roles in the homeostasis of neurons and in neurodegeneration (4Rubinsztein D.C.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which key signaling molecules and pathways regulate these cellular processes in neurodegeneration is still incomplete.

Abbi S. Zheng C. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that FIP200 also associates with other cellular proteins and regulates several signaling pathways (10Gan B. Guan J.L. Cell Signal. 2008; 20: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of FIP200 caused neurite atrophy and apoptosis in a neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2a (11Chano T. Saji M. Inoue H. Minami K. Kobayashi T. Hino O. Okabe H. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 18: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chano T. Okabe H. Hulette C.M. Brain Res. 2007; 1168: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that FIP200 may play a role in homeostasis of neurons. Interestingly, recent studies identified FIP200 as a potential mammalian counterpart of yeast autophagy protein Atg17 (13Hara T. Takamura A. Kishi C. Iemura S. Natsume T. Guan J.L. Mizushima N. J.

FIP200 was shown to be a component of the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex in fibroblasts (15Ganley I.G. Lam du H. Wang J. Ding X. Chen S. Jiang X. J. Biol.

Although the primary function of autophagy is the supply of amino acids as a response to starvation conditions in many organisms, a low level of basal (or constitutive) autophagy also plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons. Neural-specific conditional KO of Atg5 or Atg7, both essential components of mammalian autophagy, led to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, increased apoptosis, and neurodegeneration (18Hara T.

Despite these interesting observations, however, whether FIP200 plays a role in the regulation of basal autophagy and homeostasis of neurons in vivo remains totally unknown.

To explore a potential role of FIP200 in neurodegeneration in vivo, we generated and analyzed neural-specific conditional FIP200 KO mice using the Cre-loxP approach. Our results reveal a role of FIP200 in the regulation of neuronal homeostasis, and deletion of FIP200 led to cerebellar degeneration, which is caused by axon degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells as well as increased apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells. FIP200f/f mice were described previously (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). nestin-Cre mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed and handled according to local, state, and federal regulations, and all experimental procedures were carried out according to the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Michigan. Mice genotyping for FIP200 and Cre alleles were performed by PCR analysis of tail DNA, essentially as described previously (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Wei H. Gan B. Wu X. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized using CO2, and a complete tissue set was harvested during necropsy. Fixation was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C using freshly made, pre-chilled (4 °C) PBS-buffered formalin. The brain tissues were all sagittal sectioned and then embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histological examination or left unstained for immunohistochemistry. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections were examined under a BX41 light microscope (Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA), and images were captured with an Olympus digital camera (model DP70) using DP Controller software (Version 1.2.1.10 8). For immunohistochemistry, unstained tissue sections were first deparaffinized in 3 washes of xylene (3 min each) and then were rehydrated in graded ethanol solutions (100, 95, 70, 50, and 30%). After heat-activated antigen retrieval (Retriever 2000, PickCell Laboratories B.V., Amsterdam, Holland) according to the manufacturer’s specifications, sections were treated with blocking solutions; first with Avidin-Biotin Block (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) then with Protein Block Serum Free (Dako Corp.). Sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h in a humid chamber, washed in PBS 3 times (5 min each), then incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in a humidified chamber for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed in PBS similarly as before. Finally, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories) for 15 min at room temperature in a humid chamber and washed with PBS similarly as before. As the last staining step, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (SIGMA FAST® DAB with Metal Enhancer, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the sections, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature until a macroscopically appreciable light brown color developed in the sections (generally 30 s to 5 min). After incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, sections were lightly counterstained will Gill’s hematoxylin. Histological examination and digital photography were carried out as described previously (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Wei H. Gan B. Wu X. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorensen’s buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. After several rinses with buffer, they were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. They were then rinsed in double distilled water to remove phosphate salt and then stained with aqueous 3% uranyl acetate for 1 h. The samples were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol, rinsed two times in propylene oxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. They were Ultrathin-sectioned at 70 nm in thickness and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 60 kV. Images were recorded digitally using a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital camera system operated using AMT software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA). Cerebellum sections from various time points (6 μm) were deparaffinized, incubated in methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min, washed, and incubated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were detected as described in the ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sections were counterstained with methyl green. The mouse brain tissues were collected from control or FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice at postnatal day 0 (P0). The protein lysates were prepared by homogenization in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm sodium EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Tissue and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and cleared supernatants were further transferred into a clean microcentrifuge tube. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. In other experiments, lysates were prepared from cerebellar neuron cultures in vitro using similar methods. The lysates were boiled for 5 min in 1 × SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12.5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and were then resolved with 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After the SDS-PAGE were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, membranes were incubated with antibody against FIP200 (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature, washed using TBST, and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). An Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) kit (Pierce) was used to detect the immunoreactivity signal. Proteasomal catalytic activity was analyzed for the lysates using the synthetic peptide substrates linked to the fluorometric receptor and aminomethylcoumarin (AMC, Proteasome Substrate Pack from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mice cerebella were dissected, placed on ice, and homogenized in proteolysis activity buffer (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2). The 250-μl aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 2.5 μl of Ac-Gly-Pro-Leu-Asp-AMC (5 mm), Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (5 mm), Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (5 mm), Ac-Arg-Leu-Arg-AMC (5 mm), or Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC (5 mm) for caspase-like, chymotrypsin-like, or trypsin-like activity, respectively. The reaction was stopped by adding 252.5 μl of ice-cold ethanol (96%). The proteasomal catalytic activity was determined by measuring the increase of fluorescence from AMC hydrolysis (380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission; Craiu et al. (54Craiu A. Gaczynska M.

Cerebellar neuronal cell cultures were prepared from cerebellum of P7 mice. Isolated cerebella were removed of meninges and cut into 0.5-mm3 pieces. Tissue was dissociated for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.02% trypsin. Trypsinization was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.0016% DNase and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Cells were further dissociated by trituration. After passing through a 70-μm filter to remove debris, the cell suspension was centrifuged at ∼200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then re-suspended in Eagle’s basel medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm glutamine, 25 mm KCl, 10% horse serum. Cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated plates at a density of 1000 cells/mm2. To induce neuronal cell death, cultures on in vitro day 5 were treated by replacing growth media with BME media without horse serum for 6 h. They were then stained with propidium iodide to detect cell death in the culture. In some experiments, 20 μm caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 10 μm necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Alexis Biochemicals) were included in the incubation with media without serum. To study the potential role of FIP200 in the central nervous system, the floxed FIP200 (FIP200f/f) mice, in which exons 4 and 5 of FIP200 gene are flanked by two loxP sequences (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), were crossed with the nestin-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in neural precursors from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) (22Dahlstrand J. Lardelli M. Lendahl U. Brain Res. 1995; 84: 109-129Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 23Frappart P.O. Lee Y. Lamont J. McKinnon P.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Bates B. Rios M. Trumpp A. Chen C. Fan G. Bishop J.M. Jaenisch R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated deletion of exons 4 and 5 leads to a frameshift mutation because of direct splicing from exon 3 (containing ATG codon) to exon 6, producing a small truncated and nonfunctional peptide. In contrast to embryonic lethality of total KO of FIP200 (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio. To evaluate deletion of FIP200 in the mutant mice, lysates were prepared from various regions of the brain of the mutant and control mice and subjected to Western blotting analysis. Fig. 1A shows that FIP200 was efficiently deleted in several regions of the mutant brain, including cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, midbrain, medulla, and cerebellum. Although neural-specific deletion of FIP200 did not lead to embryonic lethality, ∼45% of the mutant mice died shortly after birth within the first few days. The remaining mice also showed significantly reduced survival rate after P14, and all mutant mice died by 60 days (Fig. 1B). The mutant mice showed growth retardation as compared with the control littermates starting from P7. By P21, the average weight and length of the mutant mice reached only ∼50 and 75%, respectively, of the control (i.e. FIP200f/f) mice (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, the mutant mice exhibited deficits in motor coordination starting around P14, which progressed to a more severe extent with tremors and stiff movement. When they are suspended by their tails, the mutant mice showed the hind-limb crosses phenotype, whereas the control mice had the normal extended limbs (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the ataxia phenotype, histological analysis of the cerebella showed a smaller size for the mutant mice compared with the controls (Fig. 1F). The reduced cerebellum size is not a consequence of the smaller body size, because the total size of the brain of the mutant mice was comparable to the controls (Fig. 1G). The foliation and fissuration appeared to be slightly less developed, and the granular cell layer was thinner in the mutant cerebellum compared with the controls. Together, these results suggest that deletion of FIP200 by nestin-Cre led to the development of cerebellar ataxia in mice. To study the cerebellum defects in FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice, histological analyses were performed on cerebella of control and mutant mice at various stages of postnatal development. At P7, the cellular organization of the cerebella were comparable between FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre and control mice, although the external granular layer appeared slightly thinner in the mutant mice (data not shown). At P14 and thereafter, FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice showed a progressive spongiosis in the cerebellar white matter (Fig. 2A, arrows in right panels) as well as a decreased thickness of the molecular layer (Fig. 2B). We also observed a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells, neurons in the molecular layer and granular cells in the mutant mice. At P56, severe spongiosis was also found in the molecular layer of the mutant cerebellum (Fig. 2B, panel f). We next examined cerebellar sections by immunohistochemistry using antibody against calbindin, a marker for Purkinje cells. These analyses revealed loss of Purkinje cells and extensive degeneration of their dendrites in FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice compared with the control mice (Fig. 3A, top panels). Furthermore, calbindin-positive cellular elements (red arrows, Fig. 3A, panel b) were also found in the granular layer of the mutant cerebellum, which could be segments of swollen (degenerating and/or abnormal) Purkinje cell axons traversing the granular layer. Examination of the cerebellar white matter showed extensive axonal degeneration associated with swelling of labeled axons and vacuoles typical of spongiosis in the mutant mice (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Cerebellar sections from FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre and control mice were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibody against myelin basic protein (anti-MBP). Anti-MBP staining appeared equally robust in the white matter of FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre and control mice, suggesting that myelination was not significantly affected by FIP200 deletion (Fig. 3B, panels a and b). Furthermore, similar staining was found for anti-olig2 (marker for oligodendrocytes) in FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre and control mice (data not shown). These data suggest that axonal degeneration of Purkinje cells is unlikely a secondary consequence caused by deficiency of myelination in the mutant mice.FIGURE 3Purkinje cell degeneration and reactive gliosis in cerebellum of FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice. A, cerebellum sections from control (a and c) and FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre (CKO) (b and d) mice at 6 weeks of age were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-calbindin. Note the loss of Purkinje cells in the Purkinje cell layer (b) and degeneration of their axons (d) and dendrites (b) in cerebella from FIP200f/f;nestin-CRE mice compared with control mice. Arrows in panel b mark abnormal staining with anti-calbindin in the granular layer of the mutant mice. Scale bars = 100 μm. B, cerebellum sections from control (a, c, and e) and FIP200f/f;nestin-CRE (b, d, and f) mice at 4 weeks of age were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-MBP (a and b), anti-GFAP (e and f), or by transmission electron microscopy (c and d). Note that the vacuoles are embedded in myelin-sheath (arrows in b and d) of the mutant mice. Scale bars = 100 μm (a, b, e, and f) and 1 μm (c and d), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar to hematoxylin and eosin and calbindin staining of the white matter (see Figs. 2A and 3A), significant spongiosis was also evident by anti-MBP staining. Interestingly, the vacuoles appear to be embedded in the circle of MBP staining (Fig. 3B, arrows in panel b), suggesting these vacuoles may be generated by degeneration of Purkinje cell axons, which occupied the now empty space encircled by myelination. The vacuoles are negative by stainings with Oil red O for lipids or periodic acid-Schiff for polysaccharides (data not shown). Further examination of the cerebellar white matter sections by transmission electron microscopy also showed presence of apparently normal myelination in the mutant mice (Fig. 3B, panels c and d). However, the axon bundles in the mutant mice were more rounded compared with the irregular shape of that in the control mice. Furthermore, some of the axon ensheathments are empty (red arrow in panel d) in the mutant mice. These results provide further evidence of extensive swelling and degeneration of Purkinje cell axons, which may be responsible for the spongiosis observed in the cerebellar white matter of FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice. Consistent with the extensive neural degeneration, immunostaining with antibody against GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) showed significant reactive gliosis in the mutant cerebellum (Fig. 3B, panels e and f). Together, these studies suggested that degeneration of Purkinje cell axons and dendrites as well as reduced Purkinje cells and other cerebellar neurons are likely to be responsible for the loss of normal cerebellum functions in the motor coordination of FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice. To explore potential mechanisms by which deletion of FIP200 leads to neuron loss and cerebellar degeneration, we examined possible increases in apoptosis in the cerebella of the mutant mice. Indeed, our previous studies showed that deletion of FIP200 resulted in increased apoptosis in the developing heart and liver leading to major defects in these organs and embryonic lethality of KO mice (20Gan B. Peng X. Nagy T. Alcaraz A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Analysis of cerebellum sections by TUNEL assays showed apoptosis in both control and FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice during the first 2 weeks of postnatal development as expected (25Wood K.A. Dipasquale B. Youle R.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), but the mutant mice exhibited an increase in apoptosis compared with control mice at these times (Fig. 4A). As expected, the normal developmental apoptosis in control mice reduced to a minimal level concomitant with the completion of postnatal development of the cerebellum at 3 weeks after birth (2Wang V.Y. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 484-491Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Sillitoe R.V. Joyner A.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 549-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 25Wood K.A. Dipasquale B. Youle R.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, significant apoptosis were still evident in the mutant cerebella at 3 weeks and later after birth. These results suggest that inactivation of FIP200 in the neurons could result in increased apoptosis leading to neural degeneration in the mutant cerebellum. Because many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates correlated with progressive loss of neurons due to apoptosis (26Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 27Bossy-Wetzel E. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S2-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), we next examined the potential accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates by staining of cerebellum sections from FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre and control mice with anti-ubiquitin antibody. Although no aggregates were detected in the control cerebellum (Fig. 4B, panels a and c), large ubiquitin-positive aggregates were found in Purkinje cells and white matter in the mutant cerebellum (Fig. 4B, panels b and d, arrows), suggesting that deletion of FIP200 resulted in abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Because impairment of proteasome functions could lead to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates (5Ciechanover A.

The caspase-like, chymotryptic, and tryptic activities of the 20 S proteasomes were measured with Ac-GPLD-AMC (and Z-LLE-AMC), Suc-LLVY-AMC, and Ac-RLR-AMC (and Boc-LRR-AMC) peptides, respectively, as substrates. We found that both the caspase-like and chymotryptic activities were slightly elevated in the cerebella of FIP200f/f;nestin-Cre mice compared with that from control mice at P14 (Fig. 4C) and P28 (data not shown). The tryptic activity was comparable for the mutant and control mice. The increased caspase-like and chymotryptic activities could be due to some feedback mechanism for the cells to attempt to degrade the excess accumulation of the ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Therefore, the abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates was unlikely a consequence of decreased proteasome activity in the cerebellum upon deletion of FIP200. Recent studies have shown that basal autophagy is another important mechanism to remove abnormal protein aggregates (28Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1999418860,"Lrp4 is a multifunctional member of the low density lipoprotein-receptor gene family and a modulator of extracellular cell signaling pathways in development. For example, Lrp4 binds Wise, a secreted Wnt modulator and BMP antagonist. Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin is a potent osteocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 and Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin is thought to be mediated mainly by inhibition of Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteoblasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent soluble Wnt inhibitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself regulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral density a significant modifier locus was detected near the SOST gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the LRP4 gene were suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here we show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts and binds Dkk1 and sclerostin in vitro. MicroCT analysis of Lrp4 deficient mutant mice revealed shortened total femur length, reduced cortical femoral perimeter, and reduced total femur bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). Lumbar spine trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV) was significantly reduced in the mutants and the serum and urinary bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and desoxypyridinoline were increased. We conclude that Lrp4 is a novel osteoblast expressed Dkk1 and sclerostin receptor with a physiological role in the regulation of bone growth and turnover, which is likely mediated through its function as an integrator of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways."

No function is known for the much less common 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp), although genetic defects inhibiting its formation cause recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. To help understand the pathogenesis, we used mass spectrometry to identify the sites and local sequence motifs of 3Hyp residues in fibril-forming collagens from normal human and bovine tissues. The results confirm a single, essentially fully occupied 3Hyp site (A1) at Pro986 in A-clade chains α1(I), α1(II), and α2(V). Two partially modified sites (A2 and A3) were found at Pro944 in α1(II) and α2(V) and Pro707 in α2(I) and α2(V), which differed from A1 in sequence motif. Significantly, the distance between sites 2 and 3, 237 residues, is close to the collagen D-period (234 residues). A search for additional D-periodic 3Hyp sites revealed a fourth site (A4) at Pro470 in α2(V), 237 residues N-terminal to site 3. In contrast, human and bovine type III collagen contained no 3Hyp at any site, despite a candidate proline residue and recognizable A1 sequence motif. A conserved histidine in mammalian α1(III) at A1 may have prevented 3-hydroxylation because this site in chicken type III was fully hydroxylated, and tyrosine replaced histidine. All three B-clade type V/XI collagen chains revealed the same three sites of 3Hyp but at different loci and sequence contexts from those in A-clade collagen chains. Two of these B-clade sites were spaced apart by 231 residues.

Collagens are the most abundant and ubiquitous proteins in multi-cellular animals. It is well established that 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp) 2The abbreviations used are: 4Hyp4-hydroxyproline3Hyp3-hydroxyprolineP3Hprolyl 3-hydroxylaseOIosteogenesis imperfectaHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSLCliquid chromatography. residues stabilize the collagen triple helix through water-bridged intramolecular hydrogen bonding (1Berg R.A.

However, the function of the much less abundant 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp), although discovered 50 years ago, is unknown (2Ogle J.D. Arlinghaus R.B. Logan M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3667-3673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only 1–2 residues of 3Hyp occur per chain in collagen types I and II and 3–6 residues occur per chain in collagen types V and XI. The content is highest in type IV collagens of basement membranes in which 10% of the total hydroxyproline can be 3Hyp (3Gryder R.M. Lamon M. Adams E. J. Biol.

Specific prolyl 3-hydroxylases (P3Hs) are responsible for 3Hyp synthesis.

The α1(I) chain has only one established 3Hyp site at Pro986 in a motif conserved across vertebrate species (human GLPGPIGPPGPR) a close variant of which also occurs in type II collagen (human GIPGPIGPPGPR). Renewed interest in 3Hyp was recently sparked by the discovery that a recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in CRTAP. This gene encodes a protein (cartilage-associated protein) that is bound to P3H1 and cyclophilin B in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for prolyl 3-hydroxylation at the Pro986 site in collagen α1(I) and α1(II) chains (6Morello R.

A key question is whether the brittle bone phenotype in OI is caused by the absence of 3Hyp in bone matrix collagen or an intracellular assembly and transport defect caused by the malfunctioning enzyme complex or both. Because little is known about the distribution of 3Hyp in normal fibril-forming collagens beyond the single Pro986 site in α1(I) and α1(II) chains, we used protein mass spectrometry to locate further sites in all A-clade and B-clade gene products used in vertebrate collagen fibril formation. Collagen type I fibrils are assembled on a filamentous template of collagen type V, and collagen type II fibrils are assembled on a template of collagen type XI (10Wu J.J. Weis M.A. Kim L.S.

To provide a basis for understanding the overall post-translational effects of mutations in CRTAP, LEPRE1 (encodes P3H1), and other genes involved in collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylation, it is important to identify all of the sites of prolyl-3-hydroxylation in normal collagens from human and other vertebrate tissues. Our results reveal several partially hydroxylated sites of 3Hyp in the various fibrillar collagen chains, in addition to the usually fully hydroxylated primary site at Pro986 in α1(I), α1(II), and α2(V). All of the additional sites lack the distinctive sequence motif of Pro986 but share common features with known 3Hyp-containing sequences in type IV collagen. One important finding is the D-periodic spacing between sites A2 and A3 and between sites A3 (α2(I) and α2(V)) and A4 (α2(V)) of A-clade chains (α1(II), α2(V), and α2(I)) and between sites B2 and B3 of B-clade chains (α1(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI)). In contrast, mammalian type III collagen lacks any 3Hyp despite having a recognizable primary site motif at Pro986. From the conserved sites, sequence motifs, and spacing of 3Hyp sites along the collagen chains, we speculate a role for 3Hyp in mediating inter-triple-helical interactions and in aiding the supramolecular assembly of collagen. Adult human bone, cartilage, and meniscus (20–40 years old) were purchased from the Northwest Tissue Center (Seattle, WA). Fetal human bone and cartilage were obtained from the Birth Defects Research Laboratory of the University of Washington with Internal Review Board (IRB) approval. Human intervertebral disc tissue was obtained from normally discarded surgical tissue with patient-informed consent and IRB approval. Chicken skin (12–14 weeks old) was dissected from chicken wings purchased at a local supermarket. Bovine vitreous was dissected from adult steer eyes (18 months old) obtained from a local abattoir. Types I and V collagens were prepared from adult and fetal human bone. Powdered bone was defatted at 4 °C in methanol/chloroform (1/3 v/v) and demineralized at 4 °C in 0.5 m EDTA, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Type III collagen was prepared from defatted chicken skin and adult human meniscus. Type II collagen was prepared from human adult articular cartilage, fetal epiphyseal cartilage, and adult nucleus pulposus, and bovine meniscus and vitreous (18 months old). Type XI collagen was prepared from fetal human articular cartilage. Proteoglycans were removed from cartilaginous tissues with 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors (5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 24 h at 4 °C, and the residue was washed thoroughly. Collagens from all of the tissues were solubilized with pepsin (1:20 w/w, pepsin/dry tissue) in 3% acetic acid for 24 h at 4 °C (11Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Serial precipitations of solubilized bone collagen with 0.7 and 1.8 m NaCl separated types I and V collagens, respectively. Serial precipitations of solubilized articular cartilage, nucleus pulposus, and vitreous collagens with 0.8 and 1.2 m NaCl separated type II and type XI collagens, respectively. Skin type III collagen was precipitated at 0.8 m NaCl. Meniscus collagens were serially precipitated with 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2 m NaCl to separate types I/III, type II, and types V/XI, respectively. Collagen type II is a minor component of the meniscus and is highly modified post-translationally, causing it to precipitate at 0.9 m NaCl, separated from the bulk type I collagen (12Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Portions of demineralized bone and guanidine HCl-extracted cartilage residue were digested with CNBr in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 24 h (13Eyre D.R. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the resulting CB peptides were freeze-dried. For microsequence analysis, α1(II) CB9,7 was prepared from bovine nucleus pulposus and digested with trypsin, and individual peptides were resolved by reverse phase HPLC. The method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) was used with 6% gels for pepsinized collagen and 12.5% gels for CNBr peptides. N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out by Edman chemistry on a Portion 2090E machine equipped with on-line HPLC analysis of cleaved phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Collagen α-chains or CB peptide bands were cut from SDS-PAGE gels (15Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion (16Hanna S.L. Sherman N.E. Kinter M.T. Goldberg J.B.

Electrospray MS was performed on the tryptic peptides using an LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with in-line liquid chromatography (LC) (ThermoFinnigan) using a C8 capillary column (300 μm × 150 mm; Grace Vydac 208MS5.315) eluted at 4.5 μl/min. The LC mobile phase consisted of Buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) and Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3:1 acetonitrile:n-propanol, v/v). An electrospray ionization source introduced the LC sample stream into the mass spectrometer with a spray voltage of 3 kV. The machine is normally run in triple play mode with ion exclusion turned on, meaning it will do a full scan and then a zoom scan and MS/MS of the most abundant ion several times and then switch to the next most abundant ion. The machine can also be made to target specific low abundance ions by narrowing the selecting mass range. Sequest search software (ThermoFinnigan) was used for peptide identification using the NCBI protein data base. Many large collagenous peptides were not found by Sequest and had to be identified manually by calculating the possible MS/MS ions and matching these to the actual MS/MS. Hydroxyl differences were searched for manually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutes so that all the post-translational variations of a given peptide appear together in the full scan. Peptides from the known fully occupied site of 3Hyp at Pro986 in α1(I), α1(II), and α2(V) revealed close to 100% hydroxylation by tryptic peptide mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). Early studies had established by Edman sequencing that this proline residue in α1(I) was 3Hyp (18Fietzek P.P. Rexrodt F.W. Wendt P. Stark M. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, tryptic peptides prepared from individual CB peptides and whole α-chains on in-gel trypsin digestion were surveyed for mass variants (+16 Da) indicating 3Hyp at other GPP sites. From α1(II), a second partially hydroxylated site was identified at Pro944 in CB peptide, CB9,7, from human and bovine articular cartilage (Fig. 2; results for bovine shown). Table 1 lists fragment y and b ions used to interpret the MS/MS spectra from Fig. 2. This will serve also as a guide in interpreting the results presented in all the spectra presented in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 (see also FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). We will refer to this site and subsequent sites as A2, A3, etc., with A1 as the primary site. No other sites were found in α1(II) by close inspection of all identifiable peptides containing candidate -GPP- sequences in the various CB peptides or whole α-chains. The partial hydroxylation of Pro944 from bovine articular α1(II) prompted a survey of other tissue sources of type II collagen. Consistent species- and tissue-dependent variations at this site were revealed. These analytical results are summarized in Fig. 2. The degree of Pro944 3-hydroxylation estimated from the mass ratios (and site of the +16 addition established by MS/MS fragmentation profile) ranged consistently from more than 80% in bovine vitreous type II collagen to less than 20% in bovine articular type II collagen. The small pool of type II collagen from fibrocartilaginous meniscus (3–6% of total collagen; Ref. 12Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was highly 3-hydroxylated (66%) at Pro944. Similarly, nucleus pulposus type II collagen (results for human shown in Fig. 2, but also bovine) was also heavily hydroxylated (∼40%) at Pro944 (Fig. 2; see also Fig. 8). The Pro944 site in human α2(V) from bone was 60% 3-hydroxylated (mass spectrometry results not shown).TABLE 1Guide to interpretation of mass spectrometric peptide sequencing (data from Fig. 2)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)* Threonine often shows a neutral water loss upon ms/ms fragmentation.

Ions in bold carry the extra hydroxyl (16Da). We know that 4Hyp occurs only in the Y position of the (GXY)n repeat of collagens, so hydroxylated proline at X is strong evidence in itself for 3Hyp. To rule out 4Hyp (because mass spectrometric results alone cannot distinguish 3Hyp from 4Hyp), Edman microsequencing was applied to the isolated tryptic peptide containing hydroxylated site A2 from bovine α1(II). The results are shown in Fig. 3 for the fully 3-hydroxylated peptide isolated from calf nucleus pulposus α1(II). At cycle 11, the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative reverse phase HPLC profile is similar to that reported as characteristic of 3Hyp phenylthiohydantoin degradation products (19Schuppan D. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and quite distinct from that given by 4Hyp (see cycle 12). Manual evaluation of the mass spectra of all tryptic peptides from the α2(I) chain of bone type I collagen (Fig. 4) revealed a third site of 3Hyp at Pro707 (site A3). (No candidate -GPP- or sequence motif was recognizable where site A1 or A2 would be in α2(I) of human or other vertebrate species we examined (Ensemble entry: ENSG00000164692).) Residue Pro707 was 80% hydroxylated in human α2(I) (similar in bovine). Screening human α2(V) similarly, the Pro707 locus was also hydroxylated to a similar extent. Thus in α2(V) all three sites, A1, A2, and A3, was heavily hydroxylated. The near D-periodic spacing between Pro707 and Pro944 (237 residues versus D = 234) (20Doyle B.B. Hulmes D.J. Miller A. Parry D.A. Piez K.A. Woodhead-Galloway J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1974; 187: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) prompted us to search by tandem mass spectrometry for any further 3Hyp site spaced by one or two D-periods more N-terminal. Fig. 5 shows the results of analysis of a tryptic peptide containing a candidate proline at Pro470 (site A4) from α2(V) of bone. The residue was indeed partially hydroxylated as confirmed by MS/MS fragment analysis of the 3Hyp and Pro versions of the peptide. Additional analyses showed evidence of variable levels of 3-hydroxylation of a proline in the equivalent tryptic peptide from the α1(I) chain, but only from cell culture so the biological significance for α1(I) at present is unclear (results not shown). The protein sequence of human and other mammalian type III collagens (Ensemble entry: ENSG0000168542) shows a recognizable motif and GPP at the primary site Pro986. Mass spectrometry, however, showed peptides of the mass of the proline form but none for the 3Hyp form from bovine and human collagen III prepared from skin, aorta, and other tissues (Fig. 6 shows results from human meniscus α1(III)). In comparing the genomic data base (Ensemble) for all available COL3A1 sequences, all had GHx in place of GLP or GIP the triplet before GPIGPP, predicting a lack of substrate recognition by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (see Fig. 6 for sample sequences). On inspecting a broader range of vertebrate COL3A1 sequences, chicken stood out with GYP not GHP (Fig. 6). To see whether this enabled 3Hyp formation in the neighboring GPP in vivo, collagen III was purified from chicken skin and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 6, the candidate tryptic peptide from chicken α1(III) was 100% hydroxylated at the homologous locus Pro989. It appears, therefore, that a hydrophic residue is required at residue 980 (Ile, Leu, or Tyr) or at least not a histidine, for the P3H complex to recognize the proline as a substrate. Collagen type V and collagen type XI prepared from human bone and articular cartilage, respectively, were similarly analyzed. Manual inspection of the tryptic peptide profiles produced by LC-MS unequivocally revealed three sites of 3Hyp at Pro434, Pro665, and Pro692 (Fig. 7) that we refer to here as sites B3, B2, and B1 (consistent with the right to left order used along clade A chains). Sites B1 and B2 are in the same tryptic peptide 27 residues apart (Fig. 7). The results are shown only for α1(V). The MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the 3+ parent ions established the specific locations of the added hydroxyl groups (+16). The α1(XI) and α2(XI) equivalent peptides from a cartilage type XI collagen preparation showed a similar degree of hydroxylation at these two sites. In Fig. 6B, site B3 (Pro434) mass spectral results are shown for α1(XI) from cartilage, but again α1(V) and α2(XI) gave very similar levels of 3-hydroxylation at this site. Fig. 8 summarizes the molecular locations and local sequence motifs for all of the 3Hyp sites identified in the α1(I), α2(I), α1(II), α1(III), α1(V), α2(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) chains. It is possible that other GPP sites may be 3-hydroxylated, particularly in the type V/XI collagen B-clade chains, because not all GPP-containing sequences gave informative tryptic peptides. But the early literature reporting amino acid compositions of isolated chains and derived cyanogen bromide peptides is consistent with one residue/chain at the single site in α1(I) and α2(I) (21Piez K.A.

Also the underlined proline in the GP#P*GPP* sequence (where P# indicates 3Hyp and P* indicates 4Hyp) at site B3 (Fig. 8) showed significant hydroxylation (≤50%) on analysis of the α1(V) chain prepared from bovine meniscus but not from bone (data not shown). Notably from meniscus, the α1(II) chain consistently was more hydroxylated than α1(II) from articular cartilage at site A2 (Fig. 8). Our findings establish several sites of prolyl 3-hydroxylation not previously identified in fibril-forming collagens. Most of the data on 3Hyp in collagen in the literature were gathered from amino acid analyses as the different chain types were discovered and their cyanogen bromide-derived peptides were characterized (21Piez K.A.

The present results are consistent with these original quantitative measurements, which showed, for example, one residue of 3Hyp per α1(I) and α2(I) chain of type I collagen (22Butler W.T. Piez K.A. Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3771-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Click E.M. Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4699-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The primary site (site A1) in the α1(I) chain at Pro986 was originally established from Edman sequencing of tryptic peptides from calf skin α1(I) CB6 (18Fietzek P.P. Rexrodt F.W. Wendt P. Stark M. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The single 3Hyp residue in α2(I) was found in the C-terminal third (α2(I)CB5) of the chain (23Click E.M. Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4699-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but its exact sequence context to our knowledge has not been established. We show here that its location at α2(I) Pro707 (site A3) is near the N terminus of CB5, and its sequence motif is unlike that of the A1 site in α1(I). The α2(I) sequence has no recognizable A1 proline site. The α1(II) chain as shown here and previously has an A1 site that is almost fully 3-hydroxylated in cartilage tissue (6Morello R. Bertin T.K. Chen Y. Hicks J. Tonachini L. Monticone M. Castagnola P. Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Vranka J. Bächinger H.P. Pace J.M. Schwarze U. Byers P.H. Weis M. Fernandes R.J. Eyre D.R. Yao Z. Boyce B.F. Lee B. Cell. 2006; 127: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The lack of any 3-hydroxylation of the A1 site motif at Pro992 in α1(III) (Fig. 6), despite a candidate proline, is consistent with an earlier reported absence of 3Hyp from human and bovine type III collagen based on amino acid composition and Edman sequencing analyses (25Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2621-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The fully hydroxylated Pro986 primary site in chicken α1(III) but not in mammals (Fig. 6) most probably reflects the lack of a recognizable substrate sequence. This appears to be an evolutionary loss in mammals. Inspecting the COL3A1 sequences of the zebra finch, the only other bird in the genomic data base (Ensemble entry: ENSTGVG00000010995); the anole lizard, a reptile (Ensemble entry: ENSACAG00000015062); and Xenopus tropicalis, an amphibian (Ensemble entry: ENSXETG00000010783), all show the same GTSGYPGPIGPPGPR at site 1, which predictably from chicken versus mammal sequences in Fig. 6 means that their Pro986 site in tissue type III collagen will be 3-hydroxylated. A key question, therefore, is whether the lack of 3Hyp in type III collagen of mammals has any consequences in terms of the functional behavior of type III collagen in mammalian extracellular matrices. Collagen III does not form thick fibrils in its own right but occurs copolymerized on the surface of type I collagen fibrils in skin and other tissues (28Fleischmajer R. MacDonald E.D. Perlish J.S. Burgeson R.E. Fisher L.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 105: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and on type II collagen fibrils in mature articular cartilage (29Young R.D. Lawrence P.A. Duance V.C. Aigner T. Monaghan P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Eyre D.R. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. Eur. Cell. Mater. 2006; 12: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The main roles for type III collagen appear to be in wound healing, matrix repair, and tissue development and as a structural component of mechanically pliable “soft” tissues, such as arterial walls. It always coexists, it seems, as a component of fibrils formed from more abundant type I and/or type II collagens, at least in mammals. Whether collagen III can function in a more independent fibrillar role in species in which its A1 site can be 3-hydroxylated is an interesting question. For example, perhaps it could polymerize independently on a template of collagen V/XI as do types I and II fibrils (10Wu J.J. Weis M.A. Kim L.S. Carter B.G. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5539-5545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The A1 sequence motif is evident in α1(I), α1(II), α1(III), and α2(V), al"
https://openalex.org/W2154847799,"Physical exercise has been shown to increase adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and enhances synaptic plasticity. The antiapoptotic kinase, Akt has also been shown to be phosphorylated following voluntary exercise; however, it remains unknown whether the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in exercise-induced neurogenesis and the associated facilitation of synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus.To gain insight into the potential role of this signaling pathway in exercise-induced neurogenesis and LTP in the dentate gyrus rats were infused with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 or vehicle control solution (icv) via osmotic minipumps and exercised in a running wheel for 10 days. Newborn cells in the dentate gyrus were date-labelled with BrdU on the last 3 days of exercise. Then, they were either returned to the home cage for 2 weeks to assess exercise-induced LTP and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, or were killed on the last day of exercise to assess proliferation and activation of the PI3K-Akt cascade using western blotting.Exercise increases cell proliferation and promotes survival of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. Immediately after exercise, we found that Akt and three downstream targets, BAD, GSK3beta and FOXO1 were activated. LY294002 blocked exercise-induced phosphorylation of Akt and downstream target proteins. This had no effect on exercise-induced cell proliferation, but it abolished most of the beneficial effect of exercise on the survival of newly generated dentate gyrus neurons and prevented exercise-induced increase in dentate gyrus LTP. These results suggest that activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt signaling pathway plays a significant role via an antiapoptotic function in promoting survival of newly formed granule cells generated during exercise and the associated increase in synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus."

IntroductionA multitude of extracellular stimuli mediate their cellular effects through the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Central to this ubiquitous signal transduction pathway is the production of calcium-mobilizing messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3), 3The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol trisphosphatecADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateTPCtwo-pore channelGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHEKhuman embryonic kidneyUTRuntranslated regionSpS. purpuratus. cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), and NAADP (1Berridge M.J.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of calcium release by IP3 and cADPR is established (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar); both release calcium from endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores through activation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors, respectively. In contrast, although NAADP has been shown to mobilize calcium in a multitude of cell types from plants to humans and to regulate a variety of calcium-dependent processes from fertilization to neuronal growth, molecular details of this pathway are lacking (3Guse A.H. Lee H.C. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).The calcium-mobilizing properties of NAADP were first described in eggs of the sea urchin (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and this model organism has provided key insight into the mode of action of NAADP (5Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In eggs, it is clear, based on cross desensitization studies (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), lack of feedback regulation by cytosolic calcium (6Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), molecular size (7Berridge G. Dickinson G. Parrington J. Galione A. Patel S. J. Biol.

J. 2006; 397: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), that NAADP activates calcium-permeable channels unrelated to IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Moreover, NAADP is highly unusual in releasing calcium not from the endoplasmic reticulum but from acidic lysosome-like calcium stores (9Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Much supporting evidence has been obtained in mammalian cells (10Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33693-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and recent studies in smooth muscle cells suggest that NAADP mobilizes calcium through activation of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 (11Zhang F.

Med. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar), although these findings have yet to be independently verified. Other studies, however, indicate that NAADP does not mobilize calcium from acidic calcium stores but instead stimulates calcium influx (13Lim D. Kyozuka K. Gragnaniello G. Carafoli E. Santella L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), possibly through TRPM2 (14Beck A. Kolisek M. Bagley L.A. Fleig A. Penner R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or mobilizes endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores via direct activation of the ryanodine receptor (15Gerasimenko J.V.

Biol. 2009; 19: R521-R523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In three recent independent studies, direct evidence has been provided that NAADP mobilizes calcium from acidic calcium stores through activation of a previously uncharacterized family of ion channels in animals known as the two-pore channels (TPCs) (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J.

Comparative genomic analysis indicates the presence of up to three family members (TPC1–3) in the animal kingdom (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R.

Human and mouse TPC1 and TPC2 were shown to localize to endosomes and lysosomes and to potentiate NAADP responses when overexpressed (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C.

Pflugers Arch. 2009; 458: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Additionally, in a human cancer cell line, silencing of TPC1 or overexpression of TPC1 mutated within a pore region was shown to inhibit endogenous NAADP responses (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Endogenous NAADP responses in mouse pancreatic beta cells were also abolished in mice lacking the TPC2 gene (19Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X. Tang J. Rietdorf K. Teboul L. Chuang K.T. Lin P. Xiao R. Wang C. Zhu Y. Lin Y. Wyatt C.N. Parrington J. Ma J. Evans A.M. Galione A. Zhu M.X. Nature. 2009; 459: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that TPC1 and TPC2 are novel endolysosomal ion channels targeted by NAADP. Research into animal TPCs is only in its infancy, and at present, little is known concerning the properties of TPC3.Here, we define an ancestral, three-member TPC gene family in deuterostomes and provide the first evidence of a TPC3 pseudogene in primates. We report the molecular cloning of all three TPC isoforms from the sea urchin, a model system for the study of calcium-signaling pathways, and show that they target to acidic vesicles and support calcium release by NAADP from acidic calcium stores.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs reported recently, the TPC gene underwent expansion early in animal evolution (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the TPC gene complement of several deuterostomes for which complete genomes are available. Deuterostomes are animals in which the blastopore of the embryo forms the anus. Three TPC genes are found in sea urchins (a basal deuterostome) and in most other animals representative of the major clades within the deuterostome lineage. In mammals, however, the TPC3 gene is apparently lacking in humans and other primates and also in rats and mice (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, other closely related placental mammals such as cows, dogs, and horses possess the full TPC gene complement (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that loss of TPC3 in mammals is an unusually rare, relatively recent event likely beginning after the split of Euarchontoglires from Laurasiatheria, its diverse sister group. In cows, the TPC3 gene is flanked by NPHP1 and BUB1 (Fig. 1B). This arrangement is conserved in dogs, horses, chickens, and frogs (data not shown). Based on this synteny, we inspected the corresponding genomic sequence in humans for TPC3-related sequences. We found sequences that showed significant sequence identity to the N terminus of TPC3 (supplemental Fig. S1). Similar results were obtained in monkeys and chimpanzees (supplemental Fig. S1). Intriguingly, we noted the presence of conserved nucleotide deletions in primate sequences, the first of which introduces a downstream stop codon that would result in the generation of a truncated protein that is unlikely to function as a channel (supplemental Fig. S1, circle). Fig. 1C shows an alignment of the cow TPC3 amino acid sequence and those deduced from primate TPC3 genomic sequences following manual editing to preserve the reading frame. This analysis reveals marked sequence similarity at the protein level. These data provide syntenic and genomic evidence that the TPC3 gene has degenerated into a pseudogene in humans and other primates as proposed for the monkey (19Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X. Tang J. Rietdorf K. Teboul L. Chuang K.T. Lin P. Xiao R. Wang C. Zhu Y. Lin Y. Wyatt C.N. Parrington J. Ma J. Evans A.M. Galione A. Zhu M.X. Nature. 2009; 459: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), indicating loss of functions associated with this isoform in these animals. TPC3, together with TRPC2 (21Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), represent the only known calcium-permeable channels in mammals for which pseudogenes have been described.TPC1 and TPC2 have recently emerged as credible candidates for the elusive NAADP-sensitive calcium channel in mammals (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J.

Rötzer K. Griesbeck O. Harz H. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C. Pflugers Arch. 2009; 458: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To gain insight in to the ancestral TPC family, we determined the nucleotide sequences of TPCs from the purple sea urchin, which possesses the full TPC complement and in which the effects of NAADP have been extensively characterized (5Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that transcripts for sea urchin TPC1 (SpTPC1) and TPC2 (SpTPC2) are readily detectable in eggs, whereas those for TPC3 (SpTPC3) are more abundant in embryos (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The coding sequences were therefore amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using either egg or embryo cDNA as appropriate. The predicted molecular masses of SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 were 101 and 92 kDa, respectively. The corresponding value for SpTPC3 (98 kDa) was similar. A multiple sequence alignment of sea urchin and human TPCs is presented in supplemental Fig. S2. Overall similarity was 30–40%, which is substantially lower than that between members of the IP3 and ryanodine receptor family of intracellular calcium channels (∼70%). Notably, sequence similarity between sea urchin TPCs was particularly high in the two putative pores (supplemental Fig. S2, red). These data provide a comprehensive molecular description of the TPC family in this model organism.To define the properties of sea urchin TPCs, we determined their subcellular location. Fig. 2A shows the distribution of GFP-tagged SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both isoforms showed a punctate intracellular distribution in the oocyte periphery, localizing to a heterogeneous population of vesicular structures. A punctuate distribution was also observed in SKBR3 cells and HEK cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Co-labeling of cells with the fluorescent weak base LysoTracker Red revealed marked co-localization (Fig. 2B), indicating that SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 target to acidic vesicles, probably endosomes and lysosomes, as reported for mammalian TPCs (18Brailoiu E.

Indeed, both urchin isoforms co-localized with human TPC1 and TPC2 when co-expressed (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, SpTPC2 co-localized with the late endosome/lysosome marker, LAMP-1 (data not shown). We also determined the subcellular location of SpTPC3. As with SpTPC1 and SpTPC2, SpTPC3 showed a punctate intracellular distribution, which overlapped with that of LysoTracker Red (Fig. 2B). SpTPCs therefore appear to localize to acidic organelles.FIGURE 2Sea urchin TPCs localize to acidic organelles.

As reported previously (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X. Schrlau M.G. Brailoiu G.C. Gao X. Hooper R. Boulware M.J. Dun N.J. Marchant J.S. Patel S. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), microinjection of 10 nm NAADP (pipette concentration) had little effect on cytosolic calcium levels in mock-transfected cells but induced robust responses in cells overexpressing human TPC1 (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with human TPC2 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, enhanced responses to NAADP were also observed in cells overexpressing SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 (Fig. 3, A and B). These data are entirely consistent with the notion that these proteins are NAADP-sensitive calcium-permeable channels. The effects of NAADP in cells overexpressing sea urchin TPCs were abolished by pretreating cells with the V-type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). This compound collapses the pH gradient across acidic organelles and is thereby thought to compromise calcium uptake (9Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These results, together with our localization data (Fig. 2), are consistent with SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 mediating calcium release from an acidic calcium store. Finally, we examined the effects of overexpressing SpTPC3, the functional properties of which are completely unexplored. Again, as with SpTPC1 and SpTPC2, cytosolic calcium responses to NAADP were markedly potentiated in cells overexpressing SpTPC3 in the absence but not the presence of bafilomycin (Fig. 3C). The magnitudes of the NAADP-mediated calcium signals in cells expressing SpTPC3, however, were smaller than those in cells overexpressing SpTPC1 and SpTPC2 (Fig. 3, A and B). In stark contrast to the effects of NAADP, responses to a submaximal cADPR concentration were unaffected by overexpressing any of the sea urchin TPCs (Fig. 3D), thereby highlighting specificity. All members of the TPC family are thus likely NAADP-sensitive calcium-permeable channels.FIGURE 3Sea urchin TPCs mediate NAADP-dependent calcium release from acidic calcium stores. A–D, cytosolic calcium responses of individual fura-2-loaded SKBR3 cells microinjected with either 10 nm NAADP (A–C) or 50 nm cADPR (D). Cells were from mock-transfected cultures (MOCK) or cultures expressing the indicated GFP-tagged TPC construct from sea urchin (SpTPC1–3) or human (HsTPC1–2).

We find evidence that the TPC3 gene, which although widely present in deuterostomes, is a pseudogene in humans and other primates, indicative of functional divergence within closely related mammals. We define the molecular nature of the ancestral TPC family in a key model organism and demonstrate that all isoforms localize to acidic organelles and that their overexpression enhances NAADP-mediated calcium release in a bafilomycin-sensitive manner. Our data provide further mechanistic evidence supporting the concept that NAADP releases calcium from acidic organelles via TPCs. IntroductionA multitude of extracellular stimuli mediate their cellular effects through the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). Central to this ubiquitous signal transduction pathway is the production of calcium-mobilizing messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3), 3The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol trisphosphatecADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateTPCtwo-pore channelGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHEKhuman embryonic kidneyUTRuntranslated regionSpS. purpuratus. cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), and NAADP (1Berridge M.J.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of calcium release by IP3 and cADPR is established (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, 2Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar); both release calcium from endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores through activation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors, respectively. In contrast, although NAADP has been shown to mobilize calcium in a multitude of cell types from plants to humans and to regulate a variety of calcium-dependent processes from fertilization to neuronal growth, molecular details of this pathway are lacking (3Guse A.H. Lee H.C. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: re10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).The calcium-mobilizing properties of NAADP were first described in eggs of the sea urchin (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and this model organism has provided key insight into the mode of action of NAADP (5Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In eggs, it is clear, based on cross desensitization studies (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), lack of feedback regulation by cytosolic calcium (6Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), molecular size (7Berridge G. Dickinson G. Parrington J. Galione A. Patel S. J. Biol.

J. 2006; 397: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), that NAADP activates calcium-permeable channels unrelated to IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Moreover, NAADP is highly unusual in releasing calcium not from the endoplasmic reticulum but from acidic lysosome-like calcium stores (9Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Much supporting evidence has been obtained in mammalian cells (10Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33693-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and recent studies in smooth muscle cells suggest that NAADP mobilizes calcium through activation of the lysosomal ion channel TRPML1 (11Zhang F.

Med. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar), although these findings have yet to be independently verified. Other studies, however, indicate that NAADP does not mobilize calcium from acidic calcium stores but instead stimulates calcium influx (13Lim D. Kyozuka K. Gragnaniello G. Carafoli E. Santella L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), possibly through TRPM2 (14Beck A. Kolisek M. Bagley L.A. Fleig A. Penner R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or mobilizes endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores via direct activation of the ryanodine receptor (15Gerasimenko J.V.

Biol. 2009; 19: R521-R523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In three recent independent studies, direct evidence has been provided that NAADP mobilizes calcium from acidic calcium stores through activation of a previously uncharacterized family of ion channels in animals known as the two-pore channels (TPCs) (18Brailoiu E.

Additionally, in a human cancer cell line, silencing of TPC1 or overexpression of TPC1 mutated within a pore region was shown to inhibit endogenous NAADP responses (18Brailoiu E. Churamani D. Cai X.

Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that TPC1 and TPC2 are novel endolysosomal ion channels targeted by NAADP. Research into animal TPCs is only in its infancy, and at present, little is known concerning the properties of TPC3.Here, we define an ancestral, three-member TPC gene family in deuterostomes and provide the first evidence of a TPC3 pseudogene in primates. We report the molecular cloning of all three TPC isoforms from the sea urchin, a model system for the study of calcium-signaling pathways, and show that they target to acidic vesicles and support calcium release by NAADP from acidic calcium stores."

Defects in human alpha-GAL lead to the development of Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the buildup of alpha-galactosylated substrates in the tissues. alpha-GAL is an active target of clinical research: there are currently two treatment options for Fabry disease, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (approved in the United States in 2003) and pharmacological chaperone therapy (currently in clinical trials). Previously, we have reported the structure of human alpha-GAL, which revealed the overall structure of the enzyme and established the locations of hundreds of mutations that lead to the development of Fabry disease. Here, we describe the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme derived from x-ray crystal structures of each of the four stages of the double displacement reaction mechanism. Use of a difluoro-alpha-galactopyranoside allowed trapping of a covalent intermediate. The ensemble of structures reveals distortion of the ligand into a (1)S(3) skew (or twist) boat conformation in the middle of the reaction cycle. The high resolution structures of each step in the catalytic cycle will allow for improved drug design efforts on alpha-GAL and other glycoside hydrolase family 27 enzymes by developing ligands that specifically target different states of the catalytic cycle.

https://openalex.org/W1981347990,"The bulk alignment of actin filament sliding movement, powered by randomly oriented myosin molecules, has been observed and studied using an in vitro motility assay. The well established, actin filament gliding assay is a minimal experimental system for studying actomyosin motility. Here, we show that when the assay is performed at densities of actin filaments approaching those found in living cells, filament gliding takes up a preferred orientation. The oriented patterns of movement that we have observed extend over a length scale of 10-100 microm, similar to the size of a mammalian cell. We studied the process of filament alignment and found that it depends critically upon filament length and density. We developed a simple quantitative measure of filament sliding orientation and this enabled us to follow the time course of alignment and the formation and disappearance of oriented domains. Domains of oriented filaments formed spontaneously and were separated by distinct boundaries. The pattern of the domain structures changed on the time scale of several seconds and the collision of neighboring domains led to emergence of new patterns. Our results indicate that actin filament crowding may play an important role in structuring the leading edge of migrating cells. Filament alignment due to near-neighbor mechanical interactions can propagate over a length scale of several microns; much greater than the size of individual filaments and analogous to a log drive. Self-alignment of actin filaments may make an important contribution to cell polarity and provide a mechanism by which cell migration direction responds to chemical cues."

Mutations in XPB, XPD, TTD-A, and XPG (all associated with TFIIH) can cause Cockayne syndrome, combined XP/Cockayne syndrome, or trichothiodystrophy, characterized by severe developmental defects and neurodegeneration, due to the additional role of these gene products in transcription (18Lehmann A.R.

Mice completely deficient in ERCC1-XPF also age rapidly and have a dramatically reduced life span (21McWhir J. Selfridge J. Harrison D.J. Squires S. Melton D.W. Nat.

The severe phenotype caused by deficiency of ERCC1-XPF, relative to XP, has been ascribed to the additional role of this NER factor in the repair of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) (19Niedernhofer L.J. Garinis G.A. Raams A. Lalai A.S. Robinson A.R. Appeldoorn E. Odijk H. Oostendorp R. Ahmad A. van Leeuwen W. Theil A.F. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Meinecke P. Kleijer W.J. Vijg J. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2006; 444: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).The recruitment of ERCC1-XPF to various DNA repair pathways is predicted to be mediated through specific protein-protein interactions. The interaction between XPA and ERCC1 is essential for NER involving a region of XPA encompassing three consecutive glycines (residues 72–74) (24Park C.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S. Legerski R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The structural basis for the interaction between XPA and ERCC1 was recently established (27Tsodikov O.V. Ivanov D. Orelli B. Staresincic L. Shoshani I. Oberman R. Schärer O.D. Wagner G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5789-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A short and unstructured peptide of XPA, XPA67–80, including the three aforementioned glycine residues, undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to the central domain of ERCC1 (see Fig. 1). This 14- amino acid stretch of XPA is necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with ERCC1, and the XPA67–80 peptide can inhibit NER activity in vitro (27Tsodikov O.V. Ivanov D. Orelli B. Staresincic L. Shoshani I. Oberman R. Schärer O.D. Wagner G. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4768-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).These findings prompted us to investigate how the XPA-binding region of ERCC1 contributes to NER activity and other DNA repair functions of ERCC1-XPF. Herein, we report mutations in the central domain of ERCC1 that severely impact NER activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, these mutations did not affect the ability of ERCC1-XPF to function in other DNA repair pathways. Our studies suggest that the roles of ERCC1-XPF can be separated by disrupting specific protein interactions that target the endonuclease to different DNA repair pathways.RESULTSA short polypeptide from XPA (residues 67–80) binds in a groove on the central domain of ERCC1 spanning residues 105–160. Mutations that alter the strictly conserved XPA residues Gly-72, Gly-73, Gly-74, or Phe-75 abolish NER activity in vitro (27Tsodikov O.V. Ivanov D. Orelli B. Staresincic L. Shoshani I. Oberman R. Schärer O.D. Wagner G. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4768-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To study the functional role of the XPA-binding groove of ERCC1 in NER and possibly ICL and DSB repair, we set out to design mutations in ERCC1 that would disrupt the interaction with XPA. Inspection of the XPA-binding site suggested that three absolutely conserved residues in ERCC1 might be important for this interaction (supplemental Fig. 1); ERCC1 residue Asn-110 packs against XPA residue Phe-75, ERCC1 Tyr-145 contacts XPA Gly-74, and ERCC1 Tyr-152 contacts XPA residues Gly-73 and Gly-72 (Fig. 1). These ERCC1 residues are located on three different aspects of the pocket that accepts the XPA peptide, and their side chains contribute a substantial portion of the binding surface. ERCC1 residues Asn-110, Tyr-145, and Tyr-152 were mutated to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis, and we additionally generated the double mutants N110A/Y145A and Y145A/Y152A.Mutations in the XPA-binding Domain of ERCC1 Affect NER but Not the Nuclease Activity of ERCC1-XPFThe mutant ERCC1 proteins were co-expressed with wild-type XPF in Sf9 insect cells, and the resulting heterodimers were purified in three chromatographic steps using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, size exclusion, and heparin columns (29Enzlin J.H. Schärer O.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All of the mutant ERCC1 proteins eluted from the size exclusion column as proper heterodimers (supplemental Fig. 2A), indicating that mutations in the XPA-binding domain of ERCC1 did not disrupt the protein fold of ERCC1 or its interaction with XPF. All the proteins were judged to be >95% pure (supplemental Fig. 2B).We first tested the effects of the ERCC1 N110A, Y145A, and Y152A mutations on the ability of ERCC1-XPF to incise DNA. The ERCC1 mutant protein complexes were incubated with a stem-loop DNA substrate in the presence of MnCl2 (34de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the release of a 10-mer oligonucleotide product was detected by denaturing PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A). ERCC1-XPF heterodimers containing mutant or wild-type ERCC1 subunits processed this model DNA substrate with similar efficiencies, cleaving at the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction of the stem loop. These results indicate that mutation of the Asn-110, Tyr-145, and Tyr-152 residues in ERCC1 does not affect the DNA binding and nuclease activities of the ERCC1-XPF heterodimer.FIGURE 2Mutations in the XPA-binding domain of ERCC1 affect NER activity but not nuclease activity in vitro. A, incision of a stem loop substrate by wild-type and mutant ERCC1-XPF. A 5′-32P-labeled stem-loop DNA substrate (6.7 nm) was incubated with 6.7 nm (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) or 26.8 nm (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) ERCC1-XPF in the presence of 0.4 mm MnCl2. B, NER activity of wild-type and mutant ERCC1-XPF. A plasmid containing a site-specific 1,3-intrastrand cisplatin DNA cross-link (50 ng) was incubated with a whole cell extract from ERCC1-XPF-deficient cells (XP2YO) complemented with recombinant ERCC1-XPF containing the indicated mutations in ERCC1 (N110A, Y145A, Y152A) or XPF (D720A). The excised DNA fragments of 24–32 nucleotides were detected by annealing a complementary oligonucleotide containing a non-complementary 4G overhang and filling in with [α-32P]dCTP. Protein concentrations of ERCC1-XPF were 13.4 nm (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) and 53.6 nm (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15).

A plasmid containing a site-specific 1,3-intrastrand cisplatin DNA cross-link was incubated with a cell-free extract from XPF-deficient cells (XP-F cells are devoid of both XPF and ERCC1 proteins (35Biggerstaff M.

Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar). The unsupplemented XP-F cell extract lacked detectable NER activity (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The addition of ERCC1WT-XPF protein to the extract restored NER activity, generating the characteristic excision products of 24–32 nucleotides in length (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). All mutations in the XPA-binding site of ERCC1 led to a decrease in NER activity, with the strongest effects observed for the ERCC1N110A single, ERCC1Y145A/Y152A, and ERCC1N110A/Y145A double mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–13). The activity of ERCC1N110A/Y145A was only slightly above the background level measured with the catalytically inactive mutant XPFD720A (14Staresincic L. Fagbemi A.F. Enzlin J.H. Gourdin A.M.

These results demonstrate that an intact XPA-binding pocket in ERCC1 is required for NER activity in vitro.XPA-binding Mutants of ERCC1 Do Not Localize to Sites of UV DamageHaving established that the XPA-interaction mutants of ERCC1 are defective in NER in vitro, we assessed whether they prevent the recruitment of ERCC1-XPF to sites of UV damage in living cells. Based on the in vitro results (Fig. 2), we chose the ERCC1N110A, ERCC1Y145A, and ERCC1N110A/Y145A mutants for the cellular studies. ERCC1-deficient UV20 CHO cells (38Rolig R.L. Lowery M.P. Adair G.M.

B, ERCC1-deficient CHO cells were transduced with wild-type or mutant ERCC1 and irradiated with UV light (120 J/m2) through a polycarbonate filter with 5-μm pores and then fixed and stained for ERCC1 (green) and (6-4)PP (red).

Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). 1 h after UV irradiation, the cells were fixed, and the presence of (6-4)photoproducts ((6-4)PP) and of ERCC1 at sites of UV damage was monitored by immunofluorescence. As expected, UV20 cells expressing wild-type ERCC1 showed nearly complete (∼90%) co-localization of the nuclease with sites of (6-4)PP (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the single mutants ERCC1N110A or ERCC1Y145A showed less efficient co-localization with UV lesions. ERCC1N110A was detected at 23%, and ERCC1Y145A was detected at only 9% of the sites of UV damage (Fig. 3C). ERCC1N110A/Y145A was observed at sites of UV damage in less than 3% of the cases (Fig. 3, B and C), even if this protein accumulates in the nucleus. These results further support the conclusion that the reduced NER activity of these ERCC1 mutants is due to their failure to interact with XPA.UV Lesions Persist in Cells Expressing ERCC1N110A/Y145ATo further test the conclusion that the recruitment of ERCC1N110A/Y145A to NER complexes was impaired, we measured the rate of UV lesion repair in ERCC1-deficient UV20 cells and UV20 cells expressing either wild-type ERCC1 or ERCC1N110A/Y145A. Cells were UV-irradiated to generate sites of local DNA damage and fixed at various time points after irradiation, and the amount of damage remaining was assessed by immunodetection of (6-4)PP. Immediately after UV irradiation, 45–55% of the cells contained (6-4)PP, indicating the fraction of cells where a filter pore overlapped with the nucleus (Fig. 4A). At 24 h, 15% of the UV20 cells still stained positively for (6-4)PP (Fig. 4B). This defines the rate of removal of (6-4)PPs from the genome in the absence of NER. (6-4)PPs are likely diluted out during cell division in 24 h (UV20 cells have a doubling time of ∼12 h) or are perhaps eventually removed by other pathways such as homologous recombination. Expression of wild-type ERCC1 in UV20 cells led to a dramatic increase in the rate of (6-4)PP removal, with only 5% of nuclei containing foci 4 h after irradiation and 0% by 8 h after irradiation. By contrast, the slope of the curve indicating removal of (6-4)PP in cells expressing ERCC1N110A/Y145A closely resembled that of untransduced UV20 cells, indicating that NER is severely affected if the XPA-ERCC1 interaction is disrupted.FIGURE 4UV damage persists in UV20 cells expressing ERCC1N110A/Y145A but not wild-type ERCC1. A, untransduced UV20 cells or cells expressing wild-type ERCC1 or ERCC1N110A/Y145A were UV-irradiated as described in the legend for Fig. 3, cultured for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h following UV irradiation, and then fixed and stained for (6-4)PP.

To test this, UV20 cells expressing wild-type ERCC1, ERCC1N110A, ERCC1Y145A, or ERCC1N110A/Y145A were tested for their sensitivity to UV irradiation, cross-linking agents (mitomycin C and cisplatin), and ionizing radiation by clonogenic survival assays (Fig. 5). As expected, untransduced UV20 cells were hypersensitive to all of these genotoxins relative to parental wild-type AA8 cells. Furthermore, expression of wild-type ERCC1 corrected the sensitivity to all genotoxins. Cells expressing either ERCC1N110A or ERCC1Y145A showed slightly increased sensitivity to UV when compared with wild-type cells and corrected UV20 cells. However, UV20 cells transduced with ERCC1N110A/Y145A were significantly more sensitive to UV than either AA8 or corrected cell lines, although not as sensitive as UV20 cells, demonstrating that mutations in the XPA-interacting domain of ERCC1 affect long term survival following exposure to UV irradiation. Interestingly, all of the ERCC1 mutations studied here supported normal resistance to mitomycin C (Fig. 5B), cisplatin (Fig. 5C), and ionizing radiation (Fig. 5D) at levels comparable with AA8 cells or UV20 cells expressing wild-type ERCC1. These observations provide direct experimental evidence that the ERCC1-XPA interaction is required only for NER and not for ICL and DSB repair activities. The data of the ERCC1N110A/Y145A mutant demonstrate that the functions of ERCC1-XPF in NER can be separated from its functions in ICL and DSB repair by selectively blocking its interaction with XPA.FIGURE 5Mutations in the XPA-binding domain of ERCC1 inhibit NER but not ICL or DSB repair.

To gain insight into the biological roles of miR-183 we investigated two potential novel targets: integrin β1 (ITGB1) and kinesin 2α (KIF2A). miR-183 significantly decreased the expression of ITGB1 and KIF2A measured by Western blot. Targeting of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of ITGB1 and KIF2A by miR-183 was confirmed by luciferase assay. Transfection with miR-183 led to a significant decrease in cell invasion and migration capacities of HeLa cells that could be rescued by expression of ITGB1 lacking the 3′-UTR. Although miR-183 had no effects on cell adhesion in HeLa cells, it significantly decreased adhesion to laminin, gelatin, and collagen type I in normal human diploid fibroblasts and human trabecular meshwork cells.

https://openalex.org/W1966875352,"Maintenance of circadian alignment between an organism and its environment is essential to ensure metabolic homeostasis. Synchrony is achieved by cell autonomous circadian clocks. Despite a growing appreciation of the integral relation between clocks and metabolism, little is known regarding the direct influence of a peripheral clock on cellular responses to fatty acids. To address this important issue, we utilized a genetic model of disrupted clock function specifically in cardiomyocytes in vivo (termed cardiomyocyte clock mutant (CCM)). CCM mice exhibited altered myocardial response to chronic high fat feeding at the levels of the transcriptome and lipidome as well as metabolic fluxes, providing evidence that the cardiomyocyte clock regulates myocardial triglyceride metabolism. Time-of-day-dependent oscillations in myocardial triglyceride levels, net triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis were markedly attenuated in CCM hearts. Analysis of key proteins influencing triglyceride turnover suggest that the cardiomyocyte clock inactivates hormone-sensitive lipase during the active/awake phase both at transcriptional and post-translational (via AMP-activated protein kinase) levels. Consistent with increased net triglyceride synthesis during the end of the active/awake phase, high fat feeding at this time resulted in marked cardiac steatosis. These data provide evidence for direct regulation of triglyceride turnover by a peripheral clock and reveal a potential mechanistic explanation for accelerated metabolic pathologies after prevalent circadian misalignment in Western society. Maintenance of circadian alignment between an organism and its environment is essential to ensure metabolic homeostasis. Synchrony is achieved by cell autonomous circadian clocks. Despite a growing appreciation of the integral relation between clocks and metabolism, little is known regarding the direct influence of a peripheral clock on cellular responses to fatty acids. To address this important issue, we utilized a genetic model of disrupted clock function specifically in cardiomyocytes in vivo (termed cardiomyocyte clock mutant (CCM)). CCM mice exhibited altered myocardial response to chronic high fat feeding at the levels of the transcriptome and lipidome as well as metabolic fluxes, providing evidence that the cardiomyocyte clock regulates myocardial triglyceride metabolism. Time-of-day-dependent oscillations in myocardial triglyceride levels, net triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis were markedly attenuated in CCM hearts. Analysis of key proteins influencing triglyceride turnover suggest that the cardiomyocyte clock inactivates hormone-sensitive lipase during the active/awake phase both at transcriptional and post-translational (via AMP-activated protein kinase) levels. Consistent with increased net triglyceride synthesis during the end of the active/awake phase, high fat feeding at this time resulted in marked cardiac steatosis. These data provide evidence for direct regulation of triglyceride turnover by a peripheral clock and reveal a potential mechanistic explanation for accelerated metabolic pathologies after prevalent circadian misalignment in Western society."

In the infected hepatocytes, sporozoites undergo a complex developmental program to eventually generate hepatic merozoites that are released into the bloodstream in membrane-bound vesicles termed merosomes. Parasites blocked at an early developmental stage inside hepatocytes elicit a protective host immune response, making them attractive targets in the effort to develop a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine. Here, we generated parasites blocked at a late developmental stage inside hepatocytes by conditionally disrupting the Plasmodium berghei cGMP-dependent protein kinase in sporozoites. Mutant sporozoites are able to invade hepatocytes and undergo intracellular development. However, they remain blocked as late liver stages that do not release merosomes into the medium. These late arrested liver stages induce protection in immunized animals. This suggests that, similar to the well studied early liver stages, late stage liver stages too can confer protection from sporozoite challenge.

https://openalex.org/W2109068727,"Most secretion pathways in bacteria and eukaryotic cells are challenged by the requirement for their substrate proteins to mature after they traverse a membrane barrier and enter a reactive oxidizing environment. For Gram-positive bacteria, the mechanisms that protect their exported proteins from misoxidation during their post-translocation maturation are poorly understood. To address this, we separated numerous bacterial species according to their tolerance for oxygen and divided their proteomes based on the predicted subcellular localization of their proteins. We then applied a previously established computational approach that utilizes cysteine incorporation patterns in proteins as an indicator of enzymatic systems that may exist in each species. The Sec-dependent exported proteins from aerobic Gram-positive Actinobacteria were found to encode cysteines in an even-biased pattern indicative of a functional disulfide bond formation system. In contrast, aerobic Gram-positive Firmicutes favor the exclusion of cysteines from both their cytoplasmic proteins and their substantially longer exported proteins. Supporting these findings, we show that Firmicutes, but not Actinobacteria, tolerate growth in reductant. We further demonstrate that the actinobacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum possesses disulfide-bonded proteins and two dimeric Dsb-like enzymes that can efficiently catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds.

Proper protein targeting and maturation are fundamental to the homeostasis of all organisms. Whereas many of the features that direct the membrane topology and localization of a protein are known, the strategies employed by cells to promote the proper maturation of their proteins under different environmental conditions are not entirely understood. Protein secretion is a dynamic and complex process due to the membrane separation of synthesis and folding (1Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Papanikou E. Karamanou S. Economou A. Nat. Rev.

The majority of secreted proteins are translocated across a membrane into an oxidizing environment, where their folding and maturation occur. Bacteria have evolved several secretory pathways for translocating their proteins across the plasma membrane that can be categorized as either Sec-dependent or Sec-independent (4Thanassi D.G. Hultgren S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 5Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Sec-dependent pathway, which is essential in all organisms, is the major route of protein secretion. In bacteria, the majority of proteins that are targeted for Sec-dependent secretion contain a canonical N-terminal signal peptide that is either directly recognized by SecA or delivered to SecA with the aid of the secretion-dedicated chaperone SecB (6Driessen A.J. Nouwen N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). SecA then drives the translocation of the protein through the SecYEG channel. Alternatively, most plasma membrane proteins and a small number of secretory proteins are recognized as ribosome-bound nascent chains by the signal recognition particle, which directs them to SecYEG, where they are co-translationally inserted into or translocated across the plasma membrane. Upon emergence from the translocon, nascent secretory proteins mature after removal of their signal peptide by either the type I signal peptidase or, in the case of lipoproteins, the type II signal peptidase (7Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Although the obstacles associated with protein folding are fundamentally similar across all organisms, the machinery involved in this process and the environment where it occurs can differ dramatically (8Rosch J. Caparon M. Science. 2004; 304: 1513-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Harwood C.R. Cranenburgh R.

Acta. 2004; 1694: 311-327PubMed Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, secreted proteins mature in the oxidative periplasm with the aid of molecular chaperones and disulfide bond-forming machinery (11Ruiz N. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev.

Gram-positive bacteria lack this protected compartment due to the absence of an outer membrane. Thus, their secreted proteins have to mature in the unregulated environment of the thick, negatively charged cell wall composed of multilayered networks of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids (supplemental Fig. S1). Cysteine residues perform a variety of essential functions in proteins, from metal binding and enzyme catalysis to structural stability through the formation of disulfide bonds (14Giles N.M. Giles G.I. Jacob C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the reactive thiol side chain that is amenable to these roles can also negatively impact the function of a protein by the formation of incorrect disulfide bonds or other deleterious modifications. The high reactivity of cysteine thiols and their susceptibility to attack by reactive oxygen species likely create an oxidative selection pressure on cysteine-containing proteins that relates directly to their environment and localization (15Winterbourn C.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Consequently, bacteria have evolved systems that keep their cytoplasm in a reducing state and maintain the proper oxidation state of the cysteines in their extracellular proteins (16Heras B.

E. coli DsbA is a soluble monomeric enzyme with a thioredoxin-like fold and a Cys-X-X-Cys active site that aids in the maturation of secreted proteins by catalyzing their disulfide bond formation immediately after their translocation into the periplasm (supplemental Fig. S1) (20Kadokura H.

Cell. 2009; 138: 1164-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DsbA is maintained in its oxidized state by the membrane-bound protein DsbB (22Inaba K. Murakami S.

Together, the Dsb proteins in Gram-negative bacteria aid in the maturation of exported proteins and protect them from improper oxidation. Several studies have searched for homologs of the known disulfide bond-forming machinery to predict whether certain bacteria are capable of oxidizing their secreted proteins (16Heras B.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that hyperthermophilic Archaea, which possess disulfide bonds in their cytoplasmic proteins, have a bias for encoding proteins with an even number of cysteine residues. Recently, Beckwith and co-workers (27Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) applied a similar reasoning to examine whether the predicted exported proteins from a large number of bacterial species have an even-number cysteine bias. These results were then correlated to whether DsbA and DsbB homologs were present in the corresponding genomes. We used a combined computational and experimental approach to investigate the different strategies Gram-positive bacteria have evolved to compensate for changes in the oxidative environment that accompanies the localization of their proteins and their tolerance for oxygen. In agreement with recent work, our predictions indicate that Gram-positive Actinobacteria likely form disulfide bonds in their exported proteins (as do Gram-negative Proteobacteria) and that aerobic Gram-positive Firmicutes tend to generally exclude cysteines from their exported proteins (27Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Additionally, we also found that aerobic Firmicutes have substantially longer exported proteins and favor the exclusion of cysteines from their cytoplasmic proteins. Supporting these predictions, we show that Firmicutes, but not Actinobacteria, can tolerate high levels of reductant, indicating that Firmicutes do not rely on disulfide-bonded proteins for growth. We observed several disulfide-bonded proteins in Actinobacteria, but not in Firmicutes, and show that two different dimeric Dsb-like proteins from the actinobacterial species Corynebacterium glutamicum are capable of productive disulfide bond formation. These results provide further insight into how organisms combat oxidative challenges and how their proteins have coevolved in the absence or presence of various enzymatic redox systems to overcome these obstacles. Proteomes from the 340 analyzed bacterial species were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI Database). When several sequenced strains from a given species were available, one proteome from an ATCC strain was chosen to represent that species. The species were manually classified into their respective phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria) and for their ability to grow in the presence of oxygen (strict aerobes and facultative anaerobes versus strict anaerobes). Supplemental Table 1 shows the species distribution in each category. The individual bacterial proteomes were restricted to those proteins that were at least 80 amino acid residues in length. To prevent bias due to redundant protein families in the individual species, each bacterial proteome sequence set was internally homology-reduced using CD-HIT with a sequence identity threshold of 40% (30Li W. Godzik A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1658-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (6447) Google Scholar). These two initial screening steps retained 945,399 amino acid sequences for analysis and discarded 121,981 proteins based on homology reduction and 64,920 sequences as peptides. Protein sequences were classified according to predictions for the presence of transmembrane (TM) 4The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembraneSPasesignal peptidaseDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. regions using SCAMPI and signal peptidase (SPase) type I and II signal peptides using SignalP 3.0 and LipoP 1.0, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2) (31Bendtsen J.D.

The proteome sets for each of the four classifications were compiled and analyzed for their cysteine content: (i) lipoproteins, containing a SPase II signal peptide and no TM regions (21,826 or 2.3% of the sequences); (ii) secreted proteins, containing a SPase I signal peptide, no SPase II signal peptide, and no TM regions (77,419 or 8.2% of the sequences); (iii) TM proteins, containing at least one TM region, no SPase II signal peptide, but possibly a SPase I signal peptide (213,419 or 22.6% of the sequences); and (iv) cytoplasmic proteins, containing no signal peptide or TM regions (631,735 or 66.8% of the sequences). Sequences predicted to contain a SPase I signal peptide by only one of the neural network and hidden Markov model predictors and those with both a SPase II signal peptide and a TM region were discarded (1,000 or 0.1% of the sequences).

Bacterial cultures were grown in brain-heart infusion medium to mid-log phase and sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 200 μg/ml mutanolysin (Sigma) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then adjusted to 1% SDS and 8 m urea and passed through a French press. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were resolved in the first dimension via nonreducing SDS-PAGE. For the second dimension, the lanes were excised with a razor, placed in sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), heated for 5 min at 95 °C, overlaid onto a 1.0-mm 2D-Well NuPAGE 10% BisTris gel, separated by electrophoresis, and resolved by Coomassie Blue staining (35Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase in brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with 10% glucose bouillon (10% horse serum, 1% meat extract, 1% peptone, 1% dextrose, and 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5). Cultures were diluted to OD600 nm = 0.050 in unconditioned growth medium and transferred to wells of a Honeycomb 2 plate (Isotron) containing DTT. The growth kinetics were monitored by changes in the OD600 nm at 37 °C using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Labsystems). For H. influenzae, the growth medium was supplemented with 0.2 mm NAD. The coding sequences for CG0026, CG0354, and CG2799 from C. glutamicum (ATCC 13032) and DsbA (C4447) from E. coli (UTI89) were PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA with 5′-primers that excluded the N-terminal signal peptide and replaced it with a His6 tag. The PCR products were subcloned into the pET21d expression vector (Novagen), and each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial cultures were grown to A600 nm = 0.6; induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h; sedimented; and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole with 200 μg/ml lysozyme and 200 μg/ml DNase I. Following rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysates were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins were then isolated using nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare); washed; eluted with 500 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl; and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using their respective extinction coefficients and molecular masses. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a Superdex 75 column. The molecular mass standards were run according to the manufacturer’s instructions; all protein samples were dialyzed into and separated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; and the absorbance was monitored at 260 and 280 nm. Oxidase activity was assayed by analyzing the cleavage of cCMP by reduced RNase A refolded in the presence of each enzyme (36Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). RNase A (Sigma) was reduced by overnight incubation at 27 °C in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 140 mm DTT. DTT and guanidine were removed by size exclusion chromatography with Sepharose G-10 beads. RNase A reduction was verified by the mobility shift created by the large 525-Da free thiol-modifying agent maleimide-polyethylene oxide-biotin and with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (supplemental Fig. S11A). Each enzyme was assayed in a 1-ml solution containing 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm GSSG, 1 mm GSH, and 10 μm reduced RNase A. Following a 2-min incubation, cCMP was added at a final concentration of 4.5 mm, and the absorbance at 296 nm was recorded. Reductase activity was determined at 27 °C by measuring the turbidity of insulin at OD600 nm that occurs upon precipitation of the reduced B chain (37Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin (Sigma) was resuspended at 5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5, by dropping the pH to 3.0 with HCl and titrating back to pH 7.5 with KOH prior to adjusting to 2 mm EDTA and 10 μm DTT. The enzymes were assayed in a 200-μl solution containing 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 320 μm DTT, and 200 μg of insulin. To gain an understanding of how Gram-positive bacteria have evolved to protect and stabilize their proteins in the different oxidative environments, we compared the cysteine incorporation patterns in different types of proteins from Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) with those from Gram-negative bacteria (Proteobacteria). Initially, we downloaded the available proteomes from the 340 bacterial species of the major phyla of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (EMBL-EBI Database). The strict anaerobic species were then classified as “anaerobes,” and all bacteria capable of aerobic respiration, including strict aerobes and facultative anaerobes, were grouped together as “aerobes” (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). Computational analysis was performed on the proteomes to separate them into the following subproteomes: lipoproteins, secreted proteins, TM proteins, and cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2). Because only cysteines with free thiols in mature secreted proteins are susceptible to oxidation, the signal peptides were removed and examined separately, and the lipoprotein lipid-linked N-terminal cysteines were excluded prior to analysis (supplemental Fig. S3) (38Sankaran K.

Bacteria with the capacity for disulfide bond formation have previously been shown to favor the incorporation of cysteines in pairs (i.e. an even-biased manner) in their substrate proteins (27Dutton R.J.

Thus, this characteristic can be used as a strong indication of disulfide bond formation. We first analyzed the average cysteine distribution in all of the predicted secreted proteins, lipoproteins, TM proteins, and signal peptides from aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All but anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria favored an even number of cysteines in their secreted proteins and lipoproteins, and no obvious trends were observed in the signal peptides and TM protein loops (supplemental Fig. S3). However, when the exported protein (lipoprotein and secreted protein) subproteomes were analyzed separately, a large number of those from aerobic Gram-positive bacteria (∼60%) were found to average less than one cysteine/protein and to lack the even-numbered cysteine bias (supplemental Fig. S4). From these observations, we were able to classify the vast majority of all of the exported protein subproteomes by one of two patterns. The first is an “even cysteine-biased” pattern defined by an up-and-down trend in the percentage of exported proteins that correspond to an even (up) and odd (down) number of cysteines (0 Cys > 1 Cys and 2 Cys > 1 Cys), and the second is a “cysteine exclusion trend” (0 Cys > 1 Cys > 2 Cys) (Table 1). Only 5% of the exported protein subproteomes did not follow either pattern and were labeled as “remaining,” and those with fewer than 25 proteins were excluded from further analysis (supplemental Fig. S5 and Table 1). Following this separation, we could confirm a conclusion in a recent study that an obvious distinction exists between the two major phyla of Gram-positive bacteria (27Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Distribution of bacterial exported and cytoplasmic subproteomes to the indicated cysteine incorporation trendsPhylaExported proteinsCytoplasmic proteinsEven biasExclusionSemi-normalExclusionGram-positive bacteriaAerobicActinobacteria31/3127/314/31Firmicutes10/6451/6417/6443/64AnaerobicActinobacteria1/32/32/31/3Firmicutes2/2011/2016/202/20Gram-negative ProteobacteriaAerobicAlpha49/5250/522/52Beta34/3433/341/34Delta3/52/54/5Epsilon12/128/121/12Gamma80/8683/861/86AnaerobicAlpha5/134/1312/131/13Beta2/22/2Delta2/119/1111/11Epsilon1/11/1Gamma5/65/6 Open table in a new tab All exported protein subproteomes from aerobic Actinobacteria fell into the even cysteine-biased pattern, whereas those from aerobic Firmicutes followed mainly the cysteine exclusion trend (Fig. 1B, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S6). The exported proteins from aerobic Firmicutes have a mean of ∼0.5 Cys, and an astonishing 70% of them are devoid of cysteine residues, compared with only 33% in anaerobic Firmicutes (supplemental Fig. S7). In contrast, the exported proteins from aerobic Actinobacteria have a mean of ∼2.2 Cys, only 25% of them lack cysteine residues, and about 60% contain even numbers of cysteines, which is significantly higher than for aerobic Gram-negative Proteobacteria (supplemental Figs. S3A, S6, and S7). Thus, the maturation of the exported proteins from aerobic Actinobacteria likely involves disulfide bond formation, and aerobic Firmicutes tend to exclude cysteines from their exported proteins (27Dutton R.J. Boyd D. Berkmen M. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To understand how the exported proteins from Firmicutes have evolved in the absence of disulfide bond stabilization, we examined their length in comparison with that of their cytoplasmic proteins. In Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria, the average length of their mature exported proteins is longer than that of their respective cytosolic proteins, which are ∼325 amino acids in length (Fig. 2A). However, the mature exported proteins from aerobic Firmicutes have an average length that is ∼70 amino acids longer than that of their cytoplasmic proteins. This difference is substantially greater than the 7- and 16-amino acid increases seen in aerobic Actinobacteria and Gram-negative Proteobacteria, respectively. Although different cell wall attachment motifs in the Firmicute exported proteins may contribute to the increase in length, it is also possible that these proteins require more extensive non-covalent structural interactions to stabilize their proteins in the absence of disulfide bonds. Analysis of the cytoplasmic subproteomes revealed that aerobic Gram-positive bacteria encode cysteines with a low frequency, resulting in a unique distribution profile that peaks at 0 Cys compared with 2 Cys in Gram-negative Proteobacteria and Gram-positive anaerobes (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S8). Upon investigating the population variations of the cytoplasmic subproteomes from Gram-positive bacteria, we were able to assign them to either a cysteine exclusion trend (0 Cys > 1 Cys > 2 Cys) or a “semi-normal cysteine trend” (1 Cys > 0 Cys). Using these parameters, the majority of aerobic Firmicutes (67%) were found to have a cysteine exclusion trend in their cytoplasmic proteins, whereas Actinobacteria and anaerobic Firmicutes had a strong inclination toward a semi-normal cysteine trend (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Thus, aerobic Firmicutes appear to possess a general tendency to exclude cysteines from their proteins in comparison with other bacteria. To examine whether aerobic Actinobacteria possess disulfide-bonded proteins, whole cell lysates from C. glutamicum were separated and resolved by two-dimensional nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (35Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In accordance with the predictive data, both intermolecular (Fig. 3, below the diagonal) and large intramolecular (above the diagonal) disulfide-bonded proteins were present in C. glutamicum and in the control lysate from E. coli.

Transcriptional signatures from purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were derived from whole-genome gene-expression microarray data, validated by quantitative PCR and tested in independent samples. Methodology/Principal Findings The study was performed on patients of a well-characterized dengue cohort from Recife, Brazil. The samples analyzed were collected prospectively from acute febrile dengue patients who evolved with different degrees of disease severity: classic dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) samples were compared with similar samples from other non-dengue febrile illnesses. The DHF samples were collected 2–3 days before the presentation of the plasma leakage symptoms. Differentially-expressed genes were selected by univariate statistical tests as well as multivariate classification techniques. The results showed that at early stages of dengue infection, the genes involved in effector mechanisms of innate immune response presented a weaker activation on patients who later developed hemorrhagic fever, whereas the genes involved in apoptosis were expressed in higher levels. Conclusions/Significance Some of the gene expression signatures displayed estimated accuracy rates of more than 95%, indicating that expression profiling with these signatures may provide a useful means of DHF prognosis at early stages of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1985034470,"Inteins are single turnover enzymes that splice out of protein precursors during maturation of the host protein (extein). The Cys or Ser at the N terminus of most inteins initiates a four-step protein splicing reaction by forming a (thio)ester bond at the N-terminal splice junction. Several recently identified inteins cannot perform this acyl rearrangement because they do not begin with Cys, Thr, or Ser. This study analyzes one of these, the mycobacteriophage Bethlehem DnaB intein, which we describe here as the prototype for a new class of inteins based on sequence comparisons, reactivity, and mechanism. These Class 3 inteins are characterized by a non-nucleophilic N-terminal residue that co-varies with a non-contiguous Trp, Cys, Thr triplet (WCT) and a Thr or Ser as the first C-extein residue. Several mechanistic differences were observed when compared with standard inteins or previously studied atypical KlbA Ala(1) inteins: (a) cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction in the absence of all standard N- and C-terminal splice junction nucleophiles, (b) activation of the N-terminal splice junction by a variant Block B motif that includes the WCT triplet Trp, (c) decay of the branched intermediate by thiols or Cys despite an ester linkage at the C-extein branch point, and (d) an absolute requirement for the WCT triplet Block F Cys. Based on biochemical data and confirmed by molecular modeling, we propose roles for these newly identified conserved residues, a novel protein splicing mechanism that includes a second branched intermediate, and an intein classification with three mechanistic categories."
https://openalex.org/W2130254166,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common known causes of inherited mental retardation. The gene mutated in FXS is named FMR1, and is well conserved from human to Drosophila. In order to generate a genetic tool to study FMR1 function during vertebrate development, we generated two mutant alleles of the fmr1 gene in zebrafish. Both alleles produce no detectable Fmr protein, and produce viable and fertile progeny with lack of obvious phenotypic features. This is in sharp contrast to published results based on morpholino mediated knock-down of fmr1, reporting defects in craniofacial development and neuronal branching in embryos. These phenotypes we specifically addressed in our knock-out animals, revealing no significant deviations from wild-type animals, suggesting that the published morpholino based fmr1 phenotypes are potential experimental artifacts. Therefore, their relation to fmr1 biology is questionable and morpholino induced fmr1 phenotypes should be avoided in screens for potential drugs suitable for the treatment of FXS. Importantly, a true genetic zebrafish model is now available which can be used to study FXS and to derive potential drugs for FXS treatment."

Importantly, functional rescue by restoring trafficking is possible in ∼70% of these mutants, making this phenotype a promising target for pharmacological intervention.

By comparison, work with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel has implicated the cytosolic heat shock protein (Hsp) chaperones Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90, as well as several E3 ubiquitin ligases and membrane extraction factors, in its folding and degradation (10Riordan J.R.

Like CFTR, much of the hERG polypeptide consists of structured domains in the cytosol, and many trafficking-defective mutations are found in these domains (5Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D.

Both chaperones interact with the immature form of wild type (WT) hERG at the ER, most probably through its N- or C-terminal cytosolic domains. These interactions were enhanced for trafficking-defective mutants of hERG. Importantly, specific inhibition of Hsp90 activity with geldanamycin reduced the production of mature hERG and reduced the overall interaction between hERG and Hsp90 (14Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ficker E. Kuryshev Y.A. Dennis A.T. Obejero-Paz C. Wang L. Hawryluk P. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Hsc70 and Hsp90 are ATP-dependent chaperones, and a range of co-chaperone proteins assist and direct their activity (16Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Hsp40/DnaJ family co-chaperones stimulate the ATPase and polypeptide binding activities of Hsc70 and are essential for Hsc70 function (17Qiu X.B. Shao Y.M. Miao S. Wang L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2560-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 18Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem.

In the sequential chaperone pathway for the folding of progesterone and glucocorticoid steroid hormone receptors, binding of the Hsp40 protein DJA1 (DNAJA1/Hdj2) appears to be a first step, followed by Hsc70 binding (20Hernández M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol.

Another co-chaperone, Hop, is thought to promote substrate transfer from Hsc70 to Hsp90 by binding to both chaperones at once. Hsc70 and Hop dissociate and are replaced in Hsp90 complexes by other co-chaperones, such as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. It is possible that the outline of this pathway also applies to other substrates of the chaperone system including hERG. Recently, we undertook a proteomic screen to identify proteins important for hERG trafficking and found, in addition to Hsc70 and Hsp90, a number of associated co-chaperones. Among these was FKBP38 (FKBP8), a membrane-anchored peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that binds specifically to Hsp90. We determined that FKBP38 interacted and co-localized with immature hERG at the ER and that siRNA knockdown of endogenous FKBP38 reduced hERG trafficking efficiency (23Walker V.E. Atanasiu R. Lam H. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23509-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because FKBP38 is the only known membrane-anchored ER co-chaperone, it may provide a direct link between the cytosolic chaperones and ER export mechanisms of hERG. Other co-chaperones found to be associated with hERG were DJA1, the Bcl2-associated athanogene Bag2, and Hop (23Walker V.E. Atanasiu R. Lam H. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23509-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bag2 is one of several nucleotide exchange factors for Hsc70 that reset the ATPase cycle of the chaperone after stimulation by Hsp40 (19Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). These co-chaperones were also found to be associated with CFTR or a trafficking-defective mutant of the protein (11Wang X. Venable J. LaPointe P. Hutt D.M. Koulov A.V. Coppinger J. Gurkan C. Kellner W. Matteson J. Plutner H. Riordan J.R. Kelly J.W. Yates 3rd, J.R. Balch W.E.

DJA1 binds to newly synthesized CFTR at the ER and was shown to assist Hsc70 in preventing aggregation (24Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Bag2 was found to regulate degradation of CFTR through interactions with CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contacts Hsc70 and ubiquitylates chaperone-bound substrates (25Arndt V.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An increasingly recognized function of these co-chaperones and the chaperone system generally is to make “triage” decisions regarding whether substrates are folded or degraded (29Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 30McDonough H. Patterson C.

Interactions between Hsc70 and these co-chaperones are transient and sometimes competitive, for example, the Hsc70-binding domains in Hop and CHIP are homologous to each other and recognize the same site on Hsc70 (16Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 32Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The roles of DJA1 and related Hsp40 proteins in this system of chaperone-mediated folding and degradation are still poorly understood. DJA1 is highly homologous to the co-chaperones DJA2 (DNAJA2/Hdj3/Rdj2) and the less abundant DJA4 (DNAJA4). All of these have a J domain that activates Hsc70 and a separate polypeptide-binding domain, although they diverge in the efficiencies of these features (33Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol.

Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of the DJA proteins reduces the levels of the mature form of hERG exported from the ER, indicating diminished hERG trafficking efficiency. This effect is due to an increase in proteasomal degradation of the immature form, most likely by increased ERAD through Hsc70 and the ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Our results provide the first demonstration of a degradation role for these Hsp40s and suggest that they act at a critical point in hERG quality control.

Myc-tagged CHIP was a kind gift from Jörg Höhfeld (25Arndt V. Daniel C. Nastainczyk W. Alberti S. Höhfeld J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5891-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HCN2 was in pCMV-Myc, and CFTR in pcDNA3-HA. The GripTite™ 293 macrophage scavenger receptor cell line (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments except where indicated. This cell line is a genetically engineered HEK-293 cell line that expresses the human macrophage scavenger receptor type I, class A gene from the pCMV SPORT6 MSR.neo plasmid and strongly adheres to standard tissue culture plates (36Matsumoto A.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 600 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Plasmid transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 for all experiments as described by the manufacturer. The cells incubated at 26 °C were transfected as described and transferred to 26 °C for 24 h following transfection, where they remained for an additional 24 h, and then they were lysed. All of the siRNA duplexes were from Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific including the nonsilencing control (target sequence, 5′-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA); the siRNA target sequences within DJA1 and DJA2 are in supplemental Table S1. 20 nm siRNA duplexes were transfected with Oligofectamine as described by the manufacturer, and the cells were passaged after transfection. HeLa and GripTite 293 cell lines (ATCC) were generated that stably express WT hERG with HA (14Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Myc tags, respectively, inserted after residue 443 in the extracellular S1-S2 loop. A retroviral expression plasmid was generated by introducing the cDNA encoding the extracellular HA-tagged WT hERG into the HindIII/ApaI sites of the retroviral expression vector pTZV4-CMV-IRES-puro (Open Biosystems). For viral infection subconfluent HeLa cells in 6-well plates were incubated with 0.5 ml of viral expression plasmid in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml puromycin for 10–14 days to select the stable cells. 50–100 individual colonies were pooled and expanded for experiments. His-tagged human DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 were expressed in Rosetta 2 Escherichia coli cells (Novagen) and purified as described (34Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Binding experiments of purified DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 with hERG fragments were performed as described (35Tzankov S. Wong M.J. Shi K. Nassif C. Young J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27100-27109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 were prebound to nickel-Sepharose beads in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc2 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell-free translations of the hERG CT or CL-CNBD were performed with the TnT-coupled RL system with T7 polymerase (Promega) supplemented with [35S] methionine (GE Healthcare and PerkinElmer Life Sciences); diluted 1:20 into buffer G containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mg/ml ovalbumin; and added to the immobilized DJA proteins. The final reactions contained 5 μm DJA protein and 5% translation mixture. After 5 min at room temperature, the binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 unit/μl apyrase. The protein complexes were recovered at 4 °C for 30 min and washed with buffer G containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.1% Triton X-100 before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging quantification. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the cells were washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 75 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for a minimum of 15 min or, for Fig. 1 (D and E) and Fig. 2, in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 under identical conditions. The cells were homogenized by pipetting, harvested, and then left on ice for an additional 15 min with occasional vortexing. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented at 16,000 × g for 20 min, after which the resulting supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined with a detergent-compatible assay as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, samples of 0.5–1 mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a volume of 0.5–1 ml with either monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (1:200) or monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:100). For co-precipitation of hERG with endogenous DJA1 and DJA2, samples of 5 mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a volume of 2 ml with either monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (1:100) or polyclonal rabbit anti-hERG antibody (1:250). The samples were incubated with protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h, after which the beads were washed extensively and then resuspended in 2× sample buffer (12% 0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 5% β mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 20% SDS, bromphenol blue). The samples were resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for a minimum of 2 h at room temperature, washed extensively, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After extensive washing the membranes were visualized on x-ray films using an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).FIGURE 2Knockdown of DJA1 by siRNA reduces trafficking efficiency of hERG.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated with DMEM containing Me2SO or 25 μm lactacystin (Cayman Chemical Company) for an additional 24 h, after which the cells were lysed as described above. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 1 h in serum-free DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine in the presence of 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were then metabolically labeled in the same medium containing 125–150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 45 min, after which the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine and chased in the same medium for the indicated time intervals. The cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated as described, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography for visualization, and phosphorimaging quantification. Densitometric analysis was carried out using the digital imagine program Image J (National Institutes of Health). For calculation of the relative protein expression levels, each band was quantified by a mean pixel value after subtraction of background. The values for CG and FG hERG bands were normalized to the value of the CG hERG band under control conditions (with Myc vector alone). hERG trafficking efficiency is represented by the ratio of the normalized FG hERG band to the total normalized HERG intensity (FG/(CG+FG)). Quantification of Hsc70 co-immunoprecipitated with hERG was performed by first normalizing to the amount of immunoprecipitated CG hERG and then reported relative to the amount of Hsc70 bound to CG hERG under control conditions. Paired t tests were used to compare groups of data to determine significance. The results are presented as the mean values ± standard error. To search for possible chaperones and co-chaperones that interact with hERG, we previously conducted proteomic screens of immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged hERG transfected into cardiac (HL-1) (37Claycomb W.C.

Lam H. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23509-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several chaperones and co-chaperones were identified including DJA1, a member of the Hsp40/DnaJ family. We first determined whether DJA1 and the closely related proteins DJA2 and DJA4 had an effect on hERG trafficking. As previously demonstrated, hERG maturation was observed in transiently transfected HEK-293 (GripTite) cells by Western blot detection of a 155-kDa form corresponding to hERG that had become FG during export through the Golgi, compared with the 135-kDa form representing CG hERG in the ER (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of Myc-tagged DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 markedly reduced the abundance of mature FG hERG (p < 0.01 for all DJA proteins) without affecting the immature CG hERG, relative to control conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). When relative trafficking efficiency was calculated, a clearly diminished trafficking efficiency was observed in the presence of any of the three cytosolic Hsc70 co-chaperones (Fig. 1C; p < 0.01 for all DJA proteins). To confirm the specificity of this effect, the expression of GFP in the presence of the DJA proteins was tested; spontaneous GFP refolding is robust in the absence of chaperones (39Enoki S. Saeki K. Maki K. Kuwajima K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14238-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As expected, GFP levels were not affected by overexpression of any of the DJAs in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the abundance of other cellular proteins such as Hsc70 or tubulin remained unaffected (Fig. 1D). In previous work, overexpression of each of the DJAs increased Hsc70-dependent luciferase activity and mitochondrial import of the phosphate carrier (34Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that the transfected DJA proteins are functional in cells. The DJA co-chaperones are all type I Hsp40 proteins with similar architecture: an N-terminal J domain that activates Hsc70, a central substrate-binding domain, and a C-terminal homodimerization domain. We hypothesized that the inhibition of hERG maturation might be mediated through the J domain because it is necessary for Hsc70 activation. To determine the effect of this domain deletion, mutants of the major Hsp40 proteins DJA1 and DJA2 were tested. Overexpression of mutant DJA1 and DJA2 proteins lacking the J domains (A1-ΔJ and A2-ΔJ) had no effect on hERG trafficking (Fig. 1E). Thus, the J domains of the co-chaperones were necessary for the inhibitory effect, implying that the interaction with Hsc70 was important. However, overexpression of Hsc70 itself had no effect on hERG maturation (Fig. 1E), suggesting that Hsc70 required activation by the DJAs to mediate inhibition. We then asked what effect the reduction of DJA expression by siRNA knockdo"
https://openalex.org/W2082547107,"Extracellular acidosis often rapidly causes intracellular acidification, alters ion channel activities, and activates G protein-coupled receptors. In this report, we demonstrated a novel cellular response to acidosis: induction of the zymogen activation of matriptase. Acid-induced matriptase activation is ubiquitous among epithelial and carcinoma cells and is characterized by rapid onset, fast kinetics, and the magnitude of activation seen. Trace amounts of activated matriptase can be detected 1 min after cells are exposed to pH 6.0 buffer, and the vast majority of latent matriptase within the cells is converted to activated matriptase within 20 min. Matriptase activation may be a direct response to proton exposure because acid-induced matriptase activation also occurs in an in vitro, cell-free setting in which intracellular signaling molecules and ion channel activities are largely absent. Acid-induced matriptase activation takes place both on the cell surface and inside the cells, likely due to the parallel intracellular acidification that activates intracellular matriptase. Following matriptase activation, the active enzyme is immediately inhibited by binding to hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1, resulting in stable matriptase-hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 complexes that are rapidly secreted. As an early response to acidosis, matriptase activation can also be induced by perturbation of intracellular pH homeostasis by 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)-amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride, both of which inhibit Na(+)/H(+) exchangers, and diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, which can inhibit other acid-base ion channels. This study uncovers a novel mechanism regulating proteolysis in epithelial and carcinoma cells, and also demonstrates that a likely function of matriptase is as an early response to acidosis."

There was a good correlation between the ability of cis-acting elements to respond to GC in transiently transfected reporter constructs and their ability to recruit GR in the context of intact chromatin. We propose that divergence of gene regulation has involved the loss or gain of binding sites for accessory transcription factors that assist in GR recruitment.

https://openalex.org/W1987582651,"Background Computational prediction of protein interactions typically use protein domains as classifier features because they capture conserved information of interaction surfaces. However, approaches relying on domains as features cannot be applied to proteins without any domain information. In this paper, we explore the contribution of pure amino acid composition (AAC) for protein interaction prediction. This simple feature, which is based on normalized counts of single or pairs of amino acids, is applicable to proteins from any sequenced organism and can be used to compensate for the lack of domain information. Results AAC performed at par with protein interaction prediction based on domains on three yeast protein interaction datasets. Similar behavior was obtained using different classifiers, indicating that our results are a function of features and not of classifiers. In addition to yeast datasets, AAC performed comparably on worm and fly datasets. Prediction of interactions for the entire yeast proteome identified a large number of novel interactions, the majority of which co-localized or participated in the same processes. Our high confidence interaction network included both well-studied and uncharacterized proteins. Proteins with known function were involved in actin assembly and cell budding. Uncharacterized proteins interacted with proteins involved in reproduction and cell budding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins. Conclusion AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein interactions, and can be used alone or in conjunction with protein domains to predict new and validate existing interactions. More importantly, AAC alone performs at par with existing, but more complex, features indicating the presence of sequence-level information that is predictive of interaction, but which is not necessarily restricted to domains."

In a previous study, we reported that the introduction of bisecting GlcNAc into Lm332 (GnT-III-Lm332), catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), reduced cell migration (Kariya, Y., Kato, R., Itoh, S., Fukuda, T., Shibukawa, Y., Sanzen, N., Sekiguchi, K., Wada, Y., Kawasaki, N., and Gu, J.

In this study, we show that galectin-3, which is a beta-galactoside-binding protein, strongly bound to unmodified Lm332 but not to GnT-III-Lm332 and that binding of galectin-3 was completely blocked by lactose. Exogenous galectin-3 significantly enhanced keratinocyte cell motility on control Lm332 but not on GnT-III-Lm332. A functional blocking antibody against galectin-3 inhibited Lm332-induced alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrin clustering and focal contact formation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that galectin-3 associated with both beta4 integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor, thereby cross-linking the two molecules. The associations were inhibited by either the presence of lactose or expression of GnT-III. Moreover, galectin-3 consistently enhanced ERK activation. Taken together, the results of this study are the first to clearly identify the molecular mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effects of GnT-III on extracellular matrix-integrin-meditated cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W2018515506,"Usa1p is a recently discovered member of the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex. The HRD pathway is a conserved route of ubiquitin-dependent, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of numerous lumenal (ERAD-L) and membrane-anchored (ERAD-M) substrates. We have investigated Usa1p to understand its importance in HRD complex action. Usa1p was required for the optimal function of the Hrd1p E3 ubiquitin ligase; its loss caused deficient degradation of both membrane-associated and lumenal proteins. Furthermore, Usa1p functioned in regulation of Hrd1p by two mechanisms. First, Hrd1p self-degradation, which serves to limit the levels of uncomplexed E3, is absolutely dependent on Usa1p and the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Usa1p. We found that Usa1p allows Hrd1p degradation by promoting trans interactions between Hrd1p molecules. The Ubl domain of Usa1p was required specifically for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination but not for degradation of either ERAD-L or ERAD-M substrates. In addition, Usa1p was able to attenuate the activity-dependent toxicity of Hrd1p without compromising substrate degradation, indicating a separate role in ligase regulation that operates in parallel to stability control. Many of the described actions of Usa1p are distinct from those of Der1p, which is recruited to the HRD complex by Usa1p.

ERAD pathways play a major role in the destruction of misfolded or unassembled ER proteins, including both lumenal and integral-membrane substrates. In addition, normal proteins are regulated by this pathway, the most prominent case being the sterol pathway-regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in both yeast and mammals (1.Hampton R.Y.

Covalent addition of ubiquitin to proteins brings about their recognition and degradation by the cytosolic 26S proteasome. Protein ubiquitination occurs by a cascade of enzymes that add 7.6-kDa ubiquitin to the targeted protein. The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme first forms a high energy bond with ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction, and then the ubiquitin is transferred to an E2, or ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2-bound ubiquitin is next transferred from the charged E2 to the target protein by the action of a ubiquitin ligase, or E3, that ensures specificity of transfer to the proper degradation substrate. The action of the E3 is iterative, causing the construction of a substrate-bound multiubiquitin chain that is recognized by the 26S proteasome (5.Hochstrasser M. Nature. 2009; 458: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in the destruction of ER proteins. Thus, ERAD is a composite of ubiquitination pathways with distinct ligases that use both separate and common components to effect recognition, ubiquitination, and delivery of ER substrates to the cytosolic proteasome. It now appears that distinct complexes of proteins are responsible for these separate ERAD pathways (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A.

Yeast Hrd1p is one of several highly conserved ER-localized E3 ligases that mediate ERAD in eukaryotes (6.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 7.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Hrd1p has an N-terminal multispanning membrane domain that anchors it in the ER and a C-terminal domain with a RING-H2 motif found in many E3 ligases. At its natural levels Hrd1p exists in complex with several other proteins. Initial studies spawned from the genetic analysis of the HRD pathway revealed Hrd3p as a stoichiometric binding partner (7.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Hrd3p promotes Hrd1p stability, appears to enhance Hrd1p-dependent recognition of some substrates, and recruits factors that mediate substrate detection and delivery to the HRD complex (8.Bhamidipati A. Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9.Kim W. Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). More recent proteomic studies revealed that a number of proteins reside in the HRD complex, including Hrd1p, Hrd3p, Der1p, Ubx2p, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex, Kar2p, Yos9p, and Usa1p (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4.Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Of these, only Usa1p was novel and was, thus, the most poorly characterized of the HRD complex components. Because the Usa1p protein is uniquely found in the HRD complex and has corresponding proteins in other eukaryotes, it might be expected to play a pivotal role in HRD function, albeit one not revealed by genetic approaches. Usa1p is predicted to be a two-transmembrane-spanning protein, with a large N-terminal cytoplasmic region containing a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain. Usa1p has been shown to be required for degradation of lumenal ERAD substrates and to link Der1p to the HRD complex (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). These studies posited that Usa1p was uniquely required for HRD-mediated degradation of lumenal ERAD, or ERAD-L, substrates (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We have more fully investigated the function of Usa1p in the HRD complex and found that it is in fact broadly involved in ERAD function and HRD ligase regulation. As reported, we observed that Usa1p was required for degradation of lumenal substrates (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that Usa1p is also required for optimal degradation of membrane-bound (ERAD-M) substrates. Although many proteins are involved in the function of the HRD complex and have been relatively well characterized, much less is known about the regulation of this pathway. In these studies we have found that Usa1p plays a multifaceted role in regulation of Hrd1p. Usa1p was absolutely required for Hrd1p self-catalyzed degradation, and the Ubl domain of Usa1p uniquely functioned in this capacity. Usa1p-dependent Hrd1p self-degradation had mechanistic features distinct from all other ERAD substrates. In addition to governing autoregulation, phenotypic studies revealed that Usa1p had a separate role in modulating Hrd1p activity, limiting the toxicity of Hrd1p while preserving its ability to degrade bona fide ERAD substrates. Taken together, our studies show that Usa1p has a vital role in the HRD complex at multiple levels, consistent with this highly conserved presence in all eukaryotes. It is important for degradation of all classes of ERAD substrates and has thus far unique roles in the regulation of HRD ligase stability and specificity.

Beginning with an A600 of 0.35, 5-fold serial dilutions were made and spotted onto the appropriate drop-out plates followed by incubation at the indicated temperatures for 2 days (30 and 35 °C) or 3 days (37 °C). Cycloheximide chase assays were performed by the addition of cycloheximide to log-phase cultures followed by lysis at the indicated times, as previously described (17.Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B.

Equal loading of gels was confirmed by India ink staining of the nitrocellulose membranes (18.Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). GFP levels were analyzed in living cells (10,000 cells per sample) by flow microfluorimetry of log-phase cultures (12.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using a FACScalibur machine (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (19.Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol.

In vivo Hrd1p ubiquitination was assayed by immunoprecipitating Hrd1p from pdr5Δ null strains after treatment of log-phase cultures (A600 < 0.25) with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-aldehyde; Sigma) for 2.25 h before lysis. Immunoblotting for proteins in cellular lysates or in ubiquitination assays was performed as described (19.Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with variations and reagent descriptions detailed in supplemental “Materials and Methods”. The ER-resident, integral membrane protein Hmg2p is the prototype substrate of the HRD pathway. Hmg2p is the isozyme of yeast HMG-CoA reductase that undergoes regulated degradation by the HRD pathway in response to changing levels of sterol pathway signals (21.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using this ERAD-M substrate, it was reported that Usa1p was not involved in this branch of ERAD (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that active Hmg2p underwent normal degradation in a usa1Δ null mutant as measured by cycloheximide chase (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the degradation of 1myc-Hmg2p in wild type or usa1Δ cells revealed no discernable difference in half-life, as reported (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We also tested the related substrate 6myc-Hmg2p, which because of an insertion of six tandem myc tags in the transmembrane region, is constitutively degraded by the HRD pathway. That is, the 6myc-Hmg2p degradation rate is constant and unresponsive to changes in the sterol pathway signals that control Hmg2p stability (13.Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In all other ways the unregulated 6myc substrate is identical to wild type Hmg2p in its requirements for HRD pathway degradation. In contrast to Hmg2p, 6myc-Hmg2p showed clear stabilization in the usa1Δ (Fig. 1B), implying that Usa1p did have a role in ERAD-M. What is the cause of this difference in degradation? The normal Hmg2p in Fig. 1A was responsive to increases in sterol pathway activity provided by its own catalytic domain, whereas 6myc-Hmg2p was not. Thus, one explanation for the differing response to the usa1Δ null mutant is that the normal Hmg2p used in the original analysis had its degradation rate sufficiently enhanced by its own catalytic activity to overcome a partial loss of HRD pathway activity in the usa1Δ, whereas the unregulated 6myc-Hmg2p, although also catalytically active, could not similarly respond. To test this idea, we examined the effect of a usa1Δ on the normally regulated but catalytically inactive Hmg2p-GFP, which has an intact Hmg2p transmembrane domain, with the catalytic region replaced by GFP. The use of Hmg2p-GFP allows quantitative examination of degradation by cycloheximide chase with flow microfluorimetry (21.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22.Cronin S.R. Hampton R.Y. Methods in Enzymology. 1999; 302: 58-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like 6myc-Hmg2p, Hmg2p-GFP was stabilized by the usa1Δ null mutant when compared with wild type in a cycloheximide chase (Fig. 1C). In the strain used to test Hmg2p-GFP, the HMG-CoA reductase activity was provided by the native HMG-CoA reductase genes, which produce ample activity for life but less activity than that from the full-length, myc-tagged Hmg2p used in Fig. 1A. Thus, the sterol pathway-derived degradation signals in the Hmg2p-GFP strain were lower than in the 1myc-Hmg2p strain of Fig. 1A and allowed the difference between wild type and usa1Δ cells to be observed. Consistent with this idea, treating the cells with the drug zaragozic acid (ZA), which increases the cellular signal for Hmg2p degradation (21.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), restored wild type degradation of Hmg2p-GFP in the usa1Δ strain (Fig. 1D). Degradation of Hmg2-GFP was about 2-fold slower in the usa1Δ as compared with the wild type strain (closed symbols). A hrd3Δ null strain was included as a control, showing the expected severe block in degradation of Hmg2p-GFP and illustrating that the usa1Δ defect in membrane substrate degradation resulted in an intermediate phenotype. Treatment of either a wild type or a usa1Δ strain with ZA (open symbols) resulted in equivalent Hmg2p-GFP degradation in both the wild type and usa1Δ strains. Normally regulated Hmg2p was stabilized by a usa1Δ, but the partial block to the Hrd1p pathway can be overcome by sufficient elevation of its sterol pathway degradation signal either by the in cis catalytic activity in the case of 1myc-Hmg2p or by pharmacological elevation of the signal with ZA in the case of Hmg2p-GFP. Thus, a usa1Δ null mutant imposes a partial defect in degradation of ERAD-M substrates. Because Usa1p is part of the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex, we directly tested its role in Hrd1p-mediated Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination by immunoprecipitation of the substrate followed by immunoblotting for either the attached ubiquitin or the substrate itself as indicated (Fig. 1E). In the usa1Δ strain, Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination was significantly decreased (compare the wild type and usa1Δ − lanes, Fig. 1E). The addition of ZA to increase the degradation signal greatly increased Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination in both the wild type and usa1Δ strains, consistent with the ability of increased degradation signal to overcome the usa1Δ-stabilizing effect on Hmg2p-GFP shown in Fig. 1D. Taken together, these experiments indicated that Usa1p was required for optimal function of Hrd1p toward ERAD-M substrates; the usa1Δ null mutant does not cause a complete loss of Hrd1p activity. We would predict that numerous ERAD-M substrates should show some degree of stabilization in a usa1Δ null mutant. Below, we show that the degradation of another ERAD-M substrate, Sec61-2p, was also impaired in a usa1Δ strain (see Fig. 4B, right). Loss of Usa1p caused a diminution in Hrd1p activity. Thus, elevation of Hrd1p levels would be expected to suppress the degradation defect imposed by a usa1Δ null mutant. When Hrd1p was expressed from the strong TDH3 promoter, the degradation of Hmg2p-GFP was hastened and comparable with that seen in a wild type strain with similarly elevated levels of Hrd1p (Fig. 1F). The usa1Δ can, thus, be described as rendering Hrd1p hypomorphic toward its ERAD-M substrates, so that increasing the efficiency of recognition by altering degradation signals or by elevating Hrd1p overcomes the deficiency in substrate degradation. The recent proteomic studies on the HRD complex indicate that Usa1p functions to couple Der1p, the prototype member of the derlin family, to the HRD complex (3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). If this were the sole function of Usa1p, then a usa1Δ would be expected to phenocopy a der1Δ null. We directly examined this idea by comparing der1Δ and usa1Δ null mutants and found they are distinct by a number of criteria. Loss of ERAD components stimulates the UPR in yeast (23.Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 24.Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), in which a buildup of misfolded ER proteins activates a transcriptional response mediated by the unfolded protein response element in target genes. We used this response as a means of comparing the effects of null mutations in USA1 or DER1. Strains with an unfolded protein response element-driven GFP reporter were prepared with either or both nulls and compared with a wild type strain by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Both single mutants showed a similar activation of the UPR as measured by mean cellular fluorescence, and the usa1Δder1Δ double mutant showed no additional stimulation of the UPR even though the range of the UPR reporter is much greater than the 2-fold induction of UPR seen in the usa1Δder1Δ double mutant (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, by this measure it would appear that the two genes function to alleviate ER stress in a common pathway, consistent with Usa1p mediating the action of Der1p. However, direct degradation studies showed distinct, separable functions for these two proteins. Der1p has been described as being required only for the degradation of lumenal ERAD substrates, such as CPY*, with no effect on membrane-bound substrates such as Hmg2p (15.Sato B.K. Hampton R.Y. Yeast. 2006; 23: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Direct comparison confirmed that this is the case; a der1Δ had no effect on the degradation of Hmg2p-GFP or 6myc-Hmg2p (Fig. 2, B and C) but did stabilize CPY* (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the usa1Δ null mutant stabilized both of the ERAD-M substrates (Fig. 1, B and C) and CPY* (Ref. 3.Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar and Fig. 2E). Furthermore, overexpression of DER1 from the strong TDH3 promoter did not suppress the degradation defect of usa1Δ for either Hmg2p-GFP (Fig. 2D) or CPY* (Fig. 2E). Thus, Usa1p has a broader role in ERAD than Der1p, whose ERAD function is restricted to degradation of ERAD-L substrates. We next examined if Usa1p was important in Hrd1p self-degradation. Hrd1p is associated with and strongly stabilized by Hrd3p. In the absence of Hrd3p, Hrd1p undergoes rapid degradation mediated by its own RING-H2 domain, with a half-life of ∼10 min (Ref. 7.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). This self-degradation indicates regulatory communication between the lumenal Hrd3p and the cytosolic RING domain and has been posited to protect the cell from levels of Hrd1p that exceed the modulatory influence of Hrd3p (4.Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We prepared a hrd3Δ null strain to test the role of Usa1p in Hrd1p self-degradation. In the hrd3Δ background, Hrd1p showed the expected low steady-state levels and rapid degradation when compared with the HRD3 wild type strain (Fig. 3a, wild type versus hrd3Δ). In contrast, a usa1Δ alone had no effect on Hrd1p stability. However, the added presence of the usa1Δ completely inhibited Hrd1p degradation in the hrd3Δ and restored the initial steady-state levels to nearly those of the control HRD3 strain in which Hrd1p is quite stable. Thus, Usa1p was absolutely required for Hrd1p self-destruction. We developed a ubiquitination assay to test if Usa1p was required for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). In the hrd3Δ, the steady-state levels of Hrd1p are quite low, making the detection of ubiquitinated Hrd1p difficult. Accordingly, we treated strains with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to allow accumulation of ubiquitinated Hrd1p and then carried out immunoprecipitation with anti-Hrd1p antibodies followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin or Hrd1p itself. To allow the action of the proteasome inhibitors, a pdr5Δ null mutation was included in all strains (25.Emter R. Heese-Peck A. Kralli A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hrd1p works primarily with the E2 Ubc7p (6.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that the ubiquitination seen in our assay is Ubc7p dependent, shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Because of its rapid degradation, Hrd1p levels differ from strain to strain. We directly compared the ubiquitination state of Hrd1p in the strains tested by loading the same amount of immunoprecipitated Hrd1p in each lane (Fig. 3B). Usa1p was absolutely required for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination; there was no detectable Hrd1p self-ubiquitination in the hrd3Δusa1Δ double null. Thus, Usa1p mediates Hrd1p self-ubiquitination, ultimately resulting in the destruction of Hrd1p. It has been reported that Der1p is required for Hrd1p degradation (26.Plemper R.K. Deak P.M. Otto R.T. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We wondered if the powerful stabilizing effect of usa1Δ on Hrd1p self-degradation was caused by a loss of Usa1p-mediated interaction between Hrd1p and Der1p. We directly compared the effect of either a usa1Δ or der1Δ on Hrd1p degradation in a hrd3Δ strain (Fig. 3C). In the simple case of Usa1p mediating the interaction of Der1p and Hrd1p, the phenotypes would be expected to be the same or perhaps more severe in the der1Δ. In fact, the der1Δ had a modest stabilizing effect on Hrd1p; its phenotype was much weaker than that caused by usa1Δ (Fig. 3C). Similarly, der1Δ had only a small effect on Hrd1p ubiquitination in the hrd3Δ, whereas usa1Δ showed complete inhibition (Fig. 3D). In the course these studies, we discovered an epitope-specific effect that further distinguished Der1p from Usa1p. Hrd1p with a C-terminal triple-HA tag is a reliable, functional version of Hrd1p that we have used in many studies. However, in the usa1Δ background, Hrd1p-3HA shows a reproducible and dramatic mobility shift of ∼12 kDa by gel mobility (supplemental Fig. S3, arrow). This shift was highly specific for the usa1Δ null mutant and for the HA-tagged Hrd1p; it was not observed with native Hrd1p in the previous experiments or with GFP-tagged Hrd1p. The HA-dependent shift was not affected by ubiquitin proteases or N-glycanases. 4S. M. Carroll and R. Y. Hampton, unpublished observation. In light of this ambiguous mobility shift, unless otherwise specified, native untagged Hrd1p was used throughout our work. Whereas the nature of the shift remains unclear, it is nevertheless another way to assess the degree of similarity between usa1Δ and der1Δ mutants. Direct comparison showed that the shift of Hrd1p-3HA was not observed in the der1Δ but was seen in the usa1Δ mutant either with or without Hrd3p present (supplemental Fig. S3, arrow). Thus, by this criterion as well, the losses of Usa1p and Der1p have distinct phenotypes. Hrd1p self-degradation in the absence of Hrd3p is extremely rapid at native levels (Fig. 2A and Refs. 7.Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar and 26.Plemper R.K. Deak P.M. Otto R.T. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, when overexpressed, Hrd1p is degraded sluggishly despite being in great excess of Hrd3p. If Hrd1p self-degradation were autonomous, we would expect all Hrd1p not in complex"
https://openalex.org/W1991343966,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes rearrange nucleosomes by altering the position of DNA around the histone octamer. Although chromatin remodelers and the histone variant H2A.Z colocalize on transcriptional control regions, whether H2A.Z directly affects remodeler association or activity is unclear. We determined the relative association of remodelers with H2A.Z chromatin and tested whether replacement of H2A.Z in a nucleosome altered the activity of remodeling enzymes. Many families of remodelers showed increased association with H2A.Z chromatin, but only the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers showed stimulated activity in vitro. An acidic patch on the nucleosome surface, extended by inclusion of H2A.Z in nucleosomes and essential for viability, is required for ISWI stimulation. We conclude that H2A.Z incorporation increases nucleosome remodeling activity of the largest class of mammalian remodelers (ISWI) and that it correlates with increased association of other remodelers to chromatin. This reveals two possible modes for regulation of a remodeler by a histone variant."
https://openalex.org/W2119864220,"The translocation and accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the nucleus has closely been associated with cell death induction. However, the mechanism of this process has not been completely understood. The E3 ubiquitin ligase siah-1 (seven in absentia homolog 1) has recently been identified as a potential shuttle protein to transport GAPDH from the cytosol to the nucleus. Previously, we have demonstrated that elevated glucose levels induce GAPDH nuclear accumulation in retinal Müller cells. Therefore, this study investigated the role of siah-1 in high glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear translocation and subsequent cell death in retinal Müller cells. High glucose significantly increased siah-1 expression within 12 h. Under hyperglycemic conditions, siah-1 formed a complex with GAPDH and was predominantly localized in the nucleus of Müller cells. siah-1 knockdown using 50 nm siah-1 small interfering RNA significantly decreased high glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation at 24 h by 43.8 ± 4.0%. Further, knockdown of siah-1 prevented high glucose-induced cell death of Müller cells potentially by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation consistent with previous observations, indicating that nuclear GAPDH induces cell death via p53 activation. Therefore, inhibition of GAPDH nuclear translocation and accumulation by targeting siah-1 promotes Müller cell survival under hyperglycemic conditions.

High glucose significantly increased siah-1 expression within 12 h. Under hyperglycemic conditions, siah-1 formed a complex with GAPDH and was predominantly localized in the nucleus of Müller cells. siah-1 knockdown using 50 nm siah-1 small interfering RNA significantly decreased high glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation at 24 h by 43.8 ± 4.0%. Further, knockdown of siah-1 prevented high glucose-induced cell death of Müller cells potentially by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation consistent with previous observations, indicating that nuclear GAPDH induces cell death via p53 activation. Therefore, inhibition of GAPDH nuclear translocation and accumulation by targeting siah-1 promotes Müller cell survival under hyperglycemic conditions."

Proteomic analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and isolated cancer cells and cell lines provide alternative methods for identification of potential cancer markers that would be detectable in human blood using sensitive assays. The goal of this work is to evaluate the utility of an integrative strategy using these two approaches for biomarker discovery.We investigated a strategy that combined quantitative plasma proteomics of an ovarian cancer mouse model with analysis of proteins secreted or shed by human ovarian cancer cells. Of 106 plasma proteins identified with increased levels in tumor bearing mice, 58 were also secreted or shed from ovarian cancer cells. The remainder consisted primarily of host-response proteins. Of 25 proteins identified in the study that were assayed, 8 mostly secreted proteins common to mouse plasma and human cancer cells were significantly upregulated in a set of plasmas from ovarian cancer patients. Five of the eight proteins were confirmed to be upregulated in a second independent set of ovarian cancer plasmas, including in early stage disease.Integrated proteomic analysis of cancer mouse models and human cancer cell populations provides an effective approach to identify potential circulating protein biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2049379366,"Paenibacillus barcinonensis is a soil bacterium bearing a complex set of enzymes for xylan degradation, including several secreted enzymes and Xyn10B, one of the few intracellular xylanases reported to date. The crystal structure of Xyn10B has been determined by x-ray analysis. The enzyme folds into the typical (β/α)8 barrel of family 10 glycosyl hydrolases (GH10), with additional secondary structure elements within the β/α motifs. One of these loops -L7- located at the β7 C terminus, was essential for xylanase activity as its partial deletion yielded an inactive enzyme. The loop contains residues His249–Glu250, which shape a pocket opened to solvent in close proximity to the +2 subsite, which has not been described in other GH10 enzymes. This wide cavity at the +2 subsite, where methyl-2,4-pentanediol from the crystallization medium was found, is a noteworthy feature of Xyn10B, as compared with the narrow crevice described for other GH10 xylanases. Docking analysis showed that this open cavity can accommodate glucuronic acid decorations of xylo-oligosaccharides. Co-crystallization experiments with conduramine derivative inhibitors supported the importance of this open cavity at the +2 subsite for Xyn10B activity. Several mutant derivatives of Xyn10B with improved thermal stability were obtained by forced evolution. Among them, mutant xylanases S15L and M93V showed increased half-life, whereas the double mutant S15L/M93V exhibited a further increase in stability, showing a 20-fold higher heat resistance than the wild type xylanase. All the mutations obtained were located on the surface of Xyn10B. Replacement of a Ser by a Leu residue in mutant xylanase S15L can increase hydrophobic packing efficiency and fill a superficial indentation of the protein, giving rise to a more compact structure of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2046281288,"Erythrocyte invasion is critical to the pathogenesis and survival of the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. This process is partly mediated by proteins that belong to the Duffy binding-like family, which are expressed on the merozoite surface. One of these proteins, BAEBL (also known as EBA-140), is thought to bind to glycophorin C in a sialic acid-dependent manner. In this report, by the binding assay between recombinant BAEBL protein and enzyme-treated erythrocytes, we show that the binding of BAEBL to erythrocytes is mediated primarily by sialic acid and partially through heparan sulfate (HS). Because BAEBL binds to several kinds of HS proteoglycans or purified HS, the BAEBL-HS binding was found to be independent of the HS proteoglycan peptide backbone and the presence of sialic acid moieties. Furthermore, both the sialic acid- and HS-dependent binding were disrupted by the addition of soluble heparin. This inhibition may be the result of binding between BAEBL and heparin. Invasion assays demonstrated that HS-dependent binding was related to the efficiency of merozoite invasion. These results suggest that HS functions as a factor that promotes the binding of BAEBL and merozoite invasion. Moreover, these findings may explain the invasion inhibition mechanisms observed following the addition of heparin and other sulfated glycoconjugates."

It is thought that glycosylated ERAD substrates are subjected to deglycosylation by the cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase). This pathway implicates a close functional interaction between the ER export machinery, deglycosylating enzymes, and the proteasome (3Suzuki T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two interacting proteins, Png1 and Rad23, are suspected to play important roles in maintaining a close interaction between the ER export machinery and the proteasome and in the deglycosylation process itself (4Kim I.

Functional studies indicate that Png1 is the only deglycosylating enzyme acting on N-glycans in the cytosol, and yeast png1Δ cells were found to have no detectable in vitro and in vivo PNGase activity (4Kim I.

Yeast as well as mouse Png1 binds Rad23, which in turn promotes a direct interaction of this complex with the proteasome. Deletion of yeast Rad23 or down-regulation of its animal/human orthologs results in the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteasome substrates (4Kim I. Ahn J. Liu C. Tanabe K. Apodaca J. Suzuki T. Rao H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, Rad23 has been proposed to facilitate the substrate transfer to the proteasome. In addition to its assistance in protein deglycosylation, Rad23 forms a complex with Rad4 that recognizes and binds damaged DNA during nucleotide excision repair (17Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Despite the evidence for the involvement of the Png1-Rad23 complex in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, the turnover of most ERAD substrates is not affected by inhibition of PNGase activity (4Kim I.

Furthermore, deletion or down-regulation of Png1 does not result in any observable growth defect, raising questions about the significance of Png1 as an important enzyme in the proteolytic process in vivo. Unfortunately, no mutants in other systems but budding yeast have yet been described, thus precluding a more detailed analysis of Png1 function(s) in vivo. Filamentous fungi share, along with neurons and pollen tubes, the distinction of being among the most highly polarized cells in nature (21Palanivelu R. Preuss D.

Polarity in these organisms is established during spore germination, which results in the emergence of a highly polarized hypha that continues to grow by apical extension. Here we characterize PNG1 from the filamentous ascomycete N. crassa (designated NcPNG1) as being essential for establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity despite the fact that naturally occurring changes of critical residues within the catalytic center of NcPNG1 preclude any enzymatic activity of the protein. The substitution of these catalytic residues is conserved in many orthologs of the fungal kingdom, implying a so far unrecognized cellular function of PNG1 that is unrelated to protein deglycosylation. Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 (see also Ref. 24McCluskey K. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2003; 52: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). General genetic procedures for N. crassa are available at the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC). Vogel’s minimal medium was supplemented with 1.5% agar, 2% sucrose, and 1% yeast extract. The final inhibitor concentrations for the growth assays were: 5 mg/ml lysing enzymes (Sigma), 0.02 μm caspofungin (MSD Sharp & Dohme GmbH), 5 μm polyoxin D (Kaken Chemical Co.), 0.05 μm latrunculin A (Sigma), 0.1 μg/ml bemonyl (Sigma), 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem), 10 μg/ml nourseothicin (Werner BioAgents), and 10 μm MG-132 (Sigma).

Microscopic documentation of fungal hyphae or colonies was performed with an SZX16 stereomicroscope, equipped with a ColorView III camera and cellD imaging software (Olympus).

The nourseothricin concentration was adjusted to 30 μg/ml to select for transformants. N. crassa png-1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR with cDNA prepared from vegetative hyphae. The primers used were 5′-ATG GCA GGA AAC AAT TCA G-3′ and 5′-TCA AGG TCC ATA CGT CGG-3′, respectively. Total RNA was obtained by TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen); cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subcloned into TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen; designated TOPO-TA-png-1). In the process of generating full-length cDNA of png-1, we found that its open reading frame is 90 bp larger than the predicted gene at the BROAD data base. The insertion was amplified with the primers 5′-CGG AAT TCG ATG GCA GGA AAC AAT TCA GGG G-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT AGG TCC ATA CGT CGG CCA G-3′, containing the restriction sites EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, and cloned into pET28b vector (Novagen), resulting in pET-NcPNG1(His)6. Primers used for the mutagenesis of ScPng1 and NcPNG1 are listed in supplemental Table 1.

The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRV and was cloned into the equivalent site of pRS423GPD vector (2μ HIS3; ATCC). The direction of ccdB gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The png-1 gene in pENTR vector was then cloned into the destination vector by the LR Clonase II reaction (Invitrogen) to generate pRS423GPD-NcPNG1-FLAG. pRS423GPD-ScPNG1 was constructed in an analogous approach. Soluble protein prepared from BL21 cells was subjected to PNGase assays as described previously (26Suzuki T. Methods. 2005; 35: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycan binding ability was assayed as described previously (27Suzuki T. Hara I. Nakano M. Zhao G. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Taniguchi N. Totani K. Matsuo I. Ito Y. J. Biol.

Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and NcPNG1 extracts were prepared by the same extraction method. Enzyme expression was quantified either by Western blotting with anti-His antibody or by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, using Multi Gauge version 2.2 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). In vivo PNGase activity was assayed as described previously (28Tanabe K. Lennarz W.J. Suzuki T. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, 108 yeast cells bearing pRS315GPD-RTA and pRS423GPD, pRS423GPD-ScPNG1, or pRS423GPD-NcPNG1-FLAG were harvested and incubated in 0.1 m NaOH at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifugation at 3000 × g, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 5% sucrose, 0.04% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Equal amounts of each sample were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to BiotraceTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PALL Corp.). Ricin A chain (RTA) was detected using anti-ricin monoclonal antibody (CP75; Abcam) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T (25 mm Tri-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2% skimmed milk) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T. Detection was carried out with the ImmobilonTM Western blot chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate system in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore). To confirm the expression of NcPNG1-FLAG, Western blotting of the extract was carried out using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (M2; Sigma). Multiple alleles of png-1 were isolated in a large scale genetic screen for conditional mutants defective in hyphal morphogenesis (29Seiler S. Plamann M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4352-4364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We focused on png-1(9-1) and png-1(10-2) for a detailed analysis (Fig. 1A). Germination and growth rate as well as hyphal morphology and branching frequency of both conditional mutants were similar to wild type at permissive conditions (25 °C). Within 2 h of transferring them to 37 °C, we observed cessation of tip extension. In contrast to the wild type apex, the tips of png-1(9-1) and png-1(10-2) started to lose polarity, generating balloon-shaped hyphal tips. Concomitant with this growth arrest was the induction of multiple subapical branches in the mutant hyphae that also stopped extension and started to swell apolarly. Transfer back to permissive conditions resulted in growing tips with normal growth rates, diameter, and morphology within 1 h. From one to multiple new tips were generated from each swollen tip, indicating that cell polarity determinants were lost from their apical location and had to be re-established. After prolonged incubation at restrictive temperature, these spherical tips burst, and hyphae lysed. Germination of conidia from both strains under restrictive conditions resulted in apolar and abnormal growth and lysis of large, swollen germlings. A deletion strain of png-1 was available through the N. crassa Genome Project (30Dunlap J.C. Borkovich K.A. Henn M.R. Turner G.E. Sachs M.S. Glass N.L. McCluskey K. Plamann M. Galagan J.E.

Its heterocaryotic nature already suggested an important function of NcPNG1. When we plated asexually derived multinucleate conidiospores on selective medium, we detected a mixture of normal growing germlings and isotropically growing spores (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we were unable to obtain viable hygromycin-resistant ascospores from wild type × Δpng-1::hph + png-1+ crosses. The majority of the hygR ascospores did germinate in an apolar manner, indicating that NcPNG1 is required for polarity establishment in both types of spores. Rarely, we observed the formation of small hygR colonies, which showed highly abnormal growth and a high rate of cell lysis. In summary, we conclude that NcPNG1 is an essential protein required for establishing and maintaining cellular polarity. The fungal cell wall and the actin cytoskeleton are key elements to determine cell polarity (31Park H.O. Bi E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 48-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 32Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 605-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In line with the observed defects characterized by loss of polarity and cell lysis, we observed hypersensitivity of the conditional strains to lysing enzymes, a general cell wall-degrading enzyme mix containing a mixture of protease, glucanase, and chitinase activities (Fig. 2A). Most notably, polar germination of png-1(9-1) was completely abolished, and only large apolar spheres were generated when conidia were grown under either permissive or semipermissive conditions (Fig. 2B). No altered sensitivity of the png-1 strains to the β1,3-glucan synthase and chitin synthase inhibitors caspofungin and polyoxin D, respectively, was detected. Thus, NcPNG1 is not involved in the organization of the two major structural polysaccharide components of the fungal cell wall. Protein biosynthesis and proteasome function were monitored by growth on hygromycin B, nourseothricin, and MG-132 (data not shown and Fig. 2A). All mutants displayed sensitivities similar to the wild type control, indicating a specific function of NcPNG1 in regulating cell wall integrity and not protein turnover. Png1 has been shown to form a complex with Rad23 in yeast and mouse (5Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which may facilitate the transfer of misfolded, glycosylated proteins to the proteasome. N. crassa Δrad-23 displayed wild type characteristics for all parameters tested (germination and growth rate, hyphal morphology, (a)sexual development) and behaved similar to wild type in all growth tests with the above mentioned inhibitors (Fig. 2A). Because of the involvement of Rad23 in DNA repair (17Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we compared the sensitivity of wild type, png-1, and Δrad-23 mutants against the DNA-damaging agents methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), camptothecin (CPT), or 4-nitrochinoline-N-oxide (4NQ) (Fig. 2C). We observed a 15, 20, and 25% reduced viability of Δrad-23 against methyl methane sulfonate, camptothecin, and 4-nitrochinoline-N-oxide, respectively, when compared with wild type grown on sublethal concentrations of these drugs. No reduced viability was observed for both conditional png-1 strains. Based on these assays, NcRAD23 and NcPNG1 have distinct functions and are involved in DNA repair and in regulating cell wall integrity, respectively. We were not able to detect any involvement of PNG1 and RAD23 in protein turnover. To determine residues that are important for NcPNG1 function, we sequenced several conditional png-1 mutants. All mutations identified resulted in changes in well conserved residues within the core domain of PNG1 (Fig. 3A). Among the mutations observed, Glu-239 (corresponding to Glu-222 in ScPng1) was previously reported to be important for the enzymatic activity of ScPng1 (34Katiyar S. Suzuki T. Balgobin B.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12953-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutant defects may be a result of impaired enzyme activity. However, two out of three residues that constitute the catalytic triad of the enzyme and are essential for PNGase activity in yeast and animals (8Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki T. Tanabe K. Hara I. Taniguchi N. Colavita A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Specifically, amino acids 208 and 235 (corresponding to ScPng1 Cys-191 and His-218) were substituted for Ala and Tyr, making it unlikely that PNG1 is an active enzyme in vivo. To confirm that the essential function of PNG1 is unrelated to protein deglycosylation, we complemented png-1(9-1) with wild type ScPng1 and ScPng1(C191A). Both yeast proteins, and NcPNG1 as control, complemented the growth defects of png-1(9-1) (Fig. 3B), indicating that enzyme activity of PNG1 is not required for its morphogenetic function. In a second approach to support this surprising finding that NcPNG1 is not a functional enzyme, we utilized yeast png1Δ cells expressing RTA as a known in vivo substrate of PNGase (4Kim I. Ahn J. Liu C. Tanabe K. Apodaca J. Suzuki T. Rao H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NcPNG1 was expressed well in yeast, as judged by Western blotting analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3C, expression of NcPNG1 did not result in conversion of the glycosylated g1 form of RTA to the deglycosylated g0 form, providing additional support that NcPNG1 lacks deglycosylating activity in vivo. Thus, we tested whether substitutions of the catalytic residues were enough to render NcPNG1 an active enzyme. However, PNGase activity was still absent in NcPNG1 carrying a functional catalytic triad (NcPNG1(A208C,Y235H); Table 2). Thus, we performed an extensive mutagenesis analysis in which PNGase-active ScPng1 was mutagenized to residue(s) found at corresponding position(s) in NcPNG1 to determine additional residues required for PNGase activity. We identified amino acid Glu-193 of ScPng1 (equivalent to Asp-210 in NcPNG1); the N. crassa substitution abolished the activity of ScPng1(E210D) (Table 2). In addition, double substitution of ScPng1 Ile-181 and Lys-182 to Trp and Gln (the corresponding N. crassa residues) also caused loss of enzyme activity (Table 2), clearly indicating that other residues in addition to substitutions in catalytic triad are the cause for enzyme-inactive NcPNG1. These data confirm that the cellular importance of NcPNG1 is not dependent on deglycosylation activity.TABLE 2PNGase activity in point mutated fungal PNG1 proteinsRelative activityaRelative activity was calculated by quantifying the specific activity (PNGase activity per enzyme amount).

Binding of ScPng1 to glycans such as iodoacetamide-Man8GlcNAc2 can be monitored by its increase in molecular weight and can be detected by a shift in migration in SDS-PAGE (27Suzuki T. Hara I.

The amino acids important for binding to chitobiose were conserved in NcPng1 (Fig. 3A) except for the catalytic His-235 and the probe-reacting Cys-208 (35Zhao G. Li G. Zhou X. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether NcPNG1 was able to bind to carbohydrate probes after substituting the two critical residues (Fig. 4). Wild type NcPNG1 as well as NcPNG1(Y235H) or NcPNG1(A208C) did not bind to the probe. When we introduced both mutations generating NcPNG1(A208C,Y235H), its carbohydrate binding property was partially regained, indicating that NcPNG1 has lost not only its PNGase activity but also the chitobiose binding property. Interestingly, the catalytic Cys and His residues are not conserved in most filamentous fungal species (supplemental Fig. 1). For example, png-1 genes of most sequenced mold genomes have Cys to Ala/Val and His to Tyr substitutions in their catalytic centers. Moreover, the second CXXC motif that is required for zinc chelating and for PNGase activity (18Suzuki T. Park H. Lennarz W.J.

Here, we describe the functional characterization of PNG1 in N. crassa, a highly conserved protein that was previously thought to be primarily involved in the degradation of misfolded glycosylated proteins. However, NcPNG1 is an essential protein required for establishing and maintaining cell polarity despite its lack of enzymatic activity and inability to bind N-linked glycans such as iodoacetamide-Man8GlcNAc2. This may be achieved by regulating the fungal cell (which may be considered as having analogous functions as the animal extracellular matrix) by a mechanism that does not affect the major structural polysaccharides β-glucan and chitin. It is interesting that most PNG1 relatives of the fungal kingdom lack residues required for enzymatic function, implying a so far unrecognized cellular function of PNG1 that is unrelated to protein deglycosylation. We propose that this is a conserved aspect of PNG1 in fungi and potentially also in higher eukaryotes. However, its non-enzymatic function may only become apparent in highly polar cells such as fungal hyphae or neuronal cells in animals. The surprising finding of this study is that NcPNG1 is most likely not acting as PNGase in N. crassa and related fungi. This conclusion is based on the following experiments and observations. (a) The catalytic residues cysteine and histidine are substituted to alanine and tyrosine, respectively, in NcPNG1. These residues are essential for transglutaminase/PNGase activity in all so far tested enzymes from various organisms (budding yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells) using a range of different substrates (heat-denatured ovalbumin, S-alkylated RNase B, fetuin-derived glycopeptides as in vitro substrates; non-toxic ricin A-chain and T cell receptor α subunit as in vivo substrates) (8Hirsch C.

Moreover, the catalytic cysteine was found to be modified by the PNGase inhibitors Z-Vad-fmk and haloacetamidyl-oligosaccharides in yeast and mammalian PNGases (19Misaghi S. Pacold M.E. Blom D.

Also, structural analyses have identified this cysteine as the sole catalytic nucleophile required for the deglycosylation reaction (27Suzuki T. Hara I. Nakano M. Zhao G. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H.

(b) The lack of in vitro deglycosylation activity and carbohydrate binding property of NcPNG1 was determined by two independent assays. Using these assays, we have identified additional NcPNG1 residues that abolish in vitro PNGase activity when introduced into ScPNG1. Furthermore, NcPNG1 is inactive when expressed in the yeast context. (c) Most importantly, the N. crassa mutant can be complemented with an enzymatically inactive version of the S. cerevisiae protein in vivo, making the requirement of species-specific cofactors or interacting proteins unlikely. In summary, we believe that these data are convincing arguments that the in vivo importance of the PNGase ortholog in N. crassa is not related to its enzymatic activity. Although the cytoplasmic deglycosylation activity performed by PNG1 is apparently missing in molds, a different PNGase activity has been observed in Aspergillus tubingensis (Ref. 43Ftouhi-Paquin N. Hauer C.R. Stack R.F. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22960-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar corresponding to NCU04643 in N. crassa). Although the cellular function of this enzyme is still unstudied, its enzymatic properties (e.g. requirement of acidic pH for enzyme activity) as well as its character as N-glycosylated protein make it unlikely that this acidic PNGase can substitute the deglycosylation function of the cytoplasmic PNGase in the ERAD process. The identified point mutations in our conditional mutants are substitutions in conserved residues that seem primarily involved in the stabilization of protein structure and thus do not allow functional conclusions without structural information for NcPNG1. Because residues involved in the Rad23-Png1 interaction in yeast and mammals are distinct, the identified mutations may affect species-specific interactions of this complex in N. crassa, but our current data argue against a connection between PNG1 and RAD23 in N. crassa. However, we found that Δrad-23;png-1(9-1) and Δrad-23;png-1(10-2) double mutants displayed weak synthetic growth defects (23 and 27% reduced growth, respectively), making some degree of overlapping functions of the two proteins possible. In summary, the enzymatic properties of PNGase have been studied for many years in vitro, but most ERAD substrates susceptible for deglycosylation are efficiently degraded even in the absence of Png1 (6Suzuki T.

The essential nature and the presence of conditional mutants make N. crassa PNG1 a prime model for deciphering the non-enzymatic function of PNG1.

The resulting fusion protein has no DNA binding motifs but possesses protein-protein interaction domains that are believed to mediate association with chromatin remodeling complexes. Despite recent advances in the identification of molecules that interact with SYT-SSX and with the corresponding wild type SYT and SSX proteins, the mechanisms whereby the SYT-SSX might contribute to neoplastic transformation remain unclear. Epigenetic deregulation has been suggested to be one possible mechanism.We addressed the effect of SYT/SSX expression on the transcriptome of four independent isolates of primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). We observed transcriptional changes similar to the gene expression signature of synovial sarcoma, principally involving genes whose regulation is linked to epigenetic factors, including imprinted genes, genes with transcription start sites within a CpG island and chromatin related genes. Single population analysis revealed hMSC isolate-specific transcriptional changes involving genes that are important for biological functions of stem cells as well as genes that are considered to be molecular markers of synovial sarcoma including IGF2, EPHRINS, and BCL2. Methylation status analysis of sequences at the H19/IGF2 imprinted locus indicated that distinct epigenetic features characterize hMSC populations and condition the transcriptional effects of SYT-SSX expression.Our observations suggest that epigenetic features may define the cellular microenvironment in which SYT-SSX displays its functional effects."

https://openalex.org/W1979171839,"Host defense against infection is induced by Toll-like and interleukin (IL)-1 receptors, and controlled by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Our earlier studies have shown that IL-1 activation impacts cytoskeletal structure and that IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) function is substrate-dependent. Here we identify a novel regulatory component, TILRR, which amplifies activation of IL-1RI and coordinates IL-1-induced control with mechanotransduction. We show that TILRR is a highly conserved and widely expressed enhancer of IL-1-regulated inflammatory responses and, further, that it is a membrane-bound glycosylated protein with sequence homology to members of the FRAS-1 family. We demonstrate that TILRR is recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex and magnifies signal amplification by increasing receptor expression and ligand binding. In addition, we show that the consequent potentiation of NF-kappaB is controlled through IL-1RI-associated signaling components in coordination with activation of the Ras GTPase. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that TILRR function is dependent on association with its signaling partner and, further, that formation of the TILRR-containing IL-1RI complex imparts enhanced association of the MyD88 adapter during ligand-induced activation of NF-kappaB. We conclude that TILRR is an IL-1RI co-receptor, which associates with the signaling receptor complex to enhance recruitment of MyD88 and control Ras-dependent amplification of NF-kappaB and inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1980797407,"Outer hair cell (OHC) or prestin-based electromotility is an active cochlear amplifier in the mammalian inner ear that can increase hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity. In situ, Deiters supporting cells are well-coupled by gap junctions and constrain OHCs standing on the basilar membrane. Here, we report that both electrical and mechanical stimulations in Deiters cells (DCs) can modulate OHC electromotility. There was no direct electrical conductance between the DCs and the OHCs. However, depolarization in DCs reduced OHC electromotility associated nonlinear capacitance (NLC) and distortion products. Increase in the turgor pressure of DCs also shifted OHC NLC to the negative voltage direction. Destruction of the cytoskeleton in DCs or dissociation of the mechanical-coupling between DCs and OHCs abolished these effects, indicating the modulation through the cytoskeleton activation and DC-OHC mechanical coupling rather than via electric field potentials. We also found that changes in gap junctional coupling between DCs induced large membrane potential and current changes in the DCs and shifted OHC NLC. Uncoupling of gap junctions between DCs shifted NLC to the negative direction. These data indicate that DCs not only provide a physical scaffold to support OHCs but also can directly modulate OHC electromotility through the DC-OHC mechanical coupling. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of cochlear supporting cells and gap junctional coupling to modulate OHC electromotility and eventually hearing sensitivity in the inner ear."

It is unclear whether this is mediated by antibodies to the neuraminidase (NA) or haemagglutinin (HA). We use pseudoviral particles (H5pp) coated with H5 haemagglutinin but not N1 neuraminidase to address this question. In this study, we investigate whether cross-neutralizing antibodies in persons unexposed to H5N1 is reactive to the H5 haemagglutinin.We measured H5-neutralization antibody titers pre- and post-vaccination using the H5N1 micro-neutralization test (MN) and H5pp tests in subjects given seasonal vaccines and in selected sera from European elderly volunteers in a H5N1 vaccine trial who had detectable pre-vaccination H5N1 MN antibody titers. We found detectable (titer > or = 20) H5N1 neutralizing antibodies in a minority of pre-seasonal vaccine sera and evidence of a serological response to H5N1 in others after seasonal influenza vaccination. There was excellent correlation in the antibody titers between the H5N1 MN and H5pp tests. Similar correlations were found between MN and H5pp in the pre-vaccine sera from the cohort of H5N1 vaccine trial recipients.Heterosubtype neutralizing antibody to H5N1 in healthy volunteers unexposed to H5N1 is mediated by cross-reaction to the H5 haemagglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W2094645048,"Genetic differences both between individuals and populations are studied for their evolutionary relevance and for their potential medical applications. Most of the genetic differentiation among populations are caused by random drift that should affect all loci across the genome in a similar manner. When a locus shows extraordinary high or low levels of population differentiation, this may be interpreted as evidence for natural selection. The most used measure of population differentiation was devised by Wright and is known as fixation index, or F(ST). We performed a genome-wide estimation of F(ST) on about 4 millions of SNPs from HapMap project data. We demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of F(ST) values between autosomes and heterochromosomes. When we compared the F(ST) values obtained in this study with another evolutionary measure obtained by comparative interspecific approach, we found that genes under positive selection appeared to show low levels of population differentiation. We applied a gene set approach, widely used for microarray data analysis, to detect functional pathways under selection. We found that one pathway related to antigen processing and presentation showed low levels of F(ST), while several pathways related to cell signalling, growth and morphogenesis showed high F(ST) values. Finally, we detected a signature of selection within genes associated with human complex diseases. These results can help to identify which process occurred during human evolution and adaptation to different environments. They also support the hypothesis that common diseases could have a genetic background shaped by human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2063101779,"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a mechanism that increases the protein diversity of a single gene by differential exon inclusion/exclusion during post-transcriptional processing. While alternative splicing is established to occur during lymphocyte activation, little is known about the role it plays during the immune response. Our study is among the first reports of a systematic genome-wide analysis of activated human T and B lymphocytes using whole exon DNA microarrays integrating alternative splicing and differential gene expression. Purified human CD2(+) T or CD19(+) B cells were activated using protocols to model the early events in post-transplant allograft immunity and sampled as a function of time during the process of immune activation. Here we show that 3 distinct classes of alternatively spliced and/or differentially expressed genes change in an ordered manner as a function of immune activation. We mapped our results to function-based canonical pathways and demonstrated that some are populated by only one class of genes, like integrin signaling, while other pathways, such as purine metabolism and T cell receptor signaling, are populated by all three classes of genes. Our studies augment the current view of T and B cell activation in immunity that has been based exclusively upon differential gene expression by providing evidence for a large number of molecular networks populated as a function of time and activation by alternatively spliced genes, many of which are constitutively expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1990833847,"In prion diseases, the infectious isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) may subvert a normal, physiological activity of the cellular isoform (PrP(C)). A deletion mutant of the prion protein (Delta105-125) that produces a neonatal lethal phenotype when expressed in transgenic mice provides a window into the normal function of PrP(C) and how it can be corrupted to produce neurotoxic effects. We report here the surprising and unexpected observation that cells expressing Delta105-125 PrP and related mutants are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of two classes of antibiotics (aminoglycosides and bleomycin analogues) that are commonly used for selection of stably transfected cell lines. This unusual phenomenon mimics several essential features of Delta105-125 PrP toxicity seen in transgenic mice, including rescue by co-expression of wild type PrP. Cells expressing Delta105-125 PrP are susceptible to drug toxicity within minutes, suggesting that the mutant protein enhances cellular accumulation of these cationic compounds. Our results establish a screenable cellular phenotype for the activity of neurotoxic forms of PrP, and they suggest possible mechanisms by which these molecules could produce their pathological effects in vivo."

Previously we reported that a blueberry-enriched diet (BD) attenuated necroapoptosis and inflammation in periinfarct area in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI).To test the hypothesis that BD will attenuate the course of CHF, including mortality and cardiac remodeling during the first year after induction of MI in rats.Two weeks after coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into two groups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and then 12-mo dietary regimens were initiated as follows: ad libitum regular diet (control, CD, n = 27) and isocaloric food with 2% blueberry supplement (BD, n = 27) also available ad libitum. These dietary groups were compared to each other and to sham group (SH). Mortality over the 12 mo was reduced by 22% in BD compared with CD (p<0.01). In the course of developing CHF, BD had no effect on the body weight, heart rate or blood pressure. Bi-monthly Echo revealed significant attenuation of the LV chamber remodeling, LV posterior wall thinning, and MI expansion in BD compared with CD. In fact, BD arrested the MI expansion.This is the first experimental evidence that a blueberry-enriched diet has positive effects on the course of CHF and thus warrants consideration for clinical evaluation."

During hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is stabilized, thus maintaining expression of p27Kip1, which inhibits Rb phosphorylation.

A CYP86A22 cDNA was isolated from a developing stigma cDNA library, and the corresponding gene was shown to express predominantly in the developing stigma. Among six P450 genes isolated from this library, only CYP86A22 was implicated in ω-hydroxylation following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression. Unlike wild-type plants in which ω-hydroxy fatty acids (mainly in the form of 18-hydroxy oleic acid and 18-hydroxy linoleic acid) compose 96% of total stigma fatty acids, the ω-hydroxy fatty acids were essentially absent in the stigmas from 18 of 46 CYP86A22-RNAi transgenic plants and had varying levels of suppression in the remaining 28 plants.

https://openalex.org/W1988887879,"Steroid hormones induce transcription of their responsive genes by complex mechanisms including synergism between the hormone receptors and other transcription factors. On the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter progesterone induction is mediated by the reciprocal synergism between progesterone receptor (PR) and the ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor 1 (NF1). PR binding mediates ATP-dependent displacement of histone H2A and H2B, enabling NF1 access to its target site. In minichromosomes assembled in vitro NF1 binding facilitates access of PR to the hormone-responsive elements (HREs) by precluding reforming of the histone octamer, but the function of NF1 in living cells remains unclear. Here we show that depleting NF1 by small interfering RNAs or mutating the NF1-binding site significantly compromises transcription of the MMTV promoter. The central HREs 2 and 3 are not needed for ATP-dependent H2A/H2B displacement or NF1 binding but are critical for full PR binding and MMTV transactivation. We found that NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter on a H3/H4 histone tetramer particle exposes the central HREs and facilitates their binding by PR, suggesting a possible mechanism for the reciprocal synergism between PR and NF1."

Normal skin architecture is dependent both on the coordinated proliferation and stratification of keratinocytes, as well as the maintenance of a collagen-rich basement membrane. In the present studies we sought to determine whether expression of H-ras in skin keratinocytes would affect these parameters during the establishment and maintenance of an in vitro skin equivalent.Previously described cdk4 and hTERT immortalized foreskin keratinocytes were engineered to express ectopically introduced H-ras. Skin equivalents, composed of normal fibroblast-contracted collagen gels overlaid with keratinocytes (immortal or immortal expressing H-ras), were prepared and incubated for 3 weeks. Harvested tissues were processed and sectioned for histology and antibody staining. Antigens specific to differentiation (involucrin, keratin-14, p63), basement-membrane formation (collagen IV, laminin-5), and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT; e-cadherin, vimentin) were studied. Results showed that H-ras keratinocytes produced an invasive, disorganized epithelium most apparent in the lower strata while immortalized keratinocytes fully stratified without invasive properties. The superficial strata retained morphologically normal characteristics. Vimentin and p63 co-localization increased with H-ras overexpression, similar to basal wound-healing keratinocytes. In contrast, the cdk4 and hTERT immortalized keratinocytes differentiated similarly to normal unimmortalized keratinocytes.The use of isogenic derivatives of stable immortalized keratinocytes with specified genetic alterations may be helpful in developing more robust in vitro models of cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2152343927,"Cyclophilin B (CyPB) induces migration and adhesion of T lymphocytes via a mechanism that requires interaction with 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate (HS). HS biosynthesis is a complex process with many sulfotransferases involved. N-Deacetylases/N-sulfotransferases are responsible for N-sulfation, which is essential for subsequent modification steps, whereas 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) catalyze the least abundant modification. These enzymes are represented by several isoforms, which differ in term of distribution pattern, suggesting their involvement in making tissue-specific HS. To elucidate how the specificity of CyPB binding is determined, we explored the relationships between the expression of these sulfotransferases and the generation of HS motifs with CyPB-binding properties. We demonstrated that high N-sulfate density and the presence of 2-O- and 3-O-sulfates determine binding of CyPB, as evidenced by competitive experiments with heparin derivatives, soluble HS, and anti-HS antibodies. We then showed that target cells, i.e. CD4+ lymphocyte subsets, monocytes/macrophages, and related cell lines, specifically expressed high levels of NDST2 and 3-OST3 isoforms. Silencing the expression of NDST1, NDST2, 2-OST, and 3-OST3 by RNA interference efficiently decreased binding and activity of CyPB, thus confirming their involvement in the biosynthesis of binding sequences for CyPB. Moreover, we demonstrated that NDST1 was able to partially sulfate exogenous substrate in the absence of NDST2 but not vice versa, suggesting that both isoenzymes do not have redundant activities but do have rather complementary activities in making N-sulfated sequences with CyPB-binding properties. Altogether, these results suggest a regulatory mechanism in which cell type-specific expression of certain HS sulfotransferases determines the specific binding of CyPB to target cells."

The formation of these processes is caused by the initiation of a complex signaling cascade, which involves lipid rafts, as well as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Fyn, and Cdc42 (22McCroskery S. Chaudhry A. Lin L. Daniels M.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Ramseger R. White R. Kröger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7697-7705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The function of the filopodia-like processes in the developing CNS is unknown, but they might represent initial stages during the formation of excitatory spine synapses (24Matsumoto-Miyai K. Sokolowska E. Zurlinden A. Gee C.E. Lüscher D. Hettwer S. Wölfel J. Ladner A.P. Ster J. Gerber U. Rülicke T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Cell. 2009; 136: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, mice that lack CNS agrin develop 30% fewer glutamatergic synapses (11Ksiazek I. Burkhardt C. Lin S. Seddik R. Maj M. Bezakova G. Jucker M. Arber S. Caroni P. Sanes J.R. Bettler B. Ruegg M.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7183-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrate that overexpression of TM-agrin in non-neuronal cell lines can induce processes similar to those induced in CNS neurites, suggesting that the process-inducing activity of TM-agrin is not limited to nerve cells. We also investigated the structural requirements for the process-inducing activity of TM-agrin by mapping the region necessary for this activity. Our results show that an aspartic acid residue within the seventh follistatin-like domain is essential for process induction. This particular amino acid is highly conserved in other follistatin-like domains of TM-agrin. Accordingly, the seventh follistatin-like domain could functionally be replaced by the first or sixth follistatin-like domain. These data show that follistatin-like domains are critical for process formation and support a role for TM-agrin as a receptor or co-receptor in the developing CNS.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to identify the structural basis for the TM-agrin-mediated formation of filopodia-like processes. Our results demonstrate three requirements for TM-agrin process-inducing activity: An association of TM-agrin with the plasma membrane, the integrity of the loop between β-sheet 3 and 4 within the seventh follistatin-like domain, and a critical distance of the follistatin-like domain to the plasma membrane. Follistatin-like domains are common structural components of extracellular matrix proteins, including for example SPARC/osteonectin/BM-40 (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Lane T.F. Pallero M.A. Sage E.H. J. Cell.

Commun. 1999; 266: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although follistatin-like domains are present in a number of extracellular matrix proteins, little is known about their function. It is, however, generally assumed that follistatin-like modules acquire different functions depending on their structural setting (43Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that follistatin-like domain 7 of TM- agrin is essential for the formation of filopodia-like processes when expressed in neurons and non-neuronal cells. Moreover, because the expression of chick TM-agrin cDNA can induce processes for example in human HEK293 cells or monkey COS-7 cells, the effect appears to be species-independent, suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism for process induction. In agreement with this result is the recent demonstration that the formation of the processes is the result of the activation of a signaling cascade that involves partitioning of TM-agrin into sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane subdomains called lipid rafts (23Ramseger R. White R. Kröger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7697-7705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are almost ubiquitously present signaling platforms with important functions during CNS development and synapse formation (for review see Refs. 44Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 45Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The widespread presence of lipid rafts in almost all eukaryotic cells might explain the formation of processes after transfection of TM-agrin into a wide variety of cell types from different species. Likewise, the involvement of the ubiquitous lipid rafts might also explain the formation of filopodia-like processes in response to overexpression of several other proteins, including for example the transmembrane proteoglycan syndecan (46Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Tenascin-R (47Zacharias U. Leuschner R. Nörenberg U. Rathjen F.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or thrombospondin (48Adams J.C. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).X-ray crystallographic analyses of the heparan sulfate-binding domain of follistatin (33Innis C.A. Hyvönen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39969-39977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or of a dimer of the first two follistatin-like domains from SPARC/osteonectin/BM-40 (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have revealed a stereotyped elongated structure determined primarily by the 10 cysteine residues forming 5 specific intradomain disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds subdivide follistatin-like domains into two separate substructures, an N-terminal EGF-like subdomain characterized by two β-sheet structure (β1 und β2) connected via a β-hairpin, and a C-terminal part with similarity to the Kazal-type family of protease inhibitors consisting of three short antiparallel β-sheets (β3, β4, and β5) packed against an α-helix (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Innis C.A. Hyvönen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39969-39977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; see supplemental Fig. S4 for the structure of both subdomains). Our results show that the reverse type I β-turn between β-sheets 3 and 4 is critical for the formation of the filopodia-like processes in neurons and non-neuronal cells. This region has so far no function assigned in any follistatin-like domain. For example, the interaction between the EF-hand calcium-binding site-containing domain and the follistatin-like domain within BM-40 is mediated by the strand β5 (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding of activin to follistatin, although not yet precisely mapped, is likely to involve the N-terminal hairpin structure between β-sheets 1 and 2 of the first follistatin domain of follistatin (49Inouye S. Guo Y. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 50Sumitomo S. Inouye S. Liu X.J. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The same area also harbors the heparin-binding region, consistent with heparin being able to block the activin-follistatin interaction (33Innis C.A. Hyvönen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39969-39977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 51Wang Q. Keutmann H.T. Schneyer A.L. Sluss P.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3183-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the follistatin-like domain of BM-40 an asparagine residue located between β-sheet 3 and 4 (Asn-99 in human BM-40) has been shown to be covalently linked to two N-acetylglucosamine sugars (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, this asparagine is not conserved in any of the follistatin-like domains of agrin, suggesting that glycosylation at this position is not likely to influence process formation.A number of functions of agrin have been assigned to the heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate side chains (35Winzen U. Cole G.J. Halfter W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30106-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), including their interaction with low molecular weight growth factors, like fibroblast-like growth factors (52Kim M.J. Cotman S.L. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 55: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or their inhibition of neurite growth (36Baerwald-De la Torre K. Winzen U. Halfter W. Bixby J.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our results show that GAG side chains are dispensable for the formation of filopodia-like processes in neurons and non-neuronal cells, eliminating an effect of growth factor- or GAG side chain-mediated signaling pathways and their modulation by agrin on process formation. Interestingly, when all three serines that serve as glycosaminoglycan side-chain attachment sites between follistatin-like domains 7 and 8 (35Winzen U. Cole G.J. Halfter W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30106-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were mutated to alanine, the protein had a reduced process-inducing activity, whereas complete deletion of the eighth follistatin-like domain together with the GAG side-chain attachment sites restored process-forming activity. One possible explanation might be that the GAG side chains have a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the eighth follistatin-like domain. In the absence of GAG side chains, the eighth follistatin-like domain might adopt an altered conformation and might interfere with the function of follistatin-like domain 7. This effect would not be detectable in the absence of both the GAG side chains and follistatin-like domain 8 explaining the process-inducing activity of the TMFD7–572 construct.Although follistatin-like domain 7 could be functionally replaced by domains 1 and 6, the eighth follistatin-like domain could not substitute for the seventh domain. While the eighth follistatin-like domain of TM-agrin also contains the conserved aspartic acid residue between β-sheet 3 and 4, it differs from follistatin-like domains 1 and 6 in at least two aspects: an ∼8-amino acid-long stretch between β-sheet 1 and 2 and the GAG side-chain attachment sites at its N terminus (see supplemental Fig. S3 for a sequence alignment of the 8 different follistatin-like domains of TM-agrin). Because the amino acid insertion between β-sheets 1 and 2 is in the EGF-like subdomain, which is apparently not involved in process formation, the more likely explanation for the failure of the eighth follistatin-like domain to functionally substitute for follistatin-like domain 7 is the presence of the GAG side chains. Although we have not specifically addressed the glycosylation of the proteins encoded by the various constructs, Western blotting of proteins containing the eighth follistatin-like domain showed a high molecular mass smear characteristic of highly glycosylated proteins in our study (see supplemental Fig. S2A for details) as well as in previous studies (35Winzen U. Cole G.J. Halfter W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30106-30114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Baerwald-De la Torre K. Winzen U. Halfter W. Bixby J.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The absence of this smear in constructs lacking the eighth follistatin-like domain suggests that proteins containing the eighth follistatin-like domain have GAG side chains attached. Therefore, in the TMFD6+FD8-GFP construct, the GAG side chains might block the interaction of the follistatin-like domain with other proteins or might interfere with the protein’s ability to partition into lipid rafts.Agrin contains nine follistatin-like domains, eight of which are arranged as an uninterrupted tandem repeat. Rotary shadowing followed by electron microscopy demonstrates a rather rigid rod-like arrangement of the follistatin-like domains in agrin (53Denzer A.J. Schulthess T. Fauser C. Schumacher B. Kammerer R.A. Engel J. Ruegg M.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed for the structure of the tandem of follistatin-like domains (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the β1–β2 hairpin of the N-terminal part of follistatin-like domain interacts with the small three-stranded β-sheet of the preceding follistatin-like domain (32Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the loop between β-sheet 3 and 4 is part of the three-stranded C-terminal β-sheet, it is possible that mutations in this region influence the interaction between two follistatin-like domains. However, the process-inducing activity of follistatin-like domain 7 is not influenced by the deletion of the eighth follistatin-like domain. Therefore, the presence of a C-terminal interaction partner appears not to be necessary for process formation.Dendritic filopodia-like processes are known to serve as precursors for new synapses during development as well as during activity-dependent synapse remodeling (for review see Refs. 54Yuste R. Bonhoeffer T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 55Holtmaat A.J. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X.Q. Knott G.W. Svoboda K. Neuron. 2005; 45: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Once formed, the filopodia can mature into spine synapses upon contact with a presynaptic bouton (56Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 57Fiala J.C. Feinberg M. Popov V. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8900-8911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Knott G. Holtmaat A. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 58: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the number of successfully established functional synapses is low; >90% of the new filopodia dissolve within days, and only a small minority matures into synapse-bearing spines, consistent with a massive overproduction and a constant turnover of these processes (59Lohmann C. Bonhoeffer T. Neuron. 2008; 59: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dendritic spine precursor processes and the filopodia-like processes induced by TM-agrin are very similar with respect to length, time course of appearance, and disappearance and to their dependence on specific intracellular signaling proteins (56Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 57Fiala J.C. Feinberg M. Popov V. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8900-8911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Dailey M.E. Smith S.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2983-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Parnass Z. Tashiro A. Yuste R.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This similarity suggests that TM-agrin might be involved in the formation of spine synapses in the developing CNS by regulating the formation of filopodia-like processes on dendrites. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of TM-agrin synthesis markedly reduced the number of synapses in hippocampal neurons (29McCroskery S. Bailey A. Lin L. Daniels M.P. Neuroscience. 2009; 163: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, mice that lack agrin in the CNS have a 30% reduction in the number of excitatory synapses and spines in the cerebral cortex (11Ksiazek I. Burkhardt C. Lin S. Seddik R. Maj M. Bezakova G. Jucker M. Arber S. Caroni P. Sanes J.R. Bettler B. Ruegg M.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7183-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).At mature interneuronal synapses neurotrypsin, a serine protease that is concentrated in the presynaptic active zone and in the synaptic cleft, has been shown to cleave TM-agrin (63Stephan A. Mateos J.M. Kozlov S.V. Cinelli P. Kistler A.D. Hettwer S. Rülicke T. Streit P. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1861-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cleavage of agrin by neurotrypsin occurs at two conserved sites within the agrin protein, generating a truncated plasma membrane-associated TM-agrin protein as well as two soluble fragments from the C terminus with molecular masses of 90 and 22 kDa, respectively (64Reif R. Sales S. Hettwer S. Dreier B. Gisler C. Wölfel J. Lüscher D. Zurlinden A. Stephan A. Ahmed S. Baici A. Ledermann B. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3468-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recruitment to synapses as well as exocytosis of neurotrypsin depends on presynaptic activity, whereas agrin cleavage requires the additional and coincident postsynaptic activity and involves N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor activation as well as calcium influx (24Matsumoto-Miyai K. Sokolowska E. Zurlinden A. Gee C.E. Lüscher D. Hettwer S. Wölfel J. Ladner A.P. Ster J. Gerber U. Rülicke T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Cell. 2009; 136: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 65Frischknecht R. Fejtova A. Viesti M. Stephan A. Sonderegger P. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1568-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neurotrypsin-deficient mice form significantly fewer long term potentiation-associated dendritic filopodia-like processes (24Matsumoto-Miyai K. Sokolowska E. Zurlinden A. Gee C.E. Lüscher D. Hettwer S. Wölfel J. Ladner A.P. Ster J. Gerber U. Rülicke T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Cell. 2009; 136: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), demonstrating that neurotrypsin-dependent agrin cleavage is required for process formation. The C-terminal 22-kDa agrin fragment generated by neurotrypsin is able to induce filopodia-like processes when added to mature hippocampal slices, and the same fragment is able to rescue the long term potentiation-induced decrease in filopodia-like processes in neurotrypsin-deficient mice (24Matsumoto-Miyai K. Sokolowska E. Zurlinden A. Gee C.E. Lüscher D. Hettwer S. Wölfel J. Ladner A.P. Ster J. Gerber U. Rülicke T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Cell. 2009; 136: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of TM-agrin as well as direct addition of the soluble 22-kDa C-terminal agrin fragment generated by neurotrypsin can induce the formation of processes. Therefore, TM-agrin and neurotrypsin might act synergistically on process formation and interneuronal synapse formation. Another possibility is that the two proteins directly interact. This hypothesis would predict that binding of the 22-kDa C-terminal agrin fragment to TM-agrin or proteolytic cleavage of TM-agrin would lead to the formation of filopodia-like processes for example by dimerization of TM-agrin and subsequent partitioning into lipid rafts. Thus, TM-agrin would be a receptor or coreceptor for the binding of the 22-kDa agrin fragment generated by neurotrypsin. This hypothesis does not, however, exclude additional involvement of the tyrosine kinase MuSK (11Ksiazek I. Burkhardt C. Lin S. Seddik R. Maj M. Bezakova G. Jucker M. Arber S. Caroni P. Sanes J.R. Bettler B. Ruegg M.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7183-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), of the agrin receptor LRP4 (15Zhang B. Luo S. Wang Q. Suzuki T. Xiong W.C. Mei L.

In any case, the results presented in this study demonstrate a critical involvement of the seventh follistatin-like domain within TM-agrin in the formation of filopodia-like processes. IntroductionAgrin is a proteoglycan with a molecular mass of >500 kDa that is expressed in many tissues (1Bezakova G. Ruegg M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The function of agrin is best characterized in skeletal muscle where it is a key organizer during formation, maintenance, and regeneration of the neuromuscular junction (2Kröger S. Pfister H. Fut.

Ruegg M.A. Brenner H.R. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mice with an inactivation of the agrn gene die at birth due to non-functional neuromuscular junctions and consequent respiratory failure (5Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F.

Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar).Little is known about the role of agrin in tissues other than skeletal muscle, in particular in the central nervous system (for review see Refs. 1Bezakova G.

Likewise, brains of agrin-deficient mice, whose perinatal death was prevented by the re-expression of agrin in motor neurons, have a severely reduced number of pre- and postsynaptic specializations as well as functional deficits at excitatory synapses in the CNS 3The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemEembryonic dayLRP4low density lipoprotein-like receptor 4TM-agrintransmembrane form of agrinHEKhuman embryonic kidney cellGAGglycosaminoglycanEGFepidermal growth factorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNtA-agrinNtA domain-containing agrin isoform.

Although these data are consistent with a role of agrin during CNS synaptogenesis, the precise function of agrin during CNS development remains unclear.Agrin has been cloned from several species, and the sequences are highly homologous. The agrin cDNAs predict a number of domains with similarity to other extracellular matrix proteins, including four EGF-like repeats and three domains with similarity to globular domain of the laminin α-chain (LG domain) within the C-terminal half of the protein.

The binding of agrin to LRP4 activates the tyrosine kinase MuSK and initiates a complex intracellular signaling cascade resulting in the formation of most if not all pre- and postsynaptic specializations (1Bezakova G. Ruegg M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Kröger S. Pfister H. Fut. Neurol. 2009; 4: 67-86Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The functions of the other domains, particularly of the 9 follistatin-like domains within the N-terminal half of the agrin protein are unknown.Alternative first exon usage generates either a secreted soluble agrin molecule (NtA-agrin) or a transmembrane form of agrin (TM-agrin (17Burgess R.W.

Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). The secreted form of agrin binds to the laminin γ1-chain via its NtA domain resulting in stable association of this agrin isoform with basal laminae (19Denzer A.J. Brandenberger R. Gesemann M. Chiquet M. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast, in TM-agrin the NtA domain is replaced by a non-cleaved signal anchor that converts agrin into a type II transmembrane protein and localizes the agrin protein in Ncyto/Cexo orientation in the plasma membrane (17Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Neumann F.R. Bittcher G. Annies M. Schumacher B. Kröger S. Ruegg M.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).TM-agrin is primarily expressed on axons and dendrites of CNS neurons (20Annies M. Kröger S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Rüegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized that neurite-associated TM-agrin might serve as a receptor or co-receptor (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Rüegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, it was recently shown that clustering or overexpression of TM-agrin in neurons during the phase of active neurite growth reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and induces the rapid formation of numerous filopodia-like processes extending from the primary neurite (21Annies M. Bittcher G. Ramseger R. Löschinger J. Wöll S. Porten E. Abraham C. Rüegg M.A. Kröger S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22McCroskery S. Chaudhry A. Lin L. Daniels M.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The formation of these processes is caused by the initiation of a complex signaling cascade, which involves lipid rafts, as well as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Fyn, and Cdc42 (22McCroskery S. Chaudhry A. Lin L. Daniels M.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Ramseger R. White R. Kröger S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7697-7705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The function of the filopodia-like processes in the developing CNS is unknown, but they might represent initial stages during the formation of excitatory spine synapses (24Matsumoto-Miyai K. Sokolowska E. Zurlinden A. Gee C.E. Lüscher D. Hettwer S. Wölfel J. Ladner A.P. Ster J. Gerber U. Rülicke T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Cell. 2009; 136: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, mice that lack CNS agrin develop 30% fewer glutamatergic synapses (11Ksiazek I. Burkhardt C. Lin S. Seddik R. Maj M. Bezakova G. Jucker M. Arber S. Caroni P. Sanes J.R. Bettler B. Ruegg M.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7183-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrate that overexpression of TM-agrin in non-neuronal cell lines can induce processes similar to those induced in CNS neurites, suggesting that the process-inducing activity of TM-agrin is not limited to nerve cells. We also investigated the structural requirements for the process-inducing activity of TM-agrin by mapping the region necessary for this activity. Our results show that an aspartic acid residue within the seventh follistatin-like domain is essential for process induction. This particular amino acid is highly conserved in other follistatin-like domains of TM-agrin. Accordingly, the seventh follistatin-like domain could functionally be replaced by the first or sixth follistatin-like domain. These data show that follistatin-like domains are critical for process formation and support a role for TM-agrin as a receptor or co-receptor in the developing CNS."

Experimental autoimmune uveitis [EAU] is a T cell mediated intraocular inflammatory disease that resembles human uveitis. Mycobacterial and homologous Hsp60 peptides induces uveitis in rats, however their participation in aggravating the disease is poorly known. We here evaluate the effects of the Mycobacterium leprae Hsp65 in the development/progression of EAU and the autoimmune response against the eye through the induction of the endogenous disequilibrium by enhancing the entropy of the immunobiological system with the addition of homologous Hsp. B10.RIII mice were immunized subcutaneously with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein [IRBP], followed by intraperitoneally inoculation of M. leprae recombinant Hsp65 [rHsp65]. We evaluated the proliferative response, cytokine production and the percentage of CD4(+)IL-17(+), CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cells ex vivo, by flow cytometry. Disease severity was determined by eye histological examination and serum levels of anti-IRBP and anti-Hsp60/65 measured by ELISA. EAU scores increased in the Hsp65 group and were associated with an expansion of CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) and CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells, corroborating with higher levels of IFN-gamma. Our data indicate that rHsp65 is one of the managers with a significant impact over the immune response during autoimmunity, skewing it to a pathogenic state, promoting both Th1 and Th17 commitment. It seems comprehensible that the specificity and primary function of Hsp60 molecules can be considered as a potential pathogenic factor acting as a whistleblower announcing chronic-inflammatory diseases progression."
