https://openalex.org/W2058986793,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon that has severe epidemiological ramifications world-wide. It has been suggested that antibiotics that have been discharged into the natural aquatic environments after usage or manufacture can promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). These environmental ARGs could serve as a reservoir and be horizontally transferred to human-associated bacteria and thus contribute to AR proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the anthropogenic load of antibiotics in Northern Pakistan and study the occurrence of ARGs in selected samples from this region. 19 sampling sites were selected; including six rivers, one dam, one canal, one sewage drain and four drug formulation facilities. Our results show that five of the rivers have antibiotic levels comparable to surface water measurements in unpolluted sites in Europe and the US. However, high levels of antibiotics could be detected in the downstream river in close vicinity of the 10 million city Lahore, 1100, 1700 and 2700 ng L−1 for oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole respectively. Highest detected levels were at one of the drug formulation facilities, with the measured levels of 1100, 4100, 6200, 7300, 8000, 27000, 28000 and 49000 ng L−1 of erythromycin, lincomycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole respectively. ARGs were also detected at the sites and the highest levels of ARGs detected, sulI and dfrA1, were directly associated with the antibiotics detected at the highest concentrations, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Highest levels of both antibiotics and ARGs were seen at a drug formulation facility, within an industrial estate with a low number of local residents and no hospitals in the vicinity, which indicates that the levels of ARGs at this site were associated with the environmental levels of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3122653075,"Overfishing threatens coral reefs worldwide, yet there is no reliable estimate on the number of reef fishers globally. We address this data gap by quantifying the number of reef fishers on a global scale, using two approaches - the first estimates reef fishers as a proportion of the total number of marine fishers in a country, based on the ratio of reef-related to total marine fish landed values. The second estimates reef fishers as a function of coral reef area, rural coastal population, and fishing pressure. In total, we find that there are 6 million reef fishers in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide, of which at least 25% are reef gleaners. Our estimates are an improvement over most existing fisher population statistics, which tend to omit accounting for gleaners and reef fishers. Our results suggest that slightly over a quarter of the world’s small-scale fishers fish on coral reefs, and half of all coral reef fishers are in Southeast Asia. Coral reefs evidently support the socio-economic well-being of numerous coastal communities. By quantifying the number of people who are employed as reef fishers, we provide decision-makers with an important input into planning for sustainable coral reef fisheries at the appropriate scale."
https://openalex.org/W2025864890,"Agencies that fund scientific research must choose: is it more effective to give large grants to a few elite researchers, or small grants to many researchers? Large grants would be more effective only if scientific impact increases as an accelerating function of grant size. Here, we examine the scientific impact of individual university-based researchers in three disciplines funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We considered four indices of scientific impact: numbers of articles published, numbers of citations to those articles, the most cited article, and the number of highly cited articles, each measured over a four-year period. We related these to the amount of NSERC funding received. Impact is positively, but only weakly, related to funding. Researchers who received additional funds from a second federal granting council, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, were not more productive than those who received only NSERC funding. Impact was generally a decelerating function of funding. Impact per dollar was therefore lower for large grant-holders. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that larger grants lead to larger discoveries. Further, the impact of researchers who received increases in funding did not predictably increase. We conclude that scientific impact (as reflected by publications) is only weakly limited by funding. We suggest that funding strategies that target diversity, rather than “excellence”, are likely to prove to be more productive."
https://openalex.org/W2131525001,"The plasma membrane protein STRA6 is thought to mediate uptake of retinol from its blood carrier retinol-binding protein (RBP) into cells and to function as a surface receptor that, upon binding of holo-RBP, activates a JAK/STAT cascade. It was suggested that STRA6 signaling underlies insulin resistance induced by elevated serum levels of RBP in obese animals. To investigate these activities in vivo, we generated and analyzed Stra6-null mice. We show that the contribution of STRA6 to retinol uptake by tissues in vivo is small and that, with the exception of the eye, ablation of Stra6 has only a modest effect on retinoid homeostasis and does not impair physiological functions that critically depend on retinoic acid in the embryo or in the adult. However, ablation of Stra6 effectively protects mice from RBP-induced suppression of insulin signaling.

With the exception of vision, which relies on 11-cis-retinaldehyde, the biological actions of vitamin A are mediated by its metabolite retinoic acid (RA), which functions by activating specific nuclear receptors (3.Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Function of retinoid nuclear receptors: lessons from genetic and pharmacological dissections of the retinoic acid signaling pathway during mouse embryogenesis.Annu. Rev.

ROH is stored in various tissues, including white adipose tissue (WAT), lung, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the eye, but its major storage pool is found in the liver. It is secreted from hepatocytes bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP), a 21-kDa carrier encoded by the Rbp4 gene (5.Quadro L. Hamberger L. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. Understanding the physiological role of retinol-binding protein in vitamin A metabolism using transgenic and knockout mouse models.Mol. Aspects Med. 2003; 24: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RBP-bound ROH (holo-RBP) accounts for the predominant fraction of retinoids in blood during fasting but, in postprandial periods, the amount of ROH that circulates as retinyl esters in chylomicrons can greatly exceed that bound to RBP (5.Quadro L. Hamberger L. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. Understanding the physiological role of retinol-binding protein in vitamin A metabolism using transgenic and knockout mouse models.Mol. Aspects Med. 2003; 24: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Hence, an important physiological role of RBP is to mobilize ROH from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues when dietary vitamin A intake is low (6.Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S. Cosma M.P. Colantuoni V. Gottesman M.E.

Accordingly, Rbp4-null mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet develop characteristic symptoms of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) (8.Quadro L. Hamberger L. Gottesman M.E. Wang F. Colantuoni V. Blaner W.S.

Interestingly, it has been reported that plasma level of RBP increases in obese mice and humans and that the elevated serum levels of the protein markedly suppress insulin responses (9.Yang Q.

Two models have been proposed to account for uptake of ROH from holo-RBP by target cells (reviewed in Ref. 10.Noy N. Retinoid-binding proteins: mediators of retinoid action.Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). According to one model, ROH spontaneously dissociates from RBP and, due to its lipophilic nature, moves into cells by diffusion across the plasma membranes at fluxes that are dictated by its extracellular to intracellular concentration gradient (11.Fex G. Johannesson G. Retinol transfer across and between phospholipid bilayer membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 944: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12.Noy N. Xu Z.J. Kinetic parameters of the interactions of retinol with lipid bilayers.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3883-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another model proposes that uptake of ROH into cells is mediated by a cell-surface receptor for holo-RBP (13.Heller J. Interactions of plasma retinol-binding protein with its receptor.

Chem. 1975; 250: 3613-3619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Shingleton J.L. Skinner M.K. Ong D.E. Characteristics of retinol accumulation from serum retinol-binding protein by cultured Sertoli cells.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9641-9647Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In keeping with this notion, it was recently shown that a plasma membrane protein termed STRA6 binds extracellular holo-RBP and transports ROH into cultured cells (15.Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. A membrane receptor for retinol-binding protein mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A.Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). STRA6 is a multitransmembrane domain-containing protein expressed in various tissues and is most highly expressed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the eye (15.Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J.

It has been reported that, in humans, mutations in the Stra6 gene correlate with the occurrence of a Matthew-Wood syndrome (17.Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R.

Mutat. 2009; 30: E673-E681Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a severe polymalformative congenital disease that includes as main characteristics microphthalmia, pulmonary hypoplasia, heart defects, and diaphragmatic hernia. In contrast to Stra6, mutations in the Rbp4 gene in humans lead to only mild clinical symptoms traceable to VAD, including night blindness and a modest retinal dystrophy (20.Biesalski H.K. Frank J. Beck S.C. Heinrich F. Illek B. Reifen R. Gollnick H. Seeliger M.W. Wissinger B. Zrenner E. Biochemical but not clinical vitamin A deficiency results from mutations in the gene for retinol-binding protein.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The observations that RBP mutations give rise to much less severe defects than those yielded by STRA6 mutations suggest either that STRA6 exerts biological functions independently of its role as an RBP receptor or that Matthew-Wood syndrome originates from chromosomal aberrations other than STRA6 mutations. Our recent studies using cultured cell models revealed that, in addition to mediating ROH uptake, STRA6 functions as a cytokine receptor that triggers a signaling cascade in response to holo-RBP. Specifically, we found that binding of holo-RBP to STRA6 results in recruitment of JAK2 that, in turn, catalyzes phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the cytosolic domain of STRA6, leading to recruitment and activation of the transcription factor STAT5 (21.Berry D.C.

As STAT target genes in WAT and muscle include Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), a potent inhibitor of the insulin receptor (IR) (25.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. A family of cytokine-inducible inhibitors of signalling.Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), these findings provided a rationale for understanding how elevated serum levels of RBP in obese animals induce insulin resistance (9.Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Serum retinol-binding protein 4 contributes to insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). To investigate whether STRA6 mediates ROH uptake and/or holo-RBP-induced signaling in vivo, we generated and analyzed the phenotype of a mouse line harboring a Stra6-null mutation. We show that, with the exception of RPE cells in the eye (26.Ruiz A. Mark M. Jacobs H. Klopfenstein M. Hu J. Lloyd M. Habib S. Tosha C. Radu R.A. Ghyselinck N.B. Nusinowitz S. Bok D. Retinoid content, visual responses, and ocular morphology are compromised in the retinas of mice lacking the retinol-binding protein receptor, STRA6.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2012; 53: 3027-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), ablation of Stra6 does not greatly impact the retinoid content of tissues and does not disrupt physiological functions that are critically dependent on RA in the embryo or in the adult, even under conditions of VAD. Hence, although contributing in part to ROH uptake by cells, STRA6 does not appear to be mandatory for normal development in the mouse and for ROH availability in vivo in tissues other than the eye. In contrast, ablation of Stra6 abolished the ability of holo-RBP to activate a JAK/STAT cascade and to induce insulin resistance. Mice were housed according to Animal Research Committee (ARC) protocol (United States) or in a facility licensed by the French Ministry of Agriculture (agreement number B67-218-5). Animal experiments were supervised by M. M. and N. B. G. (agreements numbers 67-62 and 67-205), in compliance with the European legislation on care and use of laboratory animals. Mice with a mixed C57BL/6-129/Sv (50–50%) genetic background were maintained on a 12-h light and dark cycle on a normal chow diet. Noon of the day of a vaginal plug was taken as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Embryos and fetuses were collected by caesarean section, and the yolk sacs were taken for DNA extraction. The breeding diets (D03 from Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle (UAR) in France, or Diet 5P76 from LabDiet in the United States) contained 25,000–29,000 IU of vitamin A per kg. The mice had access to water and diet ad libitum. The high fat/high sucrose diet contained 35% (w/w) fat (D12331 from Research Diets). For vitamin A depletion studies performed in the United States and destined for HPLC analysis of retinoid contents, 12-week-old control (wild type, WT) and Stra6-null mutant mice were fed a diet devoid of vitamin A (Research Diet AIN93G-D13110GC) for 4 weeks. For vitamin A depletion studies performed in France and destined for morphological analyses, 6-week-old Rbp4+/+ and Rbp4−/− mice as well as Stra6+/+ and Stra6L−/L− mice were fed the same vitamin A-deficient diet (Harlan TD86143) for 7 weeks. The targeting vector was constructed as follows (see Fig. 1A): an ∼1-kb-long DNA fragment encompassing the XbaI-AjiI region of Stra6 locus and containing exons E5 to E7 was amplified by PCR from 129/SvPas mouse genomic DNA. It was inserted between two loxP sites into a Mouse Clinic Institute (Illkirch, France) proprietary vector, resulting in step 1 plasmid. This vector additionally displays an FRT-flanked neomycin resistance cassette (neo) located downstream of the second loxP site. Then, two ∼3-kb-long genomic DNA fragments containing exon E3-E4 and exon E8 were amplified by PCR and sequentially inserted into step 1 plasmid upstream of the first loxP site and downstream of neo, respectively. The resulting targeting vector was electroporated into 129S2/SvPas mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. After selection, targeted clones were screened by PCR using external primers. One clone targeted as expected (K126) was identified and further confirmed by Southern blot with 5′ and 3′ external probes (L3 allele; see Fig. 1A, Stra6+/L3). Clone K126 (Stra6+/L3) was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and one chimera transmitted the conditional allele to the germ line. Removal of the neo cassette from the Stra6 locus was achieved by crossing Stra6+/L3 mice with Actb-FLPe transgenics (Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym) that express FLPe recombinase in the germ line (27.Rodríguez C.I. Buchholz F. Galloway J. Sequerra R. Kasper J. Ayala R. Stewart A.F. Dymecki S.M. High-efficiency deleter mice show that FLPe is an alternative to Cre-loxP.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), thereby generating mice bearing the conditional, loxP-flanked, L2 allele (see Fig. 1A, Stra6+/L2). Deletion of neo was assessed using primers 5′-GGTTCTCCGGCCGCTTGGGT-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCGATGCGCTGCGAAT-3′ that amplify a 740-bp-long fragment from neo. Segregation of Actb-FLPe transgene was assessed using primers 5′-GGAGAAAGCATCTGGGAGATCACTG-3′ and 5′-CACAACATTGGTCAGCTCTGTCAGGCC-3′, which amplify a 530-bp-long fragment from FLPe. Heterozygous (Stra6+/L2) inter-crosses yielded a Mendelian ratio of WT and homozygous (Stra6L2/L2) mice that grew normally and were healthy, fertile, and externally undistinguishable from WT littermates, indicating that the presence of loxP sites at the Stra6 locus had no effects. The Stra6+/L2 mice were then crossed with CMV-Cre transgenic mice (Tg(CMV-cre)1Ipc), which express Cre recombinase in the one-cell stage embryo (28.Dupé V. Davenne M. Brocard J. Dollé P. Mark M. Dierich A. Chambon P. Rijli F.M. In vivo functional analysis of the Hoxa-1 3′-retinoic acid response element (3′RARE).Development. 1997; 124: 399-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to generate mice bearing the excised, null, L− allele (see Fig. 1A, Stra6+/L−). They were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1B) using primers 1 (5′-ACTGACAGATCTATTCAGGAGGAGG-3′) and 2 (5′-AGGGGAGGATCCTTTCACCACC-3′; see Fig. 1A) to amplify the wild-type (172 bp long) and the loxP-flanked L2 (222 bp long) alleles, or primers 1 and 3 (5′-GCATCCTCTTCCTCCACTCTGC-3′) to amplify the L− allele (350 bp long). Conditions were two cycles with denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 61 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 30 cycles with denaturation for 30 s at 92 °C, annealing for 30 s at 61 °C, and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C. Segregation of CMV-Cre transgene was assessed using primers 5′-ATTTGCCTGCATTACCGGTC-3′ and 5′-ATCAACGTTTTCTTTTCGGA-3′, which amplify a 350-bp-long fragment from Cre. Recombinant RBP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21.Berry D.C. Jin H. Majumdar A. Noy N.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4340-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels were measured using Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay for endotoxin content (Pierce LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit, catalog number 88282). COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 40 μg/ml gentamicin. They were transfected with expression plasmids containing full-length coding sequences for E. coli lacZ (in pCH110, Amersham Biosciences), mouse Stra6 (in pReceiver-M01, GeneCopoeia), or mouse Rbpr2 (1300002K09Rik-001 in pSG5, Stratagene) using JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus-Transfection SA). To extract proteins, embryo tissues and transfected cells were lysed and incubated for 30 min on ice in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2% (w/v) SDS) supplemented with an anti-protease mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Protein extracts were resolved by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) according to standard procedures. STRA6 protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (RP-S6, diluted 1:1000) generated at Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire and directed against the C-terminal part of mouse STRA6 (amino acids 586–615; CALLLHAPSPQPRPPLAPQDSLRPAEEEEG). Immunoreactions were visualized using protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; diluted 1:5000), followed by chemiluminescence using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies against AKT, pAKT, IR, pIR, JAK2, and pJAK2 were from Cell Signaling and used as described (21.Berry D.C. Jin H. Majumdar A. Noy N. Signaling by vitamin A and retinol-binding protein regulates gene expression to inhibit insulin responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4340-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Anti-actin and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against RBP and β-galactosidase (β-gal) were from Dako and Capel, respectively. Tissue collection and systematic histopathology were as described previously (29.Antal C. Teletin M. Wendling O. Dgheem M. Auwerx J. Mark M. Tissue collection for systematic phenotyping in the mouse.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2007; (Chapter 29, Unit 29A.4)Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin for 16 h, except for testis, which was fixed in Bouin's fluid for 16 h. All samples were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick sections were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff. In situ hybridizations were performed as described (30.Vernet N. Dennefeld C. Guillou F. Chambon P. Ghyselinck N.B. Mark M. Prepubertal testis development relies on retinoic acid but not rexinoid receptors in Sertoli cells.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5816-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For immunodetection of STRA6, 10-μm-thick sections of unfixed frozen tissues were incubated in cold acetone (−20 °C, 5 min), air-dried, hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Sections were incubated for 1 h with the anti-STRA6 antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS.

Tissues were isolated, weighed, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Counts were normalized per g of tissue. Blood was collected by heart puncture, and plasma was isolated using Microtainer plasma separator tubes (BD Biosciences). Insulin was measured using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia, Lincoln Park, MO). Mice were fasted for 12 h and injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2 g kg−1 body weight) or insulin (0.9 units kg−1 body weight; Sigma).

Here, we utilized signaling assays and biochemical studies of purified recombinant ligand and receptor molecules to investigate the differences in signaling behavior and intrinsic affinity between Notch1-Dll1 and Notch1-Dll4 complexes. Systematic deletion mutagenesis of the human Notch1 ectodomain revealed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats 6-15 are sufficient to maintain signaling in a reporter assay at levels comparable with the full-length receptor, and identified important contributions from EGF repeats 8-10 in conveying an activating signal in response to either Dll1 or Dll4. Truncation studies of the Dll1 and Dll4 ectodomains showed that the MNNL-EGF3 region was both necessary and sufficient for full activation. Plate-based and cell binding assays revealed a specific, calcium-dependent interaction between cell-surface and recombinant Notch receptors and ligand molecules. Finally, direct measurement of the binding affinity of Notch1 EGF repeats 6-15 for Dll1 and Dll4 revealed that Dll4 binds with at least an order of magnitude higher affinity than Dll1. Together, these studies give new insights into the features of ligand recognition by Notch1, and highlight how intrinsic differences in the biochemical behavior of receptor-ligand complexes can influence receptor-mediated responses of developmental signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2094107051,"Background Residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of feed efficiency, is the difference between observed feed intake and the expected feed requirement predicted from growth and maintenance. Pigs with low RFI have reduced feed costs without compromising their growth. Identification of genes or genetic markers associated with RFI will be useful for marker-assisted selection at an early age of animals with improved feed efficiency. Methodology/Principal findings Whole genome association studies (WGAS) for RFI, average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), back fat (BF) and loin muscle area (LMA) were performed on 1,400 pigs from the divergently selected ISU-RFI lines, using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Various statistical methods were applied to find SNPs and genomic regions associated with the traits, including a Bayesian approach using GenSel software, and frequentist approaches such as allele frequency differences between lines, single SNP and haplotype analyses using PLINK software. Single SNP and haplotype analyses showed no significant associations (except for LMA) after genomic control and FDR. Bayesian analyses found at least 2 associations for each trait at a false positive probability of 0.5. At generation 8, the RFI selection lines mainly differed in allele frequencies for SNPs near (<0.05 Mb) genes that regulate insulin release and leptin functions. The Bayesian approach identified associations of genomic regions containing insulin release genes (e.g., GLP1R, CDKAL, SGMS1) with RFI and ADFI, of regions with energy homeostasis (e.g., MC4R, PGM1, GPR81) and muscle growth related genes (e.g., TGFB1) with ADG, and of fat metabolism genes (e.g., ACOXL, AEBP1) with BF. Specifically, a very highly significantly associated QTL for LMA on SSC7 with skeletal myogenesis genes (e.g., KLHL31) was identified for subsequent fine mapping. Conclusions/significance Important genomic regions associated with RFI related traits were identified for future validation studies prior to their incorporation in marker-assisted selection programs."
https://openalex.org/W2043264456,"Anticipation of the actions of others is often used as a measure of action understanding in infancy. In contrast to studies of action understanding which set infants up as observers of actions directed elsewhere, in the present study we explored anticipatory postural adjustments made by infants to one of the most common adult actions directed to them - picking them up. We observed infant behavioural changes and recorded their postural shifts on a pressure mat in three phases: (i) a prior Chat phase, (ii) from the onset of Approach of the mother's arms, and (iii) from the onset of Contact. In Study 1, eighteen 3-month-old infants showed systematic global postural changes during Approach and Contact, but not during Chat. There was an increase in specific adjustments of the arms (widening or raising) and legs (stiffening and extending or tucking up) during Approach and a decrease in thrashing/general movements during Contact. Shifts in postural stability were evident immediately after onset of Approach and more slowly after Contact, with no regular shifts during Chat. In Study 2 we followed ten infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age. Anticipatory behavioural adjustments during Approach were present at all ages, but with greater differentiation from a prior Chat phase only at 3 and 4 months. Global postural shifts were also more phase differentiated in older infants. Moreover, there was significantly greater gaze to the mother's hands during Approach at 4 months. Early anticipatory adjustments to being picked up suggest that infants' awareness of actions directed to the self may occur earlier than of those directed elsewhere, and thus enable infants' active participation in joint actions from early in life."
https://openalex.org/W2008536895,"Background Delirium is a serious and common postoperative complication, especially in frail elderly patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric liaison intervention in comparison with standard care on the incidence of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour. Methods Patients over 65 years of age who were undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour were recruited to a multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The patients were randomized to standard treatment versus a geriatric liaison intervention. The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation, an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium, daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay and advice on managing any problems encountered. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. The secondary outcome measures were the severity of delirium, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, care dependency, quality of life, return to an independent preoperative living situation and additional care at home. Results In total, the data of 260 patients were analysed. Delirium occurred in 31 patients (11.9%), and there was no significant difference between the incidence of delirium in the intervention group and the usual-care group (9.4% vs. 14.3%, OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.29–1.35). Conclusions Within this study, a geriatric liaison intervention based on frailty for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour has not proven to be effective.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) improves alveolar epithelial wound repair in the lung. Stem cells were shown to play a major role in lung injury, repair and fibrosis. We studied the presence, origin and antifibrotic properties of HGF-expressing stem cells in usual interstitial pneumonia. Methods Immunohistochemistry was performed in lung tissue sections and primary alveolar epithelial cells obtained from patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP, n = 7). Bone marrow derived stromal cells (BMSC) from adult male rats were transfected with HGF, instilled intratracheally into bleomycin injured rat lungs and analyzed 7 and 14 days later. Results In UIP, HGF was expressed in specific cells mainly located in fibrotic areas close to the hyperplastic alveolar epithelium. HGF-positive cells showed strong co-staining for the mesenchymal stem cell markers CD44, CD29, CD105 and CD90, indicating stem cell origin. HGF-positive cells also co-stained for CXCR4 (HGF+/CXCR4+) indicating that they originate from the bone marrow. The stem cell characteristics were confirmed in HGF secreting cells isolated from UIP lung biopsies. In vivo experiments showed that HGF-expressing BMSC attenuated bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis in the rat, indicating a beneficial role of bone marrow derived, HGF secreting stem cells in lung fibrosis. Conclusions HGF-positive stem cells are present in human fibrotic lung tissue (UIP) and originate from the bone marrow. Since HGF-transfected BMSC reduce bleomycin induced lung fibrosis in the bleomycin lung injury and fibrosis model, we assume that HGF-expressing, bone-marrow derived stem cells in UIP have antifibrotic properties."

The pattern of DNA methylation changes during development and with disease. Human DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), a 1616-amino acid multidomain enzyme, is essential for maintenance of DNA methylation in proliferating cells and is considered an important cancer drug target. Using a fluorogenic, endonuclease-coupled DNA methylation assay with an activated form of Dnmt1 engineered to lack the replication foci targeting sequence domain, we discovered that laccaic acid A (LCA), a highly substituted anthraquinone natural product, is a direct inhibitor with a 310 nm Ki. LCA is competitive with the DNA substrate in in vitro methylation assays and alters the expression of methylated genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells synergistically with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

Lefkowitz R.J. Multiple ligand-specific conformations of the β2-adrenergic receptor.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 692-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18.Mary S. Damian M. Louet M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8304-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The conformational states stabilized by pharmacologically distinct compounds likely interact with various efficacies with different signaling proteins, thus explaining the observed differences in efficacy toward the multiple pathways associated with a single receptor. However, how specific protein-protein contacts within heterodimeric species can affect the conformational landscape a receptor can adopt in response to ligand binding is still an open question. We showed recently that monomeric GHS-R1a inserted into lipid discs adopts a complex conformational landscape in response to ligand and signaling protein binding (18.Mary S. Damian M. Louet M. Floquet N. Fehrentz J.A. Marie J. Martinez J. Banères J.L. Ligands and signaling proteins govern the conformational landscape explored by a G protein-coupled receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8304-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To explore the influence of dimerization on the structural dynamics of the ghrelin receptor, here we reconstituted, within a single lipid nanodisc, GHS-R1a as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer with GHS-R1b. This was made possible by an original method we developed to selectively purify well oriented dimeric species in lipid discs. Getting these dimeric assemblies opened the way to a strict comparison between the functional and structural features of the ghrelin receptor monomer and those in homo- and heterodimers. By doing so, we show that, although homodimerization does not significantly impact the functional and structural properties of the ghrelin receptor, GHS-R1b prevents GHS-R1a from activating its cognate signaling partners by restricting its conformational repertoire. This is to account for the dominant negative GHS-R1b exerts on ghrelin-associated signaling and illustrates how dimerization can affect signaling by modulating changes in GPCR conformation. BLT1 was expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies as a fusion with a fragment of α5 integrin (2.Arcemisbéhère L. Sen T. Boudier L. Balestre M.N. Gaibelet G. Detouillon E. Orcel H. Mendre C.

BLT1 was labeled with either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) at a unique reactive cysteine in position 47 or 176 of a cysteine-free receptor (20.Baneres J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. Structure-based analysis of GPCR function: conformational adaptation of both agonist and receptor upon leukotriene B4 binding to recombinant BLT1.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To this end, the receptor was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C at a dye:protein molar ratio of 10:1 and subsequently desalted using a PD10 column (Bio-Rad). Under the conditions used, labeling yields of 80–85% were achieved, as assessed by the absorbance of the protein at 276 nm and that of the dye at its maximal absorbance. For dimer assembly, receptors labeled either with the fluorophore donor or with the acceptor were mixed in equimolar amounts. Receptor dimers were reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs with MSP1E3(-) as the scaffolding protein and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS) as the lipids and purified as described for rhodopsin dimers (21.Bayburt T.H.

Preparations obtained under such conditions essentially corresponded to receptor dimers within a single disc. To purify parallel dimers, purified bovine calmodulin was added to the receptor-containing particles at a 1:5 receptor:CaM molar ratio (protein concentrations in the 50–100 μm range) in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 8 buffer), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and submitted to SEC. SEC was carried out on a Superdex 200 column (16 × 700 mm, GE Healthcare). The column was first equilibrated with the corresponding buffer, the protein fractions were loaded on the column (loaded volume not exceeding 1% of the total column volume), and elution was carried out with the equilibration buffer at a 0.2 ml/min flow rate. 0.3-ml fractions were collected. For complex dissociation, the CaM-receptor complex was incubated for 1 h in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA (pH 8) buffer, and the protein mixture was again submitted to SEC. The GHS-R1a receptor was expressed, purified, and reconstituted in 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside:0.02% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate micelles (3.Damian M. Marie J. Leyris J.P. Fehrentz J.A.

The homodimer was then assembled into lipid nanodiscs and purified as described above for BLT1. For the bimane emission experiments, the receptor containing the unique reactive cysteine at position 304 was mixed in equivalent amounts with a GHS-R1a cysmin mutant devoid of all its reactive cysteines (18.Mary S.

The cysmin mutant included a C-terminal S-tag for heterodimers purification (22.Mesnier D. Banères J.L.

For the GHS-R1aE124Q:GHS-R1a dimer, the mutant receptor included a C-terminal S-tag for heterodimer purification (22.Mesnier D. Banères J.L.

Receptor dimers were reconstituted by mixing equivalent amounts of GHS-R1a and GHS-R1aE124Q in 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside:0.02% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate micelles. The GHS-R1aE124Q-GHS-R1a “heterodimers” were assembled into lipid discs and purified as above. In all cases, labeling of Cys-304 with bimane was carried out as in Ref. 18.Mary S. Damian M. Louet M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8304-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. Similar labeling ratios were obtained in all cases. The ghrelin receptors were produced as described (3.Damian M. Marie J.

GHS-R1b included a C-terminal S tag for heterodimer purification (22.Mesnier D. Banères J.L.

After mixing equivalent amounts of GHS-R1a and GHS-R1b in 0.2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside:0.02% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate micelles, receptor heterodimers were assembled into a disc and purified as above.

Briefly, direct ligand binding experiments were performed using fluorescence energy transfer with the purified receptor labeled with Alexa Fluor 350 at its N terminus and a ghrelin peptide labeled with FITC (JMV 4946). Titration experiments were carried out with protein concentrations in the 10 nm protein concentration range and increasing ligand concentrations. Competition experiments were carried out by adding increasing concentrations of the competing compound to a receptor-JMV 4946 mixture (100 nm concentration range). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C between 400 and 600 nm on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) with an excitation at 346 or 488 nm. Buffer contributions were systematically subtracted. The FRET ratio corresponds to the ratio of the acceptor-emitted fluorescence at 520 nm from excitation at two different wavelengths, 346 and 488 nm (24.Hickerson R. Majumdar Z.K. Baucom A. Clegg R.M. Noller H.F. Measurement of internal movements within the 30 S ribosomal subunit using Forster resonance energy transfer.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0). Purified Gαqβ1γ2 trimer expressed in Sf9 cells (25.Kozasa T. Purification of G protein subunits from Sf9 insect cells using hexahistidine-tagged α and β γ subunits.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 21-38PubMed Google Scholar) was used in all assays. GTPγS binding experiments were carried out for 5 min at 20 °C using the fluorescent BODIPY FL GTPγS analog (26.McEwen D.P. Gee K.R. Kang H.C. Neubig R.R. Fluorescent BODIPY-GTP analogs. Real-time measurement of nucleotide binding to G proteins.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted in 200 nm Gq, 200 nm BODIPY FL GTPγS and 20 nm ghrelin receptor-containing nanodiscs in a buffer 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence emission was recorded at 511 nm with an excitation at 500 nm (Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter, Varian). All data were normalized to the fluorescence measured under the same conditions with empty discs. The phosphorylation independent arrestin-2 mutant L68C-R169E was produced in E. coli (27.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Arrestin. Mutagenesis, expression, purification, and functional characterization.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled on Cys-68 with the thiol alkylating fluorescent compound monobromobimane (28.Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. Dynamics of arrestin-rhodopsin interactions. Arrestin and retinal release are directly linked events.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For the recruitment assay, arrestin was added at a 5:1 arrestin:ghrelin receptor-containing discs molar ratio. A 20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) buffer was used in all experiments. Incubation was carried out for 45 min at 4 °C. The different ligands were then added at a 10 μm concentration (or at increasing concentration for the dose-response experiment) and incubated for 45 additional min at 4 °C. Fluorescence emission was recorded at 20 °C between 400 and 600 nm on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) with an excitation at 380 nm. All data were normalized to the fluorescence measured under the same conditions with empty discs. For the bimane fluorescence measurements, all experiments were carried out at the same bimane concentration (5 μm range with similar labeling ratios in all cases). The ghrelin receptor-containing discs were incubated with either increasing or saturating concentrations (50 μm) of the different ligands for 30 min. In the experiments with the purified effector proteins, the latter were added to the ligand-free receptor (the receptor-to-G-protein ratio was 1:10 and the receptor-to-arrestin ratio was 1:5) and incubated for 30 min. The different ligands were then added, and incubation was pursued for another 30 min. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) with an excitation wavelength at 380 nm. For Trp emission, the experimental setup was similar, with the exception that excitation was at 295 nm and emission between 300 and 500 nm. Before delineating the functioning of ghrelin receptor dimers incorporated into lipid discs, it was crucial to devise a method to control the relative orientation of the receptors when assembled into the lipid discs. Indeed, two receptor molecules incorporated in individual nanodiscs adopt both the natural parallel and the non-natural antiparallel orientations (29.Banerjee S. Huber T. Sakmar T.P. Rapid incorporation of functional rhodopsin into nanoscale apolipoprotein bound bilayer (NABB) particles.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1067-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We designed here a method for purifying particles where the two protomers are in the parallel orientation. This method is depicted schematically in Fig. 1A. It relies on the use of the CaM binding domain from petunia glutamate decarboxylase (named here PGD tag). The CaM-binding domain of PGD is a 26-residue region that makes a unique and stable complex with CaM of well defined stoichiometry, i.e. a single calcium-loaded CaM with two peptides (30.Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Calcium-calmodulin-induced dimerization of the carboxyl-terminal domain from petunia glutamate decarboxylase. A novel calmodulin-peptide interaction motif.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30328-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the PGD peptide interacts with CaM only as a dimer, if it is fused to the N terminus of the receptor, only lipid discs where the peptides are sufficiently close in space, i.e. particles where the receptor N termini are on the same side of the lipid disc, should bind CaM. The leukotriene B4 BLT1 receptor was first used to validate the PGD tag-based purification procedure. We selected this receptor as a model because we have in hand a full series of unique cysteine-containing mutants that allowed a detailed exploration of the relative arrangement of receptor proteins within the dimer using interprotomer FRET (2.Arcemisbéhère L. Sen T. Boudier L. Balestre M.N. Gaibelet G. Detouillon E. Orcel H. Mendre C. Rahmeh R. Granier S. Vivès C. Fieschi F. Damian M. Durroux T. Banères J.L. Mouillac B.

Receptor dimers in which one of the protomers bore the fluorescent donor and the other the acceptor were assembled into lipid discs, and the orientation of the two receptors within the dimeric assembly was investigated using fluorescence transfer between these two probes."
https://openalex.org/W2157932672,"Background The flotillin family member flotillin-1 (FLOT1) encodes a caveolae-associated, integral membrane protein that belongs to lipid raft family and involves in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. However, the role of FLOT1 in development and progression of cancer remains largely unknown. The present study was aimed to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of FLOT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Real-time PCR and western blot analyses were applied to examine FLOT1 expression in fourteen HCC cell lines and one normal hepatic cell line, ten pairs of primary HCC and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues from the same patient. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine FLOT1 protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 196 HCC patients. Statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value and associations of FLOT1 expression with clinical parameters. Results FLOT1 expression was evidently up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with that in the matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. In the 196 cases of tested HCC samples, FLOT1 protein level was positively correlated with Tumor size (P = 0.025), clinical stage (P<0.002), CLIP stage (P<0.001), vascular invasion (P<0.001), relapse (P<0.001), and serum AFP levels (P = 0.025). Patients with higher FLOT1 expression had shorter overall survival time, whereas those with lower FLOT1 expression had longer survival time. Conclusions Our study demonstrated FLOT1 is associated with aggressive characteristics of HCC, and suggested the possibility of its use as a prognostic marker in patients with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2084735700,"Marine waterbirds have shown variable trends in abundance over the past four decades with some species displaying steep declines along the Pacific coast from British Columbia through California. One of the most dramatic changes has been that of western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) in the Salish Sea. This region was a former core of the species wintering distribution but they have become increasingly rare prompting calls for conservation action. A more thorough understanding of this situation requires the analysis of trends at broader geographic scales as well as a consideration of mechanisms that might have led to a change in abundance. We used hierarchical modeling with a Bayesian framework applied to 36 years of Audubon Christmas Bird Count data to assess continent-wide and regional population trends in western and Clark’s grebes (A. clarkii) from 1975 to 2010. Our results show that the North American wintering population of Aechmophorus grebes decreased by ∼52% after 1975, but also that western grebes displayed strongly opposing regional patterns. Abundance decreased by about 95% over 36 years in the Salish Sea but increased by over 300% along coastal California. As a result, the mean centre of the species distribution shifted south by an estimated 895 km between 1980 and 2010. Mechanisms underlying this shift require further study but we hypothesize that it may be related to a change in the abundance and availability of their forage fish prey base. Since the mid-1980s, the Pacific sardine stock off the California coast increased from a few thousand metric tonnes to over two million. At the same time both the abundance and availability of Pacific herring declined in the Salish Sea. Studies are needed to examine this hypothesis further and additional consideration should be directed at other changes in the marine environment that may have contributed to a range shift."
https://openalex.org/W2032356997,"Deamination of 5-methylcytidine (5MeC) in DNA results in a G:T mismatch unlike cytidine (C) deamination which gives rise to a G:U pair. Deamination of C was generally considered to arise spontaneously. It is now clear that human APOBEC3A (A3A), a polynucleotide cytidine deaminase (PCD) with specificity for single stranded DNA, can extensively deaminate human nuclear DNA. It is shown here that A3A among all human PCDs can deaminate 5-methylcytidine in a variety of single stranded DNA substrates both in vitro and in transfected cells almost as efficiently as cytidine itself. This ability of A3A to accommodate 5-methyl moiety extends to other small and physiologically relevant substituted cytidine bases such as 5-hydroxy and 5-bromocytidine. As 5MeCpG deamination hotspots characterize many genes associated with cancer it is plausible that A3A is a major player in the onset of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2057700117,"Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen which causes mild to life threatening disease in humans. Ingestion of contaminated food delivers the pathogen to the gastrointestinal tract, where it crosses the epithelial barrier and spreads to internal organs. Type I interferons (IFN-I) are produced during infection and decrease host resistance after systemic delivery of L. monocytogenes. Here we show that mice benefit from IFN-I production following infection with L. monocytogenes via the gastrointestinal route. Intragastric infection lead to increased lethality of IFN-I receptor chain 1-deficient (Ifnar1−/−) animals and to higher bacterial numbers in liver and spleen. Compared to infection from the peritoneum, bacteria infecting via the intestinal tract localized more often to periportal and pericentral regions of the liver and less frequently to the margins of liver lobes. Vigorous replication of intestine-borne L. monocytogenes in the livers of Ifnar1−/− mice 48 h post infection was accompanied by the formation of large inflammatory infiltrates in this organ and massive death of surrounding hepatocytes. This was not observed in Ifnar1−/− mice after intraperitoneal infection. The inflammatory response to infection is shaped by alterations in splenic cytokine production, particularly IFNγ, which differs after intragastric versus intraperitoneal infection. Taken together, our data suggest that the adverse or beneficial role of a cytokine may vary with the route of infection and that IFN-I are not harmful when infection with L. monocytogenes occurs via the natural route."
https://openalex.org/W2059705936,"Land use change is a major threat to global biodiversity. Forest species face the dual threats of deforestation and intensification of forest management. In regions where forests are under threat, rural landscapes that retain structural components of mature forests potentially provide valuable additional habitat for some forest species. Here, we illustrate the habitat value of traditional wood pastures for a woodpecker assemblage of six species in southern Transylvania, Romania. Wood pastures are created by long-term stable silvo-pastoral management practices, and are composed of open grassland with scattered large, old trees. Because of their demanding habitat requirements, woodpeckers share habitat with many other bird species, and have been considered as possible indicator species for bird species diversity. We first compared woodpecker assemblages between forests and wood pastures. Second, we grouped features of wood pastures into three spatial contexts and addressed how these features related to the occurrence of three woodpecker species that are formally protected. Woodpecker species composition, but not the number of species, differed between forests and wood pastures, with the green woodpecker occurring more commonly in wood pastures, and the lesser spotted woodpecker more commonly in forests. Within wood pastures, the intermediate context (especially surrounding forest cover) best explained the presence of the grey-headed and middle spotted woodpecker. By contrast, variables describing local vegetation structure and characteristics of the surrounding landscape did not affect woodpecker occurrence in wood pastures. In contrast to many other parts of Europe, in which several species of woodpeckers have declined, the traditional rural landscape of Transylvania continues to provide habitat for several woodpecker species, both in forests and wood pastures. Given the apparent habitat value of wood pastures for woodpeckers we recommend wood pastures be explicitly considered in relevant policies of the European Union, namely the Habitats Directive and the EU Common Agricultural Policy."
https://openalex.org/W2120850024,"Spermine oxidase is a FAD-containing enzyme involved in polyamines catabolism, selectively oxidizing spermine to produce H2O2, spermidine, and 3-aminopropanal. Spermine oxidase is highly expressed in the mouse brain and plays a key role in regulating the levels of spermine, which is involved in protein synthesis, cell division and cell growth. Spermine is normally released by neurons at synaptic sites where it exerts a neuromodulatory function, by specifically interacting with different types of ion channels, and with ionotropic glutamate receptors. In order to get an insight into the neurobiological roles of spermine oxidase and spermine, we have deregulated spermine oxidase gene expression producing and characterizing the transgenic mouse model JoSMOrec, conditionally overexpressing the enzyme in the neocortex. We have investigated the effects of spermine oxidase overexpression in the mouse neocortex by transcript accumulation, immunohistochemical analysis, enzymatic assays and polyamine content in young and aged animals. Transgenic JoSMOrec mice showed in the neocortex a higher H2O2 production in respect to Wild-Type controls, indicating an increase of oxidative stress due to SMO overexpression. Moreover, the response of transgenic mice to excitotoxic brain injury, induced by kainic acid injection, was evaluated by analysing the behavioural phenotype, the immunodistribution of neural cell populations, and the ultrastructural features of neocortical neurons. Spermine oxidase overexpression and the consequently altered polyamine levels in the neocortex affects the cytoarchitecture in the adult and aging brain, as well as after neurotoxic insult. It resulted that the transgenic JoSMOrec mouse line is more sensitive to KA than Wild-Type mice, indicating an important role of spermine oxidase during excitotoxicity. These results provide novel evidences of the complex and critical functions carried out by spermine oxidase and spermine in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1974705011,"Cetaceans are unique in being the only mammals completely adapted to an aquatic environment. This adaptation has required complex changes and sometimes a complete restructuring of physiology, behavior and morphology. Identifying genes that have been subjected to selection pressure during cetacean evolution would greatly enhance our knowledge of the ways in which genetic variation in this mammalian order has been shaped by natural selection. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan for positive selection in the dolphin lineage. We employed models of codon substitution that account for variation of selective pressure over branches on the tree and across sites in a sequence. We analyzed 7,859 nuclear-coding ortholog genes and using a series of likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), we identified 376 genes (4.8%) with molecular signatures of positive selection in the dolphin lineage. We used the cow as the sister group and compared estimates of selection in the cetacean genome to this using the same methods. This allowed us to define which genes have been exclusively under positive selection in the dolphin lineage. The enrichment analysis found that the identified positively selected genes are significantly over-represented for three exclusive functional categories only in the dolphin lineage: segment specification, mesoderm development and system development. Of particular interest for cetacean adaptation to an aquatic life are the following GeneOntology targets under positive selection: genes related to kidney, heart, lung, eye, ear and nervous system development."
https://openalex.org/W2010115448,"Vascular pathology and dysfunction are direct life-threatening outcomes resulting from atherosclerosis or vascular injury, which are primarily attributed to contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs) dedifferentiation and proliferation by re-entering cell cycle. Increasing evidence suggests potent protective effects of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) activation against cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanism underlying GPER function remains poorly understood, especially if it plays a potential role in modulating coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs).The objective of our study was to understand the functional role of GPER in CASMC proliferation and differentiation in coronary arteries using from humans and swine models. We found that the GPER agonist, G-1, inhibited both human and porcine CASMC proliferation in a concentration- (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry revealed that treatment with G-1 significantly decreased the proportion of S-phase and G2/M cells in the growing cell population, suggesting that G-1 inhibits cell proliferation by slowing progression of the cell cycle. Further, G-1-induced cell cycle retardation was associated with decreased expression of cyclin B, up-regulation of cyclin D1, and concomitant induction of p21, and partially mediated by suppressed ERK1/2 and Akt pathways. In addition, G-1 induces SMC differentiation evidenced by increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-actin) and smooth muscle protein 22α (SM22α) protein expressions and inhibits CASMC migration induced by growth medium.GPER activation inhibits CASMC proliferation by suppressing cell cycle progression via inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. GPER may constitute a novel mechanism to suppress intimal migration and/or synthetic phenotype of VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W2036363285,"Herein, we describe the generation of a monomeric large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent protein, mBeRFP, with excitation and emission peaks at 446 and 615 nm, respectively. Compared with two previously reported LSS-RFPs (mKeima and LSS-mKate2), mBeRFP is approximately three times brighter. In addition, mBeRFP is characterized by improved photostability, rapid maturation, an extended lifetime, and a monomeric nature. Additionally, mBeRFP can be paired with the Alexa 647 dye as a FRET donor to detect caspase 3 activity. This FRET pair has an extremely dynamic range and a large Förster radius (approximately 6.5 nm). To demonstrate the applicability of mBeRFP for imaging in living cells, we performed dual-color imaging of mBeRFP and CFP simultaneously excited by a single excitation source, and we demonstrated that these fluorescent proteins allow the clear visualization of the dynamics of Bax during cancer cell apoptosis. Thus, mBeRFP appears to be particularly useful for cellular imaging applications."
https://openalex.org/W2142982527,"We model spontaneous cortical activity with a network of coupled spiking units, in which multiple spatio-temporal patterns are stored as dynamical attractors. We introduce an order parameter, which measures the overlap (similarity) between the activity of the network and the stored patterns. We find that, depending on the excitability of the network, different working regimes are possible. For high excitability, the dynamical attractors are stable, and a collective activity that replays one of the stored patterns emerges spontaneously, while for low excitability, no replay is induced. Between these two regimes, there is a critical region in which the dynamical attractors are unstable, and intermittent short replays are induced by noise. At the critical spiking threshold, the order parameter goes from zero to one, and its fluctuations are maximized, as expected for a phase transition (and as observed in recent experimental results in the brain). Notably, in this critical region, the avalanche size and duration distributions follow power laws. Critical exponents are consistent with a scaling relationship observed recently in neural avalanches measurements. In conclusion, our simple model suggests that avalanche power laws in cortical spontaneous activity may be the effect of a network at the critical point between the replay and non-replay of spatio-temporal patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2024329072,"Cerebrolysin (CBL), a mixture of several active peptide fragments and neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is currently used in the management of cognitive alterations in patients with dementia. Since Cognitive decline as well as increased dementia are strongly associated with diabetes and previous studies addressed the protective effect of BDNF in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes; hence this work aimed to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of CBL in modulating the complications of hyperglycaemia experimentally induced by streptozotocin (STZ) on the rat brain hippocampus. To this end, male adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into (i) vehicle- (ii) CBL- and (iii) STZ diabetic-control as well as (iv) STZ+CBL groups. Diabetes was confirmed by hyperglycemia and elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c%), which were associated by weight loss, elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and decreased insulin growth factor (IGF)-1β in the serum. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia caused learning and memory impairments that corroborated degenerative changes, neuronal loss and expression of caspase (Casp)-3 in the hippocampal area of STZ-diabetic rats. Behavioral deficits were associated by decreased hippocampal glutamate (GLU), glycine, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine. Moreover, diabetic rats showed an increase in hippocampal nitric oxide and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances versus decreased non-protein sulfhydryls. Though CBL did not affect STZ-induced hyperglycemia, it partly improved body weight as well as HbA1c%. Such effects were associated by enhancement in both learning and memory as well as apparent normal cellularity in CA1and CA3 areas and reduced Casp-3 expression. CBL improved serum TNF-α and IGF-1β, GLU and 5-HT as well as hampering oxidative biomarkers. In conclusion, CBL possesses neuroprotection against diabetes-associated cerebral neurodegeneration and cognitive decline via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapototic effects."

The impulsively started plate with variable temperature and mass diffusion is considered. The dimensionless momentum equation coupled with the energy and mass diffusion equations are analytically solved using the Laplace transform method. Expressions for velocity, temperature and concentration fields are obtained. They satisfy all imposed initial and boundary conditions and can be reduced, as special cases, to some known solutions from the literature. Expressions for skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are also obtained. Finally, the effects of pertinent parameters on velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are graphically displayed whereas the variations in skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are shown through tables."

Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) employs nonspecific DNA binding interactions and facilitated diffusion to conduct a highly redundant search of adjacent sites.

Intersegmental transfer between DNA segments that are transiently in close proximity provides an elegant solution that balances global and local searching processes. It has been difficult to detect intersegmental transfer experimentally; therefore, we developed biochemical assays that allowed us to observe and measure the rates of intersegmental transfer by AAG. AAG has a flexible amino terminus that tunes its affinity for nonspecific DNA, but we find that it is not required for intersegmental transfer. As AAG has only a single DNA binding site, this argues against the bridging model for intersegmental transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2076404497,"The Oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor) is one of the few non-gekkonid lizards that are geographically widespread in the tropics. We investigated its population dynamics on Hainan Island and the adjacent mainland of China and Vietnam, focusing on the impact of cyclic upheaval and submergence of land bridges during the Pleistocene. Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals two mitochondrial lineages, A and B, which are estimated to have coalesced about 0.26 million years ago (95% credibility interval: 0.05-0.61 million years ago). Lineage A contains individuals mainly from central and southern Wuzhi Mountain on Hainan Island, whereas lineage B mainly comprises individuals from other sites on the island plus the adjacent mainland. The estimated coalescence times within lineages A (0.05 million years ago) and B (0.13 million years ago) fall within a period of cyclical land-bridge formation and disappearance in the Pleistocene. A spatial analysis of molecular variance identified two distinct population groupings: I, primarily containing lineage A, and II, mainly consisting of lineage B. However, haplotypes from lineages A and B occur sympatrically, suggesting that gene flow is ongoing. Neither Wuzhi Mountain nor Qiongzhou Strait and Gulf of Tonkin act as barriers to gene flow among C. versicolor populations. Analyses of the data using mismatch distributions and extended Bayesian skyline plots provide evidence of a relatively stable population size through time for Group I, and moderate population expansions and contractions during the end of the Pleistocene for Group II. We conclude that the phylogeographical patterns of C. versicolor are the combined product of Pleistocene sea-level oscillations and nonphysical barriers to gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W1989489077,"cis-Jasmone (CJ) is a natural plant product that activates defence against herbivores in model and crop plants. In this study, we investigated whether CJ could prime defence in maize, Zea mays, against the leafhopper, Cicadulina storeyi, responsible for the transmission of maize streak virus (MSV). Priming occurs when a pre-treatment, in this case CJ, increases the potency and speed of a defence response upon subsequent attack on the plant. Here, we tested insect responses to plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a Y-tube olfactometer bioassay. Our initial experiments showed that, in this system, there was no significant response of the herbivore to CJ itself and no difference in response to VOCs collected from unexposed plants compared to CJ exposed plants, both without insects. VOCs were then collected from C. storeyi-infested maize seedlings with and without CJ pre-treatment. The bioassay revealed a significant preference by this pest for VOCs from infested seedlings without the CJ pre-treatment. A timed series of VOC collections and bioassays showed that the effect was strongest in the first 22 h of insect infestation, i.e. before the insects had themselves induced a change in VOC emission. Chemical analysis showed that treatment of maize seedlings with CJ, followed by exposure to C. storeyi, led to a significant increase in emission of the defensive sesquiterpenes (E)-(1R,9S)-caryophyllene, (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, known to act as herbivore repellents. The chemical analysis explains the behavioural effects observed in the olfactometer, as the CJ treatment caused plants to emit a blend of VOCs comprising more of the repellent components in the first 22 h of insect infestation than control plants. The speed and potency of VOC emission was increased by the CJ pre-treatment. This is the first indication that CJ can prime plants for enhanced production of defensive VOCs antagonist towards herbivores."
https://openalex.org/W1982217937,"Through bioinformatics analyses of a human gene expression database representing 105 different tissues and cell types, we identified 687 skin-associated genes that are selectively and highly expressed in human skin. Over 50 of these represent uncharacterized genes not previously associated with skin and include a subset that encode novel secreted and plasma membrane proteins. The high levels of skin-associated expression for eight of these novel therapeutic target genes were confirmed by semi-quantitative real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of normal skin and skin-derived cell lines. Four of these are expressed specifically by epidermal keratinocytes; two that encode G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR87 and GPR115), and two that encode secreted proteins (WFDC5 and SERPINB7). Further analyses using cytokine-activated and terminally differentiated human primary keratinocytes or a panel of common inflammatory, autoimmune or malignant skin diseases revealed distinct patterns of regulation as well as disease associations that point to important roles in cutaneous homeostasis and disease. Some of these novel uncharacterized skin genes may represent potential biomarkers or drug targets for the development of future diagnostics or therapeutics."

The brain-blood barrier (BBB) in mutant brains exhibited increased permeability for Evans blue and fluorescent-dextran, suggesting a breakdown of the BBB in the mutant brains. Impaired BBB integrity facilitated autoreactive T cells infiltrating into all regions of the mutant brains. Brain autoimmune disorder caused accumulation of the ubiquitin-reactive aggregates in the mutant hippocampus, and early formation of autofluorescent lipofuscins in the neurons throughout the entire brains. Chronic neuroinflammation caused damage of the hippocampal mossy fibers and neuronal apoptotic death.

https://openalex.org/W2045402585,"The crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (cHH) is a neuropeptide present in many decapods. Two different chiral isomers are simultaneously present in Astacid crayfish and their specific biological functions are still poorly understood. The present study is aimed at better understanding the potentially different effect of each of the isomers on the hepatopancreatic gene expression profile in the crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus, in the context of short term hyperglycemia. Hence, two different chemically synthesized cHH enantiomers, containing either L- or D-Phe3, were injected to the circulation of intermolt females following removal of their X organ-Sinus gland complex. The effects triggered by the injection of the two alternate isomers were detected after one hour through measurement of circulating glucose levels. Triggered changes of the transcriptome expression profile in the hepatopancreas were analyzed by RNA-seq. A whole transcriptome shotgun sequence assembly provided the assumedly complete transcriptome of P. leptodactylus hepatopancreas, followed by RNA-seq analysis of changes in the expression level of many genes caused by the application of each of the hormone isomers. Circulating glucose levels were much higher in response to the D-isoform than to the L-isoform injection, one hour from injection. Similarly, the RNA-seq analysis confirmed a stronger effect on gene expression following the administration of D-cHH, while just limited alterations were caused by the L-isomer. These findings demonstrated a more prominent short term effect of the D-cHH on the transcription profile and shed light on the effect of the D-isomer on specific functional gene groups. Another contribution of the study is the construction of a de novo assembly of the hepatopancreas transcriptome, consisting of 39,935 contigs, that dramatically increases the molecular information available for this species and for crustaceans in general, providing an efficient tool for studying gene expression patterns in this organ."

Surprisingly, the increase of tonic inhibition was accompanied by a dramatic reduction of the phasic inhibition, suggesting a possible homeostatic regulation of the total inhibition.

In developing cerebellum, the level of tonic inhibition increases significantly in the first postnatal month, but synaptic GABAergic transmission decreases substantially in the same time (25.Brickley S.G.

It has also been reported that in transgenic mice with ectopic expression of the α6 subunit, tonic conductance increases, but synaptic GABA responses decrease simultaneously (27.Wisden W. Cope D.

These studies suggest a possible interplay between synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, but the molecular mechanism underlying such interaction is currently unknown. In this study, we employed a series of molecular manipulations of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors to investigate their functional effects on fast GABAergic synaptic transmission. Overexpression of α6β3δ receptors in cultured hippocampal pyrimidal neurons resulted in a dramatic decrease of synaptic GABAergic events as well as a significant reduction of presynaptic GABAergic terminals. Surprisingly, such a functional outcome did not require the activation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. We further demonstrated that the down-regulation of phasic inhibition is not due to the positional effect of α6β3δ receptors because inserting a gephyrin-binding site (GBS) 3The abbreviations used are: GBS, gephyrin-binding site; TTX, tetrodotoxin; BIC, bicuculline methobromide; DNQX, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; THIP, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol hydrochloride; mIPSC, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current; mEPSC, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current; ANOVA, analysis of variance; GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; P7, postnatal day 7. into the α6 and δ subunits targeted α6GBSβ3δGBS receptors to postsynaptic sites but could not rescue phasic inhibition. Interestingly, overexpressing α5β3γ2-receptors also decreased synaptic GABAergic transmission. On the basis of these results, we propose that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors will compete for limited receptor slots on the cell surface so that the total GABA inhibition can be regulated in a homeostatic manner. Hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared form newborn C57BL/6 mouse pups (of either sex) as described previously (2.Wu X. Wu Z. Ning G. Guo Y. Ali R. Macdonald R.L. De Blas A.L. Luscher B.

Briefly, the hippocampi or cerebral cortex tissue was cut into 1-mm3 cubes and digested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA containing 50 units/ml DNase I. Dissociated single neurons were then plated onto a monolayer of astrocytes on poly-D-lysine-coated coverglass at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. The neuronal culture medium contained 500 ml minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 10 ml B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 100 mg NaHCO3, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 4 μm AraC to suppress the excessive proliferation of astrocytes. Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2–3 weeks. Neurons were transfected at 2–4 days in vitro using our modified high-efficiency calcium phosphate transfection protocol (28.Jiang M. Chen G. High Ca2+-phosphate transfection efficiency in low-density neuronal cultures.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). About 1 μg of each plasmid was used for the α6, α6β3δ, or α2β3γ2 transfection. The α6GBS, β3, and δGBS subunits were cotransfected at a ratio of 2:1:0.5 μg. About 0.4 μg each of GFP or mCherry was coexpressed to identify the transfected neurons. Neurons at 10–14 days in vitro were used for electrophysiological and immunocytochemical analyses. HEK 293T cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HEK cells were transfected with PEI (molecular weight 25,000, Polysciences, Inc.). HEK cells were split 1 day ahead and allowed to reach 90% confluence by the time of transfection. For each well in a 24-well plate, 1 μg of total DNA was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), mixed with 4 μl of PEI (1 μg/μl), sat for 5 min, and added drop-by-drop to the culture well containing 500 μl of media. After 5 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed with fresh medium to remove the excess reagents. The transfected HEK cells were used for electrophysiological study 1–3 days after transfection. The CMV-based expression vectors for the GABAA receptor α2, β3, and mycγ2 subunits were described previously (6.Alldred M.J. Mulder-Rosi J. Lingenfelter S.E. Chen G. Lüscher B. Distinct γ2 subunit domains mediate clustering and synaptic function of postsynaptic GABAa receptors and gephyrin.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The α6 and δ constructs in the pCMVneo backbone were gifts from Dr. R. L. MacDonald (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). The α5 subunit was a gift from Dr. Matthias Kneussel (University of Hamburg Medical School). The α6GBS and δGBS were constructed in our laboratory as described recently (2.Wu X. Wu Z. Ning G. Guo Y. Ali R. Macdonald R.L. De Blas A.L. Luscher B. Chen G. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptor α subunits play a direct role in synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27417-27430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GBS originated from the glycine receptor β subunit (29.Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Identification of a gephyrin binding motif on the glycine receptor beta subunit.Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) was inserted into the intracellular loop of the δ and α6 subunits after amino acid 341 and amino acid 340, respectively. GABA and tetrodotoxin (TTX) were purchased from Sigma. Bicuculline methobromide (BIC), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol hydrochloride (THIP) were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). DNQX and THIP were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make concentrated stock solutions. Other drugs were dissolved in deionized water. All drugs were freshly diluted to working concentrations in the bath solution on the day of the experiment. The final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was lower than 0.1%. For chronic BIC treatment, BIC (20 μm) was added to the neuronal culture medium 2–4 days before electrophysiological recordings. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 12 min and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in the blocking solution (PBS with 3% normal goat serum and 2% normal donkey serum) for 30 min. All steps were conducted at room temperature unless specified otherwise. Antibodies were diluted in the same blocking solution. The δ/δGBS subunit on the neuronal surface was labeled before permeabilization with rabbit-anti-δ-Nterm antibody (1:500, PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO). Other primary antibodies were applied after Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse-anti-GAD65 (1:100, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), mouse-anti-gephyrin mAb7a (1:500, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), and chicken-anti-GFP (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The following secondary antibodies were used as appropriate to detect primary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat-anti-chicken (1:500), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey-anti-rabbit (1:300), and Alexa Fluor 647 goat-anti-mouse (1:300, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images for GAD immunoreactivity were captured on an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000S) equipped with a digital charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu C4742-95). To quantify GABAergic synaptic terminals, images of 60 neurons were taken from each group. For each transfected neuron, two 50-μm segments of major dendrites were randomly chosen on the basis of the GFP image, and GAD-positive puncta were counted in each segment. The total number of GAD puncta along the 100-μm dendrite was compared among neurons transfected with GFP, α6β3δ, or α6 subunit alone. To investigate the surface expression of δ or δGBS, confocal images were acquired from an Olympus FV1000 microscope. Quantification of the δ immunosignal was conducted using ImageJ software. The neuronal soma together with two major dendrites of each transfected neuron was traced manually under the mCherry image. The mean fluorescence intensity of δ immunostaining in the region of interest was analyzed. The background signal in the nearby area without any neurons was subtracted during analysis. Whole cell recordings were performed in voltage clamp mode using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices) as described before (30.Deng L. Yao J. Fang C. Dong N. Luscher B. Chen G. Sequential postsynaptic maturation governs the temporal order of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptogenesis in rat embryonic cultures.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10860-10869Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A coverglass with cultured cells was placed in the recording chamber with continuous perfusion of the bath Tyrode's solution (128 mm NaCl, 30 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.3), osmolarity ∼320 mm). Fire-polished borosilicate glass pipettes with a resistance of 3–6 MΩ were used for recording. The internal pipette solution contained 135 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-phosphocreatine, 4 mm MgATP, and 0.5 mm Na2GTP (pH 7.3), osmolarity ∼300 mm). Recordings were conducted at room temperature. The membrane potential was held at −70 mV. Data were acquired using pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices), sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz. Drugs were applied through a six-channel manifold connected to a valve control system (VC-6, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) to achieve a fast switch between different solutions. Whole cell GABA/THIP-induced currents were recorded in the presence of TTX (0.5 μm) and DNQX (10 μm) to block voltage-gated sodium channels and AMPA receptors. TTX and DNQX were also added to the bath solution to record miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), whereas mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of TTX and bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist, 20 μm). To examine tonic currents in neurons, GABA (2 μm) was bath-applied, and, after the GABA-induced current reached a plateau (normally after 1 min), 40 μm bicuculline was added to block all GABAA receptors. The shift in holding current after bicuculline application was quantified as the tonic current. DNQX (10 μm) was applied throughout the entire recording period to block AMPA receptor activation. To analyze the kinetics of mIPSCs, single events recorded from each cell were identified using MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft). The events were aligned at the 50% rise point, and the average traces were used for curve fitting. The decay was fitted using two-exponential equations, and the weighted time constant (τweighted) was calculated using the following equation: τweighted = (τ1 × A1 + τ2 × A2)/(A1 + A2). Pooled data were presented as mean ± S.E., and unpaired Student's t test was used for two-group comparison, whereas one-way ANOVA was used for multiple group comparison. To investigate the interrelationship between synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, we overexpressed the α6, β3, and δ subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons to increase tonic inhibition and examined the effect on synaptic GABAergic transmission. Pyramidal neurons with a large apical dendrite and multiple basal dendrites were selected for recordings. THIP (also called Gaboxadol) is a relatively selective agonist for δ-containing GABAA receptors at low concentrations (31.Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Ebert B. GABAa agonists and partial agonists. THIP (Gaboxadol) as a non-opioid analgesic and a novel type of hypnotic.Biochem.

As expected, neurons transfected with α6β3δ subunits (together with GFP) showed significantly larger THIP (5 μΜ) currents, whereas α2β3γ2 overexpression did not increase THIP currents compared with non-transfected neurons (Fig. 1, A–C and G; non-TF, 17 ± 5 pA, n = 22; α6β3δ, 192 ± 32 pA, n = 11; α2β3γ2, 6 ± 3 pA, n = 10; p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, overexpression of either α6β3δ or α2β3γ2 receptors did not change the whole-cell GABA (100 μΜ) currents (Fig. 1, D–F and H; non-TF, 3861 ± 461 pA, n = 20; α6β3δ, 4228 ± 453 pA, n = 12; α2β3γ2, 4997 ± 445 pA, n = 8; p > 0.3, one-way ANOVA). The γ2 subunit was myc-tagged, and immunostaining confirmed that it was expressed after transfection and clustered at postsynaptic sites (2.Wu X. Wu Z. Ning G. Guo Y. Ali R. Macdonald R.L. De Blas A.L. Luscher B. Chen G. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptor α subunits play a direct role in synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27417-27430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of α6β3δ subunits in hippocampal neurons results in a large tonic current, but the total GABA current remains unchanged. On the other hand, overexpression of α2β3γ2 subunits has no effect on the tonic current nor on the total GABA current, as if the total number of GABAA receptors on the cell surface had reached the plateau before overexpression. We next examined whether the increased expression of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors might affect synaptic GABAergic transmission. mIPSCs were recorded in the presence of TTX (0.5 μm) and DNQX (10 μm) to block action potentials and glutamatergic responses, respectively. The average mIPSC frequency recorded in non-transfected control neurons was 1.25 ± 0.20 Hz (n = 30, Fig. 2, A and D). Surprisingly, in neurons overexpressing α6β3δ-receptors, the mIPSC frequency was reduced significantly to 0.14 ± 0.04 Hz (Fig. 2B, n = 9, p < 0.001), a dramatic 9-fold decrease from the control level. We wondered whether such a drastic reduction was caused by transfecting multiple plasmids in neurons. Therefore, we overexpressed α2β3γ2 subunits as a control but found no significant change in the frequency of mIPSCs (Fig. 2, C and D, 0.94 ± 0.25 Hz, n = 9, p > 0.5), suggesting that transfection of multiple plasmids did not cause mIPSC reduction. Furthermore, the average mIPSC amplitude was found to be not different among the three groups (Fig. 2E, non-TF, 20.9 ± 0.9 pA, n = 30; α6β3δ, 18.2 ± 1.3 pA, n = 9; α2β3γ2, 17.9 ± 1.9 pA, n = 9; p > 0.15, one-way ANOVA). These experiments revealed that increasing extrasynaptic α6β3δ receptor expression in hippocampal neurons significantly down-regulates synaptic GABAergic transmission. Our recent studies demonstrated that, in addition to the γ2 and δ subunits, the α subunits also play a direct role in GABAA receptor targeting (2.Wu X. Wu Z. Ning G. Guo Y. Ali R. Macdonald R.L. De Blas A.L. Luscher B. Chen G. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAa) receptor α subunits play a direct role in synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27417-27430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether expressing the α6 subunit alone in cultured hippocampal neurons can affect synaptic GABAergic transmission. Similar to α6β3δ cotransfection, we found that transfection with the α6 subunit alone (together with mCherry for identification purposes) significantly decreased the mIPSC frequency (Fig. 3, A–C; control, 1.2 ± 0.2 Hz, n = 19; α6, 0.27 ± 0.06 Hz, n = 21; p < 0.001, unpaired Student's t test). Despite the remarkable 77% reduction in mIPSC frequency, α6 expression did not change the amplitude of mIPSCs in a significant way (Fig. 3D; control, 25.2 ± 2.2 pA, n = 19; α6, 21.0 ± 1.0 pA, n = 19; p = 0.09, unpaired Student's t test). We next investigated whether overexpressing the α6 subunit alone resulted in any changes of tonic current. In control neurons (non-transfected"

However, these predictions are customarily done by relating de novo the distribution of the species with climatic conditions with no regard of previously available knowledge about the factors affecting the species distribution. We propose to take advantage of known species distribution models, but proceeding to update them with the variables yielded by climatic models before projecting them to the future. To exemplify our proposal, the availability of suitable habitat across Spain for the endangered Bonelli's Eagle (Aquila fasciata) was modelled by updating a pre-existing model based on current climate and topography to a combination of different general circulation models and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Our results suggested that the main threat for this endangered species would not be climate change, since all forecasting models show that its distribution will be maintained and increased in mainland Spain for all the XXI century. We remark on the importance of linking conservation biology with distribution modelling by updating existing models, frequently available for endangered species, considering all the known factors conditioning the species' distribution, instead of building new models that are based on climate change variables only."
https://openalex.org/W2158022445,"A prospective consecutive cohort study (follow-up study).Our study investigated whether implantation of an expandable titanium mesh cage (Osseofix®) is a successful and safe minimally invasive therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF). Our experiences, clinical and radiological findings after 12 months follow-up are presented. Kypho- and vertebroplasty are well-established minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of osteoporotic VCF. The main complications associated with both procedures are uncontrolled bone cement leakage. Therefore a suitable alternative has been investigated.During June 2010 to May 2011 24 patients were included with 32 osteoporotic VCF (T6 to L4). All of them were stabilized with the Osseofix® system. Preinterventionally we performed X-ray, MRI, and bone density measurements (DXA). Clinical and radiological results were evaluated preop., postop. and after 12 months postop. based on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), X-ray (Beck Index, Cobb-angle) and CT.There was a significant improvement in the mean ODI (70,6% to 30,1%) as well as a significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) (7,7 to 1,4) after 12 month. The mean kyphotic angle according to Cobb showed significant improvements (11,7° to 10,4°) after 12 months. Postinterventional imaging showed only one case of loss of height in a stabilized vertebral body (3.1%). We saw no changes in posterior vertebral wall or adjacent fractures. Except for one pronounced postoperative hematoma we saw no surgical complications including no cement leakage.Stabilization of symptomatic osteoporotic VCF with Osseofix® system is a safe and effective procedure, even in fractures with posterior wall involvement. The clinical mid-term results are good at a very low complication rate. The Osseofix® system is an interesting alternative to the established procedures of cement augmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2004530097,"Pockets are today at the cornerstones of modern drug discovery projects and at the crossroad of several research fields, from structural biology to mathematical modeling. Being able to predict if a small molecule could bind to one or more protein targets or if a protein could bind to some given ligands is very useful for drug discovery endeavors, anticipation of binding to off- and anti-targets. To date, several studies explore such questions from chemogenomic approach to reverse docking methods. Most of these studies have been performed either from the viewpoint of ligands or targets. However it seems valuable to use information from both ligands and target binding pockets. Hence, we present a multivariate approach relating ligand properties with protein pocket properties from the analysis of known ligand-protein interactions. We explored and optimized the pocket-ligand pair space by combining pocket and ligand descriptors using Principal Component Analysis and developed a classification engine on this paired space, revealing five main clusters of pocket-ligand pairs sharing specific and similar structural or physico-chemical properties. These pocket-ligand pair clusters highlight correspondences between pocket and ligand topological and physico-chemical properties and capture relevant information with respect to protein-ligand interactions. Based on these pocket-ligand correspondences, a protocol of prediction of clusters sharing similarity in terms of recognition characteristics is developed for a given pocket-ligand complex and gives high performances. It is then extended to cluster prediction for a given pocket in order to acquire knowledge about its expected ligand profile or to cluster prediction for a given ligand in order to acquire knowledge about its expected pocket profile. This prediction approach shows promising results and could contribute to predict some ligand properties critical for binding to a given pocket, and conversely, some key pocket properties for ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2057103284,"CD4+ T cells play a central role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) via high-level production of effector cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. To better characterize the colitogenic CD4+ T cells, we examined their expression of CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that is expressed by T cells upon activation and is upregulated in several inflammatory diseases. We found that 80% of colonic lamina propria CD4+ T cells expressed CXCR6 in the CD45RBhigh T cell-transferred colitis model. CXCR6 expression was similarly upregulated in inflamed mucosa of patients with Crohn’s disease. Although surface marker analysis demonstrated that both CXCR6+ and CXCR6− CD4+ T-cell subsets consist of the cells with effector and effector-memory cells, the more cells in the CXCR6+ subset produced IFN-γ and TNF-α compared to CXCR6− subset, and only the CXCR6+ subset produced IL-17A. Nevertheless, adoptive retransfer of lamina propria CXCR6+ T cells into Rag1−/− recipients failed to induce the disease due to limited expansion of the transferred cells. By contrast, retransfer of CXCR6− cells evoked colitis similar to that observed in CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell-transferred mice, and resulted in their conversion into CXCR6+ cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that the CXCR6+CD4+ T-cell subset consists of terminally differentiated effector cells that serve as the major source of effector cytokines in the inflamed tissue, whereas CXCR6−CD4+ T-cell subset serves as a colitogenic memory compartment that retains the ability to proliferate and differentiate into CXCR6+CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087622469,"From the early days of psychology, theorists have observed that parents sometimes transfer their own unfulfilled ambitions onto their child. We propose that parents are especially inclined to do so when they see their child as part of themselves, more so than as a separate individual. When parents see their child as part of themselves, their child’s achievements may easily come to function as a surrogate for parents’ own unfulfilled ambitions. In the present experiment, 73 parents (89% women, Mage = 43 years) were randomly assigned to reflect on either their own or others’ unfulfilled ambitions. Results showed that, when faced with their own unfulfilled ambitions, parents who see their child as part of themselves want their child to fulfill their unfulfilled ambitions. This study provides the first experimental evidence to suggest that parents may desire their child to redeem their broken dreams."
https://openalex.org/W2016983316,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have described a large number of new candidate genes that contribute to of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). In some cases, small clusters of genes are implicated, rather than a single gene, and in all cases, the genetic contribution is not defined through the effects on a specific organ, such as the pancreas or liver. There is a significant need to develop and use human cell-based models to examine the effects these genes may have on glucose regulation. We describe the development of a primary human hepatocyte model that adjusts glucose disposition according to hormonal signals. This model was used to determine whether candidate genes identified in GWA studies regulate hepatic glucose disposition through siRNAs corresponding to the list of identified genes. We find that several genes affect the storage of glucose as glycogen (glycolytic response) and/or affect the utilization of pyruvate, the critical step in gluconeogenesis. Of the genes that affect both of these processes, CAMK1D, TSPAN8 and KIF11 affect the localization of a mediator of both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis regulation, CRTC2, to the nucleus in response to glucagon. In addition, the gene CDKAL1 was observed to affect glycogen storage, and molecular experiments using mutant forms of CDK5, a putative target of CDKAL1, in HepG2 cells show that this is mediated by coordinate regulation of CDK5 and PKA on MEK, which ultimately regulates the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a critical step in the insulin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2068732957,"Maraviroc, an (HIV-1) entry inhibitor, binds to CCR5 and efficiently prevents R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from using CCR5 as a coreceptor for entry into CD4+ cells. However, HIV-1 can elude maraviroc by using the drug-bound form of CCR5 as a coreceptor. This property is known as noncompetitive resistance. HIV-1V3-M5 derived from HIV-1JR-FLan is a noncompetitive-resistant virus that contains five mutations (I304V/F312W/T314A/E317D/I318V) in the gp120 V3 loop alone. To obtain genetic and structural insights into maraviroc resistance in HIV-1, we performed here mutagenesis and computer-assisted structural study. A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that combinations of V3 mutations are required for HIV-1JR-FLan to replicate in the presence of 1 µM maraviroc, and that a T199K mutation in the C2 region increases viral fitness in combination with V3 mutations. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the gp120 outer domain V3 loop with or without the five mutations showed that the V3 mutations induced (i) changes in V3 configuration on the gp120 outer domain, (ii) reduction of an anti-parallel β-sheet in the V3 stem region, (iii) reduction in fluctuations of the V3 tip and stem regions, and (iv) a shift of the fluctuation site at the V3 base region. These results suggest that the HIV-1 gp120 V3 mutations that confer maraviroc resistance alter structure and dynamics of the V3 loop on the gp120 outer domain, and enable interactions between gp120 and the drug-bound form of CCR5."
https://openalex.org/W2118356664,"Malignant gliomas (MG), including grades III and IV astrocytomas, are the most common adult brain tumors. These tumors are highly aggressive with a median survival of less than 2 years. Nuclear factor I (NFI) is a family of transcription factors that regulates the expression of glial genes in the developing brain. We have previously shown that regulation of the brain fatty acid-binding protein (B-FABP; FABP7) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) genes in MG cells is dependent on the phosphorylation state of NFI, with hypophosphorylation of NFI correlating with GFAP and B-FABP expression. Importantly, NFI phosphorylation is dependent on phosphatase activity that is enriched in GFAP/B-FABP+ve cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that NFI occupies the GFAP and B-FABP promoters in NFI-hypophosphorylated GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells. NFI occupancy, NFI-dependent transcriptional activity, and NFI phosphorylation are all modulated by the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Importantly, a cleaved form of calcineurin, associated with increased phosphatase activity, is specifically expressed in NFI-hypophosphorylated GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells. Calcineurin in GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells localizes to the nucleus. In contrast, calcineurin is primarily found in the cytoplasm of GFAP/B-FABP-ve cells, suggesting a dual mechanism for calcineurin activation in MG. Finally, our results demonstrate that calcineurin expression is up-regulated in areas of high infiltration/migration in grade IV astrocytoma tumor tissue. Our data suggest a critical role for calcineurin in NFI transcriptional regulation and in the determination of MG infiltrative properties."
https://openalex.org/W1977540953,"This study investigated the effects of pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2) and CYP2B6 genetic variants on sodium ferulate (SF)-mediated induction of bupropion hydroxylation. The pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were evaluated after an oral dose of bupropion (150 mg) administered with and without SF pretreatment for 14 days in 33 healthy subjects. The area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) ratio of AUC_hyd (AUC(0-∞) of hydroxybupropion)/AUC_bup (AUC(0-∞) of bupropion) represents the CYP2B6 hydroxylation activity, which was significantly lower in CYP2B6*6 carriers (NR1I2 TGT noncarriers or carriers) than in noncarriers in both the basal and SF-induced states (p-value<0.05). AUC ratio and AUC_hyd of NR1I2 -24113AA variant were markedly lower than GA and GG genotypes (7.5±2.1 versus 14.5±3.3 and 20.6±1.1, and 8873±1431 versus 14,504±2218 and 17,586±1046) in the induced states. However, -24020(-)/(-) variant didn't show significant difference in the induction of CYP2B6 hydroxylation activity by SF compared with other -24020[GAGAAG]/(-) genotypes. NR1I2 TGT haplotype (-25385T+g.7635G+g.8055T) carriers exhibited a significantly decreased AUC ratio, compared with TGT noncarriers, in the basal states (7.6±1.0 versus 9.7±1.0), while this result wasn't observed in CYP2B6*6 noncarriers. Moreover, individuals with complete mutation-type [CYP2B6*6/*6+NR1I2 TGT+ -24113AA+ -24020 (-)/(-)] showed even lower percent difference of AUC ratio (8.7±1.2 versus 39.5±8.2) than those with complete wild-type. In conclusion, it is suggested that NR1I2 variants decrease the bupropion hydroxylation induced by SF treatment, particularly in CYP2B6*6 carriers.ChiCTR.org ChiCTR-TRC-11001285."
https://openalex.org/W2024407294,"The superfamily 1 helicase, RecD2, is a monomeric, bacterial enzyme with a role in DNA repair, but with 5'-3' activity unlike most enzymes from this superfamily. Rate constants were determined for steps within the ATPase cycle of RecD2 in the presence of ssDNA. The fluorescent ATP analog, mantATP (2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ATP), was used throughout to provide a complete set of rate constants and determine the mechanism of the cycle for a single nucleotide species. Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were used to determine rate constants for adenosine nucleotide binding and release, quenched-flow measurements were used for the hydrolytic cleavage step, and the fluorescent phosphate biosensor was used for phosphate release kinetics. Some rate constants could also be measured using the natural substrate, ATP, and these suggested a similar mechanism to that obtained with mantATP. The data show that a rearrangement linked to Mg(2+) coordination, which occurs before the hydrolysis step, is rate-limiting in the cycle and that this step is greatly accelerated by bound DNA. This is also shown here for the PcrA 3'-5' helicase and so may be a general mechanism governing superfamily 1 helicases. The mechanism accounts for the tight coupling between translocation and ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987330578,"Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide hormone produced mainly by a distinct group of dispersed endocrine cells located within the gastric oxyntic mucosa. Besides secreted gene products derived from the preproghrelin gene, which include acyl-ghrelin, desacyl-ghrelin and obestatin, ghrelin cells also synthesize the secreted protein nesfatin-1. The main goal of the current study was to identify other proteins secreted from ghrelin cells. An initial gene chip screen using mRNAs derived from highly enriched pools of mouse gastric ghrelin cells demonstrated high levels of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR), both of which are known to circulate in the bloodstream bound to each other. This high expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR using as template mRNA derived from the enriched gastric ghrelin cell pools and from two ghrelin-producing cell lines (SG-1 and PG-1). RBP4 protein also was shown to be secreted into the culture medium of ghrelin cell lines. Neither acute nor chronic caloric restriction had a significant effect on RBP4 mRNA levels within stomachs of C57BL/6J mice, although both manipulations significantly decreased stomach TTR mRNA levels. In vitro studies using PG-1 cells showed no effect on RBP4 release of octanoic acid, epinephrine or norepinephrine, all of which are known to act directly on ghrelin cells to stimulate ghrelin secretion. These data provide new insights into ghrelin cell physiology, and given the known functions of RBP4 and TTR, support an emerging role for the ghrelin cell in blood glucose handling and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2058949669,"The immunoglobulins expressed by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells are highly restricted, suggesting they are selected for binding either self or foreign antigen. Of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes expressed in CLL, IGHV1-69 is the most common, and often is expressed with little or no somatic mutation, and restricted IGHD and IGHJ gene usage. We found that antibodies encoded by one particular IGHV1-69 subset, designated CLL69C, with the HCDR3 encoded by the IGHD3-3 gene in reading frame 2 and IGHJ6, specifically bound to oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE), which are products of enhanced lipid peroxidation and a major target of innate natural antibodies. Specifically, CLL69C bound immunodominant OSE adducts termed MAA (malondialdehyde–acetaldehyde-adducts), which are found on apoptotic cells, inflammatory tissues, and atherosclerotic lesions. It also reacted specifically with MAA-specific peptide mimotopes. Light chain shuffling indicated that non-stochastically paired L chain of IGLV3-9 contributes to the antigen binding of CLL69C. A nearly identical CLL69C Ig heavy chain was identified from an MAA-enriched umbilical cord phage displayed Fab library, and a derived Fab with the same HCDR3 rearrangement displayed identical MAA-binding properties. These data support the concept that OSE (MAA-epitopes), which are ubiquitous products of inflammation, may play a role in clonal selection and expansion of CLL B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088435996,"Background In the Asia-Pacific region many countries have adopted the WHO’s public health approach to HIV care and treatment. We performed exploratory analyses of the factors associated with first major modification to first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-rich and resource-limited countries in the region. Methods We selected treatment naive HIV-positive adults from the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) and the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). We dichotomised each country’s per capita income into high/upper-middle (T-H) and lower-middle/low (T-L). Survival methods stratified by income were used to explore time to first major modification of first-line ART and associated factors. We defined a treatment modification as either initiation of a new class of antiretroviral (ARV) or a substitution of two or more ARV agents from within the same ARV class. Results A total of 4250 patients had 961 major modifications to first-line ART in the first five years of therapy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of treatment modification was 0.48 (0.44–0.52), 0.33 (0.30–0.36) and 0.21 (0.18–0.23) for AHOD, T-H and T-L respectively. We found no strong associations between typical patient characteristic factors and rates of treatment modification. In AHOD, relative to sites that monitor twice-yearly (both CD4 and HIV RNA-VL), quarterly monitoring corresponded with a doubling of the rate of treatment modifications. In T-H, relative to sites that monitor once-yearly (both CD4 and HIV RNA-VL), monitoring twice-yearly corresponded to a 1.8 factor increase in treatment modifications. In T-L, no sites on average monitored both CD4 & HIV RNA-VL concurrently once-yearly. We found no differences in rates of modifications for once- or twice-yearly CD4 count monitoring. Conclusions Low-income countries tended to have lower rates of major modifications made to first-line ART compared to higher-income countries. In higher-income countries, an increased rate of RNA-VL monitoring was associated with increased modifications to first-line ART."
https://openalex.org/W2008313390,"Aliphatic n-alkanols are a family of ubiquitous substances that display general anesthetic properties in accordance to their degree of hydrophobicity. In addition, the immunomodulatory activity of one of its members, ethanol, has long been recognized. We reasoned that because unbranched aliphatic n-alkanols are structurally very similar they might have an immunological impact that mirrors their anesthetic potency. We report the impact of the homologous C1-C12 alcohol series on the ability of activated primary human lymphocytes to produce IFN-γ. Methanol enhanced IFN-γ production whereas C2-C10 alcohols reduced the release of this cytokine. The activity of the n-alkanol series was observed within a wide concentration window ranging from millimolar levels for short chain alcohols to micromolar amounts for C7-C10 alcohols. There was a clear correlation between immunomodulatory activity and hydrophobicity of the compounds, but a cutoff effect was evident at C11. n-Alkanols were shown to act downstream of the cell membrane because T cell receptor early signaling was preserved. The activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) was down-regulated progressively in accordance to the size of the n-alkanol aliphatic chains with a clear downward trend that was interrupted at C11. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling was also compromised, but the cutoff appeared earlier at C10. The pattern of immunomodulation and transcriptional dysregulation induced by the n-alkanol series suggested the existence of interaction pockets of defined dimensions within intracellular targets that compromise the activation of NFAT and NF-κB transcription factors and ultimately modulate the effector function of the T lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2011081028,"Background There is evidence for a role of ionizing radiation in cardiovascular diseases. The goal of this work was to identify changes in oxidative and nitrative stress pathways and the status of the endothelinergic system during progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice after single and repeated exposure to ionizing radiation. Methods and Results B6.129P2-ApoE tmlUnc mice on a low-fat diet were acutely exposed (whole body) to Co60 (γ) (single dose 0, 0.5, and 2 Gy) at a dose rate of 36.32 cGy/min, or repeatedly (cumulative dose 0 and 2 Gy) at a dose-rate of 0.1 cGy/min for 5 d/wk, over a period of 4 weeks. Biological endpoints were investigated after 3–6 months of recovery post-radiation. The nitrative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine and the vasoregulator peptides endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in plasma were increased (p<0.05) in a dose-dependent manner 3–6 months after acute or chronic exposure to radiation. The oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane was not affected by radiation, while plasma 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decreased (p<0.05) after treatment. At 2Gy radiation dose, serum cholesterol was increased (p = 0.008) relative to controls. Percent lesion area increased (p = 0.005) with age of animal, but not with radiation treatment. Conclusions Our observations are consistent with persistent nitrative stress and activation of the endothelinergic system in ApoE−/− mice after low-level ionizing radiation exposures. These mechanisms are known factors in the progression of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2061393765,"Background Treatment of LQT2 is inadequate. Many drugs which can pharmacologically rescue defective protein trafficking in LQT2 also result in potent blockade of HERG current, negating their therapeutic benefit. It is reported that PD-118057 and thapsigargin can rescue LQT2 without hERG channel blockade, but the precise mechanism of action is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of PD-118057 and thapsigargin on the dominant negative E637K-hERG mutant has not been previously investigated. Objective In this study, we investigated: (a) the effect of PD-118057 and thapsigargin on the current amplitudes of WT-hERG and WT/E637K-hERG channels; (b) the effect of PD-118057 and thapsigargin on the biophysical properties of WT-hERG and WT/E637K-hERG channels; (c) whether drug treatment can rescue channel processing and trafficking defects of the WT/E637K-hERG mutant. Methods The whole-cell Patch-clamp technique was used to assess the effect of PD-118057 and thapsigargin on the electrophysiological characteristics of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (Ikr) of the hERG protein channel. Western blot was done to investigate pharmacological rescue on hERG protein channel function. Results In our study, PD-118057 was shown to significantly enhance both the maximum current amplitude and tail current amplitude, but did not alter the gating and kinetic properties of the WT-hERG channel, with the exception of accelerating steady-state inactivation. Additionally, thapsigargin shows a similar result as PD-118057 for the WT-hERG channel, but with the exception of attenuating steady-state inactivation. However, for the WT/E637K-hERG channel, PD-118057 had no effect on either the current or on the gating and kinetic properties. Furthermore, thapsigargin treatment did not alter the current or the gating and kinetic properties of the WT/E637K-hERG channel, with the exception of opening at more positive voltages. Conclusion Our findings illustrate that neither PD-118057 nor thapsigargin play a role in correcting the dominant-negative effect of the E637K-hERG mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2035524386,"Our work in a rodent model of urinary calcium suggests genetic and gender effects on increased residual variability in urine chemistries. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that sex would similarly be associated with residual variation in human urine solutes. Sex-related effects on residuals might affect the establishment of physiological baselines and error in medical assays.We tested the effects of sex on residual variation in urine chemistry by estimating coefficients of variation (CV) for urinary solutes in paired sequential 24-h urines (≤72 hour interval) in 6,758 females and 9,024 males aged 16-80 submitted to a clinical laboratory.Females had higher CVs than males for urinary phosphorus overall at the False Discovery Rate (P<0.01). There was no effect of sex on CV for calcium (P>0.3). Males had higher CVs for citrate (P<0.01) from ages 16-45 and females higher CVs for citrate (P<0.01) from ages 56-80, suggesting effects of an extant oestral cycle on residual variance.Our findings indicate the effects of sex on residual variance of the excretion of urinary solutes including phosphorus and citrate; differences in CV by sex might reflect dietary lability, differences in the fidelity of reporting or genetic differentiation in renal solute consistency. Such an effect could complicate medical analysis by the addition of random error to phenotypic assays. Renal analysis might require explicit incorporation of heterogeneity among factorial effects, and for sex in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2046648157,"Dinoflagellates are a large group of algae that contribute significantly to marine productivity and are essential photosynthetic symbionts of corals. Although these algae have fully-functioning mitochondria and chloroplasts, both their organelle genomes have been highly reduced and the genes fragmented and rearranged, with many aberrant transcripts. However, nothing is known about their RNA polymerases. We cloned and sequenced the gene for the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial polymerase (RpoTm) of the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra and showed that the protein presequence targeted a GFP construct into yeast mitochondria. The gene belongs to a small gene family, which includes a variety of 3′-truncated copies that may have originated by retroposition. The catalytic C-terminal domain of the protein shares nine conserved sequence blocks with other single-subunit polymerases and is predicted to have the same fold as the human enzyme. However, the N-terminal (promoter binding/transcription initiation) domain is not well-conserved. In conjunction with the degenerate nature of the mitochondrial genome, this suggests a requirement for novel accessory factors to ensure the accurate production of functional mRNAs."
