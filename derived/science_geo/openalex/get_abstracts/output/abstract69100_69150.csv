https://openalex.org/W2068535052,"Brain serotonin concentrations at 1 p.m. were significantly elevated 1 hour after rats received a dose of L-tryptophan (12.5 milligrams per kilogram. intraperitoneally) smaller than one-twentieth of the normal daily dietary intake. Plasma and brain tryptophan levels were elevated 10 to 60 minutes after the injection, but they never exceeded the concentrations that occur nocturnally in untreated animals as a result of their normal 24-hour rhythms. These data suggest that physiological changes in plasma tryptophan concentration influence brain serotonin levels."

Detected signals evoked potentials several times larger than did undetected signals, falsely reported signals, or correctly reported nonsignals. The threshold signal intensity at which detection performance exceeded chance levels was identical with concurrently obtained electrophysiological measures of threshold."

The calcium complex in the organic phase is shown by electron microscopy to consist of spherules, composed of stoichiometric amounts of calcium, inorganic phosphate, and phospholipid. The demonstration of complex formation between calcium phosphate and acidic phospholipids adds support to the concept that phospholipids are involved in biological mineralization."

https://openalex.org/W1999845724,"HIGHER animals may change in their response to drugs because of a decrease in the sensitivity of drug receptor sites in the organism, or because of accelerated drug metabolism. The latter has been explained1 on the basis of drug induced stimulation of liver microsomal enzymes, for example, many compounds have been listed which induce microsomal oxidizing enzymes in rats, and phenobarbital has been shown to stimulate the metabolism of the anti-coagulant coumarin in man2. We now report the induced enzyme metabolism of nicotine in man by tobacco smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2005673706,"In the mouse, most (or all) complement-receptor lymphocytes and theta-bearing lymphocytes are part of nonoverlapping populations of cells. This finding validates the use of these membrane markers to characterize populations of lymphocytes. In addition, it is probable that, although receptors for complement and membrane-bound immunoglobulins coexist on the same lymphoid cells, these markers are located at separate sites on the membrane."

Since voltage and electrical resistance per unit area were unchanged by a tenfold decrease in area of skin studied, it is concluded that these mounting techniques do not produce edge damage and consequently provide a means for study of the skin in its absence."
https://openalex.org/W2026941508,"The urinary activities for bone marrow colony formation were measured on consecutive 24-hour urine samples from two gray collie dogs with cyclic neutropenia and from two normal collies. The activity varied cyclically in the gray collies with a peak activity developing during the neutropenic phase, which antecedes the return of blood neutrophils. The activity fell to undetectable levels after the blood neutrophil counts returned to the normal range. The urine of normal dogs showed no activity. Since the dogs with cyclic neutropenia have been shown to have periodic hematopoiesis, these data suggest a regulatory hormonal role for the substance measured by this assay."

Cells differ in their competence to metabolize specific nutrients, an indication that there are specialized cellular responses to exogenous organic molecules. Embryonic ophiuroid tissues have an exceptional capacity for assimilation."

https://openalex.org/W2036112937,"CONSIDERATION of the high incidence of naso-pharyngeal cancer among the Chinese1 led us to search for carcinogenic constituents in condensates from burning Chinese incense. Using thin-layer arid column chromatography, several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including 3,4-benzopyrene, have been detected by ultraviolet absorption spectra. The 3,4-benzopyrene content was estimated fluorimetrically2 to be of the order 0.4 μg/stick of incense. The free radical content of the tar condensates was estimated by Dr A. Horsfield of Varian Associates Ltd. to be approximately 1.3 × 1015 stable electrons/g (comparable with the figure 1 × 1015/g obtained for cigarette tar3)."
https://openalex.org/W2024958886,"Magnetocardiograms with a bandwidth of 0 to 40 hertz were recorded from intact dogs undergoing myocardial infarction. This was done with a superconducting magnetometer in a magnetically shielded room. The purpose was to look for the steady currents of injury from the heart which supposedly produce much of the S-T segment shifts during infarction. These heart currents cannot be measured with surface electrodes because of direct-current interference from other sources, such as from the contact potential between electrode and skin. The magnetocardiograms showed both S-T segment shifts and direct currents as a result of infarction. However, they also showed that the S-T segment shifts were not produced by the direct currents. It is unlikely that these direct currents originated from the infarcted area, and their exact origin is not yet known."

https://openalex.org/W2070358301,"Concentrations of carbon monoxide in rainwater collected at widely diverse locations show up to a 200-fold supersaturation relative to the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere. These results indicate the existence of an additional natural source of carbon monoxide not heretofore considered. Production of carbon monoxide in clouds is tentatively attributed to the photochemical oxidation of organic matter or the slight dissociation of carbon dioxide induced by electrical discharges, or both. Methane concentrations measured in the same rainwater show that the partitioning of this gas, unlike that of carbon monoxide, is very close to a state of equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2002856814,"The unresolved mechanism of light production in Photoblepharon and Anomalops has been reinvestigated in fresh and preserved material. Based on biochemical evidence obtained with emulsions and cell-free extracts of the organs, especially the stimulation of light with reduced flavin mononucleotide, and on electron microscopy of organ sections showing the presence of numerous bacteria, we conclude that the light is produced by symbiotic luminous bacteria. Because of the continuing failure to cultivate the luminous bacteria and because of their morphology, we suggest that the bacteria are of a primitive type called bacteroids."

https://openalex.org/W2048312428,"Female rats of the poorly responding, inbred F344 strain were immunized with poly(Glu(52)Lys(33)Tyr(15)) aggregated with methylated bovine serum albumin, and then they were mated. The first and second litters in the F(1) generation and in the F(2) generation showed an enhanced immune response. When poly-lysine was used as the aggregating agent, enhancement occurred in only the first litter of the F(1) generation and in the F(2) generation. In both cases, antigen was transmitted from the immunized female to her offspring, where it localized in the bone marrow and, in a few cases, in the thymus and spleen also. The transplacental passage of antigen is probably the basis for the enhanced antibody response, which is a manifestation of immunological memory."

https://openalex.org/W2051751169,The effects of ouabain on potassium accumulation were studied in the dog carotid artery. It was confirmed that vascular smooth muscle lost potassium in the presence of ouabain greater than 10-9 molar. This effect could be reversed by systematically increasing potassium in the external medium. The action of ouabain on ion accumulation was represented quantitatively with the application of a recent biophysical approach.

https://openalex.org/W2063403517,"Monospecific antiserum to highly purified second component of human complement (C'2) was used to show the absence of the protein from the serums of four persons homozygous for a hereditary deficiency of second-component activity. Serum from an individual heterozygous for the deficiency contained a reduced amount of this protein as compared to the concentration in normal serum. These observations indicate that genetic deficiency of this component is due to failure of synthesis of normal amounts of the protein rather than to synthesis of an antigenically related, hemolytically inactive analog of C'2."
https://openalex.org/W2076480027,Accumulating knowledge of polymorphic enzyme systems poses intriguing possibilities of anthropologic genetics. Development of an automated procedure for determination of heterozygosity or homozygosity of the atypical plasma cholinesterase allele (E(1)(a)) permitted screening of 2317 individuals during a national Preschool Nutrition Survey and several smaller population studies. Frequencies of the allele (E(1)(a)) closely parallel those previously reported. Caucasians manifested a heterozygote male preponderance of 1.85: 1.
https://openalex.org/W2015764474,"THE different parts of the exoskeleton of portunid crabs show a wide range of hardness and rigidity. The most rigid structure is the dactylus of the chela; most flexible and soft are the unmineralized joints between the limbs. The propodus, the carapace and the pleopods represent intermediate stages of rigidity. Because the extent of mineralization largely determines the flexibility and hardness of the exoskeleton we were interested to identify the important factors in this calcification process."

https://openalex.org/W2011313351,"Zaoral, Kolc and Sorm1 showed that the analogue of arginine vasopressin in which the arginine is in the D rather than the L-configuration, [8-D-arginine]-vasopressin, has ten times as much antidiuretic as vasopressor activity. This finding allows an explanation for the early report by Heller2 that a similar dissociation of activities was obtained when ‘Pitressin’ (Parke, Davis and Co.) was heated at alkaline pH. One of the effects of such treatment on polypeptides is racemization of their constituent amino-acids, and, if one can generalize from the behaviour of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), one of the amino-acids most likely to racemize is arginine3."
