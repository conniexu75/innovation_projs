We investigated the sources of the narrowband gamma oscillation, the factors modulating its strength, and its relationship to broadband gamma activity. Narrowband and broadband gamma power were uncorrelated. Increasing visual contrast had opposite effects on the two rhythms: it increased broadband activity, but suppressed the narrowband oscillation. The narrowband oscillation was strongest in layer 4 and was mediated primarily by excitatory currents entrained by the synchronous, rhythmic firing of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The power and peak frequency of the narrowband gamma oscillation increased with light intensity. Silencing the cortex optogenetically did not abolish the narrowband oscillation in either LGN firing or cortical excitatory currents, suggesting that this oscillation reflects unidirectional flow of signals from thalamus to cortex.

Gamma rhythms are produced by a wide range of brain circuits and are thought to reflect multiple phenomena. Rhythms in a broad gamma range (30–90 Hz) have long been observed in regions including isocortex (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W.

In cortex, these rhythms are believed to arise from the precisely timed synchronization of inhibitory networks (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K.

Recently, however, it has become clear that gamma rhythms reflect multiple phenomena, and that a single neuronal circuit can support multiple types of gamma rhythms. In hippocampal area CA1, for example, gamma rhythms occurring in distinct frequency bands are coherent with distinct input sources (Colgin et al., 2009Colgin L.L. Denninger T. Fyhn M. Hafting T. Bonnevie T. Jensen O. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Frequency of gamma oscillations routes flow of information in the hippocampus.Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), perhaps to provide separate routes for information from those structures. Understanding the origin of multiple patterns of high-frequency rhythms is essential for understanding the functional roles these rhythms might play. In the visual cortex, there is evidence for two types of gamma rhythm, one with power distributed in a band between 30 and 90 Hz, and one that oscillates in a much narrower band. The gamma rhythms between 30 and 90 Hz have long been described in multiple species including cats (Eckhorn et al., 1988Eckhorn R. Bauer R. Jordan W. Brosch M. Kruse W. Munk M. Reitboeck H.J.

A fundamentally different gamma oscillation has been reported in visual cortex of anesthetized cats. This oscillation is extremely narrow in bandwidth in single experiments, and can appear also in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and retina (Koepsell et al., 2009Koepsell K. Wang X. Vaingankar V.

A gamma oscillation with a sharp band close to 60 Hz has also been observed in visual cortex of awake mice, where its power grows markedly with locomotion (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A.

We refer to this oscillation as narrowband gamma, but note that some authors have used this term differently (Hermes et al., 2015aHermes D. Miller K.J. Wandell B.A. Winawer J.

Biol. 2013; 23: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The origins of this oscillation, and the behavioral and sensory factors modulating it, are unknown. Here we investigate the narrowband gamma oscillation in awake mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and establish the factors that determine its strength and frequency, and its relationship to broadband gamma activity. We find that this oscillation has different properties from broadband gamma activity: its amplitude increases with mean light intensity and with locomotion, but it decreases with visual contrast. The narrowband oscillation occurs independently of broadband gamma activity, indicating that it arises from different mechanisms. These mechanisms involve synaptic excitation more than inhibition and operate before the visual signals reach the cortex. Indeed, the narrowband oscillation is present earlier in the visual system, arising at least as early as the LGN. We start by characterizing the narrowband gamma oscillation in mouse V1. We then explore its synaptic basis and its dependence on visual contrast and locomotion. Finally, we turn to the LGN and to optogenetic manipulations that investigate the source of the narrowband oscillation. Consistent with previous reports (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A.

Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), when we recorded in V1 of awake mice using multi-electrode arrays (Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A. Saleem A.B. Schölvinck M.L. Carandini M. Locomotion controls spatial integration in mouse visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Saleem et al., 2013Saleem A.B. Ayaz A. Jeffery K.J. Harris K.D. Carandini M. Integration of visual motion and locomotion in mouse visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) we observed a sharp peak in the local field potential (LFP) power spectrum close to 60 Hz (Figures 1A–1C and S1, available online). The frequency of this oscillation was 61 Hz in this example experiment (Figures 1B and 1C) and could vary between 55 and 70 Hz in other experiments, with a remarkably narrow bandwidth of 2–5 Hz. This oscillation could not have reflected mains interference, for these recordings were conducted in Europe, where (unlike in the United States) the electricity alternates at 50 Hz. This narrowband oscillation was prominent when the mice viewed a uniform gray screen (50 cd/m2), but it disappeared when we repeated the experiments in complete darkness (Figures 1A–1C; <10−2 cd/m2). The oscillation was due to the overall light intensity, not the monitor refresh frequency (which can weakly entrain visual cortical neurons; Veit et al., 2011Veit J. Bhattacharyya A. Kretz R. Rainer G. Neural response dynamics of spiking and local field potential activity depend on CRT monitor refresh rate in the tree shrew primary visual cortex.J.

Entrainment to video displays in primary visual cortex of macaque and humans.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8278-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We confirmed this with control experiments where we stimulated the visual field not with a monitor, but with a light-emitting diode (LED, 470 nm) generating light steadily with direct current (DC) input, or flickering at different rates. We saw a narrowband oscillation close to 60 Hz in all cases, independent of visual flicker rates (Figure 1D; p > 0.1, t test for all pairs of flicker rates; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Unlike broadband gamma rhythms, which involve inhibitory currents (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.H. Moore C.I.

Sensory-driven and spontaneous gamma oscillations engage distinct cortical circuitry.J. Neurophysiol. 2016; 115: 1821-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the narrowband gamma oscillation was primarily mediated by excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figure 1E). To uncover the synaptic basis of the narrowband oscillation, we analyzed intracellular recordings from layer 2/3 regular-spiking (putative pyramidal) neurons in V1 of awake mice viewing a uniform gray screen (Haider et al., 2013Haider B. Häusser M. Carandini M. Inhibition dominates sensory responses in the awake cortex.Nature. 2013; 493: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). EPSCs, isolated by voltage clamping the membrane potential near the reversal potential for inhibition, showed a clear peak around 60 Hz, similar to that seen in the extracellular LFP. The power in the narrowband gamma frequency range was significantly greater than a baseline prediction based on a smooth power spectrum that excludes this range (the “residual spectrum”; Figure S1; p = 0.027; t test over n = 11 recordings). However, we did not observe a similar peak in narrowband gamma power in the inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from the same neurons during the same stimulus conditions (p = 0.11; n = 11 recordings). This suggests that at least in superficial layers, the narrowband gamma oscillation is primarily mediated by EPSCs. Another fundamental difference between narrowband and broadband gamma activity is that increasing visual contrast had opposite effects on them (Figures 2A–2D and S2). When we measured V1 responses in awake mice to drifting gratings (60° diameter, 2 cycles/s, 0.05 cycles/°) at different levels of visual contrast, we found a positive correlation of broadband power with contrast (ρ = 0.59 ± 0.18; n = 7 recordings; Figures 2A–2D). For the narrowband gamma oscillation, instead, the power was instead negatively correlated with contrast (ρ = −0.43 ± 0.16; n = 7 recordings; Figures 2C and 2D). Narrowband gamma oscillation was suppressed by contrast not only during passive visual presentation, but also while mice used visual inputs to guide locomotion (Figure 2C). We recorded V1 activity while mice navigated in a virtual reality environment where visual cues indicated a position that mice must reach to receive a water reward. The narrowband gamma oscillation increased prominently during inter-trial periods, when the screen was uniform gray (Figure 2C; the increase in narrowband power prior to the offset of the previous trial likely reflects the uniform gray texture of the wall at the far end of the virtual corridor). Further, throughout the experiment the power of this narrowband gamma oscillation was uncorrelated with power in broadband gamma range (Figure 2E). The power of the narrowband gamma oscillation varied strongly across the depth of visual cortex and was markedly higher in layer 4 (L4; Figures 3A, 3B, and S3). We recorded the activity across different laminae of V1 using a linear multi-electrode array (16 sites, 50 μm spacing; Figure 3A) and identified L4 in each recording as the location showing the earliest current sink (Mitzdorf, 1985Mitzdorf U. Current source-density method and application in cat cerebral cortex: investigation of evoked potentials and EEG phenomena.Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 37-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) in response to a contrast-reversing checkerboard stimulus (Figure 3A). This layer also showed the strongest ∼60 Hz narrowband gamma peak (Figure 3B). The highest residual power was observed at the same depth as the largest current sink in all recordings (correlation ρ = 0.98; p < 10−3; n = 6 recordings; Figure S3). Because L4 receives strong inputs from the LGN, we next asked if the narrowband gamma oscillation was also present in these inputs, and we found that it is evident in many LGN neurons (Figures 3C and 3D). We used silicon probes to record from 323 LGN neurons from 7 awake head-fixed mice viewing a uniform gray screen (∼50 cd/m2). Inspection of spike-train power spectra revealed that many neurons fired rhythmically at frequencies close to 60 Hz (Figures 3C and 3D). We quantified the rhythmicity of each neuron as the power in the narrowband gamma frequency range compared to a baseline prediction based on a smooth power spectrum (the “residual spectrum”; Figure S1). This measure yielded high values in a sizeable proportion of LGN neurons (Figure 3D). For instance, 14% of LGN neurons (44/323; n = 18 recordings from 7 animals) showed a narrowband gamma peak greater than 20% of the baseline prediction (dotted line in Figure 3D). Consistent with our results in V1 (Figure 2), the power of narrowband gamma in LGN decreased with increasing levels of contrast (ρ = −0.53; p < 10−4; n = 9 recordings; Figures S4A–S4C). The narrowband gamma oscillation entrained the activity of many LGN neurons in a coherent fashion (Figure S5). We observed the narrowband oscillation in the spike time autocorrelations (Figure S5A) and found that it was coherent between simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons (0.33 ± 0.04, mean ± SD; n = 215 cell pairs where both cells had over 20% residual power), being clearly visible in both the cross-correlogram and coherence spectrum computed from the spike trains of simultaneously recorded pairs (Figures S5B and S5C). Narrowband gamma in LGN therefore represents a network-wide oscillation, rather than independent oscillations in individual cells. Individual LGN neurons had diverse but consistent phases with respect to the oscillation: computing each neuron’s preferred phase in two halves of the data yielded a similar estimate (correlation ρ = 0.69; p < 10−6; Figure S5D). The strength and the phase of narrowband gamma entrainment in LGN neurons bore no obvious relationship to their visual preferences, such as receptive field polarity and contrast sensitivity (data not shown). To investigate how narrowband gamma depends on light intensity, we recorded LGN neurons using extracellular multi-tetrode array recordings while varying the light intensity of a gray screen between ∼1 and ∼95 cd/m2 (Figures 3E–3G). The light intensity changed every 4 s (Figure 3E), presented in interleaved sequences. The narrowband oscillation was seen when light intensities were above 4 cd/m2, with power that increased with light intensity (ρ = 0.74; p < 10−21; n = 15 recordings; Figures 3E, 3F, and S4D). Light intensity also had an effect on the oscillation’s frequency, which increased from close to 50 Hz at low intensities (<5 cd/m2) to around 60 Hz at high intensities (>30 cd/m2). As a result, we found a strong correlation between the peak frequency of the narrowband gamma oscillation and the log light intensity level (ρ = 0.67; p < 10−16; n = 15 recordings; Figure 3G). The strength of narrowband gamma oscillations was related not only to visual factors (light intensity and contrast) but also to the behavioral state of the animal. Consistent with previous reports (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A. Wilbrecht L. Stryker M.P. Niell C.M.

Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), we found that narrowband gamma power is highly correlated with running speed (correlation ρ = 0.49 ± 0.04, mean ± SEM; n = 10 recordings in V1). This observation, however, does not imply that behavioral state itself directly modulates gamma power. Indeed, since the mouse pupil dilates during locomotion (Erisken et al., 2014Erisken S.

Arousal and locomotion make distinct contributions to cortical activity patterns and visual encoding.Neuron. 2015; 86: 740-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and since narrowband gamma power depends on light intensity (Figure 3F), it remains possible that the correlation between locomotion and narrowband gamma reflects a greater amount of light striking the retina when pupils are dilated during running. To answer this question, we measured gamma power after applying the anti-muscarinic agent tropicamide to the eye surface. This procedure caused full dilation of the pupil (Figure S6A), thus removing the correlation of pupil diameter with running speed. We found that the correlation of narrowband gamma power with running speed persisted even in these conditions of fixed pupil diameter (correlation ρ = 0.35; p < 0.01; Figure S6B), confirming that the correlation of narrowband gamma oscillation with locomotion does not simply reflect an indirect effect of increased light flux after pupil dilation. The presence of the narrowband gamma oscillation in LGN suggests, but does not prove, that the cortex inherits this rhythm from the thalamus. Indeed, this oscillation could be generated in V1 independently of LGN activity. To investigate this question, we recorded activity in V1 using extracellular multi-electrode arrays, while silencing the activity in the LGN by optogenetically activating thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons (Reinhold et al., 2015Reinhold K. Lien A.D. Scanziani M. Distinct recurrent versus afferent dynamics in cortical visual processing.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Silencing LGN strongly suppressed LFP activity in V1 at all frequencies, including the narrowband gamma peak close to 60 Hz (Figures S7A–S7C). This result indicates that the narrowband gamma oscillation cannot be sustained in V1 without input from the thalamus. A second hypothesis is that the oscillation could rely on the presence of cortico-thalamic connections. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether silencing V1 would suppress the narrowband gamma oscillation in LGN and in the excitatory currents that it elicits in L4 cortical neurons. We performed these experiments in VGAT-ChR2 mice, where excitatory V1 activity could be silenced optogenetically across layers (Lien and Scanziani, 2013Lien A.D. Scanziani M. Tuned thalamic excitation is amplified by visual cortical circuits.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1315-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Figures S7D–S7I). To facilitate combined intracellular and extracellular recordings (Figure 4A), the mice were lightly anesthetized with urethane. This light anesthesia did not impede the narrowband gamma oscillation: LGN neurons showed rhythmic firing at frequencies close to 60 Hz, and EPSCs recorded simultaneously in L4 neurons showed a coherent oscillation (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4F). Silencing the cortex optogenetically did not abolish the narrowband oscillation observed in LGN or the EPSCs in L4 neurons (Figures 4 and S7J–S7L). Silencing V1 caused no significant change in the frequency (p = 0.312; paired t test; n = 47 neurons with greater than 50% residual power in either condition; Figure 4B) and only a slight reduction of power (p = 0.042; Figure 4C) of the narrowband oscillation seen in LGN spike trains. While cortical silencing reduced L4 EPSC spectral power at all frequencies, there was actually a slight increase in the residual power of the narrowband gamma oscillation (p = 0.047; n = 14; Figures 4D, 4E, and S7L), consistent with addition of a narrowband oscillation inherited from the thalamus, to cortically generated broadband activity. The cross-coherence between LGN spiking activity and the EPSCs in L4 V1 neurons showed a clear peak at the narrowband gamma frequencies, which was unaffected by cortical silencing (p = 0.15; n = 47; Figures 4F and 4G). These results demonstrate that the narrowband gamma oscillation in LGN persists in the absence of feedback from V1. We have shown that the narrowband gamma oscillation in mouse V1 has several major differences from the more commonly described broadband gamma rhythm. The power of narrow- and broadband gamma activity was uncorrelated, and visual contrast suppressed the narrowband gamma oscillation while it increased broadband gamma rhythms. Within cortex, the narrowband gamma oscillation was strongest in L4, and cortical intracellular recordings revealed narrowband gamma in excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic currents. Narrowband gamma oscillations persisted in LGN ensembles and L4 synaptic inputs, even after silencing of cortex. We therefore conclude that the narrowband gamma oscillation (2–5 Hz bandwidth oscillation close to 60 Hz) is generated in thalamus and possibly even retina, representing an entirely different phenomenon than broadband gamma (30–90 Hz rhythms). Whereas broadband gamma rhythms involve cortical inhibitory networks (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.H. Moore C.I.

Gamma oscillation by synaptic inhibition in a hippocampal interneuronal network model.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6402-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), narrowband gamma is transmitted to cortex by the rhythmic firing of thalamic ensembles. Although resonance in thalamocortical loops has been proposed as a mechanism for the generation of high-frequency oscillations (Steriade, 1997Steriade M. Synchronized activities of coupled oscillators in the cerebral cortex and thalamus at different levels of vigilance.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 583-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Steriade, 2000Steriade M. Corticothalamic resonance, states of vigilance and mentation.Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 243-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), we found that the narrowband gamma oscillation was transmitted from LGN to visual cortex even after cortical firing was abolished optogenetically. We therefore propose that the oscillation is generated either within thalamic circuits or by their interactions with their retinal inputs. Our results are consistent with previous reports of narrowband oscillations in mouse visual cortex at frequencies close to 60 Hz (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A. Wilbrecht L. Stryker M.P.

Furthermore, the oscillation we study here might be homologous to an oscillation previously described in LGN of anesthetized cats (Castelo-Branco et al., 1998Castelo-Branco M. Neuenschwander S.

Long-range synchronization of oscillatory light responses in the cat retina and lateral geniculate nucleus.Nature. 1996; 379: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which showed extremely narrowband rhythmicity within single recordings. The frequency of that oscillation, however, varied between recordings, spanning a range of 45–114 Hz. In these cat recordings, the thalamic oscillation was highly synchronous with a retinal oscillation determined either by simultaneous recording or by analysis of intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in thalamus. If this proposed homology is correct, it would suggest that the narrowband gamma recorded here might reflect an oscillation generated in retina and transmitted through LGN to visual cortex. The fact that the power of this oscillation is increased by locomotion (as well as by stimulation of mesencephalic locomotor nuclei at levels too small to evoke locomotion; Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A. Wilbrecht L. Stryker M.P. Niell C.M. Identification of a brainstem circuit regulating visual cortical state in parallel with locomotion.Neuron. 2014; 83: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) suggests that its amplitude is likely to be modulated by thalamic circuitry. What function might this narrowband gamma oscillation play in visual processing? Although a definitive answer to this question requires further work, the present data are sufficient to formulate two hypotheses. A first hypothesis is that the narrowband gamma oscillation represents an “idling” rhythm. In this interpretation, narrowband gamma represents a default state of LGN activity when visual processing is not being carried out, similar to the proposed function of the visual alpha rhythm and the beta oscillation of the motor system. This hypothesis would explain why this oscillation is suppressed by increases in visual contrast. In the second hypothesis, the narrow- and broadband gamma oscillations would represent specific channels for thalamocortical and corticocortical communication. It has been proposed that oscillatory patterns with different frequency characteristics may allow routing of information between specific brain structures. For example, the coherence of slow gamma between hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and fast gamma between CA1 and entorhinal cortex (Colgin et al., 2009Colgin L.L. Denninger T. Fyhn M. Hafting T. Bonnevie T. Jensen O. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Frequency of gamma oscillations routes flow of information in the hippocampus.Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), may indicate the existence of two separate transmission channels in the hippocampal formation. Analogously, the narrowband gamma oscillation may provide a specific channel for feedforward transmission from LGN to visual cortex, while broadband gamma—which is generated in cortical regions—enables transmission of information between cortical circuits.

In this study, collagen was isolated from the mesoglea of jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye and its hemostatic property was studied. The yields of acid-soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin-soluble (PSC) were 0.12% and 0.28% respectively. The SDS-PAGE patterns indicated that the collagen extracted from jellyfish mesoglea was type I collagen. The lyophilized jellyfish collagen sponges were cross-linked with EDC and interconnected networks in the sponges were revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Collagen sponges exhibited higher water absorption rates than medical gauze and EDC/NHS cross-linking method could improve the stability of the collagen sponges. Compared with medical gauze groups, the blood clotting indexes (BCIs) of collagen sponges were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and the concentration of collagen also had an influence on the hemostatic property (P < 0.05). Collagen sponges had an improved hemostatic ability compared to the gauze control in tail amputation rat models. Hemostatic mechanism studies showed that hemocytes and platelets could adhere and aggregate on the surface of collagen sponge. All properties make jellyfish collagen sponge to be a suitable candidate used as hemostatic material and for wound healing applications."

We conclude that vestibulo-cerebellar motor learning is the first form of memory acquisition shown to depend on GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation by increasing single-channel conductance. Plasticity mediated by synaptic trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic-acid-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) plays an important role in the acquisition of declarative memories (Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Synaptic AMPA receptor plasticity and behavior.Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Ionotropic AMPARs drive fast, excitatory neuronal activity and can consist of four different subunits named GluA1 through GluA4. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, most AMPARs are hetero-oligomers composed of either GluA1/GluA2 or GluA2/GluA3 subunits, and the subunit composition dictates which role AMPARs play in synaptic plasticity (Shi et al., 2001Shi S.

Here we sought to unravel the potential role of GluA1- and/or GluA3-containing AMPARs in cerebellar motor learning. Unlike the rich insight into the role of AMPARs in declarative memory formation in the hippocampus, relatively little is known about their role in procedural memory formation in the cerebellum. AMPAR plasticity occurs at parallel-fiber-to-Purkinje-cell (PF-PC) synapses, reflecting the expression of LTP or long-term depression (LTD) (Kakegawa and Yuzaki, 2005Kakegawa W. Yuzaki M.

The GluA3-containing AMPARs in PCs are critical for the induction and expression of PF-PC LTP not by trafficking of receptors, but by a change in the conductance and open probability of the channel. This form of plasticity requires activation of Epac through an increase of cyclic AMP. Together, these findings not only show that GluA3 is crucial for cerebellar potentiation and learning, but also that its actions of plasticity are evoked through a novel mechanism. Unlike GluA2 global knockout (KO) mice, which suffer from severe motor performance deficits including ataxia (Gerlai et al., 1998Gerlai R. Henderson J.T. Roder J.C. Jia Z.

Carlen P. et al.Enhanced LTP in mice deficient in the AMPA receptor GluR2.Neuron. 1996; 17: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), mice that lack AMPAR subunit GluA1 or GluA3 (GluA1-KO and GluA3-KO) displayed intact basic motor behavior (Figure S1). Indeed, they were able to stabilize the images on their retina and/or gaze with respect to a moving visual field (i.e., optokinetic reflex, or OKR; Figure S1A), with respect to their head movements (i.e., the vestibulo-ocular reflex in the dark, or VOR: Figure S1B), or with respect to a combination of both, as occurs in daily life (i.e., VOR in the light, or VORL; Figure S1C). None of the comparisons between GluA1-KO mice, GluA3-KO mice, and their control littermates showed a significant difference in any of these paradigms (for p values, see Figure S1 and corresponding legends). Far more challenging is the test for VOR phase-reversal adaptation, which involves cerebellum-dependent motor learning (Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2013Gutierrez-Castellanos N. Winkelman B.H. Tolosa-Rodriguez L. De Gruijl J.R. De Zeeuw C.I. Impact of aging on long-term ocular reflex adaptation.Neurobiol. Aging. 2013; 34: 2784-2792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During this paradigm, mice learn to shift the phase of their VOR following sinusoidal visuovestibular mismatch stimulation, in which the visual stimulus moves in the same direction as the vestibular stimulus (i.e., in phase), yet at a greater amplitude (Figure 1A). After 5 days of visuovestibular training, wild-type (WT) mice moved their eyes during table stimulation in the dark in the same direction as the body, rather than the opposite direction as they used to do before the training (i.e., they normally show an innate contraversive compensation). More specifically, the mature WT mice learned to shift their VOR in the dark by 159° out of the perfect 180° after the training (Figure 1B). Likewise, when we subjected littermate GluA1-deficient mice to this phase-reversal adaptation paradigm, they reached final average phase shifts of 162° (GluA1-KO versus WT, p = 0.13; Figure 1B), indicating that GluA1-containing AMPARs are dispensable for VOR adaptation. In contrast, GluA3-deficient mice showed striking deficits in shifting the phase of their VOR in the dark; they showed a final phase shift of only 35° after five training sessions (GluA3-KO versus WT, p = 0.001; Figure 1B). When we looked not only at the oculomotor phase but also at the learning trajectory extent (as explained in Figure S2A), we observed that, although the initial performances of VOR catch-learning trials were not significantly different for any of the three groups tested (p = 0.3 and p = 0.11 for GluA1-KO and GluA3-KO, respectively), the final performances of GluA3-KO after 5 days of training were significantly different from those of both WT littermates (p = 0.01) and GluA1-KO mice (p = 0.01) (Figure 1C). Accordingly, the vector of total learning extent per mouse, which equals the distance between the initial (first recording, day 1) and the final VOR performance coordinate throughout the 5-day-spanning phase-reversal paradigm (Figure S2), was significantly smaller for GluA3-KO mice than it was for WT and GluA1-KO mice (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0002, respectively) (Figures 1D and 1E). Moreover, the consolidation rate of learning, which equals the ratio between the total learning extent and the ideal learning extent with no overnight memory loss between training days (Figure S2A), was also significantly lower in GluA3-KO than in both GluA1-KO and WT littermates (p = 0.0008 and p = 0.001, respectively) (Figure 1E). Importantly, all groups of mice performed equally well during the visually driven vestibular training trials over the 5 days of training (all p values > 0.05; Figure 1A), indicating that the learning deficits in GluA3-KO as measured in the dark during the catch trials did not directly result from a poor response to the visuovestibular training signal but rather from an impaired ability to maintain this learned vestibular response in the absence of the visual cue (Figure 1B). In addition to phase modulation, we also investigated gain modulation of vestibulo-ocular movements after either in-phase (gain-down) or out-of-phase (gain-up) visuovestibular training paradigms that aim to reduce or increase the amplitude, respectively, of the eye-movement response to a constant vestibular input. GluA3-KO mice showed severe learning deficits in both the gain-down (p = 0.001 for final catch trials) and gain-up (p = 0.009 for final catch trials) paradigms, whereas GluA1-KO and WT mice again performed equally well in both training paradigms (p = 0.11 and p = 0.2 for gain-down and gain-up final catch trials, respectively) (Figures 1F and S1D). These experiments indicate that GluA3-containing AMPARs contribute to cerebellum-dependent motor learning. PCs form the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. It has previously been shown that synaptic plasticity at their parallel fiber afferents crucially contributes to motor learning (Schonewille et al., 2010Schonewille M. Belmeguenai A. Koekkoek S.K. Houtman S.H. Boele H.J. van Beugen B.J. Gao Z. Badura A. Ohtsuki G. Amerika W.E. et al.Purkinje cell-specific knockout of the protein phosphatase PP2B impairs potentiation and cerebellar motor learning.Neuron. 2010; 67: 618-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of GluA1- and GluA3-containing AMPARs to basal synaptic transmission, we recorded spontaneous miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) of PCs in cerebellar slices from 4–6 week old mice (Figure 2A), an age at which GluA3-KO mice showed motor learning deficits similar to those shown during adulthood (Figure S2D). The average amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs in GluA1-deficient PCs were not significantly different (p = 0.4 and p = 0.2, respectively) from those in WT PCs (Figure 2B). In PCs of GluA3-KO mice, the average amplitude (p = 0.0003) and frequency (p = 0.02) of mEPSCs were significantly lower than those in WT PCs. The low basal transmission in the GluA3-KO mice was neither reflected in structural changes at the level of spine densities of proximal or distal PC dendrites (p = 0.7 and p = 0.2 for proximal and distal, respectively) (Figure S3) nor compensated for by increased synaptic currents from kainate receptors (for details, see Figure S4 and corresponding legends). In PCs of mice that lack both GluA1 and GluA3, mEPSC events were virtually absent (Figure 2B), suggesting that the large majority of synaptic currents in PCs are derived from either GluA1- or GluA3-containing AMPARs. A reduced basal transmission in GluA3-deficient PC synapses can either be a cause or a consequence of impaired synaptic plasticity. We therefore investigated both LTD and LTP at the PF-PC synapse using whole-cell recordings. LTD was induced either by pairing PF stimulation with a depolarizing voltage-clamp step, mimicking climbing fiber (CF) input (Linden, 2001Linden D.J. The expression of cerebellar LTD in culture is not associated with changes in AMPA-receptor kinetics, agonist affinity, or unitary conductance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Figure 2C), or by pairing PF stimulation with CF stimulation (Schonewille et al., 2011Schonewille M. Gao Z. Boele H.J. Veloz M.F. Amerika W.E. Simek A.A. De Jeu M.T. Steinberg J.P. Takamiya K. Hoebeek F.E. et al.Reevaluating the role of LTD in cerebellar motor learning.Neuron. 2011; 70: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar; Figures S3C–S3E). The magnitudes of LTD in PCs of GluA1-KO and GluA3-KO mice were indistinguishable from those in the PCs of WT littermates with either induction protocol (with somatic depolarization for GluA1-KO versus WT, p = 0.4, and for GluA3-KO versus WT, p = 0.2; with direct CF stimulation for GluA1-KO versus WT, p = 0.9, and for GluA3-KO versus WT, p = 0.8). These data are in line with other studies showing that GluA2 is the key subunit for AMPAR internalization and therefore for LTD induction (Steinberg et al., 2006Steinberg J.P. Takamiya K. Shen Y. Xia J. Rubio M.E. Yu S. Jin W. Thomas G.M. Linden D.J. Huganir R.L.

Hoebeek F.E. et al.Reevaluating the role of LTD in cerebellar motor learning.Neuron. 2011; 70: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Next, we induced LTP in PCs by 1 Hz tetanic stimulation of PF input alone (Lev-Ram et al., 2002Lev-Ram V. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. Tsien R.Y. A new form of cerebellar long-term potentiation is postsynaptic and depends on nitric oxide but not cAMP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8389-8393Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). This stimulus protocol reliably produced significant LTP in both WT PCs (p = 0.0005) and GluA1-KO PCs (p = 0.0003) with a similar magnitude (p = 0.5) and without significant changes in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the evoked EPSCs after LTP induction (p = 0.11 and p = 0.6 in GluA1-KO and WT PCs, respectively). In contrast, with the same stimulation protocol, LTP could not be induced in GluA3-KO PCs (p = 0.7) (Figure 2D). These experiments demonstrate that PF-PC LTP requires GluA3-containing AMPARs. What is the molecular mechanism underlying GluA3-dependent LTP of PF-PC synapses? To test whether GluA3-dependent synaptic plasticity in PCs depends on cAMP signaling, we administered the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (FSK) to PCs of GluA3-KO brain slices and compared the effects to those in WT slices and GluA1-KO slices (Figure 3A). Whereas FSK produced, on average, a 2-fold potentiation in PF-evoked EPSCs in both WT and GluA1-KO PCs (230% ± 25% and 215% ± 35%, respectively), it failed to induce synaptic potentiation in PCs that lack GluA3 (95% ± 10%, p = 0.005, GluA3-KO versus WT). Importantly, AMPAR potentiation also occurred in WT PCs when local stimulation with 1 μM AMPA was used while blocking PFs with TTX (189% ± 17%, p = 0.001; Figure 3B), highlighting its postsynaptic nature (Chen and Regehr, 1997Chen C. Regehr W.G. The mechanism of cAMP-mediated enhancement at a cerebellar synapse.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8687-8694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation at PF-PC synapses can occur upon a rise in the cellular level of cAMP. We next examined whether cAMP-driven synaptic potentiation is a result of synaptic trafficking of GluA3-containing AMPARs. To assess whether FSK increases GluA3 levels on the cell surface of spines, we performed time-lapse two-photon imaging of PCs in cultured organotypic cerebellar slices infected with Sindbis virus to acutely express GluA3 subunits fused to superecliptic pHluorin (SEP). SEP is a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that shows a reduction in fluorescence upon rapid application of acidic (pH 5) ACSF (Figure S4F; Makino and Malinow, 2009Makino H. Malinow R. AMPA receptor incorporation into synapses during LTP: the role of lateral movement and exocytosis.Neuron. 2009; 64: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To test whether GluA3 trafficking can be detected with this method, we first triggered LTD chemically by adding the metabotropic mGluR1 receptor agonist DHPG to induce internalization of AMPARs (Linden, 2001Linden D.J. The expression of cerebellar LTD in culture is not associated with changes in AMPA-receptor kinetics, agonist affinity, or unitary conductance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, application of DHPG to WT PCs expressing SEP-GluA3 produced a significant decrease in SEP fluorescence at spines (p < 0.0001; Figure 4A) and in synaptic strength (p = 0.004 for amplitude and p = 0.04 for frequency; Figure 4B), which is in line with the endocytosis of AMPARs that occurs during the expression of LTD at the PF-PC synapse (Wang and Linden, 2000Wang Y.T. Linden D.J. Expression of cerebellar long-term depression requires postsynaptic clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In contrast, washing in FSK failed to induce any change in SEP-GluA3 fluorescence at PC spines (0.03% ± 0.015% change, p = 0.4; Figure 4A), even though FSK significantly increased synaptic currents in the SEP-GluA3-expressing PCs (p = 0.04 for amplitude and p < 0.0001 for frequency; Figure 4B). These data suggest that the cAMP-driven synaptic potentiation does not require an insertion of GluA3-containing AMPARs at the surface of spines. To assess whether FSK promotes lateral mobility of GluA3 receptors instead of an increase in receptor externalization, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments of single spines of PCs expressing SEP-GluA3 (Figure 4C). After ∼80% photobleaching, the SEP signals recovered to ∼50%, suggesting that a proportion of SEP-GluA3 is immobilized at synapses (Makino and Malinow, 2009Makino H. Malinow R. AMPA receptor incorporation into synapses during LTP: the role of lateral movement and exocytosis.Neuron. 2009; 64: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The SEP fluorescence intensity recovered at a similar pace in the presence or absence of FSK (p = 0.9), indicating that the lateral mobility of GluA3-containing AMPARs is not influenced by a rise in cAMP. To assess whether GluA3 plasticity involves a change in channel properties, we resolved single-channel, AMPA-mediated currents by clamping a single AMPAR in cell-attached mode at the cell body of either GluA1-KO or GluA3-KO PCs with the recording pipette containing near-saturating concentrations of AMPA (Poon et al., 2010Poon K. Nowak L.M. Oswald R.E. Characterizing single-channel behavior of GluA3 receptors.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 1437-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Poon et al., 2011Poon K. Ahmed A.H. Nowak L.M. Oswald R.E. Mechanisms of modal activation of GluA3 receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GluA1-containing AMPARs at the surface of GluA3-KO PC cell bodies stochastically reached open states 1, 2, and 3 (indicating binding of 2, 3, and 4 glutamates per receptor complex, respectively) and displayed similar conductance levels and open-channel probability in the presence or absence of FSK application (Figure S5). In contrast, GluA3-containing AMPARs on cell bodies of GluA1-KO PCs produced the vast majority of their openings in the first and lower conductance state (O1) under basal conditions (Figures 5A and 5B ), indicating that only two out of the four ligand-binding domains (LBDs) present in the AMPAR tetramer are activated by AMPA. After application of FSK, the behavior of GluA3-containing AMPARs changed strikingly and produced a significantly higher amount of openings in state O2 and O3—similar to GluA1-containing AMPARs (compare Figures 5A, 5B, 5E, and S5B). The average duration of the openings was unchanged (p = 0.4, p = 0.13, and p = 0.09 for O1, O2, and O3, respectively; Figure 5C), but an increase of the absolute frequency of the openings caused shortening of the closed-state dwell-time and thus a significant net increase in open probability (p < 0.0001; Figure 5E). Although FSK did not significantly change the conductance level of any of the open states (p = 0.7, p = 0.14, and p = 0.15 for O1, O2, and O3, respectively; Figure 5D), the higher relative fraction of events in the highly conductive open states O2 and O3 caused a significant increase (p < 0.0001) in the overall conductance of cAMP-stimulated GluA3 channels (Figures 5B and 5D). These experiments suggest that a rise in intracellular cAMP produces synaptic potentiation by increasing the open-channel probability of the GluA3 subunit, indicating a novel mechanistic model for GluA3-dependent synaptic plasticity. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying GluA3-dependent plasticity, we aimed to identify the intermediary factor that translates a rise in cAMP into synaptic potentiation of GluA3-containing AMPARs. Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by a rise in cAMP and exerts cAMP-dependent synaptic effects (Lev-Ram et al., 2002Lev-Ram V. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. Tsien R.Y. A new form of cerebellar long-term potentiation is postsynaptic and depends on nitric oxide but not cAMP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8389-8393Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Sokolova et al., 2006Sokolova I.V. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Postsynaptic mechanisms are essential for forskolin-induced potentiation of synaptic transmission.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, incubating WT PCs with PKA antagonist KT5720 or PKA antagonist H89 did not have a significant effect on synaptic potentiation induced by FSK (215% ± 20% with KT5720 and 235% ± 19% with H89; p = 0.7 and p = 0.9, respectively; Figure 6A), indicating that PKA is not involved in mediating GluA3 plasticity. We next assessed the involvement of Epac (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP, a.k.a. Rap guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor) as an alternative cAMP-dependent pathway that can trigger synaptic changes (Gekel and Neher, 2008Gekel I. Neher E.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7991-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Woolfrey et al., 2009Woolfrey K.M. Srivastava D.P. Photowala H. Yamashita M. Barbolina M.V. Cahill M.E. Xie Z. Jones K.A.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The blockade of Epac with its selective antagonist ESI-05 (Tsalkova et al., 2012Tsalkova T. Mei F.C. Li S. Chepurny O.G. Leech C.A. Liu T. Holz G.G. Woods Jr., V.L. Cheng X. Isoform-specific antagonists of exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 18613-18618Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) did not reduce basal transmission at PF-PC synapses (Figure 7H), but it effectively prevented the FSK-induced synaptic potentiation in WT PCs (p = 0.9 versus baseline and p < 0.0001 versus control condition without ESI-05) (Figure 6A). To assess whether Epac activation is not only necessary but also sufficient to cause GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation, we investigated the impact of the selective Epac activator 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP (8CPT). Adding 20 μM 8CPT to the intracellular recording solution produced synaptic potentiation in WT PCs (185% ± 17%, p = 0.0004; Figure 6B), but not in GluA3-deficient PCs (100% ± 5%, p = 0.8; Figure 6B). In addition, the postsynaptic application of 8CPT increased the amplitude and frequency of PC mEPSCs (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.001, respectively; Figures 6C and 6D) and did not change the PPF ratio (104% ± 5%; Figure 6B). These experiments indicate that a rise in cAMP triggers synaptic potentiation through Epac-mediated activation of postsynaptic, GluA3-containing AMPARs. This Epac-driven activation of GluA3-containing AMPARs was not limited to AMPARs located at synapses. Outside-out patches excised from WT PC somata produced a peak current of approximately 10 pA in response to puffs of 100 μM AMPA (Figure S4E). When the Epac activator 8CPT was added to the internal solut"

We studied the growth and biochemical profile of Nannochloropsis 211/78 (CCAP) in optimized flat-plate photobioreactors. Eighteen cultivations were performed at two nutrient concentrations. The fatty acid, protein content and calorific values were analyzed after 8, 12 and 16 days. Neutral lipids were separated and the changes in fatty acids in triglycerides (TAGs) during nutrient depletion were recorded. The maximum cell density reached 4.7 g∙L-1 and the maximum productivity was 0.51 g∙L-1∙d-1. During nutrient-replete conditions, eicosapentaneoic acid (EPA) and total protein concentrations measured 4.2–4.9% and 50–55% of the dry mass, respectively. Nutrient starvation induced the accumulation of fatty acids up to 28.3% of the cell dry weight, largely due to the incorporation of C16:0 and C16:1n-7 fatty acyl chains into neutral lipids. During nutrient starvation the total EPA content did not detectibly change, but up to 37% was transferred from polar membrane lipids to the neutral lipid fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2579796465,"Background light intensity (irradiance) substantially impacts the visual code in the early visual system at synaptic and single-neuron levels, but its influence on population activity is largely unexplored. We show that fast narrowband oscillations, an important feature of population activity, systematically increase in amplitude as a function of irradiance in both anesthetized and awake, freely moving mice and at the level of the retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Narrowband coherence increases with irradiance across large areas of the dLGN, but especially for neighboring units. The spectral sensitivity of these effects and their substantial reduction in melanopsin knockout animals indicate a contribution from inner retinal photoreceptors. At bright backgrounds, narrowband coherence allows pooling of single-unit responses to become a viable strategy for enhancing visual signals within its frequency range."
https://openalex.org/W2576059313,"The use of native species in forest restoration has been increasingly recognized as an effective means of restoring ecosystem functions and biodiversity to degraded areas across the world. However, successful selection of species adapted to local conditions requires specific knowledge which is often lacking, especially in developing countries. In order to scale up forest restoration, experimental data on the responses of native species to propagation and restoration treatments across a range of local conditions are required. In this study, the restoration potential of 34 native tree species was evaluated based on nursery research and field planting experiments at a highly degraded site in a subtropical area of southwest China. We examined species performance in terms of germination rates as well as survival rates and growth over 2 years after planting. Of the 34 species examined, 25 had a germination percentage greater than 50%. Survivorship ranged from 0 to 97% across species and was greater than 50% for 20 species. Mean monthly growth increments varied between species. Pioneer species performed well, and 14 mid- and late-successional species performed reasonably well to very well in this study. However, the remaining 16 mid- and late-successional species performed poorly. These results indicate that carefully selected mid- and late-successional species can be effectively incorporated into mixed species plantings. This data can be used to inform restoration planning, helping to identify suitable species and so enhance the biodiversity and resilience of restored forests."
https://openalex.org/W2573028465,"Fear learning is a fundamental behavioral process that requires dopamine (DA) release. Experience-dependent synaptic plasticity occurs on DA neurons while an organism is engaged in aversive experiences. However, whether synaptic plasticity onto DA neurons is causally involved in aversion learning is unknown. Here, we show that a stress priming procedure enhances fear learning by engaging VTA synaptic plasticity. Moreover, we took advantage of the ability of the ATPase Thorase to regulate the internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in order to selectively manipulate glutamatergic synaptic plasticity on DA neurons. Genetic ablation of Thorase in DAT+ neurons produced increased AMPAR surface expression and function that lead to impaired induction of both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). Strikingly, animals lacking Thorase in DAT+ neurons expressed greater associative learning in a fear conditioning paradigm. In conclusion, our data provide a novel, causal link between synaptic plasticity onto DA neurons and fear learning."
https://openalex.org/W2573542790,"In recent decades petroleum pollution in the tropical rainforest has caused significant environmental damage in vast areas of the Amazon region. At present the extent of this damage is not entirely clear. Little is known about the specific impacts of petroleum pollution on tropical vegetation. In a field expedition to the Ecuadorian Amazon over 1100 leaf samples were collected from tropical trees in polluted and unpolluted sites. Plant families were identified for 739 of the leaf samples and compared between sites. Plant biodiversity indices show a reduction of the plant biodiversity when the site was affected by petroleum pollution. In addition, reflectance and transmittance were measured with a field spectroradiometer for every leaf sample and leaf chlorophyll content was estimated using reflectance model inversion with the radiative tranfer model PROSPECT. Four of the 15 plant families that are most representative of the ecoregion (Melastomataceae, Fabaceae, Rubiaceae and Euphorbiaceae) had significantly lower leaf chlorophyll content in the polluted areas compared to the unpolluted areas. This suggests that these families are more sensitive to petroleum pollution. The polluted site is dominated by Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae, suggesting that these plant families are particularly competitive in the presence of pollution. This study provides evidence of a decrease of plant diversity and richness caused by petroleum pollution and of a plant family-specific response of leaf chlorophyll content to petroleum pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon using information from field spectroscopy and radiative transfer modelling."

The model outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) among the 5 treatments. ICERs were interpreted using a willingness-to-pay threshold of €32,000/QALY. Uncertainty was evaluated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Three strategies were on the efficiency frontier: pulsed-tapered vancomycin, FMT via enema, and FMT via colonoscopy, in order of increasing effectiveness. FMT via duodenal infusion and fidaxomicin were dominated (i.e. less effective and costlier) by FMT via colonoscopy and FMT via enema. FMT via enema compared with pulsed-tapered vancomycin had an ICER of €18,092/QALY. The ICER for FMT via colonoscopy versus FMT via enema was €73,653/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations showed that FMT via enema was the most cost-effective strategy in 58% of simulations and FMT via colonoscopy was favored in 19% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €32,000/QALY.FMT via enema is the most cost-effective initial strategy for the management of second recurrence of community-onset CDI at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €32,000/QALY."
https://openalex.org/W2579199090,"Spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) serves as a key cellular correlate of associative learning, which is facilitated by elevated attentional and emotional states involving activation of adrenergic signaling. At cellular levels, adrenergic signaling increases dendrite excitability, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that activation of β2-adrenoceptors promoted STD long-term synaptic potentiation at mouse hippocampal excitatory synapses by inactivating dendritic Kv1.1-containing potassium channels, which increased dendrite excitability and facilitated dendritic propagation of postsynaptic depolarization, potentially improving coincidental activation of pre- and postsynaptic terminals. We further demonstrate that adrenergic modulation of Kv1.1 was mediated by the signaling scaffold SAP97, which, through direct protein-protein interactions, escorts β2 signaling to remove Kv1.1 from the dendrite surface. These results reveal a mechanism through which the postsynaptic signaling scaffolds bridge the aroused brain state to promote induction of synaptic plasticity and potentially to enhance spike timing and memory encoding."

The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus capreolus) is the most abundant ungulate and a major game species all over Europe. Yet, internationally available literature on roe deer pathology is scarce. The aims of this study were (1) to provide an overview of the causes of mortality or morbidity observed in roe deer in Switzerland and to assess potential changes in the disease pattern over time; and (2) to evaluate the value and limitations of a long term dataset originating from general wildlife health surveillance. We compiled 1571 necropsy reports of free ranging roe deer examined at the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health in Switzerland from 1958 to 2014. Descriptive data analysis was performed considering animal metadata, submitter, pathologist in charge, laboratory methods, morphological diagnoses and etiologies. Recurrent causes of mortality and disease pictures included pneumonia, diarrhea, meningoencephalitis, actinomycosis, blunt trauma, predation, neoplasms and anomalies. By contrast, other diagnoses such as fatal parasitic gastritis, suspected alimentary intoxication and reproductive disorders appeared only in earlier time periods. Diseases potentially relevant for other animals or humans such as caseous lymphadenitis (or pseudotuberculosis), salmonellosis, paratuberculosis and listeriosis were sporadically observed. The disease pattern in roe deer from Switzerland was largely in accordance with previous reports. The observed fluctuations were consistent with methodical and/or personnel changes and varying disease awareness. Nevertheless, despite such limitations, the compiled data provide a valuable baseline. To facilitate comparison among studies, we recommend systematically archiving all case documents and fixed tissues and to perform data analyses more regularly and in a harmonized way."
https://openalex.org/W2571890433,"Background Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD) is the main limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Although CLAD is usually not responsive to treatment, earlier identification may improve treatment prospects. Methods In a nested case control study, 1-year post transplant surveillance bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were obtained from incipient CLAD (n = 9) and CLAD free (n = 8) lung transplant recipients. Incipient CLAD cases were diagnosed with CLAD within 2 years, while controls were free from CLAD for at least 4 years following bronchoscopy. Transcription profiles in the BAL cell pellets were assayed with the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression analysis, based on an absolute fold change (incipient CLAD vs no CLAD) >2.0 and an unadjusted p-value ≤0.05, generated a candidate list containing 55 differentially expressed probe sets (51 up-regulated, 4 down-regulated). Results The cell pellets in incipient CLAD cases were skewed toward immune response pathways, dominated by genes related to recruitment, retention, activation and proliferation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+ T-cells and natural killer cells). Both hierarchical clustering and a supervised machine learning tool were able to correctly categorize most samples (82.3% and 94.1% respectively) into incipient CLAD and CLAD-free categories. Conclusions These findings suggest that a pathobiology, similar to AR, precedes a clinical diagnosis of CLAD. A larger prospective investigation of the BAL cell pellet transcriptome as a biomarker for CLAD risk stratification is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2573897856,"Context Inmates, notably women, are at greater risk for obesity and metabolic complications than the general population according to several studies from high income countries. Data regarding French correctional institutions are lacking so far. To fill this gap, we have assessed in a sample from a French prison (33 females and 18 males) the gender-specific effect of incarceration on weight and body mass index (BMI) and examined their current metabolic status. Furthermore, to reveal the possible determinants of increased obesity, we analyzed emotional vulnerability, eating behavior and physical activity using self-reported questionnaires. Results In this sample, obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) was already frequent in women (18.2%) but rather scarce for men (11%) at prison entry. Incarceration worsened the rate of obesity in both genders (21.2% and 16.7% respectively). At the time of study, abdominal obesity estimated through waist circumference was particularly prevalent in women (69.7%) versus men (27.8%) and metabolic syndrome was detected in 33% of female against none in male inmates. Abdominal obesity was associated with female sex (p<0.03), low physical activity (p<0.05) and eating disorder (p = 0.07) in univariate analyses. Low physical activity remained significant as an explanatory factor of higher abdominal obesity in multivariate analysis. A marked difference between genders was found for practice of physical activity with a higher proportion of women compared to men being inactive (37.9% vs. 11.8%) and fewer women being very active (17.2% vs. 41.2%). Conclusion This study revealed that a significant proportion of women of this correctional institution combined established obesity, a metabolic syndrome and very little practice of physical activity which put them at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, obesity should be better surveyed and treated in prison, especially for female inmates. Increased physical activity, adapted to obese women, would be the first mean to decrease obesity and gender differences."

The Kd, Bmax, internalization and binding kinetics of [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex-4 and [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex(9–39) were studied in vitro using Ins-1E cells. Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in nude mice bearing Ins-1E xenografts. In vitro evaluation demonstrated high affinity binding of the [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex-4 agonist to the Ins-1E cells with fast internalization kinetics reaching a plateau after 30 min. The antagonist [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex(9–39) did not internalize and had a 4–fold higher Kd value compared to the agonist. In contrast to [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex(9–39), which showed low and transient tumor uptake, [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex-4 demonstrated excellent in vivo binding properties with tumor uptake identical to that of 68Ga-Ex-4, but substantially lower kidney uptake resulting in a tumor-to-kidney ratio of 9.7 at 1 h compared to 0.3 with 68Ga-Ex-4. Accumulation of activity in thyroid and stomach for both peptides, which was effectively blocked by irenat, confirms that in vivo deiodination is the mechanism behind the low kidney retention of iodinated peptides. The 124I congener of [Nle14,125I-Tyr40-NH2]Ex-4 demonstrated a similar favourable biodistribution profile in the PET imaging studies in contrast to the typical biodistribution pattern of [Nle14,Lys40(Ahx-DOTA-68Ga)NH2]Ex-4. Our results demonstrate that iodinated Ex-4 is a very promising tracer for imaging of benign insulinomas. It solves the problem of high kidney uptake of the radiometal-labelled tracers by improving the tumor-to-kidney ratio measured for [Nle14,Lys40(Ahx-DOTA-68Ga)NH2]Ex-4 by 32 fold."

In neoplastic cells, ribosome biogenesis is increased to sustain the high proliferation rate and ribosome composition is altered to modulate specific gene expression driving tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the usage of ribosome biogenesis factors as clinical markers in adult patients with AML. We showed that nucleoli, the nucleus compartments where ribosome production takes place, are modified in AML by analyzing a panel of AML and healthy donor cells using immunofluorescence staining. Using four AML series, including the TCGA dataset, altogether representing a total of about 270 samples, we showed that not all factors involved in ribosome biogenesis have clinical values although ribosome biogenesis is increased in AML. Interestingly, we identified the regulator of ribosome production nucleolin (NCL) as over-expressed in AML blasts. Moreover, we found in two series that high NCL mRNA expression level was associated with a poor overall survival, particular in elderly patients. Multivariate analyses taking into account age and cytogenetic risk indicated that NCL expression in blast cells is an independent marker of reduced survival. Our study identifies NCL as a potential novel prognostic factor in AML. Altogether, our results suggest that the ribosome biogenesis pathway may be of interest as clinical markers in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2574192730,"Human exploitation of marine resources is profoundly altering marine ecosystems, while climate change is expected to further impact commercially-harvested fish and other species. Although the global fishery is a highly complex system with many unpredictable aspects, the bioenergetic limits on fish production and the response of fishing effort to profit are both relatively tractable, and are sure to play important roles. Here we describe a generalized, coupled biological-economic model of the global marine fishery that represents both of these aspects in a unified framework, the BiOeconomic mArine Trophic Size-spectrum (BOATS) model. BOATS predicts fish production according to size spectra as a function of net primary production and temperature, and dynamically determines harvest spectra from the biomass density and interactive, prognostic fishing effort. Within this framework, the equilibrium fish biomass is determined by the economic forcings of catchability, ex-vessel price and cost per unit effort, while the peak harvest depends on the ecosystem parameters. Comparison of a large ensemble of idealized simulations with observational databases, focusing on historical biomass and peak harvests, allows us to narrow the range of several uncertain ecosystem parameters, rule out most parameter combinations, and select an optimal ensemble of model variants. Compared to the prior distributions, model variants with lower values of the mortality rate, trophic efficiency, and allometric constant agree better with observations. For most acceptable parameter combinations, natural mortality rates are more strongly affected by temperature than growth rates, suggesting different sensitivities of these processes to climate change. These results highlight the utility of adopting large-scale, aggregated data constraints to reduce model parameter uncertainties and to better predict the response of fisheries to human behaviour and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2578421528,"Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a potent anti-inflammatory peptide with cytoprotective effect in various tissues. The present investigation demonstrates the ability of α-MSH to interact with intestinal epithelial cell monolayers and mitigate inflammatory processes of the epithelial barrier. The protective effect of α-MSH was studied on Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial monolayers, which were disrupted by exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. The barrier integrity was assessed by measuring transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) and permeability for marker molecules. Caco-2 monolayers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for expression of melanocortin-1 receptor and tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-4. The activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) was detected by fluorescence microscopy and inflammatory cytokine expression was assessed by flow cytometric bead array cytokine assay. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to proinflammatory cytokines lowered TEER and increased permeability for fluorescein and albumin, which was accompanied by changes in ZO-1 and claudin-4 immunostaining. α-MSH was able to prevent inflammation-associated decrease of TEER in a dose-dependent manner and reduce the increased permeability for paracellular marker fluorescein. Further immunohistochemistry analysis revealed proinflammatory cytokine induced translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit into Caco-2 cell nuclei, which was inhibited by α-MSH. As a result the IL-6 and IL-8 production of Caco-2 monolayers were also decreased with different patterns by the addition of α-MSH to the culture medium. In conclusion, Caco-2 cells showed a positive immunostaining for melanocortin-1 receptor and α-MSH protected Caco-2 cells against inflammatory barrier dysfunction and inflammatory activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2579155423,"Folate deficiency during pregnancy has been related to low birth weight, preterm (PT) birth and other health risks in the offspring; however, it is unknown whether prematurity is related to low folate transport through the placenta due to altered expression of specific folate transporters. We determined placental expression (mRNA and protein concentrations by RT-qPCR and WB respectively) of specific folate transporters: RFC, PCFT/HCP1 and FOLR1 in chorionic (fetal) and basal (maternal) plates of placentas of PT pregnancies (PT, 32-36 weeks, n = 51). Term placentas were used as controls (T, 37-41 weeks, n = 47). Folates and vitamin B12 levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence in umbilical cord blood of newborns. FOLR1 mRNA expression was lower and protein concentration higher in PT placentas (both plates) relative to the control group (p <0.05). In addition, gestational age was positively correlated with mRNA expression (Rho = 0.7), and negatively with protein concentration (Rho = -0.7 for chorionic and -0.43 for basal plate). PCFT/HCP1 mRNA was lower in PT placentas, without changes in protein levels. RFC did not differ in PT placentas compared to controls. PT newborns presented higher cord blood folate level (p = 0.049) along with lower vitamin B12 concentration compared to controls (p = 0.037).In conclusion, placental FOLR1 mRNA was positively associated with gestational age. Conversely, FOLR1 protein concentrations along with folate/vitamin B12 ratio in cord blood were negatively associated with gestational age. Placental FOLR1 is likely the main placental folate transporter to the fetus in newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2576285039,"Background Deep tissues and their afferents have unique responses to various stimuli and respond to injury distinctively. However, the types of receptors and endogenous ligands that have a key role in pain after deep tissue incision are unknown. TRPA1 has been shown to mediate pain-related responses in inflammation- and nerve injury-induced pain models. We hypothesized that TRPA1 has an important role in pain behaviors after deep tissue incision. Methods The effect of various doses of intraperitoneal (i.p.) TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031, on pain behaviors after skin + deep tissue incision of the rat hind paw was measured. In vivo reactive oxygen species (ROS)-imaging and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels after incision were also evaluated. Separate groups of rats were examined for H2O2-evoked pain-related behaviors after injections into the deep tissue or the subcutaneous tissue. Results Guarding pain behavior after skin + deep tissue incision was decreased by i.p. HC-030031. However, HC-030031 did not affect mechanical or heat responses after incision. Treatment either before or after incision was effective against incision-induced guarding behavior. ROS increased after skin + deep tissue incision in both the incised muscle and the skin. Tissue H2O2 also increased in both skin and muscle after incision. H2O2 injection produced pain behaviors when injected into muscle but not after subcutaneous injection. Conclusions This study demonstrates that TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 reduced spontaneous guarding pain behavior after skin + deep tissue incision. These data indicate that TRPA1 receptors on nociceptors are active in incised fascia and muscle but this is not evident in incised skin. Even though endogenous TRPA1 agonists like ROS and H2O2 were increased in both incised skin and muscle, those in skin do not contribute to nociceptive behaviors. This study suggests that endogenous TRPA1 ligands and the TRPA1 receptor are important targets for acute pain from deep tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2572264426,"Objectives Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) seem to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mainly in those using clopidogrel. We analysed the impact of PPIs on the prognosis of patients with stable CAD. Methods We followed 706 patients with CAD. Primary outcome was the combination of secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were 1) acute ischaemic events (any acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack) and 2) heart failure (HF) or death. Results Patients on PPIs were older [62.0 (53.0–73.0) vs. 58.0 (50.0–70.0) years; p = 0.003] and had a more frequent history of stroke (4.9% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.004) than those from the non-PPI group, and presented no differences in any other clinical variable, including cardiovascular risk factors, ejection fraction, and therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Follow-up was 2.2±0.99 years. Seventy-eight patients met the primary outcome, 53 developed acute ischaemic events, and 33 HF or death. PPI use was an independent predictor of the primary outcome [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.281 (1.244–4.183); p = 0.008], along with hypertension, body-mass index, glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, and nitrate use. PPI use was also an independent predictor of HF/death [HR = 5.713 (1.628–20.043); p = 0.007], but not of acute ischaemic events. A propensity score showed similar results. Conclusions In patients with CAD, PPI use is independently associated with an increased incidence of HF and death but not with a high rate of acute ischaemic events. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2574104634,"Migrant men who have sex with men (MSM) have a higher predisposition for HIV transmission. We aimed to determine and compare the prevalence and trends of HIV, Syphilis, and HCV between migrant and resident MSM in Shandong, China.A serial cross-sectional study was conducted in eight cities in Shandong, China from 2010 to 2014. The surveys collected information on demographics, HIV-related knowledge, and HIV-related behaviors including the serologic status of HIV, syphilis, and HCV. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine differences between migrant and resident MSM.The overall prevalence of HIV among the 15,705 MSM (14120 were resident, 1580 were migrant and 5 were missing) was 2.6%, with an increase of 1.0% in 2010 to 4.4% in 2014. Prevalence of HIV was higher among migrant MSMs (5.5%) compared to resident MSMs (2.3%). Compared to residents, migrants also had higher prevalence of syphilis (7.5% vs 4.9%) and HCV (1.1% vs 0.6%). We found that there was an increase in the proportion of migrant MSM engaging in anal sex [adjusted OR (AOR) = 1.41 in migrants vs 1.12 in residents], condom use during last anal sex (AOR = 1.14 in residents, P for trend = 0.32), consistent condom use (AOR = 1.04 residents, P for trend = 0.11) and drug use (AOR = 1.51 in migrants and 1.29 among residents). Except in the year 2011, receiving some health services in last year was significant for people who were HIV-positive compared to negative. (P for trend <0.05).Prevalence of HIV increased in resident as well as migrant MSMs. The migrant MSMs had higher STIs compared to resident MSMs and therefore, should be targeted for effective interventions aimed at reducing their risk behaviors. Deeper understanding of the role of migration in health issues is required for combating the persistently high and gradually increasing HIV burden in MSM in China."
https://openalex.org/W2578328098,"The betabaculovirus originally called Pseudaletia (Mythimna) sp. granulovirus #8 (MyspGV#8) was examined by electron microscopy, host barcoding PCR, and determination of the nucleotide sequence of its genome. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the occlusion bodies of MyspGV#8 possessed the characteristic size range and morphology of betabaculovirus granules. Barcoding PCR using cytochrome oxidase I primers with DNA from the MyspGV#8 collection sample confirmed that it had been isolated from the true armyworm, Mythimna unipuncta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and therefore was renamed MyunGV#8. The MyunGV#8 genome was found to be 144,673 bp in size with a nucleotide distribution of 49.9% G+C, which was significantly smaller and more GC-rich than the genome of Pseudaletia unipuncta granulovirus H (PsunGV-H), another M. unipuncta betabaculovirus. A phylogeny based on concatenated baculovirus core gene amino acid sequence alignments placed MyunGV#8 in clade a of genus Betabaculovirus. Kimura-2-parameter nucleotide distances suggested that MyunGV#8 represents a virus species different and distinct from other species of Betabaculovirus. Among the 153 ORFs annotated in the MyunGV#8 genome, four ORFs appeared to have been obtained from or donated to the alphabaculovirus lineage represented by Leucania separata nucleopolyhedrovirus AH1 (LeseNPV-AH1) during co-infection of Mythimna sp. larvae. A set of 33 ORFs was identified that appears only in other clade a betabaculovirus isolates. This clade a-specific set includes an ORF that encodes a polypeptide sequence containing a CIDE_N domain, which is found in caspase-activated DNAse/DNA fragmentation factor (CAD/DFF) proteins. CAD/DFF proteins are involved in digesting DNA during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2579671944,"Coughing in a child induced by upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) can be a problem, both for the child and its parents. Current studies show a lack of proven efficacy for over-the counter (OTC) medications, but promising data support the use of honey for children. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two kinds of Iranian honey with diphenhydramine (DPH) on nocturnal pediatric coughs and the sleep quality of children and their parents. This was a clinical trial (registered in IRCT; No.: 28.20.7932, 15 October 2013). The study consisted of 87 patients. All the parents completed a standard previously validated questionnaire. The children were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group 1, Honey type 1 (Kimia Company, Iran) (n = 42), Group 2, Honey type 2 (Shahde-Golha, Iran) (n = 25), and Group 3, DPH (n = 20). Each group received double doses of the respective treatments on two successive nights. A second survey was then administered via a telephone interview in which the parents were asked the same questions. The mean scores for all aspects of coughs were significantly decreased in each group before and after the treatment. All three treatments improved the cough and sleep scores. Honey type 1 was superior to DPH in improving all aspects of coughs, except the frequency, and Honey type 2 was more effective than DPH in improving all aspects of coughs, except the sleep quality of the child. There was no significant difference between Honey type 1 and 2 in any aspects of cough relief in the present study. The results suggest that honey may provide better cough relief than DPH in children and improve the sleep quality of children and their parents."
https://openalex.org/W2571825132,"Background The aim of this work was to explore the potential risk of vector-borne Chagas disease in urban districts in northeastern Brazil, by analyzing the spatiotemporal distributions and natural infection rates with Trypanosoma cruzi of triatomine species captured in recent years. The main motivation of this work was an acute human case of Chagas disease reported in 2008 in the municipality of Sobral. Methodology/principal findings We analyzed data from community-based entomological surveillance carried out from 2010 to 2014. Triatomine natural T. cruzi infection was assessed by examination of insect feces by optical microscopy. Sites of triatomine capture were georeferenced through Google Earth and analyzed with ArcGIS. A total of 191 triatomines were collected, consisting of 82.2% Triatoma pseudomaculata, 7.9% Rhodnius nasutus, 5.8% T. brasiliensis, 3.7% Panstrongylus lutzi, and 0.5% P. megistus, with an overall natural infection index of 17.8%. Most infestations were reported in the districts of Dom José (36.2%), Padre Palhano (24.7%), and Alto do Cristo (10.6%). The overwhelming majority of insects (185/96.9%) were captured inside houses, and most insects tended to be collected in intermittent peaks. Moreover, captured triatomines tended to constitute colonies. The acute case reported in 2008 was found to be situated within a T. pseudomaculata hotspot. Conclusion The triatomine collection events carried out by dwellers were aggregated in time and space into distinct foci, suggesting that insects are intermittently and artificially introduced into the city, possibly via accidental migration from their natural reservoirs. The relatively high T. cruzi infection rate indicates considerable circulation of the parasite in these areas, increasing the risk of vector-borne Chagas disease infection. These data suggest a need to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and integrate appropriate control actions targeting triatomines, T. cruzi reservoirs, and human populations. Our data also identify Chagas disease transmission as a hazard in urban areas of Sobral."
https://openalex.org/W2578295730,"In the sparse representation model, the design of overcomplete dictionaries plays a key role for the effectiveness and applicability in different domains. Recent research has produced several dictionary learning approaches, being proven that dictionaries learnt by data examples significantly outperform structured ones, e.g. wavelet transforms. In this context, learning consists in adapting the dictionary atoms to a set of training signals in order to promote a sparse representation that minimizes the reconstruction error. Finding the best fitting dictionary remains a very difficult task, leaving the question still open. A well-established heuristic method for tackling this problem is an iterative alternating scheme, adopted for instance in the well-known K-SVD algorithm. Essentially, it consists in repeating two stages; the former promotes sparse coding of the training set and the latter adapts the dictionary to reduce the error. In this paper we present R-SVD, a new method that, while maintaining the alternating scheme, adopts the Orthogonal Procrustes analysis to update the dictionary atoms suitably arranged into groups. Comparative experiments on synthetic data prove the effectiveness of R-SVD with respect to well known dictionary learning algorithms such as K-SVD, ILS-DLA and the online method OSDL. Moreover, experiments on natural data such as ECG compression, EEG sparse representation, and image modeling confirm R-SVD's robustness and wide applicability."
https://openalex.org/W2579220055,"Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2 (LGMD2) is a group of autosomally recessive inherited disorders defined by weakness and wasting of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. In the past, several population isolates with high incidence of LGMD2 arising from founder mutation effects have been identified. The aim of this work is to describe the results of clinical, epidemiologic, and molecular studies performed in a Mexican village segregating numerous cases of LGMD2. A population census was conducted in the village to identify all LGMD affected patients. Molecular analysis included genome wide homozygosity mapping using a 250K SNP Affymetrix microarray followed by PCR amplification and direct nucleotide sequencing of the candidate gene. In addition, DNA from 401 randomly selected unaffected villagers was analyzed to establish the carrier frequency of the LGMD2 causal mutation. A total of 32 LGMD2 patients were identified in the village, rendering a disease prevalence of 4.3 (CI: 2.9-5.9) cases per 1,000 habitants (1 in 232). Genome wide homozygosity mapping revealed that affected individuals shared a 6.6 Mb region of homozygosity at chromosome 15q15. The identified homozygous interval contained CAPN3, the gene responsible for LGMD2 type A (LGMD2A). Direct sequencing of this gene revealed homozygosity for a novel c.348C>A mutation (p.Ala116Asp) in DNA from all 20 affected subjects available for genetic screening, except one which was heterozygous for the mutation. In such patient, a heterozygous c.2362AG>TCATCT deletion/insertion was recognized as the second CAPN3 mutation. Western blot and autocatalytic activity analyses in protein lysates from skeletal muscle biopsy obtained from a p.Ala116Asp homozygous patient suggested that this particular mutation increased the autocatalytic activity of CAPN3. Thirty eigth heterozygotes of the p.Ala116Asp mutation were identified among 401 genotyped unaffected villagers, yielding a population carrier frequency of 1 in 11. This study demonstrates that a cluster of patients with LGMD2A in a small Mexican village arises from a novel CAPN3 founder mutation. Evidence of allelic heterogeneity is demonstrated by the recognition of an additional CAPN3 mutation in a single affected. Our study provides an additional example of genetic isolation causing a high prevalence of LGMD and of successful molecular characterization of the disease by means of homozygosity mapping. The identification of a very high carrier frequency of the LGMD2-causing mutation has implications for more rational genetic counseling in this community."
https://openalex.org/W2574710004,"Terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) are specialized cells that envelop the motor nerve terminal, and play a role in the maintenance and regeneration of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The chemorepulsive protein semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) is selectively up-regulated in TSCs on fast-fatigable muscle fibers following experimental denervation of the muscle (BotoxA-induced paralysis or crush injury to the sciatic nerve) or in the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Re-expression of SEMA3A in this subset of TSCs is thought to play a role in the selective plasticity of nerve terminals as observed in ALS and following BotoxA-induced paralysis. Using a mouse model expressing a mutant SEMA3A with diminished signaling capacity, we studied the influence of SEMA3A signaling at the NMJ with two denervation paradigms; a motor neuron disease model (the G93A-hSOD1 ALS mouse line) and an injury model (BotoxA-induced paralysis). ALS mice that either expressed 1 or 2 mutant SEMA3A alleles demonstrated no difference in ALS-induced decline in motor behavior. We also investigated the effects of BotoxA-induced paralysis on the sprouting capacity of NMJs in the K108N-SEMA3A mutant mouse, and observed no change in the differential neuronal plasticity found at NMJs on fast-fatigable or slow muscle fibers due to the presence of the SEMA3A mutant protein. Our data may be explained by the residual repulsive activity of the mutant SEMA3A, or it may imply that SEMA3A alone is not a key component of the molecular signature affecting NMJ plasticity in ALS or BotoxA-induced paralysis. Interestingly, we did observe a sex difference in motor neuron sprouting behavior after BotoxA-induced paralysis in WT mice which we speculate may be an important factor in the sex dimorphic differences seen in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2523999583,"The study of neural pre-stimulus or “anticipatory” activity opened a new window for understanding how the brain actively constructs the forthcoming reality. Usually, experimental paradigms designed to study anticipatory activity make use of stimuli. The purpose of the present study is to expand the study of neural anticipatory activity upon the temporal occurrence of dichotomic, statistically unpredictable (random) stimuli within an ecological experimental paradigm. To this purpose, we used a simplified driving simulation including two possible, randomly-presented trial types: a car crash end trial and a no car crash end trial. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were extracted -3,000 ms before stimulus onset. We identified a fronto-central negativity starting around 1,000 ms before car crash presentation. By contrast, a whole-scalp distributed positivity characterized the anticipatory activity observed before the end of the trial in the no car crash end condition. The present data are in line with the hypothesis that the brain may also anticipate dichotomic, statistically unpredictable stimuli, relaying onto different pre-stimulus ERP activity. Possible integration with car-smart-systems is also suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2579145571,"Mutations in the Aristaless Related Homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with a spectrum of structural (lissencephaly) and functional (epilepsy and intellectual disabilities) neurodevelopmental disorders. How mutations in this single transcription factor can result in such a broad range of phenotypes remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that ARX functions through distinct interactions with specific transcription factors/cofactors to regulate unique target genes in different cell types. To identify ARX interacting proteins, we performed an unbiased proteomics screen and identified several components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including β-catenin (CTNNB1), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (BCL9) and leucine rich repeat flightless interacting protein 2 (LRRFIP2), in cortical progenitor cells. Our data show that ARX positively regulates Wnt/ β-catenin signaling and that the C-terminal domain of ARX interacts with the armadillo repeats in β-catenin to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In addition, we found BCL9 and P300 also interact with ARX to modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These data provide new insights into how ARX can uniquely regulate cortical neurogenesis, and connect the function of ARX with Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2577969924,"Previous research has shown that precision and power grip performance is consistently influenced by simultaneous articulation. For example, power grip responses are performed relatively fast with the open-back vowel [a], whereas precision grip responses are performed relatively fast with the close-front vowel [i]. In the present study, the participants were presented with a picture of a hand shaped to the precision or power grip. They were required to pronounce speech sounds according to the front/above perspective of the hand. The results showed that not only the grip performance is affected by simultaneously pronouncing the speech sound but also the production of speech sound can be affected by viewing an image of a grip. The precision grip stimulus triggered relatively rapid production of the front-close vowel [i]. In contrast, the effect related to the power grip stimulus was mostly linked to the vertical dimension of the pronounced vowel since this stimulus triggered relatively rapid production of the back-open vowel [a] and back-mid-open vowel [o] while production of the back-close vowel [u] was not influenced by it. The fact that production of the dorsal consonant [k] or coronal consonant [t] were not influenced by these stimuli suggests that the effect was not associated with a relative front-back tongue shape of the articulation in the absence of changes in any vertical articulatory components. These findings provide evidence for an intimate interaction between certain articulatory gestures and grip types, suggesting that an overlapping visuomotor network operates for planning articulatory gestures and grasp actions."
https://openalex.org/W2579870852,"Objective Walking through a narrow aperture requires unique postural configurations, i.e., body rotation in the yaw dimension. Stroke individuals may have difficulty performing the body rotations due to motor paralysis on one side of their body. The present study was therefore designed to investigate how successfully such individuals walk through apertures and how they perform body rotation behavior. Method Stroke fallers (n = 10), stroke non-fallers (n = 13), and healthy controls (n = 23) participated. In the main task, participants walked for 4 m and passed through apertures of various widths (0.9–1.3 times the participant’s shoulder width). Accidental contact with the frame of an aperture and kinematic characteristics at the moment of aperture crossing were measured. Participants also performed a perceptual judgment task to measure the accuracy of their perceived aperture passability. Results and Discussion Stroke fallers made frequent contacts on their paretic side; however, the contacts were not frequent when they penetrated apertures from their paretic side. Stroke fallers and non-fallers rotated their body with multiple steps, rather than a single step, to deal with their motor paralysis. Although the minimum passable width was greater for stroke fallers, the body rotation angle was comparable among groups. This suggests that frequent contact in stroke fallers was due to insufficient body rotation. The fact that there was no significant group difference in the perceived aperture passability suggested that contact occurred mainly due to locomotor factors rather than perceptual factors. Two possible explanations (availability of vision and/or attention) were provided as to why accidental contact on the paretic side did not occur frequently when stroke fallers penetrated the apertures from their paretic side."

Oscillatory activity is ubiquitous in nervous systems and is critical for the coordination of behavior among different neural circuits (Nusbaum and Beenhakker, 2002Nusbaum M.P. Beenhakker M.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, oscillatory activity gained notoriety when described in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of humans (Berger, 1929Berger H. Arch. Psychiatr. Nervenkr. 1929; 87: 527-570Crossref Scopus (2369) Google Scholar). Oscillations in the gamma (30–80 Hz) range were discovered by Adrian in the olfactory bulb in response to odorants (Adrian, 1950Adrian E.D. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1950; 2: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Gamma oscillations have been attributed to many functional roles mostly related to their usefulness in providing a common temporal framework for meaningful interaction among groups of neurons, which can be measured as synchrony (Traub et al., 1999Traub R.D.

Neuroscience. 1993; 56: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The most common and robust mechanism, however, is the reciprocal interaction between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons (reviewed in Cardin, 2016Cardin J.A. J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10496-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The period of this reciprocal interaction is mainly determined by the duration of the chloride-dependent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) (∼12–50 ms), thus resulting in frequencies around 20–80 Hz. However, the duration of the IPSPs may vary rapidly, changing the frequency of gamma oscillations and broadening the spectral peaks (broadband gamma). In other circumstances, gamma oscillations vary little in frequency and generate narrow spectral peaks (narrowband). The conditions in which these two types of gamma oscillations are generated and their functional significance are largely unknown. Two papers in this issue of Neuron (Saleem et al., 2017Saleem A.B. Lien A.D. Krumin M. Haider B. Román M. Aslı Aya R. Reinhold K. Busse L. Carandini M. Harris K.D.

Key to understanding the importance of the two studies are the concepts of luminance and contrast. Luminance is a measure of the amount of light per unit area, while contrast is a measure of the difference in luminance between any two points in an image and is, therefore, the parameter that makes visual objects distinguishable. One of the most striking features of the visual system is the ability to detect small contrast signals despite changes in luminance of several orders of magnitude, i.e., we can read the newspaper either in bright sunlight or under the light of the full moon. This feat is realized by retinal circuitry, which generates the center-surround structure of the receptive field of retinal ganglion cells in which signals of opposite luminance are added together to generate an output from retina to lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) mainly representing contrast. However, we are also aware of the level of luminance. How is luminance information encoded by the visual system? Early recordings from primary visual cortex (V1) in chronically implanted cats (Hubel, 1959Hubel D.H. J. Physiol. 1959; 147: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and monkeys (Wurtz, 1969Wurtz R.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1969; 32: 727-742PubMed Google Scholar) emphasized the very little effect that background illumination had on the sustained firing rates of single neurons. In this issue of Neuron, Saleem et al. and Storchi et al. demonstrate that luminance is instead represented in population dynamics in the form of narrowband gamma oscillations. Both papers show that, in the mouse visual system, increases in the intensity of background illumination result in proportional increases in narrow-bandwidth (∼10 Hz) oscillatory activity with a peak at ∼60 Hz in awake mice, or ∼30 Hz under anesthesia. These narrowband oscillations are coherent within the LGN and are not present in the dark. The two papers are highly complementary; while Saleem et al., 2017Saleem A.B. Lien A.D. Krumin M. Haider B. Román M. Aslı Aya R. Reinhold K. Busse L. Carandini M. Harris K.D. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar focuses on V1 and LGN and places emphasis on the differential response properties of narrow- and broadband gamma oscillations, the study by Storchi et al., 2017Storchi R. Bedford R.A. Martial F.P. Allen A.E. Wynne J. Montemurro M.A. Petersen R.S. Lucas R.J. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar untangles the retinal mechanism of the narrowband oscillation and its transmission to LGN. The study by Saleem et al. uses a clever combination of optogenetic approaches to show that the narrowband oscillation disappears from cortex when the thalamus is inactivated but remains unaltered in LGN when V1 is silenced. Thus, even though the study by Saleem et al. demonstrates that luminance-dependent narrowband oscillations are not generated in cortex, it leaves open the possibility that they may be generated in the retina. The paper by Storchi et al. demonstrates not only that the response properties of luminance-driven narrowband oscillations are present in the retina, but also that oscillations are coherent in simultaneous recordings of retina and LGN. Since communication from retina to LGN is unidirectional, their data strongly suggest that the oscillation indeed originates in the retina. They go further to show that, within the retina, the light sensitivity responsible for the oscillations is largely derived not from photoreceptors (rods and cones) but from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express melanopsin, the blue-sensitive photopigment supposedly responsible for circadian photoentrainment. Indeed, Storchi et al. show that narrowband oscillations are partially suppressed either in knockout mice for the gene that encodes melanopsin (Opn4−/−) or in control mice responding to ramps of increasing light defective in wavelengths (blue) that selectively activate melanopsin. Thus, at least in part, narrowband oscillations are due to the activation of ipRGCs by background light illumination. While the study by Storchi et al. focuses on narrowband oscillations, the study by Saleem et al. places great emphasis on the comparison between narrow- and wideband oscillations. From the LFP and spike responses of LGN and V1, Saleem et al. quantify the magnitude of narrowband oscillations as the normalized power averaged between 55 and 70 Hz, and that of the wideband as the mean power across the spectral bands of 20–40 and 70–90 Hz. This distinction of gamma band is important because it is widely documented that visual stimuli such as drifting gratings or moving bars, in which the main signal is contrast, increase spectral power in V1 over a broad range of frequencies between 20 and 90 Hz. Saleem et al. shows that contrast stimuli have opposite effects in the two frequency bands, increasing broadband and decreasing narrowband oscillation amplitude. This distinction alone suggests very different functions for the two oscillations. Across the depth of V1, Saleem et al. find that the power of narrowband oscillations is higher in layer 4, the site of termination of LGN inputs. They then record from LGN and find a subset of neurons with strong rhythmicity at 60 Hz. As in cortex, narrowband oscillatory power in LGN spikes is increased by luminance and decreased by contrast. More importantly, narrowband oscillations in LGN are coherent among neighbor neurons, also shown by Storchi et al., which likely amplifies their excitatory driving effect in cortex. Indeed, intracellular recordings from L2/3 by Saleem et al. reveal rhythmic excitatory, but not inhibitory, postsynaptic currents. Inhibitory currents are the hallmark of cortical gamma oscillations generated by the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Cardin, 2016Cardin J.A. J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10496-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) rhythmicity in L4 is not changed when V1 is silenced. Together with the optogenetic results mentioned above, Saleem et al.’s data strongly suggest that narrowband oscillations in cortex are inherited from thalamus. Even though this separation of frequency bands is clear in Saleem et al., such dichotomy is far from clear in the literature. For example, Welle and Contreras, 2016Welle C.G. Contreras D. J. Neurophysiol. 2016; 115: 1821-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar showed that in anesthetized mice, the spontaneous gamma oscillations that occur when the mice face a uniform gray screen are broadband (bandwidth ∼20 Hz), while oscillations elicited by drifting gratings have a narrow band of ∼10 Hz, and for both the peak frequency was 25 Hz. Thus, while the peak is consistent with the narrowband frequencies reported for anesthetized mice in in the two studies discussed here, the oscillatory bandwidths are inverted with respect to Saleem et al. Similarly, a study in anesthetized cats (Castelo-Branco et al., 1998Castelo-Branco M. Neuenschwander S. Singer W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6395-6410PubMed Google Scholar) showed that optimally oriented drifting gratings triggered narrowband (∼10 Hz) oscillations in visual cortex with peaks between 30 and 60 Hz. Uniform stimuli also triggered narrowband oscillations, although with peaks in a higher frequency range, between 60 and 120 Hz. Furthermore, in the LGN and retina, both the drifting gratings and the uniform stimuli triggered narrowband oscillations in the high frequency range. Thus, in the cat visual cortex, the narrowband oscillatory response to uniform stimuli are in agreement with the results of both Saleem and Storchi, but the broadband response to gratings differs from that shown by Saleem et al. Finally, by measuring the relative times of LGN and V1 spikes in the cat, Castelo-Branco et al. concluded that the oscillations in the high frequency range are mostly feedforward, i.e., they originate in LGN, while oscillations in the lower frequency range are of cortical origin. This is in full agreement with the optogenetic results in Saleem et al. Thus, one conclusion is common between the cat and mouse studies: cortical and subcortical (retina-LGN) circuits seem to possess independent oscillatory mechanisms for narrow and wideband oscillations. Locomotion strongly modulates the magnitude of narrowband oscillations in mouse visual cortex (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by Saleem et al. (see the remarkable similarity between Figure 1B in Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, with Figure 1B, left panel, in Saleem et al., 2017Saleem A.B. Lien A.D. Krumin M. Haider B. Román M. Aslı Aya R. Reinhold K. Busse L. Carandini M. Harris K.D. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, locomotion increases pupil diameter, letting more background light into the eye. Saleem et al. demonstrate that the effects of movement and luminance can occur independently of each other by reproducing the effect of movement during mydriasis with anticholinergics. Storchi et al. shows for the first time that, also in LGN, unconstrained movement increases sustained firing rates and narrowband oscillations, in contrast to previous work by Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, who reported no movement-related increase in LGN activity in head-fixed animals. However, movement-related LGN firing rate changes occur only during response to light, i.e., movement does not increase LGN firing rates in the dark. This is an interesting observation that remains to be tested in visual cortex. Locomotion-driven narrowband activity is attributed to cortical circuits under conditions of elevated neuromodulatory drive. Even in the absence of visual stimulation, narrowband oscillations in V1 can be induced by increased arousal (Vinck et al., 2015Vinck M. Batista-Brito R. Knoblich U. Cardin J.A. Neuron. 2015; 86: 740-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) or optogenetic stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.M. Hoy J.L. Bonci A. Wilbrecht L. Stryker M.P. Niell C.M. Neuron. 2014; 83: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which is thought to increase cholinergic activation in cortex via the basal forebrain (Pinto et al., 2013Pinto L. Goard M.J. Estandian D. Xu M. Kwan A.C. Lee S.H. Harrison T.C. Feng G. Dan Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the retinal-thalamic-cortical pathway, cortical narrowband oscillations may have additional subcortical and cortical mechanisms. Does luminance have a role in the transmission of visual information? The study by Storchi et al. measured the effect of changing narrowband coherence on the representation of simple visual stimuli, as measured by pooling neuronal responses together, which is one form of coding. By shuffling trial-level responses, power in the narrowband is reduced while firing rate is maintained, and visual responsiveness to stimuli is slightly diminished. They propose that narrowband coherence enhances visual information transmission by enhancing the pooling of neuronal responses. In contrast, the study by Saleem et al. shows that when mice navigate virtual reality, i.e., a high-contrast signal, the amplitude of narrowband decreases, as expected from their previous results with drifting gratings. Rather than enhancing the transfer of visual information, Saleem et al. propose that narrow- and wideband represent two different channels of information transfer for different types of visual information. Future studies must resolve how luminance signals are coded in parallel with contrast signals and how they influence each other along the visual pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2575879572,"It is well known that iron overload promotes alcoholic liver injury, but the doses of iron or alcohol used in studies are usually able to induce liver injury independently. Little attention has been paid to the coexistence of low alcohol consumption and mild iron overload when either of them is insufficient to cause obvious liver damage, although this situation is very common among some people. We studied the interactive effects and the underlining mechanism of mild doses of iron and alcohol on liver injury in a mouse model. Forty eight male Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, iron (300 mg/kg iron dextran, i.p.), alcohol (2 g/kg/day ethanol for four weeks i.g.), and iron plus alcohol group. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and blood and livers were collected for biochemical analysis. Protein nitration level in liver tissue was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Although neither iron overload nor alcohol consumption at our tested doses can cause severe liver injury, it was found that co-administration of the same doses of alcohol and iron resulted in liver injury and hepatic dysfunction, accompanied with elevated ratio of NADH/NAD+, reduced antioxidant ability, increased oxidative stress, and subsequent elevated protein nitration level. Further study revealed that triosephosphate isomerase, an important glycolytic enzyme, was one of the targets to be oxidized and nitrated, which was responsible for its inactivation. These data indicate that even under low alcohol intake, a certain amount of iron overload can cause significant liver oxidative damage, and the modification of triosephosphate isomerasemight be the important underlining mechanism of hepatic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2577959154,"Purpose Tibial radiolucent lines (RL) are commonly seen in cemented unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR). In the postoperative course, they can be misinterpreted as signs of loosening, thus leading to unnecessary revision. Since 2004, a cementless OUKR is available. First studies and registry data have shown equally good clinical results of cementless OUKR compared to the cemented version and a significantly reduced incidence of RL in cementless implants. Methods This single-centre retrospective cohort study includes the first 30 UKR (27 patients) implanted between 2007 and 2009 with a mean follow-up of 5 years. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the OKS, AKS, range of movement (ROM) and level of pain (VAS). Standard radiologic evaluation was performed at three months, one and five years after surgery. The results five years after implantation were compared to a group of 27 cemented Oxford UKR (OUKR) in a matched-pair-analysis. Results Tibial RL were seen in 10 implants three months after operation, which significantly decreased to five after one year and to three after five years (p = 0.02). RL did not have a significant influence on revision (p = 1.0) or clinical outcome after five years. RL were always partial, never progressive and strictly limited to the tibia. There was no significant difference in the incidence of tibial RL five years after implantation between cemented and cementless implants (cemented: 4, cementless: 3, p = 1.0). Conclusions After cementless implantation RL were limited to the tibia, partial and never progressive. During short term follow-up the incidence of RL decreased significantly. RL seem to have no influence on clinical outcome and revision."
https://openalex.org/W2578145829,"Prenatal exposure to inflammation results in hypertension during adulthood but the mechanisms are not well understood. Maternal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alters interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in the fetal environment. As reported in many recent studies, IL-6 regulates DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) through the transcription factor friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1). The present study explores the role of intrarenal DNMTs during development of hypertension induced by prenatal exposure to LPS. Pregnant rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: control, LPS, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, a NF-κB inhibitor), and the combination of LPS and PDTC. Expression of IL-6, Fli-1, TNF-α, DNMT1 and DNMT3B was significantly increased in the offspring of LPS-treated rats. Global DNA methylation level of renal cortex also increased dramatically in rat offspring of the LPS group. Prenatal PDTC administration reversed the increases in gene expression and global DNA methylation level. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to LPS may result in changes of intrarenal DNMTs through the IL-6/Fli-1 pathway and TNF-α, which probably involves hypertension in offspring due to maternal exposure to inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2579259641,"A promising alternative vaccine candidate to reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases is the protein antigen PspA (Pneumococcal surface protein A). Since concomitant colonization with two or more pneumococcal strains is very common in children, we aimed to determine if immunization with PspA would be able to control co-colonization. We evaluated nasal immunization with recombinant PspA (rPspA) in a model of co-colonization with two strains expressing different PspAs. Mice were immunized intranasally with rPspAs from clades 1 to 4 (rPspA1, rPspA2, rPspA3 or rPspA4) using whole-cell pertussis vaccine (wP) as adjuvant. Mice were then challenged with a mixture of two serotype 6B isolates St491/00 (PspA1) and St472/96 (PspA4). Immunization with rPspA1+wP and rPspA4+wP reduced colonization with both strains and the mixture of rPspA1+rPspA4+wP induced greater reduction than a single antigen. Immunization rPspA1+rPspA4+wP also reduced colonization when challenge experiments were performed with a mixture of isolates of serotypes 6B (PspA3) and 23F (PspA2). Furthermore, none of the tested formulations led to a pronounced increase in colonization of one isolate over the other, showing that the vaccine strategy would not favor replacement. Interestingly, the adjuvant wP by itself already led to some reduction in pneumococcal colonization, indicating the induction of non-specific immune responses. Anti-rPspA IgG was observed in serum, nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, whereas animals inoculated with formulations containing the adjuvant wP (with or without rPspA) showed higher levels of IL-6 and KC in NW and increase in tissue macrophages, B cells and CD4+T cells in BALF."
https://openalex.org/W2577678461,"Residual stress arisen in fabrication process of Double-Ceramic-Layer Thermal Barrier Coating System (DCL-TBCs) has a significant effect on its quality and reliability. In this work, based on the practical fabrication process of DCL-TBCs and the force and moment equilibrium, a theoretical model was proposed at first to predict residual stress generation in its fabrication process, in which the temperature dependent material properties of DCL-TBCs were incorporated. Then, a Finite Element method (FEM) has been carried out to verify our theoretical model. Afterwards, some important geometric parameters for DCL-TBCs, such as the thickness ratio of stabilized Zirconia (YSZ, ZrO2-8%Y2O3) layer to Lanthanum Zirconate (LZ, La2Zr2O7) layer, which is adjustable in a wide range in the fabrication process, have a remarkable effect on its performance, therefore, the effect of this thickness ratio on residual stress generation in the fabrication process of DCL-TBCs has been systematically studied. In addition, some thermal spray treatment, such as the pre-heating treatment, its effect on residual stress generation has also been studied in this work. It is found that, the final residual stress mainly comes from the cooling down process in the fabrication of DCL-TBCs. Increasing the pre-heating temperature can obviously decrease the magnitude of residual stresses in LZ layer, YSZ layer and substrate. With the increase of the thickness ratio of YSZ layer to LZ layer, magnitudes of residual stresses arisen in LZ layer and YSZ layer will increase while residual stress in substrate will decrease."
https://openalex.org/W2575281061,"Dinoflagellates have been shown to express miRNA by bioinformatics and RNA blot (Northern) analyses. However, it is not yet known if miRNAs are able to alter gene expression in this class of organisms. We have assessed the possibility that miRNA may mediate circadian regulation of gene expression in the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum using the Luciferin Binding Protein (LBP) as a specific example. LBP is a good candidate for regulation by miRNA since mRNA levels are constant over the daily cycle while protein synthesis is restricted by the circadian clock to a period of several hours at the start of the night phase. The transcriptome contains a potential DICER and an ARGONAUTE, suggesting the machinery for generating miRNAs is present. Furthermore, a probe directed against an abundant Symbiodinium miRNA cross reacts on Northern blots. However, L. polyedrum has no small RNAs detectable by ethidium bromide staining, even though higher plant miRNAs run in parallel are readily observed. Illumina sequencing of small RNAs showed that the majority of reads did not have a match in the L. polyedrum transcriptome, and those that did were almost all sense strand mRNA fragments. A direct search for 18-26 nucleotide long RNAs capable of forming duplexes with a 2 base 3' overhang detected 53 different potential miRNAs, none of which was able to target any of the known circadian regulated genes. Lastly, a microscopy-based test to assess synthesis of the naturally fluorescent LBP in single cells showed that neither double-stranded nor antisense lbp RNA introduced into cells by microparticle bombardment prior to the time of LBP synthesis were able to reduce the amount of LBP produced. Taken together, our results indicate that circadian control of protein synthesis in L. polyedrum is not mediated by miRNAs."

To explore the latent mechanism, male wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats (WTR) and transgenic rats harboring the hKLK1 gene (TGR) were fed to 4 and 18 months old and divided into four groups: young WTR (yWTR) as the control, aged WTR (aWTR), aged TGR (aTGR) and aged TGRs with HOE140 (aTGRH). Erectile function of all rats was evaluated by cavernous nerve electrostimulation method and measured by the ratio of intracavernous pressure/ mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) in rats. Expression levels of cAMP and cGMP were assessed, and related signaling pathways were detected by western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Our experiment results showed erectile function of the aWTR group and aTGRH group was lower compared with those of other two groups. Also, expression levels of cAMP and cGMP were significantly lower than those of other two groups. Moreover, expressions of related signaling pathways including DDAH/ADMA/NOS/cGMP and COX-2/PTGIS/cAMP were also downregulated in the corpus cavernosum of rats in aWTR group. Our finding revealed hKLK1 played a protective role in age-related ED.

https://openalex.org/W2578778973,"Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (Vipp1) is thought to play an important role both in thylakoid biogenesis and chloroplast envelope maintenance during stress. Vipp1 is conserved in photosynthetic organisms and forms a high homo-oligomer complex structure that may help sustain the membrane integrity of chloroplasts. This study cloned two novel VIPP1 genes from Triticum urartu and named them TuVipp1 and TuVipp2. Both proteins shared high identity with the homologous proteins AtVipp1 and CrVipp1. TuVipp1 and TuVipp2 were expressed in various organs of common wheat, and both genes were induced by light and various stress treatments. Purified TuVipp1 and TuVipp2 proteins showed secondary and advanced structures similar to those of the homologous proteins. Similar to AtVipp1, TuVipp1 is a chloroplast target protein. Additionally, TuVipp1 was able to rescue the phenotypes of pale leaves, lethality, and disordered chloroplast structures of AtVipp1 (-/-) mutant lines. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TuVipp1 and TuVipp2 are functional proteins in chloroplasts in wheat and may be critical for maintaining the chloroplast envelope under stress and membrane biogenesis upon photosynthesis."

Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 409-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar reveal a critical role for the AMPA receptor subunit GluA3 in cerebellar synaptic plasticity and motor learning in mice. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at glutamatergic synapses are extensively studied forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity that are widely regarded as key mechanisms for learning and memory, and deficits in LTP and LTD are linked to many neurological and mental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, and Alzheimer disease (Henley and Wilkinson, 2016Henley J.M. Wilkinson K.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms governing these forms of plasticity are a subject of intensive investigation. At the core of this research is the involvement of the AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs), because these receptors are the principal mediator of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS and since considerable evidence has accumulated that changes in the properties and/or the number of AMPARs are critically involved in the expression of major forms of both LTP and LTD at many central synapses. However, the extent to which these receptors, and their composite subunits, mediate these changes remains controversial (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2013; 80: 704-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, Henley and Wilkinson, 2016Henley J.M. Wilkinson K.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). AMPARs are heteromeric complexes consisting of various combinations of four different subunits (GluA1–4). The mechanisms of LTP and LTD have been mainly studied at the excitatory synapses between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Here, a large body of evidence links GluA1-containing AMPARs with LTP and GluA2-containing AMPARs with LTD. In contrast, little is known about the possible role of GluA3-containing AMPARs in synaptic plasticity. Global genetic deletion of GluA3 produces no clear effect on LTP or LTD in the hippocampus, suggesting that this subunit may play little or no role (Meng et al., 2003Meng Y. Zhang Y. Jia Z. Neuron. 2003; 39: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, it is known that GluA3 is present at many central synapses and contributes to the formation of functional AMPARs, and that mutations in the GluA3 gene are linked to a number of brain disorders (e.g., Wu et al., 2007Wu Y. Arai A.C. Rumbaugh G. Srivastava A.K. Turner G. Hayashi T. Suzuki E. Jiang Y. Zhang L. Rodriguez J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18163-18168Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role for this subunit in brain function. However, whether the GluA3 subunit regulates synaptic plasticity and behavior remains elusive. In this issue of Neuron, Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017Gutierrez-Castellanos N. Da Silva-Matos C.M.

Compared to GluA1 KO (Zamanillo et al., 1999Zamanillo D. Sprengel R. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Kaiser K.M. Köster H.J. Borchardt T. Worley P. et al.Science. 1999; 284: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and GluA2 KO (Jia et al., 1996Jia Z. Agopyan N. Miu P. Xiong Z. Henderson J. Gerlai R. Taverna F.A. Velumian A. MacDonald J. Carlen P. et al.Neuron. 1996; 17: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) mice, which show deficits in both basal synaptic function and behavior, including severe motor deficits in the case of GluA2, the GluA3 KO mice appear more normal (Meng et al., 2003Meng Y. Zhang Y. Jia Z. Neuron. 2003; 39: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), providing a useful model for studying their role in CNS function. First, the authors demonstrated that GluA3 KO mice were severely impaired in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) phase-reversal adaptation, a well-established cerebellum-dependent motor learning paradigm, in which the mice learns to shift the phase of their VOR following sinusoidal visuovestibular mismatch stimulation (Gao et al., 2012Gao Z. van Beugen B.J. De Zeeuw C.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 619-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GluA1 KO mice were not altered in this test. This finding is rather surprising given that GluA1 is actually more highly expressed than GluA3 in the cerebellum and that much of early work, primarily from the hippocampus, indicates the critical involvement of GluA1, but not GluA3, in declarative memory (Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). These results suggest an essential role of GluA3 in cerebellum-dependent behavior. To determine the cellular basis for the motor learning defects in GluA3 KO mice, the authors then examined synaptic function in Purkinje cells (PCs). Early studies show that synaptic plasticity of PCs is important for motor learning (Gao et al., 2012Gao Z. van Beugen B.J. De Zeeuw C.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 619-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). They recorded spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of PCs in cerebellar slices and found that both the amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs were significantly lower in GluA3 KO, but not GluA1 KO, compared to wild-type (WT) control. In GluA1/3 double KO mice, mEPSC events were virtually absent. These results suggest that the majority of synaptic responses in PCs are derived from either GluA1- or GluA3-containing AMPARs. To examine synaptic plasticity, LTD and LTP were then compared using evoked EPSCs at the parallel fiber (PF) to PC (PF-PC) synapse. While the magnitude of LTD was not altered in GluA1 KO or GluA3 KO mice, LTP was abolished in GluA3 KO mice, but remained intact in GluA1 KO mice. Therefore, while both GluA1 and GluA3 contribute to basal synaptic transmission, GluA3 is uniquely indispensable for LTP at the PF-PC synapse. Notably, previous studies have established that GluA2 is critical for LTD at this synapse (Gao et al., 2012Gao Z. van Beugen B.J. De Zeeuw C.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 619-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying GluA3-dependent LTP at the PF-PC synapse, the authors then switched to a form of chemically induced synaptic potentiation by application of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (FSK). Again, this form of LTP was abolished in GluA3 KO, but remained intact in GluA1 KO mice, suggesting that GluA3-mediated potentiation is downstream of cAMP signaling. In the next series of experiments, the authors combined imaging, single-channel conductance analysis, and pharmacological inhibitors to demonstrate that the GluA3-mediated synaptic potentiation by FSK was independent of synaptic insertion or lateral diffusion of GluA3-containing AMPARs, but involved an increase in the channel properties of the receptors. Specifically, they found an increase in the time that the channels occupied higher conductance substrates leading to an overall increase in single-channel conductance. Interestingly, this FSK-induced synaptic plasticity did not require PKA, but depended on Epac, an exchange factor directly activated by cAMP. Activation of Epac was also sufficient to induce GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation. Is the FSK induced synaptic potentiation relevant to LTP at the PF-PC synapse and motor learning? To test this, the authors examined the role of Epac on LTP induced by tetanic stimulation. As predicted, the LTP was blocked by an Epac inhibitor. In addition, Epac activation enhanced basal response and occluded tetanically induced LTP. Consistent with the effect on LTP, inhibition of Epac in WT mice significantly impaired motor learning in the VOR phase-reversal adaptation test, similar to the deficits observed in GluA3 KO mice. Finally, to confirm that GluA3 in the PCs is actually responsible for the GluA3-mediated LTP and motor learning, the authors utilized a mouse strain where GluA3 was deleted specifically in the PCs using a Cre-LoxP method. Similar to the global GluA3 KO mice, these PC-specific KO mice also exhibited defective learning in the VOR phase-reversal adaptation test, indicating the critical importance of GluA3 in PCs for motor learning. The study by Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017Gutierrez-Castellanos N. Da Silva-Matos C.M. Zhou K. Canto C.B. Renner M.C. Koene L.M.C. Ozyildirim O. Sprengel R. Helmut W. Kessels H.W. De Zeeuw C.I. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 409-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar is of considerable significance for a number of reasons. First, it reveals for the first time a major role for GluA3 in both basal synaptic function and synaptic plasticity in cerebellar PCs. This is in marked contrast to CA1 pyramidal neurons where GluA3 appears to contribute little to basal synaptic transmission, LTP, or LTD (Meng et al., 2003Meng Y. Zhang Y. Jia Z. Neuron. 2003; 39: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rather, GluA1 is the dominant subunit for LTP and GluA2 for LTD. Second, this study indicates that GluA3-mediated LTP is associated with changes in the channel properties, but not receptor trafficking. Previous work has identified an increase in AMPAR single-channel conductance as an underlying mechanism of LTP at CA1 synapses (Benke et al., 1998Benke T.A. Lüthi A. Isaac J.T. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1998; 393: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), but whether this is due to a modification of the properties of AMPARs already at the synapse or the synaptic insertion of higher conductance AMPARs is unknown. At the PF-PC synapse, the effects appear to be due to a direct modification of AMPARs to increase single-channel conductance. Third, GluA3-mediated channel property changes require cAMP, but surprisingly are independent of PKA. This is again distinct from the CA1 synapse where direct phosphorylation of GluA1 is important to alter the channel conductance and/or trafficking of AMPARs (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 2013; 80: 704-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GluA3-dependent LTP requires Epac, but how this protein modulates the channel properties of GluA3 containing AMPARs remains to be investigated. Finally, the study reveals that GluA3, not GluA1, plays a key role in motor learning, in contrast to the acquisition of declarative memories such as fear memory where GluA1 is essential (Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In summary, the study by Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017Gutierrez-Castellanos N. Da Silva-Matos C.M. Zhou K. Canto C.B. Renner M.C. Koene L.M.C. Ozyildirim O. Sprengel R. Helmut W. Kessels H.W. De Zeeuw C.I. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 409-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar has provided compelling evidence that GluA3 plays an essential role in LTP at the PF-PC synapse and motor learning (Figure 1). This GluA3-dependent synaptic plasticity is distinct from the GluA1-driven LTP in the hippocampus in that it involves exclusively enhanced channel conductance, but not trafficking, of AMPARs. It would be interesting to know whether this form of plasticity also exists in other regions of the brain. Another outstanding question is how the activation of cAMP-Epac signaling leads to changes in the channel properties of AMPARs. It would also be interesting to know whether this mechanism interacts with GluA2-mediated receptor trafficking shown to occur during LTD at this synapse. Cleary there is much still to do, but the findings of Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017Gutierrez-Castellanos N. Da Silva-Matos C.M. Zhou K. Canto C.B. Renner M.C. Koene L.M.C. Ozyildirim O.

There is a need to develop new and safe adjuvants, because some existing vaccines have low immunogenicity among certain patient groups. In this study, SBP, a hepatitis B surface antigen binding protein that was discovered through screening a human liver cDNA expression library, was introduced into hepatitis B vaccine. A good laboratory practice, non-clinical safety evaluation was performed to identify the side effects of both SBP and SBP-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine. The results indicate that SBP could enhance the HBsAg-specific immune response, thus increasing the protection provided by the hepatitis B vaccine. The safety data obtained here warrant further investigation of SBP as a vaccine adjuvant."
https://openalex.org/W2575624070,"Small antibody mimetics, or alternative binding proteins (ABPs), extend and complement antibody functionality with numerous applications in research, diagnostics and therapeutics. Given the superiority of ABPs, the last two decades have witnessed development of dozens of alternative protein scaffolds (APSs) for the design of ABPs. Proteins from extremophiles with their high structural stability are especially favorable for APS design. Here, a 10X mutant of the 50S ribosomal protein L35Ae from hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus horikoshii has been probed as an APS. A phage display library of L35Ae 10X was generated by randomization of its three CDR-like loop regions (repertoire size of 2×108). Two L35Ae 10X variants specific to a model target, the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), were isolated from the resulting library using phage display. The affinity of these variants (L4 and L7) to HEL ranges from 0.10 μM to 1.6 μM, according to surface plasmon resonance data. While L4 has 1-2 orders of magnitude lower affinity to HEL homologue, bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA), L7 is equally specific to HEL and BLA. The reference L35Ae 10X is non-specific to both HEL and BLA. L4 and L7 are more resistant to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride compared to the reference L35Ae 10X (mid-transition concentration is higher by 0.1-0.5 M). Chemical crosslinking experiments reveal an increased propensity of L4 and L7 to multimerization. Overall, the CDR-like loop regions of L35Ae 10X represent a proper interface for generation of functional ABPs. Hence, L35Ae is shown to extend the growing family of protein scaffolds dedicated to the design of novel binding proteins."

Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 362-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar provide critical insight into the dynamics of lncRNA expression, function, and mechanism during oligodendrocyte development and after injury. One of the primary tenets of molecular biology is the transcription of mRNA from DNA and the subsequent translation of mRNA into protein. Since the inception of the “central dogma” over 50 years ago, delineating the mechanisms that oversee both transcription and translation have remained fundamental questions in the field of biology that have far-reaching implications in health and disease. Studies on gene transcription have identified a plethora of regulatory factors that can be broadly grouped into three key categories: (1) basal regulatory factors that associate with RNA polymerase, (2) transcription factors that recognize specific DNA motifs, and (3) epigenetic modification of chromatin, which influences DNA accessibility. Over the past two decades, it has become appreciated that there are additional regulatory layers associated with gene transcription, including microRNAs and other classes of non-protein-coding RNA molecules. As with most scientific disciplines, advances in technology are coupled with a deeper, and often unexpected, understanding of the underlying complexities of the associated systems. Indeed, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the human genome revealed that only one-fifth of the total transcription occurs in protein-coding genes, suggesting an abundance of non-coding RNA species in the mammalian transcriptome. Such high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome led to the discovery of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which have been implicated in the regulation of nearly all aspects of gene transcription, including the basal transcriptional apparatus, microRNA regulation, and epigenetic phenomenon. Given that lncRNAs comprise a new layer of transcriptional regulation, recent efforts have focused on the identification of tissue and lineage specific cohorts. Moreover, because many developmental processes have clearly defined transcriptional inputs and subsequent cellular outputs, understanding how lncRNAs influence cell-fate decisions has provided a framework for delineating how they interface with these associated transcriptional mechanisms. The developing brain is a particularly rich source of lncRNAs where their expression is dynamically regulated and there is increasing evidence that they directly contribute to the production of diverse cell types during central nervous system (CNS) development (Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014Fatica A. Bozzoni I. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, Perry and Ulitsky, 2016Perry R.B. Ulitsky I.

Recent efforts have focused on utilizing cell-type- or developmental-stage-specific transcriptome data for identifying and functionally characterizing lncRNAs during neural precursor, neuronal, or oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage differentiation. Mercer et al., 2010Mercer T.R. Qureshi I.A. Gokhan S. Dinger M.E. Li G. Mattick J.S. Mehler M.F. BMC Neurosci. 2010; 11: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar utilized custom microarray analysis to define cohorts of lncRNAs that exhibit dynamic expression patterns during the neuronal-glial fate transition and during oligodendrocyte lineage specification. Dong et al., 2015Dong X. Chen K. Cuevas-Diaz Duran R. You Y. Sloan S.A. Zhang Y. Zong S. Cao Q. Barres B.A. Wu J.Q. PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005669Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the lncRNA transcriptome of neuronal and glial cells in the mouse brain. Furthermore, they identified an lncRNA, lnc-OPC, which is specifically expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), and found that it contributes to the early specification of OPCs from neural stem cells. These studies and others highlight the importance of better understanding the biology of lncRNA regulation and function. In this issue of Neuron, He et al., 2017He D. Wang J. Lu Y. Deng Y. Zhao C. Xu L. Chen Y. Hu Y.C. Zhou W. Lu Q.R. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 362-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar catalog the repertoire of lncRNA expression across the various stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the CNS and have well-defined stages of lineage development and associated transcriptional mechanisms, making them an ideal CNS lineage in which to identify dynamic lncRNA expression profiles. Paired-ended NGS and de novo transcriptome reconstruction were utilized to profile lncRNAs during oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation, uncovering more than 500 unannotated lncRNA transcripts (lncOLs) across OL lineage differentiation. Subsequent profiling of epigenetic patterns associated with these lncOLs revealed three previously identified lncRNAs, lncOL1–lncOL3, and three novel lncRNAs, lncOL4–lncOL6. Further analysis determined that their expression is dynamic over the course of OL lineage differentiation. These efforts provided a more comprehensive annotation of lncRNA expression across the course of OL lineage specification and maturation. These restricted expression patterns of lncOLs begs the question: what is the functional role of these lncOLs in the CNS? While knockout (KO) mouse models provide a powerful means to investigate lncRNA function, to date, very few lncRNA mutant mice have been generated as lncRNA structure, and potential overlap with other transcripts complicate gene manipulation and analysis. Furthermore, several lncRNA knockout mouse lines have yielded modest phenotypes. He et al., 2017He D. Wang J. Lu Y. Deng Y. Zhao C. Xu L. Chen Y. Hu Y.C. Zhou W. Lu Q.R. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 362-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar tackled this challenge by combining a battery of in vitro and in vivo gene manipulation approaches to address the function of an OL-restricted lncRNA, lncOL1. Gain-of-function studies both in vitro and in the developing mouse brain indicate that lncOL1 is sufficient for OL differentiation while whole mouse CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knockout of lncOL1 led to defects in OL differentiation and myelination. Strikingly, this same phenomenon was observed in a demyelinating injury model, indicating that lncOL1 also contributes to myelin regeneration and implicating it in myelin-associated neurological disorders. However, under both normal and injury conditions, myelination did eventually recover suggesting that lncOL1 is important for the timing of OL differentiation and myelination. Indeed, this would be consistent with suggested roles for lncRNAs as fine tuners of differentiation or may indicate some functional redundancy with other factors. Several molecular mechanisms utilized by lncRNAs to regulate transcription and cellular differentiation has been described (Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014Fatica A. Bozzoni I. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). These mechanisms often employ epigenetic regulation through the PRC2 complex that induces gene silencing via histone methylation and deacetylation (Davidovich and Cech, 2015Davidovich C. Cech T.R. RNA. 2015; 21: 2007-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). He et al., 2017He D. Wang J. Lu Y. Deng Y. Zhao C. Xu L. Chen Y. Hu Y.C. Zhou W. Lu Q.R. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 362-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar go on to demonstrate that Suz12-containing PRC2 complex is required to silence the OPC transcriptional program and promote OL differentiation. Moreover, lncOL1 function is inhibited by loss of Suz12 activity indicating that its ability to influence OL differentiation requires the presence of Suz12-PRC2 complex. These results are consistent with recent reports where PRC2-mediated silencing contributes to the differentiation of OLs (Emery and Lu, 2015Emery B. Lu Q.R. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020461Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Profiling of lncOL1-KO OLs revealed a derepression of Suz12 target genes (OPC program), indicating that lncOL1 is critical for the silencing of the Suz12 target genes. In addition, RNA immunoprecipitation demonstrated that lncOL1 and Suz12 form a complex, while LncOL1-KO OLs failed to recruit Suz12 to its target promoters. Put together, a model emerges where lncOL1 promotes OL differentiation by interacting with Suz12 and recruiting Suz12 to its target genes (Figure 1). Previous studies have supported a role for lncRNAs in a number of developmental processes. In a technical and bioinformatics tour-de-force, He et al., 2017He D. Wang J. Lu Y. Deng Y. Zhao C. Xu L. Chen Y. Hu Y.C. Zhou W. Lu Q.R. Neuron. 2017; 93 (this issue): 362-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar provide a more comprehensive view of the dynamics of lncRNA expression and a much deeper mechanistic understanding of how lncOL1 contributes to the timing of myelination. Additional facets of its function are reflected in their observation that lncOL1, while not expressed in adult spinal cord, is re-expressed after demyelinating injury and important for proper timing of remyelination. Given the function of lncOL1 in OL differentiation and myelination, it is interesting to speculate that lncOLs may be harnessed for therapeutic intervention, as the restricted spatio-temporal expression patterns of lncRNAs make them attractive therapeutic targets. Indeed, lncRNAs are currently used as diagnostic and prognostic markers for several cancers (Huarte, 2015Huarte M. Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Mutations in a number of lncRNA loci have also been associated with an array of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and autism (Hart and Goff, 2016Hart R.P. Goff L.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2016; 55: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It may also be important to understand the lncRNA-protein interactions, as this may provide an additional avenue for therapeutic interventions. This study and others provide a roadmap for future investigations aimed at harnessing this new transcriptional layer in the context of the labyrinth that is cell lineage development. Clearly, we have just begun to scratch the surface of understanding how lncRNAs influence cellular behaviors and associated diseases. Given that lncRNA expression is often restricted to specific cell lineages or “states,” one can imagine that they may also demonstrate dynamic expression and function under different physiological conditions in the adult or in an “activity”-dependent manner across diverse brain regions. Finally, given that lncRNAs comprise approximately 80% of the transcriptome, advances in NGS and bioinformatics may conjure up additional roles for this class of RNA outside of the realm of transcriptional regulation. lncRNA Functional Networks in Oligodendrocytes Reveal Stage-Specific Myelination Control by an lncOL1/Suz12 Complex in the CNSHe et al.NeuronDecember 29, 2016In BriefHe et al. describe an integrated transcriptional map of lncRNA networks at multiple stages during oligodendrocyte lineage progression and reveal a key lncRNA epigenetic circuitry through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes in control of CNS myelination and myelin repair.

https://openalex.org/W2578444905,"Animal pollinators and the plants they pollinate depend on networks of mutualistic partnerships and more broadly on the stability of such networks. Based mainly on insect-plant visitation networks, theory predicts that species that are most prone to extinction contribute the most to nestedness, however empirical tests are rare. We used a sunbird-tree visitation network within which were both extinction prone vs non extinction prone sunbird species to test the idea. We predicted that the extinction prone species would contribute the most to nestedness. Using local abundance as a proxy for extinction risk we considered that locally rare sunbird species, by virtue of their small population size and associated demographic stochasticity to be more at risk of extinction than the common species. Our network was not strongly nested and all sunbird species made similar contributions to nestedness, so that in our empirical test, extinction proneness did not predict contribution to nestedness. The consequences of this finding remain unclear. It may be that network theory based on plant-insect mutualisms is not widely applicable and does not work for tree- sunbird mutualistic networks. Alternatively it may be that our network was too small to provide results with any statistical power. Without doubt our study highlights the problems faced when testing network theory in the field; a plethora of ecological considerations can variously impact on results."
