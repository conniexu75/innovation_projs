https://openalex.org/W1998165633,"In our view, gene therapy may ameliorate some human genetic diseases in the future. For this reason, we believe that research directed at the development of techniques for gene therapy should continue. For the foreseeable future, however, we oppose any further attempts at gene therapy in human patients because (i) our understanding of such basic processes as gene regulation and genetic recombination in human cells is inadequate; (ii) our understanding of the details of the relation between the molecular defect and the disease state is rudimentary for essentially all genetic diseases; and (iii) we have no information on the short-range and long-term side effects of gene therapy. We therefore propose that a sustained effort be made to formulate a complete set of ethicoscientific criteria to guide the development and clinical application of gene therapy techniques. Such an endeavor could go a long way toward ensuring that gene therapy is used in humans only in those instances where it will prove beneficial, and toward preventing its misuse through premature application. Two recent papers have provided new demonstrations of directed genetic modification of mammalian cells. Munyon et al. (44) restored the ability to synthesize the enzyme thymidine kinase to thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cells by infection with ultraviolet-irradiated herpes simplex virus. In their experiments the DNA from herpes simplex virus, which contains a gene coding for thymidine kinase, may have formed a hereditable association with the mouse cells. Merril et al. (45) reported that treatment of fibroblasts from patients with galactosemia with exogenous DNA caused increased activity of a missing enzyme, alpha-D-galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase. They also provided some evidence that the change persisted after subculturing the treated cells. If this latter report can be confirmed, the feasibility of directed genetic modification of human cells would be clearly demonstrated, considerably enhancing the technical prospects for gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2087048220,"Synaptic potentials and changes in resting membrane potentials of superior cervical ganglia of the rabbit were measured in the presence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and agents that affect its metabolism. Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and its mono- and dibutyryl derivatives caused a hyperpolarization of the postganglionic neurons. Theophylline potentiated the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential that follows synaptic transmission, as well as the hyperpolarization of postganglionic neurons caused by exogenous dopamine. Conversely, prostaglandin E(1) inhibited both the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential and the dopamine-induced hyperpolarization. We hypothesize that the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential as well as the dopamine-induced hyperpolarization result from increased amounts of adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate in the postganglionic neurons. The dibutyryl derivative of guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate caused a depolarization of the postganglionic neurons, which is consistent with the possibility that guanosine 3'5'-monophosphate mediates synaptic transmission at muscarinic cholinergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1537719062,"Abstract An endogenous adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of an endogenous protein in extensively washed human erythrocyte ghosts has been studied. This system is unique in that it has been possible to determine many of the properties of this membrane-associated enzyme using its endogenous protein substrate instead of an added exogenous phosphate acceptor such as histone. In the presence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and [γ-32P]ATP maximum incorporation of 32P]phosphate was observed at pH 6.5. The concentration of cyclic AMP that gave one-half maximal stimulation was 0.23 µm. Other cyclic nucleotides would maximally stimulate [32P]phosphate incorporation but at much higher concentrations. The nucleoside triphosphates, GTP, UTP, and CTP, reduced the amount of [32P]phosphate incorporated from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of cyclic AMP and in its absence. The divalent cation, Mg2+, was required for activity, and in the presence of Ca2+ the enzyme was strongly inhibited. A cyclic AMP-binding protein also was present in extensively washed human erythrocyte ghosts. In the presence of Mg2+ the apparent dissociation constant for cyclic AMP was 3.3 nm. Fractionation of 32P-labeled human erythrocyte ghosts revealed that cyclic AMP stimulated incorporation into the protein fraction. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized 32P-labeled human erythrocyte ghosts showed that the phosphorylation of one or two classes of proteins was specifically increased in the presence of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1486325186,"Abstract Purification of the phospho-protein phosphatase of skeletal muscle which promotes the conversion of the phospho- (D or b) form to the dephospho- (I or a) form of glycogen synthetase (UDPG:glycogen α-4-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.I.II) was aided by the use of buffers which include manganese chloride. The Mn2+ (5 mm) appeared to stabilize the enzyme and to insure greater recovery from DEAE-cellulose chromatography than reported previously. The enzyme was purified more than 1,000-fold from the 78,000 x g supernatant of rabbit muscle homogenate. It was essentially free of phosphorylase and synthetase. Phosphatase activity was measured by two methods: (a) as the rate of conversion of glycogen synthetase-D to the I form (D to I conversion) and (b) as the rate of orthophosphate release from 32P-labeled synthetase-D (32Pi release). Inhibition of the phosphatase reaction (more than 50%) was found in the presence of F- (10 mm), Na2SO3 (1 mm), and Pi or PPi (0.2 mm). More than a 2-fold increase in phosphatase activity was found in the presence of divalent metal cations: Mn2+ g Ca2+ g Mg2+ (half-maximal concentration was 0.6 to 1.2 mm). Glucose-6-P (up to 1 mm) had no effect on the rate of 32Pi release, but increased about 2-fold the rate of D to I conversion (at 0.1 mm), as did galactose-6-P and glucosamine-6-P to a lesser extent. A glycogen concentration of 0.5 to 1.5 mg per ml was found to be optimal compared to the slower reaction rates found with greater or lesser concentrations. A histone phosphatase activity found in this preparation, measured using 32P-labeled histone phosphate as substrate, had properties similar to and was copurified with glycogen synthetase-D phosphatase. However, the above carbohydrate-type effectors of synthetase and synthetase-D phosphatase reactions were without effect on the rate of histone dephosphorylation. These findings suggest that these two phosphatase activities may reside in the same enzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W1585602885,"Abstract The terminal phosphate of ATP is incorporated into erythrocyte membrane polyphosphoinositides at the rate of 1.5 nmoles per min per mg of protein in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ and 0.5 mm ATP. The amount of membrane polyphosphoinositide monophosphate can be doubled in 30 min. Phosphorylation proceeds until the entire supply of membrane phosphatidylinositol is exhausted. Inhibition of incorporation by Ca2+ depends on the concentration of Mg2+ in the medium. Incorporation is also lower in the presence of detergent, although it may be restored to normal by the addition of exogenous phosphatidylinositol. An Arrhenius plot of reaction rate had two linear portions with a transition at 17°. As the amount of polyphosphoinositide in the membrane is increased, the amount of calcium bound is elevated. The lowest detectable binding site on the membrane (Kassoc 4 x 104 liters per mole) appears to be affected. Calcium bound at this site increases in a 1:1 molar ratio with increased polyphosphoinositide monophosphate. Phosphorylation of membrane protein is too low to account for the increase in calcium binding. Membranes with elevated polyphosphoinositide levels also have much higher Ca2+-ATPase activity than membranes with normal levels, although (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity is not increased. The data provide the first direct evidence that the higher inositides may be involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W2058473859,"Two experiments demonstrated that memory over an interval with relatively high amounts of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was inferior to memory over an interval with relatively high amounts of stage 4 sleep. The results suggest that, at least for humans, REM sleep does not facilitate memory consolidation and that stage 4 sleep may be beneficial to memory."
https://openalex.org/W1502292357,"Abstract The studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the transport of 16 amino acids by membrane vesicles prepared from Escherichia coli ML 308–225 exhibits properties similar to those found previously for respiration-linked β-galactoside transport. Concentrative uptake of all 16 amino acids is stimulated maximally by d-lactate and by the artificial electron donor system ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, and to a lesser extent by succinate, l-lactate, dl-α-hydroxybutyrate, and NADH. Competitive uptake and displacement studies indicate that the vesicles possess at least nine distinct amino acid uptake systems with the following substrate specificities: proline, lysine, glycine-alanine, serine-threonine, glutamic acid-aspartic acid, phenylalanine-tyrosine-tryptophan, histidine, leucine-isoleucine-valine, cysteine. In the presence of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, the initial rates of lysine, alanine, serine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, leucine, cysteine, and lactose transport by membrane vesicles are 42 to 102% of those exhibited by appropriately treated whole cells. Initial rates of d-lactate-dependent transport as a function of external amino acid concentration yield simple hyperbolic kinetics for all but four amino acids: histidine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine yield biphasic velocity curves. Apparent Km values determined for the amino acids are in general agreement with results reported for intact cells. Steady state levels of d-lactate-dependent amino acid accumulation vary with temperature. These levels represent a balance between rates of influx and efflux, which can be shifted readily from one steady state level to another by raising or lowering the temperature. Different amino acid transport systems exhibit different steady state temperature optima, ranging from 20°–35°. In contrast, temperature optima for the initial rate of uptake occur at the same temperature (45°) with nearly all of the transport systems, and are similar to the temperature optimum for d-lactic dehydrogenase. There is no relationship between rates of oxidation of electron donors by the membranes (NADH g d-lactate g succinate g dl-α-hydroxybutyrate g l-lactate) and the ability of these compounds to stimulate amino acid uptake. These results indicate that the site of energy coupling between respiration and amino acid transport lies between the primary dehydrogenase and cytochrome b1. Furthermore, the relative effectiveness of these electron donors in supporting uptake varies widely among the various transport systems. The d-lactate-coupled concentrative uptake of proline, lysine, alanine, threonine, aspartic acid, tyrosine, histidine, leucine, and cysteine is inhibited by anaerobiosis, by the electron transfer inhibitors cyanide, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, amytal, and oxamate, and by p-chloromercuribenzoate; inhibition by the latter compound is reversed by dithiothreitol. Furthermore, anaerobiosis, cyanide, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and amytal cause rapid efflux of the same amino acids from the intravesicular pool. Oxamate and p-chloromercuribenzoate, however, produce little or no efflux of accumulated amino acids. Moreover, p-chloromercuribenzoate blocks tyrosine exchange and cyanide-induced tyrosine efflux; in each case inhibition is reversed by dithiothreitol. Finally, cyanide-induced efflux of proline exhibits a Km for intramembranal proline which is 350 times higher than the Km determined for d-lactate-dependent uptake of external proline, whereas the Vmax values are the same for both processes. The findings presented are consistent with the conceptual model suggested for d-lactic dehydrogenase-coupled β-galactoside transport."
https://openalex.org/W1849424407,"Abstract Horseradish peroxidase forms spectroscopically distinct, reversible complexes with hydroxamic acids (R─CO─ NHOH), hydrazides (RCO─NHNH2), amides (RCONH2), and α-hydroxyketones (RCO─CH2OH). Binding of these compounds to the enzyme depends on the polar and steric character of R and the hydrogen bonding capacity of ─CO─ X─Y (X─Y = NH─OH, NH─NH2, NH─H, CH2OH). Hydroxamate anions and hydrazide cations do not associate with the enzyme. The dissociation constants (K1) for the enzyme-RCOXY complexes span seven orders of magnitude (K1 ∼ 0.3 to 2 x 10-7 m), the greatest affinity being shown by compounds with a planar, aromatic R group. This is attributed to an interaction of the R moiety at an apoprotein hydrophobic crevice. Spectrophotometric, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the association of horseradish peroxidase with hydroxamic acids entails a transition from a mixed spin state of the enzyme to a high spin derivative. The spectroscopic characteristics of enzyme-RCOXY complexes are similar, suggesting that X─Y substituents do not interact directly with the metal ion of the prosthetic group but perturb its environment. Analogous conclusions were drawn from (a) the parallelism between RCOXY affinities for manganic and ferric peroxidases which does not pertain to ligands (e.g. F-) substituting in the first coordination sphere of the metal ion and (b) the lack of pronounced spectroscopic changes in RCOXY-ferroperoxidase complexes. The association of peroxidase with hydroxamic acids is competitively inhibited by specific enzyme substrates (hydrogen donors), permitting the evaluation of so far unknown enzyme-(donor) substrate binding parameters (Ks). Such a competitive behavior also implies the proximity of RCOXY to the active site. RCOXY compounds influence heme-linked ionizations and ligand interchange reactions, e.g. they inhibit the formation of alkaline peroxidase and peroxidase-cyanide complex. With cyanide and RCOXY, ferriperoxidase gives tertiary complexes. Their formation occurs sequentially: enzyme (HCN)/⇌ enzyme-cyanide (RCOXY)/⇌ enzyme-cyanide·RCOXY."
https://openalex.org/W1615758853,"The covalently bound heme moiety in horse heart cytochrome c was cleaved from the polypeptide chain by reaction with silver sulfate in acidic solution. The apoprotein was extracted with acid acetone, treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to differential sedimentation to remove the heme moiety, protein bound silver, and polymerized apoprotein, respectively. Monomeric apocytochrome c has a sedimentation coefficient of 1.2 S, an intrinsic viscosity of 15.5 ml per g, and a large negative maximum in its circular dichroic spectrum at 199 nm. All 3 histidyl residues can be carboxymethylated, the phenolic ionization of all 4 tyrosyl residues is normal giving an apparent pK of 10.2, and the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the single tryptophanyl residue can be perturbed by addition of 20% ethylene glycol. These results are identical with those of unfolded cytochrome c and are characteristic of a polypeptide in a randomly coiled conformation. Therefore the heme-polypeptide interactions in cytochrome c must be essential to stabilization of the globular conformation of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510741760,"Rat liver sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) has been localized, both by activity measurement and by prosthetic group analyses, to the intermembrane space of mitochondria. The apparent activation of sulfite-dependent cytochrome c reduction by liver homogenates in the presence of detergents was not duplicated with either ferricyanide or oxygen as electron acceptor. This is presumably due to the inaccessibility of sulfite oxidase in its mitochondrial compartment to exogenous cytochrome c. Sulfite-cytochrome c reductase of rat liver mitochondria was found to have an identity different from either the rotenone-insensitive DPNH-cytochrome c reductase or succinate-cytochrome c reductase. Examination of rat liver mitochondria at -100° by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the EPR signal at g = 1.97, deriving from pentavalent molybdenum. The characteristic effect of pH on the shape of this signal identified it as that of the molybdenum center of sulfite oxidase. When rat liver mitochondria were treated with digitonin or dialyzed in hypotonic media the EPR signal was no longer observed. The signal was, however, restored by the addition of either sulfite or DPNH to the treated mitochondria. The enzyme was released into the nonparticulate aqueous phase by each of these treatments. The above observations have also been made with sulfite oxidase of chicken liver. Under anaerobiosis the cytochromes of rat liver mitochondria were reduced by sulfite to the same extent as by succinate. Addition of sulfite to digitonin solubilized aqueous extracts of mitochondria generated a cytochrome b5-like spectrum with features similar to that generated by sulfite on purified sulfite oxidase. Such a spectrum was not elicited by sulfite from particulate preparations corresponding to the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Aerobically, the oxidation of sulfite by hepatic mitochondria resulted in the esterification of inorganic phosphate with the ATP-sulfite ratio approaching unity and sulfite-O2 ratio of 2."
https://openalex.org/W1480375472,"Abstract ApoLp-Gln-II (or apoA-II), one of the two major apolipoproteins of human plasma high density lipoprotein, was isolated from a single female volunteer by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified apoprotein was shown to be homogeneous by immunoelectrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis. Distinctive features of the amino acid composition were the absence of histidine, arginine, and tryptophan. Reduction and carboxymethylation yielded 2 moles of S-carboxymethylcysteine per mole of intact apoLp-Gln-II. Few carboxymethyl groups could be added to apoLp-Gln-II prior to its reduction, indicating that cystine rather than cysteine was present in the intact apoprotein. This was confirmed by identification of cystine on enzymatic digestion of the intact apoprotein. Following reduction and S-carboxymethylation of apoLp-Gln-II, its molecular weight, as determined by gel filtration in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, decreased from 16,700 ± 300 S.E.M. to 8,950 ± 150 S.E.M., indicating that apoLp-Gln-II is composed of two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight. The two chains appeared to be identical by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in urea (pH 2.9 and 9.4), immunoelectrophoresis, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. No NH2-terminal amino acid could be demonstrated by the dansyl chloride or phenylisothiocyanate methods, but digestion of apoLp-Gln-II with pyrrolidonecarboxylyl peptidase released pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid. Carboxypeptidase A digestion released glutamine and threonine. The kinetics of release as well as the inability to demonstrate threonine on hydrazinolysis indicated that glutamine was the COOH-terminal amino acid and threonine was the penultimate residue. These studies indicate that apoLp-Gln-II is composed of two identical polypeptide chains connected by a single disulfide bridge. Each chain has NH2-terminal pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid and COOH-terminal glutamine. The composition of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated chains is: Cys(Cm)1, PCA1, Asp2, Asn1, Thr6, Glu8, Gln7, Pro4, Gly3, Ala5, Val6, Met1, Ile1, Leu8, Tyr4, Phe4, and Lys9. Each polypeptide chain contains 77 residues and has a molecular weight of 8690."

https://openalex.org/W1510248076,"Abstract Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase has been found to catalyze the reduction of a series of para-substituted benzaldehydes at markedly different rates. By steady state kinetic analysis, values of kh and kd have been obtained for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase reduction of p-Br-, p-Cl-, H-, p-CH3, p-CH3O-benzaldehyde by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide with deuterium in the nicotinamide 4-A position (NADD). Hammett plots of log kh and log kd versus σ+ are linear with p = 2.17 and 2.24, respectively. Since the p values are almost the same for both NADH and NADD reduction, the difference in the intercept of the two Hammett plots gives the value of the kinetic isotope effect, kh:kd = 3.6. The significance of the sign and magnitude of these p values is discussed and shown to be consistent with a direct hydride transfer. The p value for the equilibrium conversion of para-substituted benzaldehydes to their corresponding alcohols was determined to be p = 1.5. The difference between the kinetically determined p and the p for Keq may reflect an enhanced polarization of the carbonyl of the substrate in forming the ternary complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, the association constants of substituted benzaldehydes for binary complex, calculated from the observed isotope effects on the limiting Michaelis constants, were found to increase with electron-donating group (p = -0.85)."
https://openalex.org/W181641836,"Abstract A ribonuclease degrading only RNA complexed to DNA is found associated with the avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase. A convenient and sensitive assay for the enzyme is degradation of [3H]poly(A) complexed to poly(dT). Using this assay, nuclease and DNA polymerase activities are inseparable by DEAE-Sephadex or phosphocellulose ion exchange chromatography or by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Poly(A) labeled selectively at each end can be used to demonstrate that the nuclease is an endonuclease, and chromatography of the digestion products of poly(A) confirms this result. The oligonucleotide digestion products can be further digested to 5'-AMP by venom phosphodiesterase, indicating that they are terminated by 3'-OH groups."

https://openalex.org/W1557455162,"Abstract The Sendai virus induces fusion of chicken erythrocytes in the presence of bivalent cations such as Ca2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+. Beside the known activities of the virus envelope, another yet unknown viral factor seems necessary for inducing fusion. Low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.02%) greatly inhibit the fusion activity of the virus while the hemagglutination, hemolysis, and neuraminidase activities remain relatively intact. Ca2+ (40 mm) is able to induce fusion at pH 10.5, without any added virus. Under these conditions, a low percentage of the membrane phosphatidylethanolamine and lecithin are hydrolyzed and form lyso compounds. The lyso compounds probably are responsible for the formation of homopolykaryon. An electron microscope study of the fusion process is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1546518131,"Abstract Mouse mammary cells in organ culture incorporate 32Pi into the serine and threonine residues of 19 specific plasma membrane proteins and 8 specific ribosomal proteins as resolved by polyacrylamide electrophoresis. These proteins are also phosphorylated in cell-free reactions by tightly bound protein kinases which are endogenous to these organelles and not activated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and by a purified cytosol protein kinase which is activated by cyclic AMP. The radioactivity patterns of phosphorylated plasma membrane proteins are nearly identical after reactions with the endogenous or cytosol protein kinases or after phosphorylation in intact cultured cells. Certain differences in the radioactivity profiles of 32P-labeled ribosomal proteins are observed after phosphorylation by the ribosomal or cytosol protein kinases as compared to the 32P-proteins of ribosomes labeled in cultured cells. Insulin stimulates the rate of phosphorylation of specific plasma membrane and ribosomal proteins in undifferentiated mammary stem cells with maximal stimulation observed after 16 hours of culture. Prolactin synergizes with insulin to stimulate the rate of phosphorylation of all 19 membrane proteins and four ribosomal proteins in cells which differentiate in vitro after treatment with insulin and hydrocortisone. Stimulation of phosphorylation of these specific proteins occurs subsequent to the rapid induction by prolactin of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase of the cytosol, as previously described. The results suggest that the phosphorylation of multiple specific proteins in these organelles represents the propagation of the initial prolactin stimulus at the cell surface to various functionally distinct compartments of the mammary epithelial cell."

https://openalex.org/W1604677515,"Abstract The adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent (cAMP-dependent) protein kinases of rabbit skeletal muscle have been partially characterized in terms of molecular size and subunit composition. Three and possibly four species of protein kinase have been detected. The largest form of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration and sedimentation to have a molecular weight of 123,000 and to be made up of a catalytic subunit (C) and a regulatory or cAMP-binding subunit (R) with molecular weights of 49,000 and 82,000, respectively. A second muscle protein kinase was estimated to have a molecular weight of 76,000 with a catalytic subunit the same size as that of the larger protein kinase and with an R subunit having a molecular weight of 50,000. The other muscle protein kinases were not purified sufficiently to permit making meaningful estimates of their molecular weights, but it could be concluded that they differed from one another primarily in the size of their R subunits. Experiments were carried out which showed that the R subunits can be readily altered in vitro by aging or by proteolytic attack, so it is possible that some of the forms that were detected may have been formed during enzyme isolation. Resolution of the muscle protein kinases into C subunit and R·[3H]cAMP complex fractions was achieved by substrate-affinity chromatography after dissociation of the holoenzymes in the presence of [3H]-cAMP. Reconstitution of the original enzyme forms from separated C and R subunits was shown by physical techniques and kinetic measurements."

This may be of physiological importance in the case of transferrin. Differences in the behavior of the two proteins were also observed.
https://openalex.org/W1510857897,"Abstract ApoLp-Gln-II (or apoA-II), one of the two major apolipoprotein components of human plasma high density lipoproteins, was subjected to enzymatic and nonenzymatic digestion with trypsin and cyanogen bromide. The individual peptides were isolated to homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Cm-Sephadex, Sephadex G-100, Sephadex G-75, preparative thin layer plates, and by peptide mapping. Isolated peptides were assayed for purity by amino acid analysis, thin layer chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Edman NH2-terminal analysis. Cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by reduction and S-carboxymethylation produced two peptides, C-III and C-IV, of 51 and 26 residues, respectively. The smaller peptide (C-IV) contained homoserine and homoserine lactone and had NH2-terminal pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. It was the NH2-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide. This peptide contained the single S-carboxymethylcysteine residue. C-III was the COOH-terminal peptide. It contained COOH-terminal glutamine and a penultimate threonine residue. Tryptic digestion of reduced and alkylated apoLp-Gln-II yielded eight major tryptic peptides (T-I-1, T-I-2, T-I-3, T-III, T-IV, T-VI-1, T-VII, and T-VIII) and seven additional tryptic peptides which either contained or were contained in two or more of the eight major peptides. Only single unique NH2-terminal (T-I-2), COOH-terminal (T-VII), S-carboxymethylcysteine-containing (T-VIII), methionine-containing (T-VI-1), and isoleucine-containing (T-I-3) peptides were found. The combined compositions of the tryptic or cyanogen bromide peptides were equal to the composition of S-carboxymethyl-apoLp-Gln-II. These results confirm previous observations from this laboratory on intact and reduced and alkylated apoLp-Gln-II and support the concept that the molecule is composed of two identical chains of 77 residues each linked by a disulfide bond. The data available allow a partial alignment of these peptides and indicate that the disulfide bridge is in the NH2-terminal one-third of the molecule. The first three tryptic peptides in the sequence are T-I-2, T-VIII, and T-VI-1. T-VII is the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide. These assignments have been confirmed by manual and automated Edman degradations of the isolated tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides performed in parallel with the present studies and published elsewhere (Brewer, H. B., Jr., Lux, S. E., Ronan, R., and John, K. M. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 1304–1308)."

It is suggested that the native enzyme has the subunit structure α2β2. This structure is analogous to that of the active form of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. α2 corresponds in size to protein B1 and β2 to protein B2. In contrast to the bacterial enzyme the phage enzyme does not dissociate into α2 and β2 on purification. T4 ribonucleotide reductase contains 2.3 atoms of non-heme iron per molecule. The light absorption spectrum shows a sharp peak at 410 nm, and the electron spin resonance spectrum shows a doublet structure centered at g = 2.00. Both spectra are very similar to those of protein B2 of the E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. The reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates shows absolute requirements for NADPH, T4 thioredoxin, and E. coli thioredoxin reductase. The reaction is stimulated 2- to 3-fold by MgCl2."
https://openalex.org/W1516976598,"Abstract Modified nucleosides have been found in some types of low molecular weight nuclear RNA of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells in addition to 4 S RNA. The low molecular weight nuclear RNA species have been defined on the basis of their size as well as their content of uridylic acid as 4 S, 4.5 S, 5 S, U-1, U-2, and U-3 RNA (Busch, H., and Smetana, K. (1970) The Nucleolus, p. 285, Academic Press, New York). In particular, the U-2 RNA contained 11 pseudouridine residues and the unusual nucleoside, N2,N2-dimethyl 7-methyl guanosine, which was not found in transfer RNA or any other nuclear RNA except U-3. Nuclear 4.5 S RNAiii contained 3 pseudouridine residues and 1 residue each of N6-methyl adenosine and N2-methyl guanosine. Nuclear 5 S RNAiii contained 2 pseudouridine residues. Although the content of modified nucleosides in the 4 S RNAs from cytoplasm, ribosomes, and nuclei was the same, significantly lower amounts of dihydrouridine and N2-methyl guanosine were found in the nucleolar 4 S RNA. No modified nucleosides were found in 4.5 S RNAi, 4.5 S RNAii, 5 S RNAi, 5 S RNAii, U-1a RNA, and 5.5 S RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1515095695,"Abstract A protein kinase has been purified from the bovine corpus luteum by acid precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite columns. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 159,000. DEAE-cellulose chromatography resolved the protein kinase activity into two peaks, designated as KI and KII. Both peaks possessed adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-binding activities and both kinase activities were stimulated in vitro by cyclic AMP. The extent of stimulation of KII by cyclic AMP was greater than that of KI. (Km for cyclic AMP, 2.0 x 10-8 m.) KII was further purified by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. In addition to stimulation by cyclic AMP, the enzyme recovered from hydroxylapatite was also stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) in vitro. The response to LH was concentration dependent and specific. Other pituitary hormones were ineffective. The effects of LH and cyclic AMP were not additive and the binding of cyclic [3H]AMP to the hydroxylapatite-treated enzyme was not inhibited by the presence of LH. It is concluded that LH may have a direct control on the activity of protein kinase in the corpus luteum that is independent of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1538213920,"Abstract Cell-free extracts of several rat tissues contained N6-butyryl amidohydrolase and O2'-butyryl esterase activities for the deacylation of [3H]butyryl-labeled N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP, N6-monobutyryl cyclic AMP, and O2'-monobutyryl cyclic AMP. The highest rates of deacylation were in the soluble cytoplasm of all tissues; cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activities were also highest in the same cell compartment. Since rates of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase and 5'-AMP 5'-nucleotidase activities were from one to two orders of magnitude greater than those of the deacylases, deacylation is clearly the rate-limiting process in the catabolism of butyryl derivatives of cyclic AMP to adenosine. Despite these relatively low rates of deacylation, they are sufficiently high to produce, even when operating minimally, amounts of cyclic AMP far greater than could be produced endogenously, even under hormonal stimulation. It is concluded that dibutyryl cyclic AMP could serve as a source of intracellular cyclic AMP and of biologically active monobutyryl cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1538995411,"Abstract The two sugar nucleotides, UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine and UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, are enzymatically hydrolyzed by normal hamster cell extracts to yield free N-acetyl-d-galactosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, respectively. A nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity splits the sugar nucleotides to UMP and the appropriate N-acetyl-d-hexosamine-1-phosphate, and another enzymatic step with orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase activity then hydrolyzes the phosphorylated intermediate sugar to free N-acetyl-d-hexosamine. The two enzymatic activities differ in their divalent ion requirement and optimal pH and show the same hydrolytic activity on both sugar nucleotides. Different lines of hamster transformed cells and their revertants showed a block in either one or the other enzyme. Cell lines transformed by Rous sarcoma virus or Simian virus 40 were blocked in the nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity, whereas cell lines transformed by polyoma virus or after treatment with the chemical carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine were blocked in the second phosphohydrolase step. Variants from the polyoma- and dimethylnitrosamine-transformed cells, which had reverted in the biological properties characteristic of transformation, showed the same enzymatic block as their parental transformed cells. The block in enzyme activities may thus be due to a common genetic change in transformed cells and their revertants that is not found in the normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2404951042,"Abstract Because of the requirement for divalent metal ion activation, inorganic pyrophosphatase activity is measured in a complex equilibrium mixture containing free metal ion, free PPi, and metal ion-PPi complexes. Using crystalline yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase the binding to the enzyme of each of these individual components of the equilibrium has been examined. The dissociation constants of the binary enzyme-metal ion complexes are 2, 11, 16, and 800 µm for Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, respectively. In the absence of free metal ions neither PPi nor CaPPi bind to the enzyme; in the presence of excess Ca2+, CaPPi is bound quite strongly (Kd apparent = 7 x 10-9 m). The enzyme has two binding sites for CaPPi per mole of enzyme dimer. The results of these static binding studies are consistent with the kinetic analyses presented in the following papers."
https://openalex.org/W1577368561,"Abstract Acetylcholinesterase, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, elastase, and subtilisin have been spin-labeled, each at its active site serine residue, by 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl-methylphosphonofluoridate. The mobility of the label when attached to these enzymes falls into three categories: high mobility, acetylcholinesterase; moderate mobility, α-chymotrypsin; and low mobility, elastase and subtilisin. The mobility of the label attached to trypsin depends upon the pH at which the reaction is carried out; it is mobile when labeled at pH 5.5 and immobile when labeled at pH 7.7 Spin-labeled subtilisin undergoes rapid hydrolytic release of the phosphonyl nitroxide above pH 4.3, and experiences unfolding of the active site region below pH 3.5. These results are discussed in terms of the crystallographic data presently available for these enzymes."

In each case, the zero-field splitting was in the range 1.5 to 1.8°K and the associated spin Hamiltonian parameter D was in the range of 0.10 cm-1 to 0.11 cm-1. When nitrilotriacetate was substituted for the bicarbonate ordinarily occupying the anion-binding site of transferrin, the zero-field splitting increased to 3.2°K. Whether this is due to a change in geometry or a change in ligands at the metalbinding site is not yet clear."

The kinetics of inhibition have been measured and analyzed in terms of a model involving strong interactions between CaPPi and two metal-complexed forms of the enzyme, EMg and ECa. Inhibition constants for these interactions have been estimated by nonlinear regression and are compared with those obtained by equilibrium measurements. These results are discussed in terms of several theories for specificity in metal ion activation of catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1484213425,"Abstract A DPN-dependent dehydrogenase catalyzing the oxidative deamination of l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate to 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate was purified about 30-fold from extracts of the lysine-fermenting Clostridium SB4. The best preparations have a specific activity of 34 units per mg and are relatively homogeneous. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate the enzyme has a subunit molecular weight of about 37,000. The most active form of the enzyme is a tetramer of molecular weight about 140,000; at high pH or in solutions of low ionic strength it dissociates readily to a dimer of molecular weight about 68,000 which appears to be about one-third as active. The enzyme is highly specific with respect to substrate utilization and consequently is useful for the identification and quantitative estimation of l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate and 3-keto-5-amino-hexanoate. The equilibrium of the dehydrogenase reaction is more favorable for amino acid oxidation than are the equilibria of other similar reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1492801100,"Abstract The kinetic model of carbohydrate metabolism during differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum has been refined and expanded. A new program designed to simulate long term metabolic changes is briefly described. The model consists of a metabolic map, initial metabolite concentrations, enzyme kinetic expressions and constants, enzyme activation functions, and time functions giving independent metabolite concentrations. Output of the model must be consistent with metabolite accumulation patterns observed during differentiation and with flux values determined in vivo. The specific activity of enzymes in vivo and changes in this activity as a function of differentiation are taken as unknowns in the analysis and are calculated or predicted based upon parameters assumed to be valid."
https://openalex.org/W1491073804,"Abstract Nicotinic acid, at a concentration of 2.5 µm, was a more effective precursor of NAD than was nicotinamide in perfused rat kidney. NAD synthesis from nicotinic acid occurs via nicotinic acid ribonucleotide and desamido-NAD. Nicotinamide deamidase was not active but the nicotinamide, released by NAD glycohydrolase action or added to the perfusate, was incorporated into NAD via NMN. Mono- and dinucleotides as well as quinolinate entered the kidney cells slowly. The latter was converted to nicotinic acid ribonucleotide and thence to NAD. Nicotinic acid ribonucleoside served as a precursor of NAD. Urinary products from nicotinic acid included nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid, nicotinamide, and a trace of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. From nicotinamide no products other than the unchanged amide were detected. Nicotinamide was the preferred precursor of NAD in the testis as shown by intratesticular injection in the whole animal or by homogenate experiments. Quinolinic acid did not serve as a source of the pyridine moiety of NAD in the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1552752002,"Abstract An inducible oxidase from Arthrobacter oxydans that catalyzes the oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine was purified about 50-fold. Reduced pyridine nucleotide is required for oxidase activity; no requirement for ferrous, ferric, or other cation could be demonstrated. Artificial electron acceptors do not substitute for oxygen in the reaction. The oxidase catalyzes the anaerobic reduction of methylene blue by NADH. 2,6-Dihydroxypyridine increases the rate of the anaerobic reaction but is not altered during the reaction. The purified oxidase preparation has absorption maxima at 384 and 455 nm. The maxima disappear during the anaerobic reaction. These and other data suggest that the oxidase is a monooxygenase of molecular weight about 89,000 having a flavin prosthetic group. The only detectable product of the oxidase reaction is a blue pigment. Its formation is decreased or eliminated when oxidase is supplemented with a second enzyme fraction (cleavage enzyme). Blue pigment is not a substrate for the cleavage enzyme. It is proposed that the normal metabolic sequence is the oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine to a trihydroxypyridine, mediated by the oxidase, followed by pyridine ring cleavage in a second reaction. The over-all stoichiometry of the oxidase reaction, corrected for oxygen utilized in blue pigment formation, is 2,6-dihydroxypyridine:NADH:O2 = 1:1:1."
https://openalex.org/W1489192103,"Abstract The methylation of tRNA in vitro and in vivo was studied using normal mouse cells (3T3) and transformed mouse cells (SV3T3) which were obtained by transformation of the normal 3T3 cells with SV40 virus. Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from transformed cells transferred methyl groups in vitro from S-adenosylmethionine to either Escherichia coli B or mouse tRNA to a much greater extent than did extracts of nontransformed control cells. Furthermore, the tRNA methylating enzymes of the transformed cells had an altered specificity which resulted in methylation of new sites on E. coli B tRNA in addition to those methylated by nontransformed cell enzymes. It was also demonstrated that E. coli B tRNA methylated by transformed cell extracts chromatographed differently on benzoylated DEAE-cellulose and had more methylated oligonucleotide sequences than did E. coli B tRNA methylated by normal cell extracts. In marked contrast to the results obtained in vitro with mouse enzymes and E. coli B tRNA, no differences were detected in tRNA which was methylated in vivo by growing normal and transformed cells in l-[methyl-14C]methionine or l-[methyl-3H]methionine. The extent of methylation and the methylated base composition of the two tRNA populations were the same. The normal and transformed cell tRNA co-chromatographed on benzoylated DEAE-cellulose and had the same methylated oligonucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2058492479,An enzyme that polymerizes adenylate residues from adenosine triphosphate was prepared from rat liver mitochondria and compared to similar preparations from the mitochondria of three hepatomas.

https://openalex.org/W1596174525,"Abstract In contrast to human erythrocytes, rat erythrocytes synthesize NAD directly from nicotinamide via NMN. 14C from nicotinamide appeared in NMN and NAD and to lesser extent in nicotinamide ribonucleoside and NADP. Mono- and dinucleotides formed were present solely within the cells, whereas nucleosides and the unchanged substrates readily passed through the cell membrane. NMN pyrophosphorylase, the first enzyme of this pathway, has been purified about 400-fold from rat erythrocytes and was shown to require ATP and Mg++, to have a pH optimum of 8.5 to 9.0 and to have Km values of 0.067 and 3.8 µm for nicotinamide and PP-ribose-P, respectively. The enzyme activity was increased 50% in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. Although NMN pyrophosphorylase cannot be measured in a buffer system of pH 7.4, due to the hydrolysis of the product by NAD glycohydrolase in the hemolysate, it can be readily measured at pH 8.8 where NAD glycohydrolase is not active. From radioactive nicotinic acid the major labeled products were nicotinic acid ribonucleotide, nicotinic acid ribonucleoside, and NAD with lesser amounts of label in nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide. The results suggest that nicotinic acid is converted to NAD by the Preiss-Handler pathway while nicotinamide is metabolized via the parallel pathway through NMN."
https://openalex.org/W1510185376,"Abstract The methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharide (MGLP) of Mycobacterium phlei is an acidic molecule with 18 hexose units, containing esterified acetate (3 moles), propionate (1 mole), isobutyrate (1 mole), octanoate (1 mole), and succinate (0 to 3 moles). The positions of acylation in the lipopolysaccharide have now been investigated to determine whether these groups are esterified at specific sites. Because of the lability of the acyl groups during the degradative reactions employed, they were specifically replaced with methyl ether groups. The methyl-replaced lipopolysaccharide was then degraded by sequential periodate oxidation, sodium borotritide reduction, and mild acid hydrolysis (Smith degradation). Radioactive fragments obtained in the Smith degradation were compared with those produced by similar treatment of the polysaccharide alone, and the newly formed methylated fragments served to identify positions of acylation. To distinguish between the methyl groups endogenous to the lipopolysaccharide and those arising from methyl replacement, a parallel experiment was performed on [methyl-3H]MGLP, prepared from cells grown in the presence of l-[methyl-3H]methionine. In a third study, the acyl groups of nonradioactive MGLP were replaced with radioactive methyl groups. These three complementary studies have demonstrated that the lipopolysaccharide does contain discrete sites for acylation. The form of the lipopolysaccharide with a total of eight acyl substituents (MGLP-III) was found to contain only eight positions of acylation. These were identified as position 3 of the glyceric acid, position 6 of 5 of the 7 glucose residues, and positions 4 and 6 of the terminal 3-O-methyl-glucose residue. The results indicate that the acyltransferases responsible for the incorporation of these groups possess a high degree of specificity, and also suggest that a rigidly defined structure must be important for the biological function of the lipopolysaccharide."

Bovine serum high density lipoprotein has an average rotational relaxation time of 570 ns at 25°; it is a relatively rigid, spherical particle with some local flexibility at the level of protein side chains and the individual lipid components. In the presence of increasing amounts of 1-octanol, the lipoprotein first expands and finally becomes disrupted. The structural changes are qualitatively similar to those produced by alcohol anesthetics on biological membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2044819554,We have recorded from the granular layer of the turtle cerebellum extracellular unitary potentials that appear to reflect pre- and postsynaptic events at the synapse between a single swelling of a mossy fiber and the dendritic tips of several granule cells. The presynaptic component is an all-or-none potential. It can be directly activated by spinal stimulation and is unaltered by repetitive activity or by high concentrations of magnesium. The postsynaptic component is a graded potential. It follows the presynaptic component by approximately 1 millisecond and is depressed by repetitive activity and by high concentrations of magnesium. The recording of large potentials produced by the flow of postsynaptic current within a single glomerulus suggests powerful transmission. Electron micrographs demonstrate large cerebellar glomeruli in the turtle and a substantial accumulation of mitochondria in the dendritic tips of granule cells.

https://openalex.org/W1600594132,"Abstract To elucidate the site of action of thyrotropin (TSH) in its stimulatory effect on thyroidal phosphatide turnover, the conversion of glycerophosphate to phosphatidic acid was examined. Thyroid cells which normally exclude phosphorylated intermediary metabolites were made permeable to l-α-[32P,2-3H]glycerophosphate by incubating thyroid slices in hypotonic medium adjusted to 90 mosm per kg by decreasing the NaCl concentration. In this system, it was found that TSH stimulated the incorporation of both labels of glycerophosphate into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol but had little effect on the labeling of phosphatidylcholine. 32P was also incorporated into ATP and this along with the observation that the 32P:3H ratio in the lipids differed from that in the glycerophosphate substrate indicated that other reactions besides the direct conversion of glycerophosphate to phosphatidic acid were occurring. Despite the presence of complex metabolic interrelations in the intact cell, specific activity arguments lead to the conclusion that a site of action of TSH is at the conversion of glycerophosphate to phosphatidic acid."
