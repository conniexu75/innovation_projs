https://openalex.org/W1998000193,"TH17 lymphocytes appear to be essential in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory diseases. We demonstrate here the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 receptors on blood-brain barrier endothelial cells (BBB-ECs) in multiple sclerosis lesions, and show that IL-17 and IL-22 disrupt BBB tight junctions in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TH17 lymphocytes transmigrate efficiently across BBB-ECs, highly express granzyme B, kill human neurons and promote central nervous system inflammation through CD4+ lymphocyte recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2144690533,"Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of agricultural societies and hunter-gatherers in arid environments. In contrast, rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists consume much less starch1,2,3. This behavioral variation raises the possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase, the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis4. We found that copy number of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) is correlated positively with salivary amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high-starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with traditionally low-starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset of these populations suggest that the extent of AMY1 copy number differentiation is highly unusual. This example of positive selection on a copy number–variable gene is, to our knowledge, one of the first discovered in the human genome. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2111945300,"More than a billion humans worldwide are predicted to be completely deficient in the fast skeletal muscle fiber protein alpha-actinin-3 owing to homozygosity for a premature stop codon polymorphism, R577X, in the ACTN3 gene. The R577X polymorphism is associated with elite athlete status and human muscle performance, suggesting that alpha-actinin-3 deficiency influences the function of fast muscle fibers. Here we show that loss of alpha-actinin-3 expression in a knockout mouse model results in a shift in muscle metabolism toward the more efficient aerobic pathway and an increase in intrinsic endurance performance. In addition, we demonstrate that the genomic region surrounding the 577X null allele shows low levels of genetic variation and recombination in individuals of European and East Asian descent, consistent with strong, recent positive selection. We propose that the 577X allele has been positively selected in some human populations owing to its effect on skeletal muscle metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2090044071,"Large data sets on human genetic variation have been collected recently, but their usefulness for learning about history and natural selection has been limited by biases in the ways polymorphisms were chosen. We report large subsets of SNPs from the International HapMap Project1,2 that allow us to overcome these biases and to provide accurate measurement of a quantity of crucial importance for understanding genetic variation: the allele frequency spectrum. Our analysis shows that East Asian and northern European ancestors shared the same population bottleneck expanding out of Africa but that both also experienced more recent genetic drift, which was greater in East Asians."

https://openalex.org/W1976671101,"Virus integration into the host genome is a characteristic step during cervical carcinogenesis. Experimental data provide evidence that integration could result in increased levels of oncogene (E6/E7) transcripts. This is the first study in which the level of viral transcripts is correlated to the physical state of the viral genome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinomas (CxCa). Using the APOT-assay integrate-derived transcripts only were detected in 3/28 (11%) CIN and in 28/55 (51%) carcinomas, respectively. The remaining biopsies contained either episome-derived transcripts only or both mRNA species. SybrGreen real time reverse transcriptase–PCR assays were used to quantify viral gene expression for (i) all transcripts initiated from p97, (ii) full-length E6, (iii) E6*I and (iv) E5 transcripts. E6/E7 transcript levels showed a broad distribution but similar median values irrespective of histopathological grading and physical state of the viral genome. Biopsies with integrate-derived transcripts only generally lacked E5-specific mRNA. Our data do not support the hypothesis that HPV integration invariably results in high levels of oncogene transcripts. Instead, constitutive expression of oncogene transcripts rather than the level of expression appears to be decisive for transformation and the maintenance of the malignant phenotype."

Paleocene-early Eocene and late Eocene-early Miocene rates are only a fraction of middle Eocene and middle Miocene-Recent rates. These changes must reflect significantly different modes of continental weathering, which may be due to alternate states of atmospheric circulation marked by reduction of global precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2039688872,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) signaling in tumor cells has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by regulating matrix proteolysis. Although MMP-9/gelatinase-B is an important component of these TGF-beta1 responses, the mechanism of its regulation is not well understood. Here, we present evidence that TGF-beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) is critical for TGF-beta regulation of MMP-9 and the metastatic potential of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. We found that suppression of TAK1 signaling by dominant-negative (dn) TAK1 or RNA interference (siRNA) reduces expression of MMP-9 and tumor cell invasion, without growth inhibition in cell culture. The orthotopic xenograft studies in SCID mice showed that suppression of TAK1 signaling by dn-TAK1 reduces tumor growth and formation of lung metastases. Dn-TAK1 reduced the proliferation Ki-67 index and neovasculature of orthotopic xenografts. TAK1-mediated regulation of MMP-9 involves NF-kappaB signaling. Dn-TAK1 reduces NF-kappaB transcriptional response and inhibition of NF-kappaB reduces expression of MMP-9 and activity of the MMP-9 promoter reporter. Together, these findings suggest that TAK1 contributes to TGF-beta1-mediated tumor angiogenesis and metastasis via a mechanism involving the TAK1-NF-kappaB-MMP-9 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2147846611,"One of the fundamental challenges of binocular vision is that objects project to different positions on the two retinas (binocular disparity). Neurons in visual cortex show two distinct types of tuning to disparity, position and phase disparity, which are the results of differences in receptive field location and profile, respectively. Here, we point out that phase disparity does not occur in natural images. Why, then, should the brain encode it? We propose that phase-disparity detectors help to work out which feature in the left eye corresponds to a given feature in the right. This correspondence problem is plagued by false matches: regions of the image that look similar, but do not correspond to the same object. We show that phase-disparity neurons tend to be more strongly activated by false matches. Thus, they may act as 'lie detectors', enabling the true correspondence to be deduced by a process of elimination."
https://openalex.org/W1495420575,"SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene) or ROC2/RBX2 is the second family member of ROC1/RBX1, a component of SCF (Skp1, Cullin, F-box protein) and VCB (von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), Cullin and Elongin B/C) E3 ubiquitin ligases. SAG protected cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis when overexpressed. We report here that SAG was subjected to hypoxia induction at the levels of mRNA and protein. Hypoxia induction of SAG was largely HIF-1alpha dependent. A consensus HIF-1-binding site, GCGTG was identified in the first intron of the SAG gene. In response to hypoxia, HIF-1 bound to this site and transactivated SAG expression. SAG transactivation required both the intact binding site in cis and HIF-1alpha in trans. On the other hand, like its family member, ROC1, SAG promoted VHL-mediated HIF-1alpha ubiquitination and degradation, which was significantly inhibited upon small interfering RNA silencing of SAG or ROC1. Furthermore, the endogenous HIF-1alpha at both basal and hypoxia-induced levels was significantly increased upon SAG silencing. Finally, SAG forms in vivo complex with Cul-5 and VHL under hypoxia condition. These results suggest an HIF-1-SAG feedback loop in response to hypoxia, as follows: hypoxia induces HIF-1 to transactivate SAG. Induced SAG then promotes HIF-1alpha ubiquitination and degradation. This feedback loop may serve as a cellular defensive mechanism to reduce potential cytotoxic effects of prolonged HIF-1 activation under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2066910712,"Mdm2, a regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, is frequently overexpressed in lymphomas, including lymphomas that have inactivated p53. However, the biological consequences of Mdm2 overexpression in lymphocytes are not fully resolved. Here, we report that increased expression of Mdm2 in B cells augmented proliferation and reduced susceptibility to p53-dependent apoptosis, which was due to inhibition of p53 and suppression of p21 expression. Notably, developing and mature B cells from Mdm2 transgenic mice had an increased frequency of chromosomal/chromatid breaks and/or aneuploidy. This Mdm2-mediated genome instability occurred at a similar frequency as that in B cells overexpressing the oncogene c-Myc, but the chromosomal instability was not further enhanced when Mdm2 and c-Myc were overexpressed together. Elevated Mdm2 expression alone increased the occurrence of B-cell transformation in vivo and cooperated with c-Myc overexpression, resulting in an acceleration of B-cell lymphomagenesis. In addition, the frequency of p53 mutations was reduced, but not eliminated, in lymphomas arising in Mdm2/Emu-myc double transgenic mice. Therefore, increased Mdm2 expression facilitated B-cell lymphomagenesis, in part, through regulation of p53 by altering B-cell proliferation and susceptibility to apoptosis, and by inducing chromosomal instability."

https://openalex.org/W2000844161,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major causative agent of cervical cancer and the E6 and E7 genes encode the major HPV oncoproteins. The E7 protein from high-risk HPV types alters cell cycle progression and represses genes encoding components of the antigen-presentation pathway, suggesting a role for E7 in tumour immune evasion. We show that knockdown of E7 expression in HPV16- and HPV18-transformed cervical carcinoma cells by RNA interference increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I at the cell surface and reduced susceptibility of these cells to natural killer (NK) cells. Tetracycline-regulated induction of HPV16 E7 resulted in reduced expression of cell surface MHC class I molecules and increased NK cell killing. Our results suggest that, for HPV-associated malignancies, reduced MHC class I expression is the result of an active immune evasion strategy that has evolved to assist viral replication."

https://openalex.org/W1983163493,"Regulation of the synthesis, function and degradation of HDM2 (Mdm2 in mouse) plays a key role in controlling the abundance and activity of the transcription factor p53, with consequent implications for the proliferation and survival of normal and cancer cells. We have previously identified the regulation of export of HDM2 mRNA from the nucleus as a novel point of control of HDM2 synthesis. This process is dependent on the activity of the growth factor-regulated MAP-kinase kinases (MEKs). Here, we provide evidence that the eIF4E kinase MNK1 is a key downstream effector of MEKs in this regulatory pathway. We show that HDM2 mRNA export in breast cancer cells is promoted by overexpressed eIF4E in a MEK- and MNK1-dependent manner, and inhibition of MNK1 suppresses endogenous HDM2 mRNA export pathways. This MNK1- and eIF4E-dependent HDM2 regulation occurs through sequences in the 3' untranslated region of HDM2 mRNA, and consequently HDM2 mRNA transcripts from both the constitutive P1 and inducible P2 promoters are regulated by this pathway. eIF4E is a known oncogene that is overexpressed in human tumours, including the majority of breast cancers. This pathway, therefore, may play an important role in the dysregulation of HDM2 oncoprotein expression that occurs in many human tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2020817173,"Infrasound generated by the sonic boom from the inbound Concorde supersonic transport is recorded at Palisades, New York (Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory), as a series of impulses from distances varying from 165 to about 1000 kilometers. Refraction effects determined by temperature and wind conditions return the signal to the surface from both stratospheric (40 to 50 kilometers) and thermospheric (100 to 130 kilometers) levels. The frequency of the recorded signal is a function of the level of reflection; the frequency decreases from impulse stretching as the atmosphere becomes more rarified relative to the sound pressure. The horizontal trace velocity of the signal across the array of instruments is equal to the acoustic velocity at the reflection level. The sonic boom can thus be used to provide temperature-wind parameters at reflection levels estimated from the signal frequency. Daily observed signal variations have indicated significant variations in these parameters."

The orientation of shoreline segments within the larger of these sinuous features (10 to 15 kilometers between apexes) is significantly related to shoreline dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2016674121,"The cytoplasmic domain of the common beta-chain (betac) of the granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interleukin-3 (IL-3)/IL-5 receptor contains a membrane proximal region that is sufficient to mediate ligand-dependent mitogenic activity. Within this region two motifs, designated as box 1 and box 2, are highly conserved among members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Whereas box 1 is required for the recruitment and phosphorylation of Janus kinase-2, the function of box 2 remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a novel transmembrane protein (common beta-chain associated protein (CBAP)) which directly associated with betac via the box 2 motif. Interestingly, such an association only occurred in the absence of GM-CSF in vivo. Ectopic overexpression of CBAP triggered apoptosis of factor-dependent cells via mitochondrial dysfunction, which could be inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. Reduced expression of endogenous CBAP by small interfering RNA did not interfere GM-CSF-activated signaling molecules, but such treatment significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by GM-CSF deprivation, but not other death stimuli. Domain mapping studies indicated that one apoptogenic domain of CBAP correlated with its ability to interact with betac. Taken together, these results suggest that CBAP modulates GM-CSF-deprivation-induced apoptosis possibly via a novel mechanism involving interaction with an un-liganded betac molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1970123345,"I have argued, following Einstein and London, that Bose-Einstein statistics is important for understanding the behavior of superfluid (4)He, while Fermi-Dirac statistics is important for understanding that of (3)He. In order to understand qualitatively the general behavior of (3)He-(4)He mixtures at constant pressure, the interaction between the helium atoms cannot be neglected. A very simple model of (3)He-(4)He mixtures is then a binary mixture of two kinds of hard spheres that follow Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively. This model correctly predicts the most striking features of the phase diagrams of helium mixtures in the temperature-concentration plane. In particular, the Bose-Einstein statistics of (4)He is responsible for the occurrence of a phase separation of the mixture at low temperatures that starts at an unusual type of critical point, while the Fermi-Dirac statistics of (3)He leads to an incomplete phase separation near the absolute zero of temperature, which makes possible the successful operation of a powerful cooling device, the helium dilution refrigerator."
