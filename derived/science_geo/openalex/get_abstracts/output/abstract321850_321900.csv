https://openalex.org/W2032315791,"The linear polarization of sunlight multiply scattered by the atmosphere, and cloud particles of Venus has been computed and compared with observations over the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the infrared region. The following properties of the visible cloud layer are derived: the refractive index of the cloud particles is 1.45 +/- 0.02 at a wavelength of 0.55 micron, and there is an indication of a slight decrease in the value from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region; the mean particle radius is very near 1 micron, and most of the particles are spherical; the cloud layer occurs high in the atmosphere where the pressure is about 50 millibars (equivalent to an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers on the earth). The results for the index of refraction eliminate the possibility that the visible clouds are composed of pure water or ice."
https://openalex.org/W4248199097,"The hunger to participate that exists today in various segments of the American public is in part a response to what some people perceive as an unresponsiveness of institutions and processes to the felt needs of the individual and of society. It is also, in part, an expression of a desire for a redistribution of power in American public life. Technology is one of the major determinants of the nature of public as well as private life in contemporary society. Participatory technology is an attempt on the part of diverse individuals and groups to influence technological processes through participation in existing or new public processes by which technology is or can be developed , controlled, and implemented. Like other processes of direct citizen participation in governmental decision making, it raises many questions about the adequacy of existing theories and practices of representative government. These questions cannot be answered on an a priori basis. Members of the educational, scientific, technical, and governmental communities should analyze these questions in an effort to develop answers that are appropriate to the particular situations for which they are responsible and with which they are concerned."

The rubidium absorbed reached concentrations many times the external concentration without any slackening of the rate of absorption-evidence for a high degree of irreversibility of the overall absorption process. This is discussed in terms of the ""enzyme-kinetic"" model of ion transport by carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1990754878,"Rats were trained to press a lever for electrical stimulation of the brain. After extinction of the habit, fear-producing stimuli (a buzzer or electrical shock to the feet) recalled the rat to the lever, although its lever pressing on these occasions never produced further intracranial stimulation. Operant levels of the lever-pressing habit were also greatly increased for long periods following the fear-producing stimuli. The phenomenon is most striking in rats trained with tegmental electrodes and is almost completely absent in rats trained with electrodes in the hypothalamus. This suggests that electrical self-stimulation in some sites may be caused by an activation of mechanisms underlying normal fear and escape."

It is indlcated that double hydroxides are formed in the clay suspensions, causing the buffering region. (L.N.N.)"

https://openalex.org/W1967292219,"Some natural populations show an extremely high degree of polymorphism, especially in color and pattern, which may be interpreted as ""protective variation."" Two possible genetic models, one based on frequency-stat (like thermostat) and one based on higher selection value of heterozygotes, have been proposed to account for the phenomenon."
