https://openalex.org/W1533292277,"NH2-terminal extension peptides of type I and type III procollagens were isolated from dermatosparactic and normal fetal calfskin, respectively. Cell culture experiments showed that the globular domains of the tested procollagen peptides were biologically active but that peptides from the helical region of collagen had no effect. The peptides were added to the incubation medium of calf fibroblasts along with radioactive precursor amino acids, and the amount of newly synthesized collagen was determined. The experiments indicated that procollagen peptides exerted a feedback-like inhibitory effect specific for the synthesis of collagen. Neither degradation of collagen, hydroxylation of collagen alpha chains, nor synthesis of noncollagenous proteins were affected. Synthesis of type II collagen by calf chondrocytes was not reduced. In addition, it was shown that procollagen peptides from calf were equally effective when added to human fibroblast cultures, an observation that could be of considerable medical interest."

https://openalex.org/W1525197059,Peptide mapping of underivatized tryptic digests of bovine and chick intestinal calcium-binding proteins has been accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). High precision analysis of nanomolar quantities of peptides were achieved in less than 1 h (recycle time). Peak resolution and definition are superior compared to conventional techniques and recoveries of both small (4-residue) hydrophilic and large (30-residue) hydrophobic peptides are excellent. The total amino acid composition of the bovine intestinal calcium-binding protein has been accounted for on the basis of two tryptic maps of 20 microgram of protein each.

https://openalex.org/W1523178289,"To examine the question of whether 24-hydroxylation plays and importance role in the physiological functions of vitamin D, the biological activity of 24,24-difluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D was compared with that of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D-deficient rats. These two compounds were found almost identically active in the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport, the mobilization of calcium from bone, the healing of rachitic epiphyseal plate cartilage, the elevation of serum inorganic phosphorus, the mineralization of rachitic bone, and in the prevention of rachitogenesis in rats. Little or no difference was detected in the time course of response of intestinal calcium transport or bone calcium mobilization to the two forms of vitamin D. Therefore, in the rat no support could be obtained for the idea that 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 plays an important role in the known physiological responses to the vitamin."

https://openalex.org/W2064487242,"We have identified an abundant 20,000 dalton protein (KAP) by in vitro translation of male mouse kidney mRNA. This protein is synthesized in reduced amounts from female kidney mRNA. A KAP cDNA fragment was purified and used for nucleic acid hybridization studies. Females and castrated males have 10 and 200 fold lower levels, respectively, of KAP mRNA relative to males. The administration of testosterone to females or castrated males results in the induction of KAP mRNA to normal male levels. Testicular feminized (Tfm) mice have 3 fold lower levels of KAP mRNA relative to normal males and are not induced by testosterone. KAP mRNA is not found in significant amounts in tissues other than the kidney, and the KAP gene renatures with kinetics similar to single-copy DNA. With the rapidly expanding knowledge of mouse genetics, KAP should prove useful in determining genetic factors which regulate the inducibility and tissue specificity of a hormonally regulated gene."

https://openalex.org/W1530639715,"Abstract Two closely related acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyl-transferases were purified to near-homogeneity from preparations of bovine liver mitochondria. Each enzyme consisted of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight near 33,000. One transferase was specific for benzoyl-CoA, salicyl-CoA, and certain short straight and branched chain fatty acyl-CoA esters as substrates while the other enzyme specifically used either phenylacetyl-CoA or indoleacetyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA substrates for one transferase inhibited the other. Glycine was the preferred acyl acceptor for both enzymes but either L-asparagine or L-glutamine also served. Peptide products for each transferase were identified by mass spectrometry. Enzymatic cleavage of acyl-CoA was stoichiometric with release of thiol and formation of peptide product. Apparent Km values were low for the preferred acyl-CoA substrates relative to the amino acid acceptors (10(-5) M range compared to greater than 10(-3) M). Both enzymes were inhibited by high nonphysiological concentrations of certain divalent cations (Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+). In contrast to benzoyltransferase, phenylacetyltransferase was sensitive to inhibition by either 10(-4) M 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) or 10(-5) M p-chloromercuribenzoate; 10(-4) M phenylacetyl-CoA partially protected phenylacetyltransferase against 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) inactivation but 10(-1) M glycine did not. For activity, phenylacetyltransferase required addition of certain monovalent cations (K+, Rb+, Na+, Li+, Cs+, or (NH4)+) to the assay system but benzoyltransferase did not. Preliminary kinetic studies of both transferases were consistent with a sequential reaction mechanism in which the acyl-CoA substrate adds to the enzyme first, glycine adds before CoA leaves, and the peptide product dissociates last."

https://openalex.org/W1593942754,"The binding of substrates and a product to glutathione S-transferase A from rat liver was studied by use of equilibrium dialysis and equilibrium partition in a two-phase system. The radioactive substrates glutathione and bromosulfophthalein as well as a product of glutathione and 3,4-dichloro-1-nitrobenzene, S-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)glutathione, gave hyperbolic binding isotherms with a stoichiometry of 2 mol per mol of enzyme (i.e. 1 molecule per subunit). Glutathione (and glutathione disulfide) had an equilibrium (dissociation) constant for the binding of about 10 microM, whereas bromosulfophthalein and the product had equilibrium constants of about 0.5 microM. All ligands showed the same binding stoichiometry, and competition experiments involving unlabeled ligands indicated that glutathione and the glutathione derivatives were binding to the same site. Low affinity sites appeared to exist in addition to the specific high affinity sites (one per subunit) for all ligands tested. The binding studies are fully consistent with a steady state random kinetic mechanism for the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2027610926,"Bombyx mori silkworms producing fibroin proteins of different lengths have been analyzed genetically and shown to possess variant alleles of a single fibroin gene. The structures of two alleles have been compared by using restriction endonuclease sites inside and outsite the fibroin gene as physical markers. We find that fibroins distinguishable on the basis of length are encoded by genes with different internal structures and overall lengths. Our results strongly support the idea that rearrangements within the highly repetitive sequences of the fibroin gene are the result of unequal recombination, and can give rise to variant fibroin genes with altered coding lengths."
https://openalex.org/W1520165502,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), which specifically binds Met-tRNAMetf and forms stable ternary complexes with GTP, has been purified from ribosomal salt wash proteins from calf liver. The purified factor exhibits only two polypeptide bands of Mr = 48,000 and 38,000 following electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Densitometric tracings show the two polypeptides are present in a molar ratio of 1:1. This suggests a Mr = 86,000 for the native enzyme, a value which agrees with the apparent molecular weight determined by physical methods. Less pure preparations of eIF-2 show additional polypeptide bands, including 50,000- and 46,000-dalton bands, all of which can be removed by further purification without affecting the activity of eIF-2."

https://openalex.org/W2112595098,"The messenger RNA coding for the precursor of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (Ru-P2) carboxylase has been partially purified from pea leaves. The mRNA has a size of 11.5S, is approximately 800 nucleotides long and, on cell-free translation, directs the synthesis of a single major polypeptide of 20,000 daltons. Antiserum for the small subunit of Ru-P2 carboxylase immunoprecipitated 52% of the 35S-methionine-labeled cell-free translation products. The RNA hybridizes with pea DNA with monophasic kinetics corresponding to the presence of one, or very few, gene copies per haploid genome."
https://openalex.org/W1551959403,"During the first 2 days of culture of myogenic chicken cells only minute amounts of mRNA for a subunit of creatine kinase, M-CK, could be found in cultures from the 3rd and 4th day; however, a dramatic increase of mRNA for the muscle-specific M-CK was observed. The mRNA for B-CK, another subunit of creatine kinase, was readily detectable in young cultures increased up to the 3rd day in culture but decreased significantly 1 day later. The comparison of the ratios of mRNA concentrations for M-CK and B-CK in polysomal and total cellular RNA did not reveal significant differences in polysomal and total cellular RNA from 24-, 48-, and 68-h cultures, indicating that specific accumulation of a nonpolysomal form containing translatable mRNA for M-CK prior to its appearance in the polysomes does not seem to represent a major mechanism of regulation. In RNA from cells grown in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 3 days and subcultured into the same medium for another 3 days only mRNA for B-CK was found. If cells, however, were subcultured into standard medium both mRNAs, the one for B-CK and the one for M-CK could be detected. BrdUrd inhibition seems to affect only the mRNA for M-CK and not the one for B-CK. Removal of BrdUrd from the cultures probably allows new transcription or processing of mRNA for M-CK, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1571714448,"Incorporation of [3H]lysine into the non-histone chromosomal proteins HMG1, HMG2, and HMG17 and into each of the five major classes of histones was measured in rat liver at various times after partial hepatectomy. Histone synthesis was closely coupled temporally to that of DNA, although a small amount of histone was shown to be produced before DNA replication began. In contrast, the incorporation curves for the high mobility group (HMG) proteins showed little correlation with that for DNA. At 4 h after partial hepatectomy, protein synthesis had virtually ceased. Thereafter, the rates of synthesis of the HMG proteins rose steadily so that by 12 h, well before the onset of DNA replication they had reached about two-thirds of the maximum rates attained during the first cell division cycle. Histones had only reached about one-sixth of their maximum rates at this time. The lack of coupling betweeen the synthesis of the HMG proteins and DNA was confirmed by experiments with inhibitors of DNA replication. Reduction of DNA synthesis to less than 10%of the uninhibited rate had little or no effect on incorporation into the HMG proteins, whereas, under similar conditions, the rate of synthesis of histones was reduced by more than 50%."

https://openalex.org/W1523247951,"This study examines thiamin transport in isolated rat hepatocytes and its relationship to thiamin phosphorylation. In an Na+ medium, [35S]thiamin, 3 microM, was accumulated rapidly by the cells, and a near study state intra-/extracellular distribution ratio of 3 was attained in 1 min. However, the uptake of radioactivity continued to increase with time owing principally to the accumulation of [35S]thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). In a choline, Li+ or K+ medium, the steady state intra-/extracellular distribution ratio of [35S]thiamin was decreased to less than or equal to 1.1. Accordingly, the rate of formation of [35S]TPP also decreased. Ouabain and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation significantly lowered the distribution ratio of intra-/extracellular [35S]thiamin. These data indicate that thiamin transport in liver is concentrative, Na+-dependent, and dependent on biological energy. Additionally, they suggest that thiamin transport plays a significant role in governing the rate of synthesis of TPP. Neither pyrithiamin, an inhibitor of thiamin pyrophosphokinase nor o-benzoylthiamin disulfide, a permeable thiamin analog, affected the distribution ratio of intra-/extracellular [35S]thiamin, but preferentially inhibited the phosphorylation of [35S]thiamin. By contrast, amprolium primarily inhibited uptake. These data suggest that thiamin transport and phosphorylation can be differentiated by the action of appropriate inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1523268300,"Abstract Cells of a clonal cell line (ob 17) isolated from the epididymal fat pad of ob/ob mouse possess insulin receptors. Their number was increased 1.5-fold after growth arrest, with no significant change in the Kd values of the sites determined by extrapolation of the high affinity portion of the curvilinear Scatchard plots. With chronic insulin exposure for 3 to 11 days after confluence, ob 17 cells showed a decrease in insulin receptor concentrations from 8,000 to 1,600 high affinity sites/cell (Kd from 0.45 to 1.10(-9) M) while similar levels of low sites were found (80,000 to 100,000 sites/cell; Kd from 10(-8) to 3 x 10(-8) M). The loss of the high affinity binding sites is accompanied by the disappearance of the stimulatory effect by insulin of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. Therefore, in contrast to 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, the ob 17 cells present, in culture, a self-modulation of insulin receptors and a loss of insulin sensitivity after chronic exposure to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1584147929,"Methods are described for the incorporation into phospholipid vesicles of epoxide hydrase isolated from liver microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rabbits. Chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column of epoxide hydrase and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine treated with sodium cholate yielded homogeneous vesicles with a diameter of about 25 nm and containing 80 to 85% of the protein applied. At high substrate concentrations, the vesicles catalyzed the hydration of benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-oxide and styrene-7,8-epoxide at a rate similar to that obtained with the enzyme in a soluble form. However, the kinetics of styrene glycol formation catalyzed by the vesicular or microsomal preparations were complex. Convex Lineweaver-Burk plots and concave Hill plots were obtained, whereas normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics characterized the hydration catalyzed by the enzyme in a soluble form. The results could be explained if reconstitution of the enzyme into the vesicles gives rise to low affinity high capacity sites for the substrate on the enzyme, or alternatively facilitates the interaction of the substrate with such sites already present. It is suggested that reconstituted liposomes containing both the liver microsomal hydroxylase system and epoxide hydrase may prove to be a good model system for evaluating substrate specificity and factors of importance in the formation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites by these enzymes."

The native molecular weight of the enzyme is 38,200 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The subunit molecular weight is 18,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and 17,000 as determined by gel filtration in guanidine hydrochloride, suggesting that the enzyme is a dimer in its native state. Cross-linking the enzyme with dimethylsuberimidate confirms the dimeric structure and peptide mapping data suggested that the subunits are quite similar if not identical. The amino acid composition reveals that 33% of the residues are hydrophobic."

Form A which was obtained with tertiary butanol as precipitating agent belongs to space group I 422 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 148.1 A and c = 134.9 A. This form diffracts to high resolution and will be used for further crystallographic studies. Form B is also tetragonal, space group P42212, with cell dimensions a = b = 145.4 A and c = 104.2 A. This form was obtained from ammonium sulfate precipitations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the enzyme is built up from subunits of molecular weight 37,000. The asymmetric units of both crystal forms contain at least two such subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1573077348,"The anomeric proton magnetic resonances of Mycobacterium smegmatis 3-O-methylmannose polysaccharide have chemical shifts intermediate betwen those of nonaglucoamylose and alpha-cyclodextrin, and on addition of palmitic acid most of these resonances are shifted upfield toward that of the cyclodextrin. This suggests that the methylated polysaccharide could have a conformation with some secondary structure intermediate between those of the two reference compounds, and that it forms a tightened coil upon addition of the lipid which yields an inclusion complex with the polysaccharide. The change in chemical shift is linear with lipid concentration, which indicates that the complex undergoes rapid exchange with free polysaccharide. The changes in proton chemical shifts of the polysaccharide and of the palmitic acid are consistent with the fatty acid being inserted in the coiled polysaccharide with its carboxyl group near the methyl aglycon."
https://openalex.org/W184511202,"Bovine erythrocyte green hemoprotein was shown to undergo rapid and complete bleaching during aerobic reduction by dithionite. In order to explain this phenomenon, we have studied the reactions of the ferrihemoprotein with dithionite and H202 and the reactions of the ferrohemoprotein with HzOz and OZ. Bleaching caused by aerobic dithionite was shown not to involve either superoxide or bisulfite anions. Inhibition by the ligands CO and pyridine suggested that a free heme site was necessary for bleaching and that the ferrous hemoprotein may be involved. Catalase strongly inhibits this bleaching, implying that HzOz (produced in the aerobic dithionite solution) is involved. The ferrihemoprotein is bleached by HzOz at pH 7.2, 25”C, in a reaction which involves a complex with Hz02 (KD = 1.3 mM) that decays at a rate of 0.14 s-l. This reaction is inhibited by CN(Z& = K. = 0.083 mu). HzOz reacts more rapidly with ferrohemoprotein; within 5 s, 35 to 50% of the hemoprotein is bleached and the remainder is oxidized to ferrihemoprotein. The anaerobic reduction of ferrihemoprotein by dithionite is very fast. These findings lead to the conclusion that in the aerobic bleaching reaction dithionite both generates HzOz by reaction with O2 and maintains the heme in the more reactive ferrous state. The ferrohemoprotein reacts rapidly with O2 to form a transient Complex (& = 8.7 X Ioe5 M) which decays to the ferrihemoprotein at a rate of 501 S -’ at 5°C. This oxidation is accompanied by a loss of 13 to 20% of the original absorbance of the ferrihemoprotein. Like green hemoprotein, cytochrome P-450 is bleached by HzOz, but at a much slower rate; ferrocytochrome P-450 reacts more rapidly than does ferricytochrome P-450. The mechanism for the bleaching is envisioned to be similar to the peroxidatic cycle of Yokota and Yamazaki ((1965) Biochim Biophys. Actu 105, 301) with the important difference that the addition of reducing equivalents to Compounds I and II of the peroxidatic cycle has been replaced by the loss of HO l radicals. We postulate that HO* generated by such a mechanism attacks, and thereby bleaches, the porphyrin ring."
https://openalex.org/W1487511095,"Considerable controversy has surrounded the question of whether the exocrine pancreas discharges digestive enzymes in a parallel or nonparallel fashion. A recent report (Rothman, S.S., and Wilking, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3543-3549) claimed that the in vitro rabbit pancreas demonstrated nonparallel enzyme discharge after stimulation with cholecystokinin/pancreozymin, but that parallel discharge followed stimulation with the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin/pancreozymin. It was suggested that the full hormone acted to inhibit chymotrypsinogen secretion while stimulating trypsinogen secretion. Because of the fundamental importance of this question to our understanding of the exocrine secretion of exportable proteins, we have repeated these experiments using the same preparation and stimulant but have observed only parallel enzyme discharge. We conclude that it is unlikely that cholecystokinin/pancreozymin causes the selective inhibition of chymotrypsinogen secretion."

A cDNA transcript primed by oligo(dT) hybridized to the poly(A) segment of fibroin mRNA was used to determine the sequence immediately adjacent to poly(A). A specific primer complementary to this sequence then allowed synthesis of 5'-terminally homogeneous transcripts amenable to analysis by rapid sequencing methods. The 3' terminus of fibroin mRNA contains an unusually long oligo(U) stretch, as well as the sequence A2UA3 recently found in 3' non-coding regions of other eukaryotic mRNAs.

The active form of the enzyme is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 32,000. The enzyme requires Mg2+ in the reaction mixture and displays a broad pH and monovalent cation requirement. Bgl I is not sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents but was affected by reagents that modify lysine and arginine residues. When lysine residues were modified by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, both binding and catalysis were diminished while modification of arginine residues by 2,3-butanedione inhibited the enzyme activity but had no effect on its binding properties."

The method uses high resolution sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by [5'-3H]polyuridylate hybridization to poly(A)-mRNA in gradient fractions. Polyadenylate, purified globin mRNA, and ribonuclease-treated lysate are used to standardize the hybridization assay.

These hemoglobins exhibit a variety of ligand-dependent association states with the met-hemoglobins existing as monomers and liganded hemoglobins as dimers at physiological concentrations. Monomeric methemoglobin C chain crystallizes in space group P21, with a = 46.0 A, b = 45.3 A, c = 40.9 A, beta = 104.5 degrees, and one monomer per asymmetric unit. These crystals exhibit unusual spectroscopic behavior when examined with a polarizer, turning colorless in certain orientations. This implies that all the heme rings are nearly parallel within the crystals. Dimeric cyanmethemoglobin D chain crystallizes in space group P41212 (P43212), with a = b = 77.0 A, c = 61.5 A, and one-half a dimer per asymmetric unit. These homodimers thus possess a molecular 2-fold which is aligned with the crystallographic dyad."
