To address these issues, we screened for epigenetic regulators of iCM reprogramming and found that reducing levels of the polycomb complex gene Bmi1 significantly enhanced induction of beating iCMs from neonatal and adult mouse fibroblasts. The inhibitory role of Bmi1 in iCM reprogramming is mediated through direct interactions with regulatory regions of cardiogenic genes, rather than regulation of cell proliferation. Reduced Bmi1 expression corresponded with increased levels of the active histone mark H3K4me3 and reduced levels of repressive H2AK119ub at cardiogenic loci, and de-repression of cardiogenic gene expression during iCM conversion. Furthermore, Bmi1 deletion could substitute for Gata4 during iCM reprogramming. Thus, Bmi1 acts as a critical epigenetic barrier to iCM production. Bypassing this barrier simplifies iCM generation and increases yield, potentially streamlining iCM production for therapeutic purposes.

The adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capacity and is thus an important target for novel regenerative approaches to replenish lost cardiomyocytes (CMs) after cardiac injury (Laflamme and Murry, 2011Laflamme M.A. Murry C.E.

However, our limited understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying cardiac reprogramming has significantly hindered its potential translational applications. Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in shaping and maintaining cellular identities during developmental programming and cellular reprogramming. Recent studies on in vitro cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells demonstrated that temporal activation of functionally important cardiac genes requires coordinated programmed control of chromatin structure (Paige et al., 2012Paige S.L.

Likewise, cellular reprogramming is accompanied by profound changes in the epigenetic landscape (Dhawan et al., 2011Dhawan S. Georgia S. Tschen S.I. Fan G. Bhushan A.

This transition in epigenetic status is likely to be involved in suppressing the original cell-type-specific signature and establishing and stabilizing a target cell-type-specific program (Apostolou and Hochedlinger, 2013Apostolou E.

Epigenetics of reprogramming to induced pluripotency.Cell. 2013; 152: 1324-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Epigenetic alterations were also observed at both fibroblast- and CM-specific marker genes during iCM reprogramming (Fu et al., 2013Fu J.D. Stone N.R. Liu L. Spencer C.I. Qian L. Hayashi Y. Delgado-Olguin P. Ding S. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D.

However, how these epigenetic transitions are regulated remains elusive. iCM reprogramming, like other types of cellular reprogramming, is an inefficient and slow process, which is at least in part due to multiple epigenetic barriers that have not been identified. It also remains unclear whether iCM reprogramming shares similar epigenetic mechanisms with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming or has its own specific barriers. Here we report the first shRNA-based loss-of-function screen to explore the role of epigenetic factors in iCM reprogramming. Among the identified epigenetic regulators of iCM reprogramming, the polycomb ring finger oncogene Bmi1 acted as a major epigenetic barrier during the early phase of iCM reprogramming. Genetic and epistasis analyses suggested that the inhibitory effect of Bmi1 on iCM reprogramming was not completely mediated by its downstream effectors involved in cell proliferation such as p16Ink4a, p19Arf, and p53. Instead, we discovered an uncharacterized role of Bmi1 in directly binding the regulatory regions of several cardiogenic genes including Gata4. Knockdown of Bmi1 caused de-repression of endogenous Gata4 and could functionally replace Gata4 to induce beating iCMs. Thus, our work identifies Bmi1 as a critical epigenetic barrier at the early stage of iCM reprogramming and demonstrates that removing this early epigenetic barrier is sufficient to generate functional iCMs with fewer transcription factors. To identify potential epigenetic regulators of iCM reprogramming, we employed a loss-of-function approach to explore the function of 35 selected components of chromatin modifying or remodeling complexes (Table S1). For each candidate, a pool of shRNAs (four to six independent shRNA constructs) targeting different regions within the gene was used and knockdown efficiency was validated (Table S1 and Figure S1A). The individual shRNA pools were then transduced into neonatal cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) isolated by using explant culture method (ExCFs) from a transgenic α-muscle heavy chain (αMHC)-GFP reporter mouse (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D.

Berry E.C. Fu J.D. Ieda M. Srivastava D. Reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 1204-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) together with retroviruses expressing polycistronic Mef2c/Gata4/Tbx5 (MGT) (Wang et al., 2015aWang L. Liu Z. Yin C. Asfour H. Chen O. Li Y. Bursac N. Liu J. Qian L. Stoichiometry of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 influences the efficiency and quality of induced cardiac myocyte reprogramming.Circ. Res. 2015; 116: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Upon transduction of MGT, activation of GFP allowed us to follow the emergence of newly induced iCMs. Furthermore, we used cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) as an additional differentiated CM marker to monitor CF to CM fate conversion (Figure 1A). iCM reprogramming efficiency was determined by flow cytometry analysis to quantify the percentage of αMHC-GFP+ and cTnT+ cells (Figure 1A). Although to various degrees, knocking down 11 of the 35 epigenetic regulators reduced reprogramming efficiency (Figure 1B and Table S1). Silencing inhibitor of growth family member 1 (Ing1) or lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5B (Kdm5b/Plu1) resulted in at least 2-fold reduction in the percentages of αMHC-GFP+ or cTnT+ cells (Figure 1B and Table S1). Ing1 functions as a reader protein of H3K4me3/2, while Plu1 acts as an H3K4me3/2 demethylase (Table S1). These observations highlight the importance of histone methylation during iCM reprogramming. On the contrary, loss of Plu1 function has been found to enhance iPSC reprogramming (Kidder et al., 2013Kidder B.L. Hu G. Yu Z.-X. Liu C. Zhao K. Extended self-renewal and accelerated reprogramming in the absence of Kdm5b.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 4793-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that this histone modifier might be required for iCM reprogramming while impeding reprogramming to pluripotency. In addition to the factors that were required for iCM reprogramming, we also identified epigenetic regulators that likely acted as barriers to iCM reprogramming (Figures 1B and 1C). shRNA pools against K(lysine) acetyltransferase 7 (Kat7/Myst2), K(lysine) acetyltransferase 6A (Kat6a/Myst3), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C (Kdm5c/Smcx) or inhibitor of growth family member 5 (Ing5) resulted in a roughly 2-fold increase in iCM reprogramming efficiency (Figure 1C and Table S1). Myst2 and Myst3 belong to the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases, whereas Smcx functions as an H3K4 demethylase (Table S1). Knockdown of helicase lymphoid specific (Hells/Lsh/Smarca6) resulted in a 6-fold increase in the percentage of cTnT+ cells (Figures 1B and 1C, Table S1). Hells encodes a component of the SWI/SNF complex, and targeted deletion of Hells leads to a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and perinatal lethality (Geiman et al., 2001Geiman T.M. Tessarollo L. Anver M.R. Kopp J.B. Ward J.M. Muegge K. Lsh, a SNF2 family member, is required for normal murine development.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In conclusion, chromatin regulatory factors involved in various aspects of epigenetic regulation function either as facilitators of or barriers to iCM reprogramming. Among the 35 candidate epigenetic regulators, ablation of Bmi1, which encodes a polycomb group protein homologous to Drosophila protein Posterior Sex Combs (Psc) (van Lohuizen et al., 1991van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Scheijen B. Wientjens E. van der Gulden H. Berns A.

Flow analysis and quantification showed that knocking down Bmi1 led to a 10-fold increase in the percentage of cTnT+ cells (Figures 1B and 1C, Table S1). This significant enhancement of iCM reprogramming efficiency caused by loss of Bmi1 function is in sharp contrast to its positive role in iPSC reprogramming (Moon et al., 2011Moon J.-H. Heo J.S. Kim J.S. Jun E.K. Lee J.H. Kim A. Kim J. Whang K.Y. Kang Y.-K. Yeo S. et al.Reprogramming fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells with Bmi1.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Onder et al., 2012Onder T.T. Kara N. Cherry A. Sinha A.U. Zhu N. Bernt K.M. Cahan P. Marcarci B.O. Unternaehrer J. Gupta P.B. et al.Chromatin-modifying enzymes as modulators of reprogramming.Nature. 2012; 483: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to focus on exploring the role of Bmi1 during fibroblast conversion into iCM. To further determine the effect of Bmi1 knockdown on iCM reprogramming, we used two individual Bmi1 shRNAs, along with MGT to convert neonatal ExCFs into iCMs. Consistently, silencing Bmi1 with these two shRNAs individually resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of αMHC-GFP+ and cTnT+ cells compared to shNT controls (Figures S1B and S1C). Pooled shBmi1 oligos had a knockdown efficiency of >90% and increased iCM reprogramming efficiency to an even greater degree than individual shBmi1 oligos (Figures S1C and S1D). For the rest of the study, we used shBmi1-pool (referred to as shBmi1) unless otherwise indicated. shBmi1 treatment not only increased the percentage of iCMs but also resulted in an increased number of iCMs compared to shNT control treatment. We quantified the absolute numbers of αMHC-GFP+ or cTnT+ iCMs using flow cytometry and observed a significant increase in the numbers of both αMHC-GFP+ and cTnT+ cells (Figure S1E). Additionally, shBmi1-treated, freshly isolated neonatal CFs exhibited a similar increase in reprogramming efficiency and the numbers of αMHC-GFP+ or cTnT+ cells (Figures 1D and 1E). We next determined if this increased CF to iCM conversion rate could translate into enhanced structural and functional maturation. We performed immunocytochemistry (ICC) on shBmi1- and shNT-treated cultures 2 weeks after infection and found that Bmi1 knockdown resulted in a significantly increased number of cells expressing sarcomeric αActinin and cTnT (Figures 1F–1H). In addition, Bmi1 knockdown gave rise to an 88.7% increase in the number of αActinin+ iCMs that assembled sarcomeres (Figure 1I). More strikingly, we observed twice as many beating iCMs that exhibited periodic calcium oscillation in shBmi1 cultures as we did in control cultures (Figures 1J–1L, Movie S1, Movie S2, and Movie S3). Furthermore, molecular characterization of the Bmi1-depleted and control cells by examination of the expression of a panel of sarcomere, contractility, and ion channel genes revealed higher expression of these functionally important cardiac genes in the Bmi1-depleted cultures (Figure 1M). Taken together, our data demonstrate that knockdown of Bmi1 remarkably enhances MGT-mediated iCM reprogramming. To further assess the repressive function of Bmi1 on cardiac reprogramming, we used the following three commonly used reprogramming methods in conjunction with shBmi1 or shNT to generate iCMs from freshly isolated neonatal CFs: (1) the MGT polycistronic construct (Wang et al., 2015aWang L. Liu Z. Yin C. Asfour H. Chen O. Li Y. Bursac N. Liu J. Qian L. Stoichiometry of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 influences the efficiency and quality of induced cardiac myocyte reprogramming.Circ. Res. 2015; 116: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), (2) separate M+G+T (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by defined factors.Cell. 2010; 142: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), or (3) M+G+T plus Hand2 (M+G+T+H) (Song et al., 2012Song K. Nam Y.-J. Luo X. Qi X. Tan W. Huang G.N. Acharya A. Smith C.L. Tallquist M.D. Neilson E.G. et al.Heart repair by reprogramming non-myocytes with cardiac transcription factors.Nature. 2012; 485: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed the highest percentage of αMHC-GFP+ or cTnT+ cells by MGT, but the highest absolute number of cTnT+ cells by M+G+T+H regardless of Bmi1 knockdown (Figures 2A–2F), reflecting varied reprogramming outcomes depending on which marker was used as the readout. Nevertheless, Bmi1 knockdown uniformly increased iCM percentage across all reprogramming conditions (Figures 2A–2F) and exerted the most influence over the MGT transduced cultures (Figures 2A–2F). The significant increase in reprogramming efficiency observed with Bmi1 knockdown under all conditions indicates that depletion of Bmi1 influences cardiac reprogramming mediated by different cocktails and leads to higher reprogramming efficiency (reached to 50% of marker+ iCMs under MGT induction) compared to the corresponding controls. Furthermore, we validated our findings in multiple cell types of diverse origin, including mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), neonatal tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs), adult CFs, adult TTFs, and CD31+ endothelial cells. Upon Bmi1 knockdown, all cell types exhibited a significant increase in the percentage and absolute number of cardiac-marker-positive iCMs 10 days after MGT transduction (Figures 2G–2P). Quantification of flow and ICC analyses also revealed that enhancement of iCM induction varied depending on the cell types assayed (Figures 2G–2P), suggesting potential intrinsic variability of genetic and epigenetic features and cell plasticity among different cell types. To further validate the enhancement of cardiac reprogramming in non-fibroblast CD31+ endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of several sarcomere and ion channel markers, including Myh6, Myl7, Actc1, Pln, Slc8a1, Scn5a, Cacna1c, Ryr2, and Myl2, and we found that these markers were more highly expressed in shBmi1-treated cells, especially the ion channel marker genes (Figure S2A). Thus, Bmi1 knockdown enhances iCM reprogramming under a variety of conditions and across diverse cell types. Given the opposing effects of Bmi1 depletion on iCM reprogramming and iPSC reprogramming, we next asked if Bmi1 acted as a general repressor of somatic reprogramming/transdifferentiation or functioned specifically as a repressor of iCM reprogramming. To this end, we generated induced neurons (iNs) from MEFs by following a recently reported protocol (Xue et al., 2013Xue Y. Ouyang K. Huang J. Zhou Y. Ouyang H. Li H. Wang G. Wu Q. Wei C. Bi Y. et al.Direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons by reprogramming PTB-regulated microRNA circuits.Cell. 2013; 152: 82-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) with shBmi1 or shNT. The efficiency of iN reprogramming was assessed using ICC of neuron marker microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Figure S2B). Although Bmi1 knockdown appeared to alter the morphology of the MAP2+ iNs (Figure S2B), it did not have any effect on the number of MAP2+ cells (Figure S2C). Further analysis revealed that there was no significant change in the expression levels of additional neuronal markers such as class III β-tubulin (Tubb3) and Nestin (Nes) with shBmi1 compared to the control (Figure S2D). These results indicate that Bmi1 does not regulate direct neuron reprogramming but rather acts as a specific repressor of the iCM reprogramming. Next, we sought to determine the temporal window for silencing Bmi1 to achieve an enhancement in iCM induction. We performed flow analysis and quantified the percentage of αMHC-GFP+ and cTnT+ cells generated from shBmi1- and shNT-treated reprogramming ExCFs at a series of time points. Enhancement in iCM reprogramming efficiency by shBmi1 occurred as early as day 3 (Figures 3A and 3B ). Likewise, western blot analysis indicated that Bmi1 depletion resulted in a significant upregulation of cardiac marker αMHC-GFP protein expression as early as day 3 (Figure 3C). These observations were further confirmed by the higher expression of a panel of CM marker genes in shBmi1-treated reprogramming fibroblasts at day 3, suggesting an effect of Bmi1 knockdown on cardiac fate acquisition at the early stage of reprogramming (Figure 3D). To further define the critical time window for Bmi1 knockdown, we introduced Bmi1 shRNAs into neonatal ExCFs at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 days after MGT transduction (Figure 3E). Interestingly, we found that iCM reprogramming efficiency as indicated by the percentages of αMHC-GFP+ or cTnT+ cells was reliably increased only if shBmi1 was introduced within 3 days of MGT infection (Figures 3F and 3G). Depletion of Bmi1 at 5 days after MGT transduction did not noticeably affect iCM generation (Figures 3F and 3G). Moreover, reasoning that chromatin remodeling is a prerequisite step to cell fate conversion, we asked if removing the epigenetic barrier by knocking down Bmi1 prior to the introduction of MGT could lead to a similar enhancement. Fibroblasts were infected with shBmi1-puro lentiviruses and cultured under puromycin selection for 3 days before MGT transduction (Figure 3H). Flow cytometry analysis showed that shBmi1-treated neonatal ExCFs also had significantly higher percentages of αMHC-GPF+ and cTnT+ cells compared to those of the controls (Figure 3I). These data suggest that Bmi1 functions during the early stage of iCM reprogramming and that knockdown of Bmi1 must occur within the first 3 days of or prior to MGT introduction to enhance iCM reprogramming. One of the well-documented functions of Bmi1 is to regulate cell proliferation and senescence through its downstream effectors p16Ink4a, p19Arf, and p53 (Jacobs et al., 1999Jacobs J.J. Kieboom K.

We asked if the enhancement of iCM reprogramming by Bmi1 knockdown was mediated through an upregulation of p16Ink4a (isoform 2 of Cdkn2a), p19Arf (isoform 1 of Cdkn2a), or p53. We first analyzed their expression in control shNT- and shBmi1-infected reprogramming fibroblasts and found that Bmi1 depletion indeed resulted in an upregulation of the expression of these target genes during iCM reprogramming (Figure S3A). We then knocked down Bmi1 and its target genes simultaneously to determine if the increased reprogramming efficiency"

We aimed to reduce the number of medicines consumed by people living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). Secondary objectives were to explore the effect of deprescribing on survival, falls, fractures, hospital admissions, cognitive, physical, and bowel function, quality of life, and sleep.Ninety-five people aged over 65 years living in four RACF in rural mid-west Western Australia were randomised in an open study. The intervention group (n = 47) received a deprescribing intervention, the planned cessation of non-beneficial medicines. The control group (n = 48) received usual care. Participants were monitored for twelve months from randomisation. Primary outcome was change in the mean number of unique regular medicines. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, six, and twelve months.Study participants had a mean age of 84.3 ± 6.9 years and 52% were female. Intervention group participants consumed 9.6 ± 5.0 and control group participants consumed 9.5 ± 3.6 unique regular medicines at baseline. Of the 348 medicines targeted for deprescribing (7.4 ± 3.8 per person, 78% of regular medicines), 207 medicines (4.4 ± 3.4 per person, 59% of targeted medicines) were successfully discontinued. The mean change in number of regular medicines at 12 months was -1.9 ± 4.1 in intervention group participants and +0.1 ± 3.5 in control group participants (estimated difference 2.0 ± 0.9, 95%CI 0.08, 3.8, p = 0.04). Twelve intervention participants and 19 control participants died within 12 months of randomisation (26% versus 40% mortality, p = 0.16, HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.22) There were no significant differences between groups in other secondary outcomes. The main limitations of this study were the open design and small participant numbers.Deprescribing reduced the number of regular medicines consumed by frail older people living in residential care with no significant adverse effects on survival or other clinical outcomes.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12611000370909."
https://openalex.org/W2290893644,"Objectives Little is known about health outcomes related to electronic cigarette (EC) use, despite its growing popularity. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between EC use and asthma. Methods The study design is a cross-sectional study. A total of 35,904 high school students were included as the final study population. The presence of asthma was based on a student’s self-reported doctor diagnosis of asthma in the past 12 months. Results Prevalence rates of asthmatics in ‘current EC users’ (n = 2,513), ‘former EC users’ (n = 2,078), and ‘never EC users’ (n = 31,313), were 3.9% (n = 98), 2.2% (n = 46) and 1.7% (n = 530), respectively. Comparing ‘current EC’ users with ‘never EC’ users, the unadjusted OR for asthma was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.89–2.94). In order to control for the effect of conventional cigarette (CC) smoking, after stratifying the subjects by the three CC smoking categories (never CC, former CC, and current CC), within the ‘never CC’ category, the unadjusted OR for asthma for ‘current EC’ users was 3.41 (95% CI: 1.79–6.49), and the adjusted OR was 2.74 (95% CI: 1.30–5.78). Severe asthma was reflected by the number of days absent from school due to asthma symptoms; current EC users had the highest adjusted OR for severe asthma compared to ‘never EC’ users. Conclusions When compared to a reference population of high school students in South Korea, EC users have an increased association with asthma and are more likely to have had days absent from school due to severe asthma symptoms. In conclusion, the results indicate that EC use may be a risk factor for asthma. The results may be useful in developing a scientific basis for the evaluation of a potential health hazard by EC."

Thus, ieCPCs are a powerful system to study cardiovascular specification and provide strategies for regenerative medicine in the heart. Heart failure (HF) is a devastating disease and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. HF often follows myocardial infarction (MI) that is usually accompanied by a massive loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs). These CMs cannot be regenerated by the adult mammalian heart and cannot yet be replaced and/or regenerated via cell-based therapies. Unfortunately, transplanting CMs into an infarcted heart yields only transient and marginal benefits (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Shortly after transplantation, most CMs are soon lost. These effects are likely caused by the limited proliferative capacity of fully differentiated CMs and a lack of blood-vessel formation to supply oxygen and nutrients (Lam et al., 2009Lam J.T. Moretti A. Laugwitz K.L. Multipotent progenitor cells in regenerative cardiovascular medicine.Pediatr. Cardiol. 2009; 30: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, to create more effective regenerative therapies, we need to find a cell type that can be extensively expanded in vitro and robustly differentiated into cardiovascular cells in a diseased heart. Cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) may offer a promising avenue for cardiac-regenerative therapy. These cells evolve from the mesoderm during cardiogenesis, a well-orchestrated process in developing embryos that is recapitulated in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Patterned mesoderm gives rise to a hierarchy of downstream cellular intermediates that represent lineage-restricted CPCs for fully differentiated heart cells, including CMs, endothelial cells (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Each step in this hierarchy is tightly controlled by multiple stage-specific signals (e.g., Wnt, Activin/Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein [BMP], fibroblast growth factor [FGF], and Notch) (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C.

Signaling and transcriptional networks in heart development and regeneration.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a008292Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Additionally, the gradual loss of multipotency, or commitment of cell fate, is usually accompanied by a decreased capacity of cellular proliferation. Thus, by isolating CPCs that can extensively self-renew and possess multiple, but restricted, potentials to directly differentiate into these three cardiovascular cell types, we may encourage the development of more effective and potentially safer therapies for cardiac regeneration. A previous study identified one type of primitive CPCs that express two key marker genes, MESP1 and SSEA1 (Cao et al., 2013Cao N. Liang H. Huang J. Wang J. Chen Y. Chen Z. Yang H.T. Highly efficient induction and long-term maintenance of multipotent cardiovascular progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells under defined conditions.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); however, these cells more closely represent a mesodermal precursor and are not fully committed to a cardiac fate. To differentiate into CMs in vitro, these primitive CPCs require multiple and sequential developmental signals. This notion is supported by studies in which Mesp1+ cells not only contributed to heart development but also gave rise to non-cardiovascular mesodermal lineages, such as hematopoietic and skeletal muscle cells (Chan et al., 2013Chan S.S. Shi X. Toyama A. Arpke R.W. Dandapat A. Iacovino M. Kang J. Le G. Hagen H.R. Garry D.J. Kyba M.

Wythe J.D. George M. Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Bruneau B.G. Early patterning and specification of cardiac progenitors in gastrulating mesoderm.eLife. 2014; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consequently, such properties of primitive CPCs may comprise their own ability to efficiently differentiate and restore lost CMs within the damaged heart, which lacks the complex paracrine environment and tight temporal and spatial control seen in developing embryos. Several reports have also described more committed CPCs that are fully specified to a cardiovascular fate. Such lineage-restricted CPCs could be identified by several late-stage marker genes, including insulin gene enhancer protein 1 (Isl1), Nkx2-5, fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1; also known as vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 2), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PdgfR)-α (Moretti et al., 2006Moretti A. Caron L. Nakano A. Lam J.T. Bernshausen A. Chen Y. Qyang Y. Bu L. Sasaki M.

These cells directly differentiated into three cardiac lineages without stepwise developmental signals. For example, Isl1+ cells have been observed in postnatal and adult heart and enter fully differentiated cardiovascular lineages without the embryonic heart niche (Laugwitz et al., 2005Laugwitz K.L. Moretti A. Lam J. Gruber P. Chen Y. Woodard S. Lin L.Z. Cai C.L. Lu M.M. Reth M. et al.Postnatal isl1+ cardioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages.Nature. 2005; 433: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, Moretti et al., 2006Moretti A.

Unfortunately, although these committed CPCs might be more suitable for cardiac cell therapy in vivo, they have yet to be extensively expanded, thus significantly limiting their applications. To overcome these limitations, we systematically examined combinations of multiple signaling pathways involved in cardiogenesis and developed chemically defined conditions to identify a specific type of CPCs—reprogrammed from fibroblasts—that extensively self-renews and is restricted to a cardiovascular fate (i.e., directly giving rise to CMs, ECs, and SMCs without stepwise differentiation). These induced expandable CPCs (ieCPCs) can robustly self-renew for more than 18 passages (translated into >1016 ieCPCs from 105 starting fibroblasts) and still retain their original morphology, gene expression pattern, and multiple, but lineage-restricted, potentials to differentiate into three cardiovascular lineages within the heart. Implanted ieCPCs spontaneously differentiate into CMs, ECs, and SMCs in infarcted mouse hearts and benefit heart function following cardiac injury. With this system, similar expandable CPCs could also be differentiated and captured from PSCs. This study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration that cardiovascular-restricted CPCs that can self-renew long term in vitro can also be directly induced from fibroblasts or differentiated from PSCs. These cells offer a useful source, uncompromised by growth arrest, for individualized cardiac cell therapies. To develop effective and personalized cell therapies, we need to obtain CPCs from an easily accessible source. To that end, we used cell activation and signaling-directed (CASD) lineage conversion, which transiently exposes cells to reprogramming factors and small molecules in conjunction with cardiac-inductive signals (Efe et al., 2011Efe J.A. Hilcove S. Kim J. Zhou H. Ouyang K. Wang G. Chen J. Ding S. Conversion of mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes using a direct reprogramming strategy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2014Wang H. Cao N. Spencer C.I. Nie B. Ma T. Xu T. Zhang Y. Wang X. Srivastava D. Ding S. Small molecules enable cardiac reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts with a single factor, Oct4.Cell Rep. 2014; 6: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Remarkably, we observed cell populations expressing markers corresponding to different stages of cardiogenesis during reprogramming, potentially helping identify and capture the desirable ieCPCs. To capture and expand putative ieCPCs arising during CASD-lineage conversion, we screened combinations of cardiogenic signals with a functional assay under the hypothesis that ieCPCs would respond and propagate with the right combination of cardiogenic signaling at optimal strength. We performed the conversion from secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (2nd MEFs) (Efe et al., 2011Efe J.A. Hilcove S. Kim J. Zhou H. Ouyang K. Wang G. Chen J. Ding S. Conversion of mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes using a direct reprogramming strategy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). First, we activated the cells by transiently expressing reprogramming factors for 6 days and allowed cardiac specification for another 2 days. From day 8, we treated the activated cells with various combinations of modulators of Wnt, Activin/Nodal, BMP, FGF, VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and Notch pathways at different concentrations for another 3 days and then passaged these cells three times under the same conditions, each 4 days apart. We then assessed spontaneous cardiac differentiation in cells that extensively propagated without showing morphological changes over the serial passages (Figure 1A). These cells were cultured in defined basal differentiation conditions without serum, knockout serum replacement, or any other exogenous differentiation cues, which is a key criterion in evaluating the committed cardiovascular fate. Cardiac differentiation of these cells was monitored by the presence of contractile patches and the expression of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a CM-specific marker. After repetitive testing and optimizing, we converged on one promising condition that retained the cardiac potential of induced cells after three passages, indicating that we captured putative ieCPCs. This condition contained BMP4 (5 ng/ml), Activin A (10 ng/ml), CHIR99021 (3 μM; a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor), and SU5402 (2 μM; an inhibitor of FGF, VEGF, and PDGF signaling), hereafter referred to as BACS. To characterize the molecular qualities of the putative ieCPCs, we examined the expression of cardiac markers by qPCR. Consistent with our hypothesis, a panel of transcription factors known to be enriched in committed CPCs—Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5, and Nkx2-5—were highly expressed in the expanded cells (Figure 1B), whereas differentiated CM markers—Tnnt2 and Myh6—were barely detectable (data not shown). Interestingly, Flk1 and Pdgfra, which encode the two CPC surface markers Flk-1 and PdgfR-α, were also highly enriched in expanded ieCPCs (Figure 1B). When expressed simultaneously, these two markers characterize CPCs committed to a cardiovascular lineage (Hirata et al., 2007Hirata H. Kawamata S. Murakami Y. Inoue K. Nagahashi A. Tosaka M. Yoshimura N. Miyamoto Y. Iwasaki H. Asahara T. Sawa Y. Coexpression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and fetal liver kinase 1 enhances cardiogenic potential in embryonic stem cell differentiation in vitro.J. Biosci.

Stage-specific optimization of activin/nodal and BMP signaling promotes cardiac differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cell lines.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 228-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). We then examined how cells responded to BACS treatment by analyzing Flk-1 and PdgfR-α expression with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells first appeared at day 8, responded to BACS treatment, and dominated the total population (more than 70%) by 1 week later; however, without BACS, these cells did not grow and eventually attenuated (Figures 1C and 1D). To distinguish whether the initial BACS treatment increased Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells through a mechanism of induction and/or proliferation, we evaluated EdU incorporation in transdifferentiating cells. We added EdU to the culture medium with BACS at day 8 and examined the percentage of EdU+/Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells at day 14. We found that about 33% of Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells did not incorporate EdU (Figure S1A), indicating that they were generated through direct induction and not proliferation. To determine if proliferation is needed to enrich Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells, we treated the cells with the cell-cycle inhibitor NU6140 (4 μM) along with BACS starting on day 8. We found that the ratio of Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells dramatically decreased at day 14 (Figure S1B). These data demonstrate that mechanisms of both cellular induction and proliferation contribute to the generation of Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells during initial BACS treatment. Next, we isolated the three subpopulations of cells (i.e., Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+, Flk-1−/PdgfR-α+, and Flk-1−/PdgfR-α−) on day 13 by FACS and examined their cardiogenic potentials. We found that only Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells efficiently gave rise to cTnT+ CMs (Figures 1E, 1F, S1C, and S1D) and formed spontaneously beating clusters. Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells that cultured for two passages in BACS to recover from the initial sorting stress showed more robust cardiac differentiation potential (Figure 1G). These data demonstrate that Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells, but not other subpopulations, represent the putative ieCPCs in BACS-treated cells. We examined whether Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ ieCPCs are truly committed cardiovascular precursors or more primitive CPCs that require specific signals and steps to be further specified. We found that treating ieCPCs with BMP4 significantly impaired their cardiac differentiation; however, treating them with the Wnt inhibitor IWP2 (5 μM), which promotes CM specification only from late-stage CPCs (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), dramatically enhanced their differentiation (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1E). Even in basal differentiation conditions without any specific induction signaling molecules, Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells directly differentiated into all three cardiovascular lineages, including CMs (cTnT+/cardiac troponin I [cTnI]+), ECs (CD31+/VE-cadherin+), and SMCs (α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA]+/calponin+) (Figure 1H). These distinct responses suggest that ieCPCs have already committed to a cardiovascular fate. In addition, ieCPCs highly expressed several committed CPC markers, including Gata4, Mef2c, Isl1, and Nkx2-5, and the proliferative marker Ki-67 (Figure 1I); whereas uncommitted mesoderm genes were only transiently expressed at earlier stages during the generation of ieCPCs (Figure S1F). Next, we determined whether ieCPC differentiation was restricted to a cardiovascular fate. We evaluated gene expression of mesoderm-derived non-cardiovascular lineages for ieCPCs that underwent either CM-, EC-, and SMC-specific differentiation or non-specific differentiation induced by fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 10 days. Under these conditions, we found no induction of non-cardiovascular genes, including markers of hematopoietic precursors, skeletal muscles, adipocytes, and chondrocytes (Figure S1G). To further confirm their restricted cardiovascular potentials, we cultured ieCPCs in the well-established induction conditions specified for each non-cardiovascular mesodermal lineage and compared the differentiation of ieCPCs with mesodermal cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In differentiated ieCPCs, we rarely found any c-Kit+/CD45+ hematopoietic progenitors or more differentiated c-Kit–/CD45+ hematopoietic cells, while mESC-derived mesodermal cells well generated those hematopoietic cells (Figure S1H). Consistently, ieCPCs showed limited or no potential to differentiate into myogenin+/MHC+ skeletal muscles, oil red O+ adipocytes, or alizarin red S+ chondrocytes compared with mESC-derived mesodermal cells, even when exposed to each lineage-specific induction cue (Figures S1I–S1K). To more precisely characterize cells after ieCPC differentiation, we analyzed the percentage of CMs (cTnT+), ECs (CD31+), and SMCs (α-SMA+) by FACS in CM, EC, SMC, and FBS differentiation conditions (Figure S2A). Isl1, a well-recognized CPC marker that diminishes as soon as CPCs enter a differentiation program (Moretti et al., 2006Moretti A. Caron L. Nakano A. Lam J.T. Bernshausen A. Chen Y. Qyang Y. Bu L. Sasaki M. Martin-Puig S. et al.Multipotent embryonic isl1+ progenitor cells lead to cardiac, smooth muscle, and endothelial cell diversification.Cell. 2006; 127: 1151-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), was used to trace undifferentiated ieCPCs (Figure S2B). We found that most (>93%) of the cells in each differentiation condition were CMs, ECs, SMCs, or undifferentiated ieCPCs (Figure S2C), confirming the restricted cardiovascular potentials of ieCPCs. Notably, we did not observe CM generation when ieCPCs were differentiated in FBS-containing conditions at a low seeding density (1 × 104 cells/cm2, suitable for inducing most mesodermal lineages) (Figures S1G and S2A). This deficiency can be prevented by using the cell seeding density optimal for CM differentiation (3 × 105 cells/cm2) and/or using BMP/Wnt inhibitors (Figure S2D). We purified Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ ieCPCs by FACS and tested whether we could expand them in long-term culture. We found that purified ieCPCs showed normal undifferentiated morphology and could stably propagate in BACS conditions for more than 18 passages (>1010-fold expansion) (Figure 2A). To evaluate whether ieCPCs expanded long term retain their original properties, we compared ieCPCs of early (<5), middle (5–10), and late (>10) passages. In these passages, we found that ieCPCs maintained a high degree of similarity in growth rate (Figure 2A), undifferentiated morphology (Figure 2B), and expression of both Flk-1 and PdgfR-α (Figure 2C) over time. By immunostaining, we found that ieCPCs similarly expressed Gata4, Mef2c, Isl1, Nkx2-5, and Ki-67 at early, middle, and late passages (Figures 2D, S3A, and S3B); however, they did not express CM-, EC-, SMC- (Figures S3C–S3E), and pluripotency-related markers (Figures S3F–S3I), even after long-term expansion. To determine if each component in BACS was required for Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells to self-renew, we omitted each cytokine or chemical individually and evaluated cell expansion. We found that omitting any component of BACS dramatically reduced the percentage of Flk-1+/PdgfR-α+ cells (Figures 2E and 2F) and cell proliferation (Figure 2G) within three passages, suggesting that each component is indispensable. We also found that removing each component of the BACS cocktail caused SMC, EC, or CM marker genes to accumulate (Figure S3J), indicating that some cells spontaneously differentiated. These results suggest that each component of BACS synergistically represses cardiovascular differentiation of ieCPCs to sustain their long-term self-renewal. To examine the global transcriptional profile of ieCPCs, we compared the transcriptomes of early- and late-passage ieCPCs, their parental MEFs, cells at day 9 of reprogramming (D9), and cardiac derivatives from ieCPCs (ieCPC-CDs) by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). With hierarchical cluster analyses, we found that early- and late-passage ieCPCs had very similar gene expression profiles that clearly differed from other cell populations (Figure 3A). With Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that genes specifically expressed in ieCPCs were related to cell adhesion and heart-lineage commitment. We pairwise compared ieCPCs with MEFs, D9, and ieCPC-CDs and found that ieCPCs were mainly enriched with GO terms associated with CPC fate and functions, such as heart development and cell proliferation. Conversely, ieCPCs lacked GO terms involved in functions of other cell types, such as the immune response in MEFs, early embryonic development of germ layers in D9, and myocyte contraction in ieCPC-CDs (Figures 3A, 3B, S4A, and S4B). However, comparing early- and late-passage ieCPCs did not yield any GO terms that met the false discovery rate threshold of ≤0.05, suggesting that ieCPCs retained stable transcriptional signatures when expanded long term. To determine whether ieCPCs represent a particular stage of cardiac differentiation of ESCs, we compared them with cells at different stages during cardiac differentiation of mESCs, including undifferentiated ESCs, mesodermal cells, CPCs, and differentiated CMs (Wamstad et al., 2012Wamstad J.A.

We found that ieCPCs and ESC-derived CPCs had the highest transcriptional similarity compared with other reference cell types (Figures 3C and S4C–S4E) and represented an intermediate cardiogenic population between uncommitted mesoderm and terminally differentiated cardiovascular cells (Figure 3C). Next, we evaluated a panel of well-studied genes involved in CPC fate commitment. We found that ieCPCs highly expressed CPC-related genes, including transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and cell-signaling molecules (Figure 3D). However, they weakly expressed markers associated with other cell types, including fibroblasts, early mesoderm, endoderm, ectoderm, non-cardiovascular mesoderm, PSCs, epicardial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and differentiated CMs, ECs, and SMCs (Figure S4F), with expression levels no higher than the ESC-derived CPCs described by Wamstad et al., 2012Wamstad J.A.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that ieCPCs possess a global transcriptional pattern similar to that of normal CPCs derived from ESCs. We tested whether ieCPCs retain their multi-lineage potentials for cardiovascular differentiation when expanded long term. We cultured ieCPCs at late passages in differentiation medium supplemented with IWP2 (5 μM) and monitored their cardiac differentiation daily for spontaneously contracting cells (typically observed first at day 3 of differentiation). The number of beating cells gradually increased until day 10 and remained at a similar level for more than 1 month. Cardiac differentiation was robust, and synchronized beating sheets formed at day 10 (Movie S1). With immunostaining, we observed that CMs derived from ieCPCs (ieCPC-CMs) expressed several CM-specific markers (Figure 4A). We also analyzed gene expression by qPCR and detected many genes important for CM contraction and functional regulation (Figure 4B). FACS analysis of cTnT revealed that the efficiency of CM differentiation from ieCPCs was about 35% at day 10 (Figure 4C). Typically, 10,000 starting ieCPCs produced ∼30,000 total cells, from which we estimate a yield of approximately one CM per input ieCPC. Next, we further characterized ieCPC-CMs. By immunofluorescence of the cardiac-myofilament proteins, we found that single ieCPC-CMs displayed a well-organized sarcomeric structure with clear cross-striations at day 10 (Figure 4D). We confirmed this finding by transmission electron microscopy, in which the well-organized sarcomeres, myofibrillar bundles, and transverse Z bands were surrounded by ample mitochondria (Figure 4E). In addition, intracellular electrical recordings from single beating ieCPC-CMs at day 10 revealed robust action potentials (APs) that were synchronized 1:1 with rhythmic Ca2+ transients (Figure 4F), which closely resembled CMs derived from murine fetal hearts or PSCs (Kuzmenkin et al., 2009Kuzmenkin A.

Moreover, 1 μM isoproterenol (a β-adrenergic agonist) significantly increased the frequency of cell contraction and spontaneous Ca2+ transients.

We sought to examine regional variation in the microbial communities in the lungs of individuals with mild-to-moderate CF lung disease, to examine the relationship between the local microbiota and local damage, and to determine the relationships between microbiota in samples taken directly from the lung and the microbiota in spontaneously expectorated sputum. In this initial study, nine stable, adult CF patients with an FEV1>50% underwent regional sampling of different lobes of the right lung by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and protected brush (PB) sampling of mucus plugs. Sputum samples were obtained from six of the nine subjects immediately prior to the procedure. Microbial community analysis was performed on DNA extracted from these samples and the extent of damage in each lobe was quantified from a recent CT scan. The extent of damage observed in regions of the right lung did not correlate with specific microbial genera, levels of community diversity or composition, or bacterial genome copies per ml of BAL fluid. In all subjects, BAL fluid from different regions of the lung contained similar microbial communities. In eight out of nine subjects, PB samples from different regions of the lung were also similar in microbial community composition, and were similar to microbial communities in BAL fluid from the same lobe. Microbial communities in PB samples were more diverse than those in BAL samples, suggesting enrichment of some taxa in mucus plugs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the microbiota in different regions of the CF lung in clinically stable individuals with mild-to-moderate CF-related lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2289653619,"Anthocyanin pigments play many roles in plants, including providing protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. Many of the genes that mediate anthocyanin accumulation have been identified through studies of flowers and fruits; however, the mechanisms of genes involved in anthocyanin regulation in seedlings under low-temperature stimulus are less well understood. Genetic characterization of a tomato inbred line, FMTT271, which showed no anthocyanin pigmentation, revealed a mutation in a bHLH transcription factor (TF) gene, which corresponds to the ah (Hoffman's anthocyaninless) locus, and so the gene in FMTT271 at that locus was named ah. Overexpression of the wild type allele of AH in FMTT271 resulted in greater anthocyanin accumulation and increased expression of several genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. The expression of AH and anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings was shown to be developmentally regulated and induced by low-temperature stress. Additionally, transcriptome analyses of hypocotyls and leaves from the near-isogenic lines seedlings revealed that AH not only influences the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, but also genes associated with responses to abiotic stress. Furthermore, the ah mutation was shown to cause accumulation of reactive oxidative species and the constitutive activation of defense responses under cold conditions. These results suggest that AH regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis, thereby playing a protective role, and that this function is particularly important in young seedlings that are particularly vulnerable to abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2292096463,"Bees provide critical pollination services to 87% of angiosperm plants; however, the reliability of these services may become threatened as bee populations decline. Agricultural intensification, resulting in the simplification of environments at the landscape scale, greatly changes the quality and quantity of resources available for female bees to provision their offspring. These changes may alter or constrain the tradeoffs in maternal investment allocation between offspring size, number and sex required to maximize fitness. Here we investigate the relationship between landscape scale agricultural intensification and the size and number of individuals within a wild ground nesting bee species, Andrena nasonii. We show that agricultural intensification at the landscape scale was associated with a reduction in the average size of field collected A. nasonii adults in highly agricultural landscapes but not with the number of individuals collected. Small females carried significantly smaller (40%) pollen loads than large females, which is likely to have consequences for subsequent offspring production and fitness. Thus, landscape simplification is likely to constrain allocation of resources to offspring through a reduction in the overall quantity, quality and distribution of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2289322415,"Introduction Evidence based on ecological studies in China suggests that short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) is associated with cardiovascular mortality. However, there is less evidence of PM-related morbidity for coronary heart disease (CHD) in China. This study aims to investigate the relationship between acute PM exposure and CHD incidence in people aged above 40 in Shanghai. Methods Daily CHD events during 2005–2012 were identified from outpatient and emergency department visits. Daily average concentrations for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microns (PM10) were collected over the 8-year period. Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) were measured from 2009 to 2012. Analyses were performed using quasi-poisson regression models adjusting for confounders, including long-term trend, seasonality, day of the week, public holiday and meteorological factors. The effects were also examined by gender and age group (41–65 years, and >65 years). Results There were 619928 CHD outpatient and emergency department visits. The average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were 81.7μg/m3 and 38.6μg/m3, respectively. Elevated exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was related with increased risk of CHD outpatients and emergency department visits in a short time course. A 10 μg/m3 increase in the 2-day PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with increase of 0.23% (95% CI: 0.12%, 0.34%) and 0.74% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.04%) in CHD morbidity, respectively. The associations appeared to be more evident in the male and the elderly. Conclusion Short-term exposure to high levels of PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of CHD outpatient and emergency department visits. Season, gender and age were effect modifiers of their association."
https://openalex.org/W2290293100,"Brain mitochondrial dysfunction is hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, the role of synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of synaptic injury in AD has received increasing attention. Synaptosomal mitochondria are a subgroup of neuronal mitochondria specifically locating at synapses. They play an essential role in fueling synaptic functions by providing energy on the site; and their defects may lead to synaptic failure, which is an early and pronounced pathology in AD. In our previous studies we have determined early synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction in an AD animal model (J20 line) overexpressing human Amyloid beta (Aβ), the key mediator of AD. In view of the limitations of J20 line mice in representing the full aspects of amyloidopathy in AD cases, we employed 5xFAD mice which are thought to be a desirable paradigm of amyloidopathy as seen in AD subjects. In addition, we have also examined the status of synaptosomal mitochondrial dynamics as well as Parkin-mediated mitophagy which have not been previously investigated in this mouse model. In comparison to nontransgenic (nonTg mice), 5xFAD mice demonstrated prominent synaptosomal mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, synaptosomal mitochondria from the AD mouse model displayed imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics towards fission along with activated Parkin and LC3BII recruitment correlating to spatial learning & memory impairments in 5xFAD mice in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest that synaptosomal mitochondrial deficits are primary pathology in Aβ-rich environments and further confirm the relevance of synaptosomal mitochondrial deficits to the development of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2288578744,"An emerging concept of normal brain immune surveillance proposes that recently and moderately activated central memory T lymphocytes enter the central nervous system (CNS) directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the choroid plexus. Within the CSF space, T cells inspect the CNS environment for cognate antigens. This gate of entry into the CNS could also prevail at the initial stage of neuroinflammatory processes. To actually demonstrate T cell migration across the choroidal epithelium forming the blood-CSF barrier, an in vitro model of the rat blood-CSF barrier was established in an “inverse” configuration that enables cell transmigration studies in the basolateral to apical, i.e. blood/stroma to CSF direction. Structural barrier features were evaluated by immunocytochemical analysis of tight junction proteins, functional barrier properties were assessed by measuring the monolayer permeability to sucrose and the active efflux transport of organic anions. The migratory behaviour of activated T cells across the choroidal epithelium was analysed in the presence and absence of chemokines. The migration pathway was examined by confocal microscopy. The inverse rat BCSFB model reproduces the continuous distribution of tight junction proteins at cell margins, the restricted paracellular permeability, and polarized active transport mechanisms, which all contribute to the barrier phenotype in vivo. Using this model, we present experimental evidence of T cell migration across the choroidal epithelium. Cell migration appears to occur via a paracellular route without disrupting the restrictive barrier properties of the epithelial interface. Apical chemokine addition strongly stimulates T cell migration across the choroidal epithelium. The present data provide evidence for the controlled migration of T cells across the blood-CSF barrier into brain. They further indicate that this recruitment route is sensitive to CSF-borne chemokines, extending the relevance of this migration pathway to neuroinflammatory and neuroinfectious disorders which are typified by elevated chemokine levels in CSF."
https://openalex.org/W2293264621,"Aberrant activation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) maintenance; both processes can result in tumor progression and treatment resistance in several types of human cancer. Hh cooperates with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in embryogenesis. We found that the Hh signaling pathway was silenced in EGFR-TKI-sensitive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, while it was inappropriately activated in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells, accompanied by EMT induction and ABCG2 overexpression. Upregulation of Hh signaling through extrinsic SHH exposure downregulated E-cadherin expression and elevated Snail and ABCG2 expression, resulting in gefitinib tolerance (P < 0.001) in EGFR-TKI-sensitive cells. Blockade of the Hh signaling pathway using the SMO antagonist SANT-1 restored E-cadherin expression and downregulate Snail and ABCG2 in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells. A combination of SANT-1 and gefitinib markedly inhibited tumorigenesis and proliferation in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that hyperactivity of Hh signaling resulted in EGFR-TKI resistance, by EMT introduction and ABCG2 upregulation, and blockade of Hh signaling synergistically increased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in primary and secondary resistant NSCLC cells. E-cadherin expression may be a potential biomarker of the suitability of the combined application of an Hh inhibitor and EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLCs."
https://openalex.org/W2291245536,"The AP2/ERF transcription factors play crucial roles in plant growth, development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. A total of 119 AP2/ERF genes (JcAP2/ERFs) have been identified in the physic nut genome; they include 16 AP2, 4 RAV, 1 Soloist, and 98 ERF genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that physic nut AP2 genes could be divided into 3 subgroups, while ERF genes could be classed into 11 groups or 43 subgroups. The AP2/ERF genes are non-randomly distributed across the 11 linkage groups of the physic nut genome and retain many duplicates which arose from ancient duplication events. The expression patterns of several JcAP2/ERF duplicates in the physic nut showed differences among four tissues (root, stem, leaf, and seed), and 38 JcAP2/ERF genes responded to at least one abiotic stressor (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation, and nitrogen starvation) in leaves and/or roots according to analysis of digital gene expression tag data. The expression of JcERF011 was downregulated by salinity stress in physic nut roots. Overexpression of the JcERF011 gene in rice plants increased its sensitivity to salinity stress. The increased expression levels of several salt tolerance-related genes were impaired in the JcERF011-overexpressing plants under salinity stress."

Children completed measures of symbolic comparison, phonological awareness, arithmetic, reading at the start of third grade and the latter two were retested at the start of fourth grade. Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations indicated that symbolic comparison was a powerful domain-specific predictor of arithmetic and that phonological awareness was a unique predictor of reading. Crucially, the strength of these independent associations was not significantly different. This indicates that symbolic numerical magnitude processing is as important to arithmetic development as phonological awareness is to reading and suggests that symbolic numerical magnitude processing is a good candidate for screening children at risk for developing mathematical difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W2290207414,"Parasitism has both direct and indirect effects on hosts. Indirect effects (such as behavioural changes) may be common, although are often poorly described. This study examined sarcoptic mange (caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei) in the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), a species that shows severe symptoms of infection and often causes mortality. Wombats showed alterations to above ground behaviours associated with mange. Infected wombats were shown to be active outside of the burrow for longer than healthy individuals. Additionally, they spent more time scratching and drinking, and less time walking as a proportion of time spent above ground when compared with healthy individuals. They did not spend a higher proportion of time feeding, but did have a slower feeding rate and were in poorer body condition. Thermal images showed that wombats with mange lost considerably more heat to the environment due to a diminished insulation layer. Infection status did not have an effect on burrow emergence time, although this was strongly dependent on maximum daily temperature. This study, through the most detailed behavioural observations of wombats to date, contributes to a broader understanding of how mange affects wombat health and abundance, and also to our understanding of the evolution of host responses to this parasite. Despite being globally dispersed and impacting over 100 species with diverse intrinsic host traits, the effects of mange on hosts are relatively poorly understood, and it is possible that similar effects of this disease are conserved in other host species. The indirect effects that we observed may extend to other pathogen types."
https://openalex.org/W2291615063,"Objective Obesity in pregnancy may be associated with reduced placental transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). The objective of this study was to examine associations between maternal BMI and maternal and cord blood levels of 25-OHD in full term neonates born to a single racial cohort residing at similar latitude. Secondary objectives were to examine associations between maternal glucose tolerance with maternal levels of 25-OHD and the relationship between cord blood 25-OHD levels and neonatal size. Methods This study was conducted among participants of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) Study meeting the following criteria: residing at latitudes 41–43°, maternal white race, and gestational age 39–41 weeks. Healthy pregnant women underwent measures of height, weight, and a 75-g fasting oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at approximately 28 weeks gestation. Maternal and cord blood sera were analyzed for total 25-OHD by HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included ANOVA and linear regression models. Results Maternal and cord blood (N = 360) mean levels (sd) of 25-OHD were 37.2 (11.2) and 23.4 (9.2) ng/ml, respectively, and these levels were significantly different among the 3 field centers (ANOVA p< 0.001). Maternal serum 25-OHD was lower by 0.40 ng/ml for BMI higher by 1 kg/m2 (p<0.001) in an adjusted model. Maternal fasting plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity, and presence of GDM were not associated with maternal serum 25-OHD level when adjusted for maternal BMI. Cord blood 25-OHD was lower by 0.26 ng/ml for maternal BMI higher by 1 kg/m2 (p<0.004). With adjustment for maternal age, field center, birth season and maternal serum 25-OHD, the association of cord blood 25-OHD with maternal BMI was attenuated. Neither birth weight nor neonatal adiposity was significantly associated with cord blood 25-OHD levels. Conclusion These results suggest that maternal levels of 25-OHD are associated with maternal BMI. The results also suggest that interpretation of neonatal 25-OHD levels may need to incorporate specific maternal factors in addition to season of birth and latitude."
https://openalex.org/W2289185591,"Objective According to epidemiological studies, gay men are at a higher risk of mental disorders than heterosexual men. In the current study, the minority stress theory was investigated in German gay men: 1) it was hypothesized that minority stressors would positively predict mental health problems and that 2) group-level coping and social support variables would moderate these predictions negatively. Methods Data from 1,188 German self-identified gay men were collected online. The questionnaire included items about socio-demographics, minority stress (victimization, rejection sensitivity, and internalized homonegativity), group-level coping (disclosure of sexual orientation, homopositivity, gay affirmation, gay rights support, and gay rights activism), and social support (gay social support and non-gay social support). A moderated multiple regression was conducted. Results Minority stressors positively predicted mental health problems. Group-level coping did not interact with minority stressors, with the exception of disclosure and homopositivity interacting marginally with some minority stressors. Further, only two interactions were found for social support variables and minority stress, one of them marginal. Gay and non-gay social support inversely predicted mental health problems. In addition, disclosure and homopositivity marginally predicted mental health problems. Conclusions The findings imply that the minority stress theory should be modified. Disclosure does not have a relevant effect on mental health, while social support variables directly influence mental health of gay men. Group-level coping does not interact with minority stressors relevantly, and only one relevant interaction between social support and minority stress was found. Further longitudinal or experimental replication is needed before transferring the results to mental health interventions and prevention strategies for gay men."
https://openalex.org/W2292636747,"The differential evolution algorithm has been widely applied on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning. At present, four random tuning parameters exist for differential evolution algorithm, namely, population size, differential weight, crossover, and generation number. These tuning parameters are required, together with user setting on path and computational cost weightage. However, the optimum settings of these tuning parameters vary according to application. Instead of trial and error, this paper presents an optimization method of differential evolution algorithm for tuning the parameters of UAV path planning. The parameters that this research focuses on are population size, differential weight, crossover, and generation number. The developed algorithm enables the user to simply define the weightage desired between the path and computational cost to converge with the minimum generation required based on user requirement. In conclusion, the proposed optimization of tuning parameters in differential evolution algorithm for UAV path planning expedites and improves the final output path and computational cost."
https://openalex.org/W2289380231,"Although its incidence has been decreasing during the last decade, malaria is still a major public health issue in Madagascar. The use of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN) remains a key malaria control intervention strategy in Madagascar, however, it encounters some obstacles. The present study aimed to explore the local terminology related to malaria, information channels about malaria, attitude towards bed nets, and health care seeking practices in case of fever. This article presents novel qualitative findings about malaria. Until now, no such data has been published for Madagascar.A comparative qualitative study was carried out at four sites in Madagascar, each differing by malaria epidemiology and socio-cultural background of the populations. Seventy-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with biomedical and traditional caregivers, and members of the local population. In addition, observations of the living conditions and the uses of bed net were conducted.Due to the differences between local and biomedical perspectives on malaria, official messages did not have the expected impact on population in terms of prevention and care seeking behaviors. Rather, most information retained about malaria was spread through informal information circulation channels. Most interviewees perceived malaria as a disease that is simple to treat. Tazomoka (""mosquito fever""), the Malagasy biomedical word for malaria, was not used by populations. Tazo (""fever"") and tazomahery (""strong fever"") were the terms more commonly used by members of the local population to refer to malaria related symptoms. According to local perceptions in all areas, tazo and tazomahery were not caused by mosquitos. Each of these symptoms required specific health recourse. The usual fever management strategies consisted of self-medication or recourse to traditional and biomedical caregivers. Usage of bed nets was intermittent and was not directly linked to protection against malaria in the eyes of most Malagasy people.This article highlights the conflicting understanding of malaria between local perceptions and the biomedical establishment in Madagascar. Local perceptions of malaria present a holistic vision of the disease that includes various social and cultural dimensions, rather than reflecting one universal understanding, as in the biomedical image. The consideration of this ""holistic vision"" and other socio-cultural aspects surrounding the understanding of malaria is essential in implementing successful control intervention strategies."

The study objective was to describe how street-connected children and youth (SCCY) in Eldoret, Kenya, perceive pregnancy. Methods This qualitative study was conducted between August 2013 and February 2014. A total of 65 SCCY aged 11–24 years were purposively sampled from the three referral points: 1) A dedicated study clinic for vulnerable children and youth at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH); 2) Primary locations in which street children reside known as “bases/barracks”; and 3) Street youth community-based organizations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Content analysis was performed after thematic coding by 4 independent coders. Results The majority of SCCY interviewed were male (69%) and sexually active (81.5%). None had gone beyond primary level of education. The strong desire for SCCY to go through conventional life experiences including marriage and child bearing was evident. Sub-themes around desired pregnancies included: sense of identity with other SCCY, sense of hope, male ego, lineage, source of income, and avoiding stigmatization. The desire for children was highly gendered with male SCCY more focused on their social status in the street community, while for females it was primarily for survival on the street. Female SCCY generally lacked agency around reproductive health issues and faced gender-based violence. Abortions (either assisted or self-induced), infanticide, and child abandonment were reported. Respondents described a lucrative market for babies born to SCCY and alleged that healthcare workers were known to abduct these babies following hospital deliveries. Conclusion Our findings indicate gender differences in the reasons why SCCY become pregnant and have children. We also noted gender inequalities in reproductive health decisions. SCCY friendly interventions that provide tailored reproductive health services are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2289612981,"Agricultural organisms, such as insect herbivores, provide unique opportunities for studies of adaptive evolutionary processes, including effects of insecticides on movement and oviposition behavior. In this study, Brassica leaves were treated with one of two non-systemic insecticides and exposed to two individual strains (referred to as single or double resistance) of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) (DBM) exhibiting physiological resistance. Behavioral responses by these two strains were compared as part of characterizing the relative effect of levels of physiological resistance on the likelihood of insects showing signs of behavioral avoidance. For each DBM strain, we used choice bioassays to quantify two possible types of behavioral avoidance: 1) females ovipositing predominantly on leaf surfaces without insecticides, and 2) larvae avoiding insecticide-treated leaf surfaces. In three-choice bioassays (leaves with no pesticide, 50% coverage with pesticide, or 100% coverage with pesticide), females from the single resistance DBM strain laid significantly more eggs on water treated leaves compared to leaves with 100% insecticide coverage (both gamma-cyhalothrin and spinetoram). Females from the double resistance DBM strain also laid significantly more eggs on water treated leaves compared to leaves with 100% gamma-cyhalothrin, while moths did not adjust their oviposition behavior in response to spinetoram. Larvae from the single resistance DBM strain showed a significant increase in mobility in response to both insecticides and avoided insecticide-treated portions of leaves when given a choice. On the other hand, DBM larvae from the double resistance strain showed a significant decrease in mobility in response to insecticides, and they did not avoid insecticide-treated portions of leaves when given a choice. Our results suggest that pest populations with physiological resistance may show behavioral avoidance, as resistant females avoided oviposition on leaves without gamma-cyhalothrin. Thus, physiological resistance and behavioral avoidance do not appear to be controlled by the same selection pressures, and the mechanisms responsible for behavioral avoidance may vary among life stages. Our analysis also suggested that a population with lesser physiological resistance to insecticides may be under a stronger selection pressure and therefore be more likely to develop avoidance behaviors than a population with higher levels of physiological resistance."

Understanding their requirement for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and the biochemistry of the enzymes and biosynthetic pathways required for fatty acid synthesis is important and highly relevant in current aquaculture. Most gnathostome vertebrates have two fatty acid desaturase (fads) genes with known functions in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and termed fads1 and fads2. However, teleost fish have exclusively fads2 genes. In rainbow trout, a fads2 cDNA had been previously cloned and found to encode an enzyme with Δ6 desaturase activity. In the present study, a second fads2 cDNA was cloned from the liver of rainbow trout and termed fads2b. The full-length mRNA contained 1578 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 1365 nucleotides that encoded a 454 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 52.48 kDa. The predicted Fads2b protein had the characteristic traits of the microsomal Fads family, including an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain containing the heme-binding motif (HPPG), histidine boxes (HDXGH, HFQHH and QIEHH) and three transmembrane regions. The fads2b was expressed predominantly in the brain, liver, intestine and pyloric caeca. Expression of the fasd2b in yeast generated a protein that was found to specifically convert eicosatetraenoic acid (20:4n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), and therefore functioned as a Δ5 desaturase. Therefore, rainbow trout have two fads2 genes that encode proteins with Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activities, respectively, which enable this species to perform all the desaturation steps required for the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA from C18 precursors."

De novo assembly was carried out using Oases followed by velvet. A total of 46,955 non-redundant transcripts (≥100 bp) using ~29 million high-quality paired end reads were generated. Functional categorization of these transcripts revealed the presence of several genes involved in various biological processes like metabolic pathways, mucilage biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and antioxidants. In addition, simple sequence-repeat motifs, non-coding RNAs and transcription factors were also identified. Expression profiling of some genes involved in mucilage biosynthetic pathway was performed in different tissues of P. ovata using Real time PCR analysis. The study has resulted in a valuable resource for further studies on gene expression, genomics and functional genomics in P. ovata."

Such fisheries occur throughout the world, but are especially prominent in developing countries where they are important for supporting local livelihoods, food security and poverty alleviation. Moreover, most artisanal fisheries in the Global South are unregulated and unmonitored and are in urgent need of science-based management to ensure future sustainability. Our results indicate that, as predicted, global research networks and centres of knowledge production are predominantly located in developed countries, indicating a global mismatch between research needs and capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2289609620,"In a queueing system with the dropping function the arriving customer can be denied service (dropped) with the probability that is a function of the queue length at the time of arrival of this customer. The potential applicability of such mechanism is very wide due to the fact that by choosing the shape of this function one can easily manipulate several performance characteristics of the queueing system. In this paper we carry out analysis of the queueing system with the dropping function and a very general model of arrival process--the model which includes batch arrivals and the interarrival time autocorrelation, and allows for fitting the actual shape of the interarrival time distribution and its moments. For such a system we obtain formulas for the distribution of the queue length and the overall customer loss ratio. The analytical results are accompanied with numerical examples computed for several dropping functions."
https://openalex.org/W2289310128,"Background The abundance of onchocerciasis vectors affects the epidemiology of disease in Sudan, therefore, studies of vector dynamics are crucial for onchocerciasis control/elimination programs. This study aims to compare the relative abundance, monthly biting-rates (MBR) and hourly-based distribution of onchocerciasis vectors in Abu-Hamed and Galabat foci. These seasonally-based factors can be used to structure vector control efforts to reduce fly-biting rates as a component of onchocerciasis elimination programs. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four endemic villages in Abu-Hamed and Galabat foci during two non-consecutive years (2007–2008 and 2009–2010). Both adults and aquatic stages of the potential onchocerciasis vector Simulium damnosum sensu lato were collected following standard procedures during wet and dry seasons. Adult flies were collected using human landing capture for 5 days/month. The data was recorded on handheld data collection sheets to calculate the relative abundance, MBR, and hourly-based distribution associated with climatic factors. The data analysis was carried out using ANOVA and Spearman rank correlation tests. Results Data on vector surveillance revealed higher relative abundance of S. damnosum s.l. in Abu- Hamed (39,934 flies) than Galabat (8,202 flies). In Abu-Hamed, vector populations increased in January-April then declined in June-July until they disappeared in August-October. Highest black fly density and MBR were found in March 2007 (N = 9,444, MBR = 58,552.8 bites/person/month), and March 2010 (N = 2,603, MBR = 16,138.6 bites/person/month) while none of flies were collected in August-October (MBR = 0 bites/person/month). In Galabat, vectors increased in September-December, then decreased in February-June. The highest vector density and MBR were recorded in September 2007 (N = 1,138, MBR = 6,828 bites/person/month) and September 2010 (N = 1,163, MBR = 6,978 bites/person/month), whereas, none appeared in collection from April to June. There was a significant difference in mean monthly density of S. damnosum s.l. across the two foci in 2007–2008 (df = 3, F = 3.91, P = 0.011). Minimum temperature showed significant correlation with adult flies counts in four areas sampled; the adult counts were increased in Nady village (rs = 0.799) and were decreased in Kalasecal (rs = - 0.676), Gumaiza (rs = - 0.585), and Hilat Khateir (rs = - 0.496). Maximum temperature showed positive correlation with black fly counts only in Galabat focus. Precipitation was significantly correlated with adult flies counts in Nady village, Abu-Hamed, but no significance was found in the rest of the sampled villages in both foci. Hourly-based distribution of black flies showed a unimodal pattern in Abu-Hamed with one peak (10:00–18:00), while a bimodal pattern with two peaks (07:00–10:00) and (14:00–18:00) was exhibited in Galabat. Conclusion Transmission of onchocerciasis in both foci showed marked differences in seasonality, which may be attributed to ecology, microclimate and proximity of breeding sites to collection sites. The seasonal shifts between the two foci might be related to variations in climate zones. This information on black fly vector seasonality, ecology, distribution and biting activity has obvious implications in monitoring transmission levels to guide the national and regional onchocerciasis elimination programs in Sudan."
https://openalex.org/W2291831908,"Background White matter (WM) fibers connect different brain regions and are critical for proper brain function. However, little is known about the cerebral blood flow in WM and its relation to WM microstructure. Recent improvements in measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) by means of arterial spin labeling (ASL) suggest that the signal in white matter may be detected. Its implications for physiology needs to be extensively explored. For this purpose, CBF and its relation to anisotropic diffusion was analyzed across subjects on a voxel-wise basis with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and also across white matter tracts within subjects. Methods Diffusion tensor imaging and ASL were acquired in 43 healthy subjects (mean age = 26.3 years). Results CBF in WM was observed to correlate positively with fractional anisotropy across subjects in parts of the splenium of corpus callosum, the right posterior thalamic radiation (including the optic radiation), the forceps major, the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, radial diffusivity correlated negatively with CBF across subjects in similar regions. Moreover, CBF and FA correlated positively across white matter tracts within subjects. Conclusion The currently observed findings on a macroscopic level might reflect the metabolic demand of white matter on a microscopic level involving myelination processes or axonal function. However, the exact underlying physiological mechanism of this relationship needs further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2288594036,"There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of alternative brands of prosthesis for total knee replacement (TKR). We compared patient-reported outcomes, revision rates, and costs, and estimated the relative cost-effectiveness of five frequently used cemented brands of unconstrained prostheses with fixed bearings (PFC Sigma, AGC Biomet, Nexgen, Genesis 2, and Triathlon).We used data from three national databases for patients who had a TKR between 2003 and 2012, to estimate the effect of prosthesis brand on post-operative quality of life (QOL) (EQ-5D-3L) in 53 126 patients at six months. We compared TKR revision rates by brand over 10 years for 239 945 patients. We used a fully probabilistic Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and the probability that each prosthesis brand is the most cost effective at alternative thresholds of willingness-to-pay for a QALY gain.Revision rates were lowest with the Nexgen and PFC Sigma (2.5% after 10 years in 70-year-old women). Average lifetime costs were lowest with the AGC Biomet (£9 538); mean post-operative QOL was highest with the Nexgen, which was the most cost-effective brand across all patient subgroups. For example, for 70-year-old men and women, the ICERs for the Nexgen compared to the AGC Biomet were £2 300 per QALY. At realistic cost per QALY thresholds (£10 000 to £30 000), the probabilities that the Nexgen is the most cost-effective brand are about 98%. These results were robust to alternative modelling assumptions.AGC Biomet prostheses are the least costly cemented unconstrained fixed brand for TKR but Nexgen prostheses lead to improved patient outcomes, at low additional cost. These results suggest that Nexgen should be considered as a first choice prosthesis for patients with osteoarthritis who require a TKR."
https://openalex.org/W2294579545,"In this paper, a novel method for selecting a navigation satellite subset for a global positioning system (GPS) based on a genetic algorithm is presented. This approach is based on minimizing the factors in the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) using a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) with an elite conservation strategy, adaptive selection, adaptive mutation, and a hybrid genetic algorithm that can select a subset of the satellites represented by specific numbers in the interval (4 ∼ n) while maintaining position accuracy. A comprehensive simulation demonstrates that the MGA-based satellite selection method effectively selects the correct number of optimal satellite subsets using receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) or fault detection and exclusion (FDE). This method is more adaptable and flexible for GPS receivers, particularly for those used in handset equipment and mobile phones."
https://openalex.org/W1626804403,"Spatial updating refers to the ability to keep track of position and orientation while moving through an environment. People with impaired vision may be less accurate in spatial updating with adverse consequences for indoor navigation. In this study, we asked how artificial restrictions on visual acuity and field size affect spatial updating, and also judgments of the size of rooms.Normally sighted young adults were tested with artificial restriction of acuity in Mild Blur (Snellen 20/135) and Severe Blur (Snellen 20/900) conditions, and a Narrow Field (8°) condition. The subjects estimated the dimensions of seven rectangular rooms with and without these visual restrictions. They were also guided along three-segment paths in the rooms. At the end of each path, they were asked to estimate the distance and direction to the starting location. In Experiment 1, the subjects walked along the path. In Experiment 2, they were pushed in a wheelchair to determine if reduced proprioceptive input would result in poorer spatial updating.With unrestricted vision, mean Weber fractions for room-size estimates were near 20%. Severe Blur but not Mild Blur yielded larger errors in room-size judgments. The Narrow Field was associated with increased error, but less than with Severe Blur. There was no effect of visual restriction on estimates of distance back to the starting location, and only Severe Blur yielded larger errors in the direction estimates. Contrary to expectation, the wheelchair subjects did not exhibit poorer updating performance than the walking subjects, nor did they show greater dependence on visual condition.If our results generalize to people with low vision, severe deficits in acuity or field will adversely affect the ability to judge the size of indoor spaces, but updating of position and orientation may be less affected by visual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2288808001,"Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV; genus Cytomegalovirus, subfamily Betaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae) is an immunosuppressive virus that mainly inhibits the immune function of T lymphocytes and macrophages, which has caused substantial damage in the farming industry. In this study, we obtained the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected porcine macrophages via high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles showed that 239 miRNA database-annotated and 355 novel pig-encoded miRNAs were detected. Of these, 130 miRNAs showed significant differential expression between the PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine macrophages. The 10 differentially expressed pig-encoded miRNAs were further determined by stem-loop reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with the high-throughput sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis of the target genes of miRNAs in PCMV-infected porcine macrophages showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic processes. This is the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in porcine macrophages and an analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanisms during PCMV infection. Further research into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral infections should contribute to the treatment and prevention of immunosuppressive viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2289554893,"Background In developing medical research, particularly in regions where medical research is largely unfamiliar, it is important to understand public perceptions and attitudes towards medical research. In preparation for starting the first cohort study in the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi Cohort Study (ADCS), we sought to understand how we could improve the quality of the research process for participants and increase public trust and awareness of research. Methods We conducted six focus groups (FG), consisting of Emirati men and women aged above 18 years to resemble the target population for the ADCS. Sampling was purposive and convenient. Data collection was an iterative process until saturation was reached with no new themes identified. Text from each FG was analyzed separately by identifying emerging issues and organizing related concepts into categories or themes. A coding tree was developed, consisting of the main concepts, themes, subthemes and corresponding quotes. Both themes and main ideas were identified using inductive analysis. Results Forty-two participants enrolled at 3 academic centers (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE University, Zayed University) and the Abu Dhabi blood bank. Focus group participants described lack of awareness of research as a challenge to participation in clinical research studies. Altruism, personal relevance of the research, and the use of role models were commonly identified motivators. Participants were generally satisfied with the informed consent process for the ADCS, but would be disappointed if not provided test results or study outcomes. Fear of a breach in confidentiality was a frequently expressed concern. Conclusions Participants join research studies for varied, complex reasons, notably altruism and personal relevance. Based on these insights, we propose specific actions to enhance participant recruitment, retention and satisfaction in the ADCS. We identified opportunities to improve the research experience through improved study materials and communication to participants and the broader community."
https://openalex.org/W2288622561,"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of the synovial joints. The autoimmune character of RA is underscored by prominent production of autoantibodies such as those against IgG (rheumatoid factor), and a broad array of joint tissue-specific and other endogenous citrullinated proteins. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) can be detected in the sera and synovial fluids of RA patients and ACPA seropositivity is one of the diagnostic criteria of RA. Studies have demonstrated that RA T cells respond to citrullinated peptides (epitopes) of proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan, which is one of the most abundant macromolecules of articular cartilage. However, it is not known if the PG molecule is citrullinated in vivo in human cartilage, and if so, whether citrulline-containing neoepitopes of PG (CitPG) can contribute to autoimmunity in RA. Methods CitPG was detected in human cartilage extracts using ACPA+ RA sera in dot blot and Western blot. Citrullination status of in vitro citrullinated recombinant G1 domain of human PG (rhG1) was confirmed by antibody-based and chemical methods, and potential sites of citrullination in rhG1 were explored by molecular modeling. CitPG-specific serum autoantibodies were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and CitPG was localized in osteoarthritic (OA) and RA cartilage using immunohistochemistry. Findings Sera from ACPA+ RA patients reacted with PG purified from normal human cartilage specimens. PG fragments (mainly those containing the G1 domain) from OA or RA cartilage extracts were recognized by ACPA+ sera but not by serum from ACPA- individuals. ACPA+ sera also reacted with in vitro citrullinated rhG1 and G3 domain-containing fragment(s) of PG. Molecular modeling suggested multiple sites of potential citrullination within the G1 domain. The immunohistochemical localization of CitPG was different in OA and RA cartilage. Conclusions CitPG is a new member of citrullinated proteins identified in human joints. CitPG could be found in both normal and diseased cartilage specimens. Antibodies against CitPG may trigger or augment arthritis by forming immune complexes with this autoantigen in the joints of ACPA+ RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2289723459,"While HIV has had a major impact on health care in southern Africa, there are few data on its impact on acute malnutrition in children in the community. We report an analysis of outcomes in a large programme of community management of acute malnutrition in the south of Lusaka.Over 3 years, 68,707 assessments for undernutrition were conducted house-to-house, and children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) or moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were enrolled into either Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) or Supplementary Feeding Programme (SFP) respectively. Case records were analysed using tabulation and unconditional logistic regression.1,859 children (889 boys, 970 girls; median age 16 months) with MAM (n = 664) or SAM (n = 1,195) were identified. Of 1,796 children whose parents consented to testing, 185 (10.3%) were HIV positive. Altogether 1,163 (62.6%) were discharged as recovered from acute malnutrition. Case fatality while in the programme was 4.2% in children with SAM and 0.5% in those with MAM (RR of SAM 10.9; 95%CI 3.4,34.8; P<0.0001), and higher in children with HIV infection (RR 5.2, 95%CI 2.9, 9.0; P<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, HIV (OR 5.2; 95%CI 2.6, 10.1; P<0.0001), MUAC <11.5 cm (OR 4.1; 95%CI 2.2, 7.4; P<0.0001) and the first year of the programme (OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.0, 3.4; P = 0.04) all increased mortality. Children with HIV infection who were able to initiate antiretroviral therapy had lower mortality (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.10, 0.57; P = 0.0008).Our programme suggests that a comprehensive community malnutrition programme, incorporating HIV care, can achieve low mortality even in a population heavily affected by HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2290490862,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is typically an adult onset dominant myopathy. Epigenetic changes in the chromosome 4q35 region linked to both forms of FSHD lead to a relaxation of repression and increased somatic expression of DUX4-fl (DUX4-full length), the pathogenic alternative splicing isoform of the DUX4 gene. DUX4-fl encodes a transcription factor expressed in healthy testis and pluripotent stem cells; however, in FSHD, increased levels of DUX4-fl in myogenic cells lead to aberrant regulation of target genes. DUX4-fl has proven difficult to study in vivo; thus, little is known about its normal and pathogenic roles. The endogenous expression of DUX4-fl in FSHD-derived human muscle and myogenic cells is extremely low, exogenous expression of DUX4-fl in somatic cells rapidly induces cytotoxicity, and, due in part to the lack of conservation beyond primate lineages, viable animal models based on DUX4-fl have been difficult to generate. By contrast, the FRG1 (FSHD region gene 1), which is linked to FSHD, is evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to humans, and has been studied in several model organisms. FRG1 expression is critical for the development of musculature and vasculature, and overexpression of FRG1 produces a myopathic phenotype, yet the normal and pathological functions of FRG1 are not well understood. Interestingly, DUX4 and FRG1 were recently linked when the latter was identified as a direct transcriptional target of DUX4-FL. To better understand the pathways affected in FSHD by DUX4-fl and FRG1, we generated transgenic lines of Drosophila expressing either gene under control of the UAS/GAL4 binary system. Utilizing these lines, we generated screenable phenotypes recapitulating certain known consequences of DUX4-fl or FRG1 overexpression. These transgenic Drosophila lines provide resources to dissect the pathways affected by DUX4-fl or FRG1 in a genetically tractable organism and may provide insight into both muscle development and pathogenic mechanisms in FSHD."
https://openalex.org/W2293232008,"The use of light diffraction for the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial colonies was a significant breakthrough with widespread implications for the food industry and clinical practice. We previously confirmed that optical sensors for bacterial colony light diffraction can be used for bacterial identification. This paper is focused on the novel perspectives of this method based on digital in-line holography (DIH), which is able to reconstruct the amplitude and phase properties of examined objects, as well as the amplitude and phase patterns of the optical field scattered/diffracted by the bacterial colony in any chosen observation plane behind the object from single digital hologram. Analysis of the amplitude and phase patterns inside a colony revealed its unique optical properties, which are associated with the internal structure and geometry of the bacterial colony. Moreover, on a computational level, it is possible to select the desired scattered/diffracted pattern within the entire observation volume that exhibits the largest amount of unique, differentiating bacterial features. These properties distinguish this method from the already proposed sensing techniques based on light diffraction/scattering of bacterial colonies. The reconstructed diffraction patterns have a similar spatial distribution as the recorded Fresnel patterns, previously applied for bacterial identification with over 98% accuracy, but they are characterized by both intensity and phase distributions. Our results using digital holography provide new optical discriminators of bacterial species revealed in one single step in form of new optical signatures of bacterial colonies: digital holograms, reconstructed amplitude and phase patterns, as well as diffraction patterns from all observation space, which exhibit species-dependent features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on bacterial colony analysis via digital holography and our study represents an innovative approach to the subject."
https://openalex.org/W2292896892,"Null models exploring species co-occurrence and trait-based limiting similarity are increasingly used to explore the influence of competition on community assembly; however, assessments of common models have not thoroughly explored the influence of variation in matrix size on error rates, in spite of the fact that studies have explored community matrices that vary considerably in size. To determine how smaller matrices, which are of greatest concern, perform statistically, we generated biologically realistic presence-absence matrices ranging in size from 3–50 species and sites, as well as associated trait matrices. We examined co-occurrence tests using the C-Score statistic and independent swap algorithm. For trait-based limiting similarity null models, we used the mean nearest neighbour trait distance (NN) and the standard deviation of nearest neighbour distances (SDNN) as test statistics, and considered two common randomization algorithms: abundance independent trait shuffling (AITS), and abundance weighted trait shuffling (AWTS). Matrices as small as three × three resulted in acceptable type I error rates (p < 0.05) for both the co-occurrence and trait-based limiting similarity null models when exclusive p-values were used. The commonly used inclusive p-value (≤ or ≥, as opposed to exclusive p-values; < or >) was associated with increased type I error rates, particularly for matrices with fewer than eight species. Type I error rates increased for limiting similarity tests using the AWTS randomization scheme when community matrices contained more than 35 sites; a similar randomization used in null models of phylogenetic dispersion has previously been viewed as robust. Notwithstanding other potential deficiencies related to the use of small matrices to represent communities, the application of both classes of null model should be restricted to matrices with 10 or more species to avoid the possibility of type II errors. Additionally, researchers should restrict the use of the AWTS randomization to matrices with fewer than 35 sites to avoid type I errors when testing for trait-based limiting similarity. The AITS randomization scheme performed better in terms of type I error rates, and therefore may be more appropriate when considering systems for which traits are not clustered by abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2288889961,"Background The African Program for Onchocerciais Control (APOC) with a main strategy of community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) was established with the aim of eliminating Onchocerciasis as a disease of public health and socio-economic importance. The study area was a hyper endemic area just before the implementation of CDTI. It has been implemented for six years in this district but yet not been evaluated. So, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of six years CDTI on parasitological and clinical indices of Onchocerciasis Methods This study employed a pre-post impact evaluation design. The minimum sample size for this study was 1318; the respondents were selected by multi-stage sampling technique. Data on socio-demographic characteristics using a semi-structured questionnaire, clinical examination for skin signs and symptoms of Onchocerciasis and two bloodless skin snips from each side of the gluteal fold were taken from the entire study participants. SPSS version 16.0 and Medcalc version 12.2.1.0 were used for analysis. Result The microfilaridermia reduced from the pre-intervention value of 74.8% to 40.7%, indicating a 45.6% reduction, mean intensity from 32.1(SD = 61.5) mf/mg skin snip to 18.7(SD = 28.7)indicating 41.75% reduction, CMFL from 19.6 mf/mg skin snip to 4.7 indicating 76% reduction. The result also showed that microfilaridermia and mean intensity decreased as the number of treatment taken increased. Pruritis, leopard skin, onchocercomata and hanging groin reduced by 54.4%, 61.3%, 77.7% and 88.5% respectively. Conclusions The implementation of CDTI significantly reduced the parasitological and clinical indices of Onchocerciasis, so, efforts should be made to improve the annual treatment coverage and sustainability of CDTI to drastically reduce the micro filarial load to the level the disease would no longer be a public health problem."
https://openalex.org/W2288914174,"Fishes exhibit a remarkable diversity of body shape as adults; however, it is unknown whether this diversity is reflected in larval stage morphology. Here we investigate the relationship between larval and adult body shape as expressed by body elongation. We surveyed a broad range of ray-finned fish species and compared body shape at larval and adult stages. Analysis shows that the vast majority of fish are more elongate at the larval stage than at the adult stage, and that adults display greater interspecies variation than larvae. We found that the superorder Elompomorpha is unique because many species within the group do not follow the observed elongation trends. These results indicate that much of the diversity observed in adults is achieved in post-larval stages. We suggest that larval morphology is subject to common constraints across the phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2289651093,"Nitro-arachidonic acid (NO2-AA) is a cell signaling nitroalkene that exerts anti-inflammatory activities during macrophage activation. While angiotensin II (ANG II) produces an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular cells, little is known regarding the potential protective effects of NO2-AA in ANG II-mediated kidney injury. As such, this study examines the impact of NO2-AA on ANG II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in an immortalized renal proximal tubule cell line (HK-2 cells). Treatment of HK-2 cells with ANG II increases the production of superoxide (O2●-), nitric oxide (●NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Using high-resolution respirometry, it was observed that the presence of NO2-AA prevented ANG II-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Attempting to address mechanism, we treated isolated rat kidney mitochondria with ONOO-, a key mediator of ANG II-induced mitochondrial damage, in the presence or absence of NO2-AA. Whereas the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and ATP synthase (ATPase) were diminished upon exposure to ONOO-, they were restored by pre-incubating the mitochondria with NO2-AA. Moreover, NO2-AA prevents oxidation and nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Combined, these data demonstrate that ANG II-mediated oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction is abrogated by NO2-AA, identifying this compound as a promising pharmacological tool to prevent ANG II-induced renal disease."

Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D. Ganz K. Shi L. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 471-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Conventional derivation of hESC lines from human embryos entails explant outgrowth to form the post-inner cell mass intermediate (PICMI), which may lead to the primed characteristics of derived cell lines. To avoid PICMI transition, Guo et al. dissociated human ICM cells into single cells to separate epiblast and primitive endoderm by Accutase, and they cultured them in t2iLGöY for 4–5 days to generate naive hESCs. Pluripotent marker expression and molecular profiling of transcriptomes showed that the resulting hESC lines exhibit features of naive pluripotency. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis also confirmed genome-wide hypomethylation in both naive hESCs and human ICM as previously reported (Lee et al., 2014Lee H.J. Hore T.A. Reik W. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 710-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), indicating high resemblance between the resulting naive hESCs and ICM of blastocyst. The authors also evaluated the metabolic properties of the naive hESCs derived from single ICM cells in t2iLGöY. Compared to primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which rely on anaerobic glycolysis, the naive hESCs exhibit robust mitochondrial respiration capacity during colony formation in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and a high oxygen consumption rate. Furthermore, Guo et al. assessed multi-lineage differentiation capacity of the naive hESCs derived from individual ICM cells. Embryoid body formation assays confirmed that the naive hESCs could differentiate into cells from all three germ layers. Pastor et al. focused on the methylation landscape of naive human PSCs. They first reverted hESCs to the naive pluripotent state by using the 5iLAF culture system (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W. Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D. Ganz K. Shi L. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 471-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the reverted cells, they sorted the 5iLAF-cultured cells into SSEA4-positive and -negative populations, which exhibited different colony morphologies corresponding to primed and naive characteristics, respectively. They also derived hESC lines from pre-implantation blastocysts completely under naive 5iLAF conditions, and they found that most of these naive cells were SSEA4 negative. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the SSEA4-negative hESCs derived by both methods could recapitulate naive expression patterns, indicating strong correlation between SSEA4 expression and naive pluripotency. Next, the authors performed WGBS to determine the methylation pattern of naive hESCs at single-nucleotide resolution. The average CG methylation of the SSEA4-negative reverted and newly derived naive PSCs was broadly similar to that of the human blastocyst. Strikingly, however, when considering the methylation pattern at specific loci, they discovered that the SSEA4-negative naive cells reverted from primed UCLA1 cells or derived directly from human pre-implantation blastocyst in 5iLAF, as well as the cells reverted from primed H9 cells in t2iL+Gö (Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J. Mansfield W. et al.Cell. 2014; 158: 1254-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), converge toward a methylation landscape that significantly deviates from that of human oocytes or blastocyst, exhibiting memory loss in methylation patterns of oocyte and blastocyst. Additionally, the loss of stable imprinting can also be observed in naive hESCs, which display a shift from monoallelic to biallelic expression of several imprinted genes upon reversion of primed hESCs in 5iLAF condition. The authors further reverted the naive hESCs back to a primed state by culturing the 5iLAF SSEA4-negative cells in primed epiblast-like cell (EpiLC) media. Although global DNA methylation could be partially rescued, the methylation at imprinted loci could not be restored, suggesting that the imprinting loss in naive state cannot be re-established during the transition from naive to primed state. Consistent with the initial report (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W. Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D. Ganz K. Shi L. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 471-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), Pastor et al. also observed karyotypic instability after prolonged culture in 5iLAF. In addition, the authors also found that the RNA and protein levels of some DNA methyltransferases, such as DNMT3B (the de novo DNA methyltransferase) and DNMT1, dropped sharply in 5iLAF cells, while expression of the 5mC oxidases TET1 and TET2 increased substantially in the naive state. Therefore, they propose that a combination of impaired maintenance methylation and increased TET activity could result in the hypomethylation of naive hESCs in 5iLAF, in which the methylation memories are gradually lost with DNA replication. Together, these studies show that at least two of the recently reported conditions for reverting primed PSCs to a naive state are also capable of supporting direct derivation of naive hESCs with both transcriptomes and genome-wide methylomes recapitulating the naive pluripotent state of human pre-implantation blastocyst, which shows robustness of both the naive pluripotent state and the different derivation protocols. Both studies here strongly demonstrate that different naive culture conditions are capable of deriving cells in a naive pluripotent state; as the saying goes, “All roads lead to Rome.” Yet, the two studies emphasize different aspects of human naive PSCs. Guo et al. derived hESCs with naive properties by dissociation of ICM cells to deplete primitive endoderm cells existing in human pre-implantation blastocyst. Pastor and colleagues derived SSEA4-negative hESC lines with transcription profiles resembling the pre-implantation epiblast and identified the correlation between SSEA4 marker expression and naive pluripotency. Moreover, they compared the methylome of in-vitro-derived naive hESCs and in-vivo-developed epiblast at base resolution, leading to the conclusion that methylation patterns of human oocyte and blastocyst and imprints were lost upon in vitro manipulation. Such differences between in vitro and in vivo systems may place both challenges and opportunities in further studies involved in naive pluripotency. The failure in methylation memory inheritance may present obstacles for direct differentiation of naive hESCs in therapeutic applications, which may require further modifications to existing naive culture systems to restore the in vivo epigenetic patterns. Likewise, the imprint-erasing potential of naive hESCs may provide important cues for further analysis, including, for example, mechanistic investigations into the process of imprinting memory loss and rescue studies aimed at re-writing DNA methylation on specific imprinted genes. Overall, all these observations deserve to be further validated using the naive human PSCs generated through different approaches by different laboratories. Naive Human Pluripotent Cells Feature a Methylation Landscape Devoid of Blastocyst or Germline MemoryPastor et al.Cell Stem CellFebruary 4, 2016In BriefPastor and colleagues show that reversion of primed hESCs in 5iLAF, or derivation of hESCs in 5iLAF, results in a population of naive cells characterized by loss of the marker SSEA4.

https://openalex.org/W2295691263,"Grain length is an important quantitative trait in rice (Oryza sativa L.) that influences both grain yield and exterior quality. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain length have been identified, it is still unclear how different alleles from different QTLs regulate grain length coordinately. To explore the mechanisms of QTL combination in the determination of grain length, five mapping populations, including two F2 populations, an F3 population, an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and an F8 RIL population, were developed from the cross between the U.S. tropical japonica variety 'Lemont' and the Chinese indica variety 'Yangdao 4' and grown under different environmental conditions. Four QTLs (qGL-3-1, qGL-3-2, qGL-4, and qGL-7) for grain length were detected using both composite interval mapping and multiple interval mapping methods in the mapping populations. In each locus, there was an allele from one parent that increased grain length and another allele from another parent that decreased it. The eight alleles in the four QTLs were analyzed to determine whether these alleles act additively across loci, and lead to a linear relationship between the predicted breeding value of QTLs and phenotype. Linear regression analysis suggested that the combination of eight alleles determined grain length. Plants carrying more grain length-increasing alleles had longer grain length than those carrying more grain length-decreasing alleles. This trend was consistent in all five mapping populations and demonstrated the regulation of grain length by the four QTLs. Thus, these QTLs are ideal resources for modifying grain length in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2296468005,"Background Graves’ disease (GD) is a complex disease in which genetic predisposition is modified by environmental factors. Each gene exerts limited effects on the development of autoimmune disease (OR = 1.2–1.5). An epidemiological study revealed that nearly 70% of the risk of developing inherited autoimmunological thyroid diseases (AITD) is the result of gene interactions. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the interactions of multiple loci on the genetic predisposition to GD. The aim of our analyses was to identify pairs of genes that exhibit a multiplicative interaction effect. Material and Methods A total of 709 patients with GD were included in the study. The patients were stratified into more homogeneous groups depending on the age at time of GD onset: younger patients less than 30 years of age and older patients greater than 30 years of age. Association analyses were performed for genes that influence the development of GD: HLADRB1, PTPN22, CTLA4 and TSHR. The interactions among polymorphisms were analyzed using the multiple logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) methods. Results GD patients stratified by the age of onset differed in the allele frequencies of the HLADRB1*03 and 1858T polymorphisms of the PTPN22 gene (OR = 1.7, p = 0.003; OR = 1.49, p = 0.01, respectively). We evaluated the genetic interactions of four SNPs in a pairwise fashion with regard to disease risk. The coexistence of HLADRB1 with CTLA4 or HLADRB1 with PTPN22 exhibited interactions on more than additive levels (OR = 3.64, p = 0.002; OR = 4.20, p < 0.001, respectively). These results suggest that interactions between these pairs of genes contribute to the development of GD. MDR analysis confirmed these interactions. Conclusion In contrast to a single gene effect, we observed that interactions between the HLADRB1/PTPN22 and HLADRB1/CTLA4 genes more closely predicted the risk of GD onset in young patients."

The genus remains taxonomically challenging in India due to its highly speciose nature, morphological similarity amongst species and negligible host records. The Indian fauna is one of the most diverse and also the least studied. The present study is based on 60 populations reared from 35 host species, 100+ individual caterpillar rearings (1100 wasp specimens pinned and 2000 in alcohol) and from 12 different geographical locations of the country (11 states and one Union territory) that represent 26 provisional Glyptapanteles species within 8 species-groups. Out of 60 populations, phylogenetic analyses were performed on 38 based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) nucleotide sequences. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods displayed three and four major discrete Glyptapanteles clades, respectively. In clade A very few Indian species were grouped along with Neotropical and Thailand species. The other clades B and C grouped the majority of the Indian species and showed considerable host specificity in both the trees. All parasitic wasp species were gregarious in nature, except for two populations. Three different sets of data (morphology, host records, and COI) were integrated in order to generate accurate boundaries between species/species-groups. Illustrations of all parasitized caterpillars/cocoons and 42 habitus views of Glyptapanteles spp., distributional information, and GenBank accession numbers, are presented. The present study, perhaps the most comprehensive done to date in India, suggests the presence of several additional Glyptapanteles species, which were previously unrecognized."

CPCs are a potentially useful cellular resource for treating heart disease and for studying cardiac development. CPCs can differentiate into the three major cell types of the heart—CMs, endothelial cells (ECs), and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).

Combinations of transcription factors such as Nkx2.5, Isl1, and Mesp1 and cell surface markers such as Flk1 (KDR in human), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα), and CXCR4 are often used to define CPCs, and populations identified with different marker sets may have both distinct and overlapping functional and molecular characteristics. It has generally been difficult to expand these identified populations while maintaining their self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacities, which presents difficulties for the sort of large-scale expansion necessary for translational applications.

Lalit et al. adopted a straightforward strategy to reprogram adult mouse fibroblasts into an early embryonic Nkx2.5+ CPC population. They screened candidate transcription factors and chromatin regulators known to be expressed in their target population for their ability to reactivate an Nkx2.5-eYFP reporter. Through this strategy, they identified a combination of 11 genes that were sufficient to induce the appearance of CPC-like cells and subsequently narrowed that list down to five genes (MTGNB: Mesp1, Tbx5, Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Baf60c). YFP+ and Cxcr4+ cells appeared after 3 weeks, and the addition of BIO and LIF, to activate the Wnt and JAK/STAT pathways, respectively, promoted further expansion and maintenance of these induced CPCs (iCPCs). iCPCs can be expanded only in the presence of BIO and LIF, and can be done so for over 20 passages to more than 1015-fold. When cultured as aggregates under cardiac differentiation conditions, iCPCs differentiated into CMs, ECs, and SMCs, and although not examined in depth, other cell types may be generated in these conditions as well. Lalit et al. also showed that iCPCs can generate all three of these lineages in vivo, following transplantation into the embryonic cardiac crescent and into damaged hearts in a myocardial infarction (MI) model. Transplantation of iCPCs improved survival after MI, though long-term survival of transplanted cells and cardiac functional improvements were not described. In contrast, Zhang et al. employed a distinct reprogramming strategy. They utilized transient overexpression of four Yamanaka factors (OSKM: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-myc) in combination with a JAK inhibitor (JI1), which they had previously shown to induce a mesodermal population during reprogramming, as a platform to identify culture conditions that would allow capture and expansion of CPCs. Following 6 days of induction with OSKM and 2 days of cardiac specification with JI1 and the canonical Wnt activator CHIR99021, they found that a 2-week treatment with a cocktail referred to as BACS (for BMP4, Activin A, CHIR99021, and SU5402 [an inhibitor of FGF, VEGF, and PDGF]) induced the appearance of a Flk1+, PDGFRα+, Isl1+, Nkx2.5+ population that they called induced expandable CPCs (ieCPCs). In chemically defined conditions, BACS expanded ieCPCs more than 1010-fold. ieCPCs were tripotent when differentiated under CM, EC, or SMC conditions, although detailed analyses showed that non-specific differentiation conditions containing only serum failed to result in CM generation but retained Isl1+ progenitor cells. A single ieCPC could generate CMs, ECs, and SMCs even after prolonged culturing, and ieCPCs differentiated into all three lineages in vivo after transplantation into an MI model. ieCPC transplantation improved cardiac function after MI, though the long-term survival and mechanism of action of cells was unclear. Recently, several groups have reported similar populations of expandable CPCs from differentiating human pluripotent stem cells. Cao et al. described a cardiovascular progenitor cell population that could be expanded 107-fold by Wnt, BMP, and Activin/Nodal inhibition (Cao et al., 2013Cao N. Liang H. Huang J. Wang J. Chen Y. Chen Z. Yang H.T. Cell Res. 2013; 23: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Birket et al. reported >1012-fold expansion of another CPC population following overexpression of a c-myc transgene with various combinations of signaling modifiers including IGF1, Hedgehog activators, TGF-β/Activin/BMP inhibitors, and bFGF (Birket et al., 2015Birket M.J. Ribeiro M.C. Verkerk A.O. Ward D. Leitoguinho A.R. den Hartogh S.C. Orlova V.V. Devalla H.D. Schwach V. Bellin M. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, the well-known CPC markers Nkx2.5, PDGFRα, and Isl1 are expressed in these populations, suggesting that there may not be a specific marker for “expandable” CPCs. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling (with BIO or CHIR99021) forms the basis for all of these expansion strategies, while many other factors are different or even opposing yet lead to the same endpoint of CPC expansion. The molecular and cellular machineries underlying the similarities and differences of these cell populations should be further elucidated in the future with more detailed genomic and epigenomic analyses. That may reveal a series of discrete progenitor populations resulting from different combinations of genes and growth factors that support them. If the reprogramming approaches described above can indeed induce specific epigenomic states, such strategies may prove useful to induce any desired expandable cell type along their pathway of specification. These progenitor populations are “cardiovascular” and give rise to CMs, ECs, and SMCs, but they are not restricted to a single cardiovascular lineage. As suggested from in vitro differentiation potentials of ieCPCs, their final differentiation potential is somewhat unclear. The proportion of CMs, ECs, and SMCs varies depending on the specific CPC type and differentiation environment, and it is not completely controllable especially after transplantation in vivo. Thus, a next step could be obtaining cell-autonomous, context-independent, single-lineage-committed progenitor cells to achieve stable target cell production and reproducible regenerative effects in vivo. Future work will show whether such populations can be obtained and prove useful in heart regeneration following injury.

The heph2 mutation in this gene results in a specific defect in spermatogenesis, causing aberrant spermatid individualization and male sterility. However, the array of molecular defects in the mutant remains uncharacterized. Using an unbiased high throughput sequencing approach, we have identified transcripts that are misregulated in this mutant. Aberrant transcripts show altered expression levels, exon skipping, and alternative 5' ends. We independently verified these findings by reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Our analysis shows misregulation of transcripts that have been connected to spermatogenesis, including components of the actomyosin cytoskeletal apparatus. We show, for example, that the Myosin light chain 1 (Mlc1) transcript is aberrantly spliced. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis reveals that Mlc1 contains a high affinity binding site(s) for dmPTB and that the site is conserved in many Drosophila species. We discuss that Mlc1 and other components of the actomyosin cytoskeletal apparatus offer important molecular links between the loss of dmPTB function and the observed developmental defect in spermatogenesis. This study provides the first comprehensive list of genes misregulated in vivo in the heph2 mutant in Drosophila and offers insight into the role of dmPTB during spermatogenesis."

Senescence plays an important role in the age-associated decline of tissue functions. Recent studies now show that targeting senescent cells can enhance the functions of stem/progenitor cells in aged mice and extend lifespan. Cellular senescence is an irreversible form of proliferative arrest induced by various cellular stresses including telomere attrition, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and aberrant oncogenic activation. Senescent cells undergo distinctive chromatin remodeling accompanied by profound alterations in gene expression, including increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (for example p16 and p21) and a group of genes encoding secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases collectively known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These important characteristics suggest that senescence can interfere with tissue homeostasis and regenerative repair and therefore contribute to aging by depleting stem or progenitor cells in a cell-autonomous manner and by altering tissue microenvironments through a paracrine mechanism (van Deursen, 2014van Deursen J.M. Nature. 2014; 509: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, senescent cells accumulate with aging and at the sites of age-associated pathologies. Using an INK-ATTAC transgene and pharmacological induction to activate caspase and apoptosis selectively in p16-expressing senescent cells, Baker and colleagues recently showed that genetic clearance of senescent cells in mice delays and ameliorates certain age-associated debilitations and extends lifespan (Baker et al., 2011Baker D.J.

This breakthrough provides direct evidence that senescence drives aging. Furthermore, it argues that preventing the accumulation of senescent cells is an attractive strategy to ameliorate or even prevent age-associated diseases and therefore enhance healthspan.

ABT263 (Navitoclax), a small-molecule inhibitor of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, was found to preferentially induce apoptosis in various types of senescent cells, consistent with the notion that senescent cells upregulate a pro-survival pathway to resist apoptosis (Zhu et al., 2015bZhu Y. Tchkonia T. Pirtskhalava T. Gower A.C. Ding H. Giorgadze N. Palmer A.K. Ikeno Y. Hubbard G.B. Lenburg M. et al.Aging Cell. 2015; 14: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Importantly, intermittent treatment of ABT263 for 2 weeks significantly reduced the number of senescent cells induced by total body irradiation (TBI) in young mice as well as in naturally aged mice. Clearance of senescent cells in TBI-induced prematurely aged mice (Shao et al., 2014Shao L. Feng W. Li H. Gardner D. Luo Y. Wang Y. Liu L. Meng A. Sharpless N.E. Zhou D. Blood. 2014; 123: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and naturally aged mice is accompanied by rejuvenation of the hematopoietic system, including increased long-term repopulation ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and attenuation of aging-related myeloid skewing. ABT263-mediated enhancement of HSC function phenocopies the effect of genetic clearance of senescent cells, suggesting that elimination of senescent cells underlies the improved hematopoietic function (Chang et al., 2016Chang J. Wang Y. Shao L. Laberge R.M. Demaria M. Campisi J. Janakiraman K. Sharpless N.E. Ding S. Feng W. et al.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The senolytic activity of ABT263 was also recently identified independently by James Kirkland’s group (Zhu et al., 2015aZhu Y. Tchkonia T. Fuhrmann-Stroissnigg H. Dai H.M. Ling Y.Y. Stout M.B. Pirtskhalava T. Giorgadze N. Johnson K.O. Giles C.B. et al.Aging Cell. 2015; (in press. Published online December 29, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12445Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). They found that it induces apoptosis in several types of senescent cells except for preadipocytes, the progenitor cells in adipose tissue. The capacity of adipogenesis declines with advancing age, which leads to lipodystrophy and likely contributes to metabolic dysfunction in the elderly. In a recent issue of Elife, Xu et al., 2015aXu M. Palmer A.K. Ding H. Weivoda M.M. Pirtskhalava T. White T.A. Sepe A. Johnson K.O. Stout M.B. Giorgadze N. et al.eLife. 2015; 4: e12997PubMed Google Scholar showed that senescence in preadipocytes not only impairs adipogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner, but also inhibits adipogenesis of neighboring non-senescent preadipocytes through a paracrine mechanism. Activin A secreted by senescent preadipocytes was identified as a SASP factor that impairs adipogenesis. Blocking Activin A increased the expression of critical adipogenesis genes and enhanced adipogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting SASP in senescent preadipocytes may enhance adipogenesis and metabolic function in aged mice. Previous reports showed that inhibition of Janus kinases (JAK) leads to suppression of SASP (Xu et al., 2015bXu M. Tchkonia T. Ding H. Ogrodnik M. Lubbers E.R. Pirtskhalava T. White T.A. Johnson K.O. Stout M.B. Mezera V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E6301-E6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and in their current study Xu et al. found that inhibition of JAK suppresses Activin A secretion and alleviates impaired adipogenesis caused by senescent preadipocytes. Furthermore, treatment with Ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor approved to treat myelofibrosis, reduces Activin A in circulation and enhances adipogenesis to prevent fat loss and improve metabolic functions in old mice, but has no obvious effect in young mice. Importantly, inhibition of SASP by Ruxolitinib was as effective as genetic clearance of p16-expressing senescent preadipocytes in enhancing adipogenesis and attenuating fat loss in aged mice, indicating that both selective killing of senescent cells and inhibiting critical components of SASP are plausible strategies to limit the impact of senescence on aging. As aging is the major risk factor for many age-associated diseases, these studies provide an important step toward translating senescence clearance/inhibition into preventing age-associated diseases and promoting healthspan. Although these studies focused on the hematopoietic system and adipose tissue, it is conceivable that senescent cells in multiple tissues are targeted. It will be interesting to determine whether these interventions have systemic effects on aging. Considering the heterogeneity among different types of senescent cells, it is not surprising that a specific inhibitor targeting a particular pathway is effective only in limited types of senescent cells, as illustrated by ABT263 (Zhu et al., 2015aZhu Y. Tchkonia T. Fuhrmann-Stroissnigg H. Dai H.M. Ling Y.Y. Stout M.B. Pirtskhalava T. Giorgadze N. Johnson K.O. Giles C.B. et al.Aging Cell. 2015; (in press. Published online December 29, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12445Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and as recently reported for Dasatinib and Quercetin, which have selectivity for senescent preadipocytes and endothelial cells, respectively (Zhu et al., 2015bZhu Y. Tchkonia T. Pirtskhalava T. Gower A.C. Ding H. Giorgadze N. Palmer A.K. Ikeno Y. Hubbard G.B. Lenburg M. et al.Aging Cell. 2015; 14: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be important to identify additional interventions to target senescent cells for clearance and inhibition of SASP components critical for the paracrine signaling of senescence. A combination of interventions may be necessary to achieve systemic senescence clearance and SASP inhibition. Many questions remain to be answered before moving these interventions into clinical testing. Whether these interventions lead to rejuvenation of aged stem cells is unclear. It will be important to determine whether there is a critical age threshold after which these interventions may not be effective. These interventions were tested in mice at 20–24 months of age, which is equivalent to 60–70 years in human age. With the increasing human life expectancy, these interventions may need to be administrated for more than 20 years. Additionally, whether these inhibitors require continuous use to be effective raises concerns over potential side effects. Clearance of senescent cells may not require continuous use of senolytic agents, as accumulation of senescent cells is likely to be gradual and intermittent clearance is effective (Baker et al., 2011Baker D.J.

However, JAK inhibitors need to be continuously used to inhibit SASP (Xu et al., 2015bXu M. Tchkonia T. Ding H. Ogrodnik M. Lubbers E.R. Pirtskhalava T. White T.A. Johnson K.O. Stout M.B. Mezera V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E6301-E6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Long-term and continuous use will exacerbate the concerns of side effects and toxicity to normal cells in the elderly. Nevertheless, these exciting studies that limit the impact of senescence represent promising strategies of eliminating “aging” factors. Together with the “fountain of youth” type of factors, which can rejuvenate aged stem/progenitor cells in old mice (Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2014Rando T.A. Wyss-Coray T. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2014; 69: S39-S42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we are now presented with many feasible options to prevent age-associated diseases and promote healthspan."
https://openalex.org/W2328654440,"Species turnover or β diversity is a conceptually attractive surrogate for conservation planning. However, there has been only 1 attempt to determine how well sites selected to maximize β diversity represent species, and that test was done at a scale too coarse (2,500 km2 sites) to inform most conservation decisions. We used 8 plant datasets, 3 bird datasets, and 1 mammal dataset to evaluate whether sites selected to span β diversity will efficiently represent species at finer scale (sites sizes < 1 ha to 625 km2). We used ordinations to characterize dissimilarity in species assemblages (β diversity) among plots (inventory data) or among grid cells (atlas data). We then selected sites to maximize β diversity and used the Species Accumulation Index, SAI, to evaluate how efficiently the surrogate (selecting sites for maximum β diversity) represented species in the same taxon. Across all 12 datasets, sites selected for maximum β diversity represented species with a median efficiency of 24% (i.e., the surrogate was 24% more effective than random selection of sites), and an interquartile range of 4% to 41% efficiency. β diversity was a better surrogate for bird datasets than for plant datasets, and for atlas datasets with 10-km to 14-km grid cells than for atlas datasets with 25-km grid cells. We conclude that β diversity is more than a mere descriptor of how species are distributed on the landscape; in particular β diversity might be useful to maximize the complementarity of a set of sites. Because we tested only within-taxon surrogacy, our results do not prove that β diversity is useful for conservation planning. But our results do justify further investigation to identify the circumstances in which β diversity performs well, and to evaluate it as a cross-taxon surrogate."
https://openalex.org/W2296530558,"Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) occurs frequently after pediatric cardiac surgery. R-wave synchronized atrial (AVT) pacing is used to re-establish atrioventricular synchrony. AVT pacing is complex, with technical pitfalls. We sought to establish and to test a low-cost simulation model suitable for training and analysis in AVT pacing.A simulation model was developed based on a JET simulator, a simulation doll, a cardiac monitor, and a pacemaker. A computer program simulated electrocardiograms. Ten experienced pediatric cardiologists tested the model. Their performance was analyzed using a testing protocol with 10 working steps.Four testers found the simulation model realistic; 6 found it very realistic. Nine claimed that the trial had improved their skills. All testers considered the model useful in teaching AVT pacing. The simulation test identified 5 working steps in which major mistakes in performance test may impede safe and effective AVT pacing and thus permitted specific training. The components of the model (exclusive monitor and pacemaker) cost less than $50. Assembly and training-session expenses were trivial.A realistic, low-cost simulation model of AVT pacing is described. The model is suitable for teaching and analyzing AVT pacing technique."
https://openalex.org/W2291167798,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) frequently establishes persistent infections that can develop into severe liver disease. The HCV NS3/4A serine protease is not only essential for viral replication but also cleaves multiple cellular targets that block downstream interferon activation. Therefore, NS3/4A is an ideal target for the development of anti-HCV drugs and inhibitors. In the current study, we generated a novel NS3/4A/Lap/LC-1 triple-transgenic mouse model that can be used to evaluate and screen NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The NS3/4A protease could be conditionally inducibly expressed in the livers of the triple-transgenic mice using a dual Tet-On and Cre/loxP system. In this system, doxycycline (Dox) induction resulted in the secretion of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) into the blood, and this secretion was dependent on NS3/4A protease-mediated cleavage at the 4B5A junction. Accordingly, NS3/4A protease activity could be quickly assessed in real time simply by monitoring Gluc activity in plasma. The results from such monitoring showed a 70-fold increase in Gluc activity levels in plasma samples collected from the triple-transgenic mice after Dox induction. Additionally, this enhanced plasma Gluc activity was well correlated with the induction of NS3/4A protease expression in the liver. Following oral administration of the commercial NS3/4A-specific inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, plasma Gluc activity was reduced by 50% and 65%, respectively. Overall, our novel transgenic mouse model offers a rapid real-time method to evaluate and screen potential NS3/4A protease inhibitors."
