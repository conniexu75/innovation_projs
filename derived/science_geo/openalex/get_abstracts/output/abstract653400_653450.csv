https://openalex.org/W3029149115,"Crowdsourcing, a participatory approach to solicit ideas from a large group of diverse individuals, provides an opportunity to nurture youth participation in HIV self-testing service design. The objective of this study was to describe the responses to a crowdsourcing contest aimed at soliciting ideas on how to promote HIV self-testing (HIVST) among young people in Nigeria.The ""4 Youth by Youth"" HIV Self-Testing Crowdsourcing contest was an online and off-line contest that asked Nigerian youth (10-24 years old) for ideas in response to the following: How might we promote HIVST among young people in Nigeria? All data were collected and analyzed between October 2018, and June 2019. Ideas and perceptions generated from the crowdsourcing contest were qualitatively analyzed using thematic content analysis. Specifically, four reviewers analyzed whether the ideas generated were desirable (appealing to young people), feasible (easy to implement) and impactful (will significantly influence HIVST uptake among young people).A total of 903 entries were received in response to the contest prompt. Participants submitted entries in various forms: online form (39.7%), offline Dropbox (44.6%), email (6.1%) and WhatsApp (9.7%). Of the total entries, 85% (n = 769/903) entries were eligible and were scored as having either high, moderate or low level of feasibility, impact and desirability, on a 3-point Likert scale. A significant portion of the entries were given a score of 3 for feasibility (4.9%), desirability (7.1%), impact (3.0%) or a total overall score of 7 or more (8.2%). The three main themes that emerged from the entries include:1) Peer-to-peer distribution and leveraging on existing infrastructures 2) Youth-Oriented Branding of the HIVST Kit 3) Mobile platforms and social media technology.The ""4 Youth by Youth"" Self-Testing contest engaged a broad audience of young people to generate ideas and perspectives on how to promote HIVST. This process informed the development of youth innovated implementation strategies to increase uptake of HIVST among adolescents and youth at risk for HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3031021604,"Cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory histones are present in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and are elevated in blood in several inflammatory conditions, sepsis being a major example. Compounds which can attenuate activities of histones are therefore of interest, with heparin being one such material that has previously been shown to bind to histones. Heparin, a successful anticoagulant for nearly a century, has been shown experimentally to bind to histones and exhibit a protective effect in inflammatory conditions. In the present study carried out in whole blood, heparin and selectively desulfated heparin reduced histone induced inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL 6), interleukin 8 (IL 8) and tissue factor and C3a, a complement component. The selectively desulfated heparins, with reduced anticoagulant activities, retained a high degree of effectiveness as an anti-histone agent, whereas fully desulfated heparin was found to be ineffective. The results from this study indicate that the presence of sulfate and other specific structural features are required for heparin to attenuate the inflammatory action of histones in whole blood."

Needs for support with loneliness and social relationships are often under-addressed in mental health services. The Community Navigator programme was designed to reduce loneliness for adults (aged 18 and above) with complex depression or anxiety who were using secondary mental health services. Acceptability and feasibility of the programme and a trial evaluation were tested in a feasibility randomised controlled trial with qualitative evaluation. Methods Forty participants with depression or anxiety using secondary mental health services were recruited from mental health services in two London sites and randomised to receive: the Community Navigator programme over six months in addition to routine care (n = 30); or routine care (n = 10). Measures of loneliness, depression, other clinical and social outcomes and service use were collected at baseline and six-months follow-up. Levels of engagement in the programme and rates of trial recruitment and retention were assessed. Programme delivery was assessed through session logs completed by Community Navigators. The acceptability of the programme was explored through qualitative interviews (n = 32) with intervention group participants, their family and friends, programme providers and other involved staff. Results Forty participants were recruited in four months from 65 eligible potential participants asked. No one withdrew from the trial. Follow-up interviews were completed with 35 participants (88%). Process records indicated the programme was delivered as intended: there was a median of seven meetings with their Community Navigator (of a maximum ten) per treatment group participant. Qualitative interviews indicated good acceptability of the programme to stakeholders, and potential utility in reducing loneliness and depression and anxiety. Conclusions A definitive, multi-site randomised controlled trial is recommended to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme for people with complex anxiety and depression in secondary mental health services."
https://openalex.org/W3031755535,"Transcription disequilibria are characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. The activity-evoked transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs), important for neuronal plasticity, memory and behavior, is altered in CNS diseases and governed by epigenetic modulation. KDM1A, a histone 3 lysine 4 demethylase that forms part of transcription regulation complexes, has been implicated in the control of IEG transcription. Here we report the development of vafidemstat (ORY-2001), a brain penetrant inhibitor of KDM1A and MAOB. ORY-2001 efficiently inhibits brain KDM1A at doses suitable for long term treatment, and corrects memory deficit as assessed in the novel object recognition testing in the Senescence Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) model for accelerated aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Comparison with a selective KDM1A or MAOB inhibitor reveals that KDM1A inhibition is key for efficacy. ORY-2001 further corrects behavior alterations including aggression and social interaction deficits in SAMP8 mice and social avoidance in the rat rearing isolation model. ORY-2001 increases the responsiveness of IEGs, induces genes required for cognitive function and reduces a neuroinflammatory signature in SAMP8 mice. Multiple genes modulated by ORY-2001 are differentially expressed in Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Most strikingly, the amplifier of inflammation S100A9 is highly expressed in LOAD and in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, and down-regulated by ORY-2001. ORY-2001 is currently in multiple Phase IIa studies."
https://openalex.org/W3029385835,"Characterization of healthy versus pathological tissue in the peritumoral area is confounded by the presence of edema, making free water estimation the key concern in modeling tissue microstructure. Most methods that model tissue microstructure are either based on advanced acquisition schemes not readily available in the clinic or are not designed to address the challenge of edema. This underscores the need for a robust free water elimination (FWE) method that estimates free water in pathological tissue but can be used with clinically prevalent single-shell diffusion tensor imaging data. FWE in single-shell data requires the fitting of a bi-compartment model, which is an ill-posed problem. Its solution requires optimization, which relies on an initialization step. We propose a novel initialization approach for FWE, FERNET, which improves the estimation of free water in edematous and infiltrated peritumoral regions, using single-shell diffusion MRI data. The method has been extensively investigated on simulated data and healthy dataset. Additionally, it has been applied to clinically acquired data from brain tumor patients to characterize the peritumoral region and improve tractography in it."

Breastfeeding can often be discontinued due to mastitis which is an inflammation of the breast tissue. We isolated 18 Staphylococcus aureus strains from milk donated by healthy (n = 6), subclinical (n = 6), and mastitic (n = 6) mothers, two strains of which were VISA (Vancomycin Intermediate S. aureus). All tested strains (n = 12) were able to form biofilms. We then examined the impact of nisin A and vancomycin alone and in combination on biofilm formation and eradication of selected strains (n = 8). We observed strain-specific responses, with the combinatorial treatment at 1/4X MIC (for both singularly) significantly inhibiting biofilm formation for seven out of eight strains when compared with nisin A or vancomycin alone. None of the selected treatments were able to eradicate pre-formed biofilms. Finally, we selected two strains, namely a VISA (APC3814H) and a strong biofilm former (APC3912CM) and used confocal microscopy to evaluate the effects of the antimicrobial agents at 1X MIC on biofilm inhibition and eradication. All treatments inhibited biofilm formation of APC3814H but were ineffective in eradicating a pre-formed biofilm. Single treatments at 1X MIC against APC3912CM cells did not prevent biofilm formation whereas combination treatment caused increased death of APC3912CM cells. Finally, the combination treatment reduced the thickness of the pre-formed APC3912CM biofilm as compared with the single treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3032508980,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Since prognosis and treatment outcomes rely on fast and accurate diagnosis, there is a need for more cost-effective, sensitive, and specific method for lung cancer detection. Thus, this study aimed to determine the ability of ATR-FTIR in discriminating malignant from benign lung tissues and evaluate its concordance with H&E staining. Three (3) 5μm-thick sections were cut from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell or tissue blocks from patients with lung lesions. The outer sections were H&E-stained and sent to two (2) pathologists to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis. The inner section was deparaffinized by standard xylene method and then subjected to ATR-FTIR analysis. Distinct spectral profiles that distinguished (p<0.05) one sample from another, called the ""fingerprint region"", were observed in five (5) peak patterns representing the amides, lipids, and nucleic acids. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis evidently clustered the benign from malignant tissues. ATR-FTIR showed 97.73% sensitivity, 92.45% specificity, 94.85% accuracy, 91.49% positive predictive value and 98.00% negative predictive value in discriminating benign from malignant lung tissue. Further, strong agreement was observed between histopathologic readings and ATR-FTIR analysis. This study shows the potential of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy as a potential adjunct method to the gold standard, the microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissues, in diagnosing lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3030761224,"A simple device using folded Parafilm-M as an artificial blood feeder was designed for studying two important dengue vector mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The efficiency of the artificial blood feeder was investigated by comparing the numbers of engorged mosquitoes that fed on the artificial blood feeder versus mice as a live blood source. Significantly more engorged females Aedes aegypti fed on the artificial blood feeder than on mice. In addition, the artificial feeder could serve as a useful apparatus for oral infection via artificial blood meals, and for saliva collection in mosquitoes. Our method enabled us to collect saliva from multiple mosquitoes at once, providing sufficient infected saliva for determination of the virus titer by plaque assay analysis. Our artificial feeder has the advantage that it is simple, inexpensive, and efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3029138199,"African Swine Fever (ASF) is one of the most complex and significant diseases from a sanitary-economic perspective currently affecting the world’s swine-farming industry. ASF has been endemic in Sardinia (Italy) since 1978, and several control and eradication programmes have met with limited success. In this traditional ASF endemic area, there are three susceptible host populations for this virus sharing the same habitat: wild boar, farmed domestic pigs and non-registered free-ranging pigs (known as “brado” animals). The main goal of this study was to determine and predict fine-scale spatial interactions of this multi-host system in relation to the epidemiology of ASF in the main endemic area of Sardinia, Montes-Orgosolo. To this end, simultaneous monitoring of GPS–GSM collared wild boar and free-ranging pigs sightings were performed to predict interaction indexes through latent selection difference functions with environmental, human and farming factors. Regarding epidemiological assessment, the spatial inter-specific interaction indexes obtained here were used to correlate ASF notifications in wild boar and domestic pig farms. Daily movement patterns, home ranges (between 120.7 and 2,622.8 ha) and resource selection of wild boar were obtained for the first time on the island. Overall, our prediction model showed the highest spatial interactions between wild boar and free-ranging pigs in areas close to pig farms. A spatially explicit model was obtained to map inter-specific interaction over the complete ASF-endemic area of the island. Our approach to monitoring interaction indexes may help explain the occurrence of ASF notifications in wild boar and domestic pigs on a fine-spatial scale. These results support the recent and effective eradication measures taken in Sardinia. In addition, this methodology could be extrapolated to apply in the current epidemiological scenarios of ASF in Eurasia, where exist multi-host systems involving free-ranging pigs and wild boar."
https://openalex.org/W3030256439,"Expert behavior is characterized by rapid information processing abilities, dependent on more structured schemata in long-term memory designated for their domain-specific tasks. From this understanding, expertise can effectively reduce cognitive load on a domain-specific task. However, certain tasks could still evoke different gradations of load even for an expert, e.g., when having to detect subtle anomalies in dental radiographs. Our aim was to measure pupil diameter response to anomalies of varying levels of difficulty in expert and student dentists’ visual examination of panoramic radiographs. We found that students’ pupil diameter dilated significantly from baseline compared to experts, but anomaly difficulty had no effect on pupillary response. In contrast, experts’ pupil diameter responded to varying levels of anomaly difficulty, where more difficult anomalies evoked greater pupil dilation from baseline. Experts thus showed proportional pupillary response indicative of increasing cognitive load with increasingly difficult anomalies, whereas students showed pupillary response indicative of higher cognitive load for all anomalies when compared to experts."
https://openalex.org/W3031965887,"Introduction Effective tacrolimus (TAC) dosing is hampered by complex pharmacokinetics and significant patient variability. The gut microbiome, a key mediator of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in advanced heart failure (HF) patients, is a possible contributor to interindividual variations in drug efficacy. The effect of alterations in the gut microbiome on TAC dosing requirements after heart transplant (HT) has not been explored. Methods We enrolled 24 patients (mean age = 55.8 ±2.3 years) within 3 months post-HT. Biomarkers of endotoxemia ((lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) and oxidative stress (8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI) were measured in 16 blood samples. 22 stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. TAC dose and serum trough level were measured at the time of stool and blood collection. TAC doses were reported in mg/kg/day and as level-to-dose (L/D) ratio, and categorized as ≤ vs. > median. Results The median TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day and L/D ratio was 100.01. Above the median daily weight-based TAC dose was associated with higher gut microbial alpha diversity (p = 0.03); similarly, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels were lower and LPS levels were higher in the above median TAC group, although these findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment. We observed n = 37 taxa to be significantly enriched among patients with > median TAC dose (all FDR<0.05), several of which are potential short-chain fatty acid producers with anti-inflammatory properties, including taxa from the family Subdoligranulum. Conclusions Our pilot study observed gut microbial alpha diversity to be increased while inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced among patients requiring higher TAC doses early after HT."
https://openalex.org/W3032438279,"Background Although dialysis patients are at a high risk of death, it is difficult for medical practitioners to simultaneously evaluate many inter-related risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of hemodialysis patients using machine learning model, and its usefulness for screening hemodialysis patients at a high risk of one-year death using the nation-wide database of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy. Materials and methods The patients were separated into two datasets (n = 39,930, 39,930, respectively). We categorized hemodialysis patients in Japan into new clusters generated by the K-means clustering method using the development dataset. The association between a cluster and the risk of death was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Then, we developed an ensemble model composed of the clusters and support vector machine models in the model development phase, and compared the accuracy of the prediction of mortality between the machine learning models in the model validation phase. Results Average age of the subjects was 65.7±12.2 years; 32.7% had diabetes mellitus. The five clusters clearly distinguished the groups on the basis of their characteristics: Cluster 1, young male, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 2, female, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 3, diabetes mellitus; Cluster 4, elderly and nephrosclerosis; Cluster 5, elderly and protein energy wasting. These clusters were associated with the risk of death; Cluster 5 compared with Cluster 1, hazard ratio 8.86 (95% CI 7.68, 10.21). The accuracy of the ensemble model for the prediction of 1-year death was 0.948 and higher than those of logistic regression model (0.938), support vector machine model (0.937), and deep learning model (0.936). Conclusions The clusters clearly categorized patient on their characteristics, and reflected their prognosis. Our real-world-data-based machine learning system is applicable to identifying high-risk hemodialysis patients in clinical settings, and has a strong potential to guide treatments and improve their prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3030131565,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and amyloid-beta (Aβ) depositions generated by the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain. In APPNL-F mice, APP gene was humanized and contains two familial AD mutations, and APP–unlike other mouse models of AD–is driven by the endogenous mouse APP promoter. Similar to people without apparent cognitive dysfunction but with heavy Aβ plaque load, we found no significant decline in the working memory of adult APPNL-F mice, but these mice showed decline in the expression of normal anxiety. Using immunohistochemistry and 3D block-face scanning electron microscopy, we found no changes in GABAA receptor positivity and size of somatic and dendritic synapses of hippocampal interneurons. We did not find alterations in the level of expression of perineuronal nets around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons or in the density of PV- or somatostatin-positive hippocampal interneurons. However, in contrast to other investigated cell types, PV interneuron axons were occasionally mildly dystrophic around Aβ plaques, and the synapses of PV-positive axon initial segment (AIS)-targeting interneurons were significantly enlarged. Our results suggest that PV interneurons are highly resistant to amyloidosis in APPNL-F mice and amyloid-induced increase in hippocampal pyramidal cell excitability may be compensated by PV-positive AIS-targeting cells. Mechanisms that make PV neurons more resilient could therefore be exploited in the treatment of AD for mitigating Aβ-related inflammatory effects on neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3029761866,"Trace elements in hair originate from intake (e.g., diet, inhalation, skin absorption), are transported in the bloodstream, and then incorporated during hair formation. However, the trace element abundance and isotopic compositions may be altered by post-eruption environmental processes. Such alterations must be addressed to obtain a meaningful interpretation of hair analysis for biomonitoring. In this study, we used strontium (Sr) isotopic analysis together with sorption kinetics of ionic Sr to quantify the rate and extent of replacement of endogenous Sr in hair by exogenous Sr from ambient water. We found that with only 10 minutes of exposure at room temperature (22°C), more than 30% of original endogenous Sr in hair was replaced with exogenous Sr from the solution. After 16 days of exposure to the solution, more than 90% of endogenous Sr was replaced, with a warmer temperature (60°C) accelerating the exchange substantially. We also found that acid leaching of exposed hair did not remove or isolate the exogenous Sr; therefore, neither the original endogenous nor the exogenous 87Sr/86Sr signal could be separated. Nonetheless, these findings illustrated that the quantitative correlation between the fraction of exogenous Sr and the soaking time, if established, could be used to estimate the length of water contact time for hair in forensic studies. Even if such time since initial contact cannot be established, the combination of acid leaching and 87Sr/86Sr analysis of hair samples may still be valuable in provenance studies to identify recent changes in the exogenous Sr pool, including movements or changes in water source."
https://openalex.org/W3030939433,"Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses have provided valuable insight into fundamental biology and disease pathophysiology. Many studies have taken advantage of the correlation in the expression patterns of the transcriptome to infer a potential biologic function of uncharacterized genes, and multiple groups have examined the relationship between co-expression, co-regulation, and gene function on a broader scale. Given the unique characteristics of immune cells circulating in the blood, we were interested in determining whether it was possible to identify functional co-expression modules in human immune cells. Specifically, we sequenced the transcriptome of nine immune cell types from peripheral blood cells of healthy donors and, using a combination of global and targeted analyses of genes within co-expression modules, we were able to determine functions for these modules that were cell lineage-specific or shared among multiple cell lineages. In addition, our analyses identified transcription factors likely important for immune cell lineage commitment and/or maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3031834618,"The prevalence of urinary incontinence in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (D/BMD) is reported to be between 15–29%, this however includes ages across the lifespan, and with no description of impact on daily life. The present study, aimed to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence in men with D/BMD, and to identify which aspects of daily life were impacted by urinary incontinence. Twenty-seven adult males, 11 with BMD and 16 with DMD, aged 20–57 years, volunteered to participate in this study. Six questionnaires were completed to provide an overview of participant mobility, urinary incontinence and distress caused by urinary incontinence. These included: The Barthel index of disability, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire—Urinary Incontinence Form, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form, The Urogenital Distress Inventory, and the Brooke and Vignos scale. The prevalence of urinary incontinence within the present men with D/BMD was 37%, assessed as urine leakage of once a week or more. Those with urinary incontinence all reported only a “small amount” of urine leakage, with urinary incontinence frequency of once a week in 5/10 participants, two or three times a week in 2/10 participants, and once a day in 3/10 participants. Of those with urinary incontinence 8/10 experienced some impact on their daily life from urine leakage including travel (4/10), social aspects (5/10), and emotional aspects (8/10). All participants with urinary incontinence were bothered by some aspect, including urine leakage (9/10), and frequent urination (4/10). In conclusion, 37% of the present men with D/BMD experience urinary incontinence on a weekly or daily basis and negatively impacted aspects of life related to travel, social and emotional wellbeing. Urine leakage, and frequent urination should be considered a meaningful problem by care providers, and discussed openly with those with D/BMD."
https://openalex.org/W3032199535,"Child mortality from rotavirus gastroenteritis remains high in Nigeria, representing 14% of all rotavirus deaths worldwide. Here, we examine the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of national rotavirus vaccine introduction in geographic and economic subpopulations of Nigeria. We projected the health and economic outcomes of rotavirus vaccination in children over the first five years of life using a spreadsheet-based model. We modeled child populations using national survey data on rotavirus mortality risk factors and vaccination coverage to predict burden and impact across regional and wealth quintile subpopulations within Nigeria. Our base case considered introduction of a general rotavirus vaccine, modeled to encompass characteristics of existing vaccines, versus no vaccine. Base case costs were estimated from the government perspective, assuming Gavi subsidies, over the first five years. We also present estimates from the cost of vaccination from the perspective of Gavi. We explored uncertainty in model parameters through probabilistic uncertainty, one-way sensitivity, and scenario analyses. According to our estimates, rotavirus enteritis was responsible for 47,898 [95% Uncertainty Limits: 35,361; 63,703] child deaths per year, with approximately 80% of the national burden concentrated in the three northern regions of Nigeria. Rotavirus vaccination was estimated to prevent 6,454 [3,960; 9,721] deaths, 13% [9%; 18%] of the national annual RV burden. National ICERs for rotavirus vaccination from the Nigerian government and Gavi perspectives were US$47 [$18; $105] and $62 [$29; $130] per DALY averted, respectively. General rotavirus vaccination was projected to reduce rotavirus mortality by only 6% [4%; 9%] in the North West region compared to 35% [24%; 47%] in the South East region. Base case ICERs ranged from US$25 [10; 56] per DALY averted in North West to US$64 [18; 157] per DALY averted in South South. Gavi perspective ICERs ranged from US$33 [$15; $68] in North West to US$88 [35; 191] per DALY averted in South South. According to one-way sensitivity analyses, ICERs were most sensitive to vaccine efficacy, followed by estimated administrative costs and rotavirus mortality. Disparities in mortality reduction were largely driven by inequality in vaccination coverage across regions and between socioeconomic subpopulations. Due to high, persistent, and inequitable burden of rotavirus in Nigeria, routine vaccination with any of these rotavirus vaccines would be an high impact and cost-effective strategy in reducing child mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3032515989,"Agents that modulate pre-mRNA splicing are of interest in multiple therapeutic areas, including cancer. We report our recent screening results with the application of a cell-based Triple Exon Skipping Luciferase Reporter (TESLR) using a library that is composed of FDA approved drugs, clinical compounds, and mechanistically characterized tool compounds. Confirmatory assays showed that three clinical antitumor therapeutic candidates (milciclib, PF-3758309 and PF-562271) are potent splicing modulators and that these drugs are, in fact, nanomolar inhibitors of multiple kinases involved in the regulation the spliceosome. We also report the identification of new SF3B1 antagonists (sudemycinol C and E) and show that these antagonists can be used to develop a displacement assay for SF3B1 small molecule ligands. These results further support the broad potential for the development of agents that target the spliceosome for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, as well as new avenues for the discovery of new chemotherapeutic agents for a range of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3032600608,"Object The neurosurgical community is particularly exposed to burnout. The objectives of this study were to report the prevalence and associated factors of burnout within the French neurosurgical community using validated academic and psychologic scales. Methods A national survey was sent to 141 French residents and 432 neurosurgeons between April and July 2019. Burnout was surveyed using the Maslach burnout inventory. The survey included demographic data and several academic psychologic scales. A stepwise multiple regression was used to determine factors that are associated with burnout scores. Results The response rate was 100% and 23.6% for residents and neurosurgeons, respectively. Prevalence of burnout within the French neurosurgical community was 49%. There were no significant differences between residents and neurosurgeons. Two categories of factors were associated with the main dimensions of burnout during the stepwise multiple regression: personality and factors related with neurosurgical practice. Personality types such as neuroticism were negatively associated with burnout while agreeableness was protective. Work addictive profile with excessive work and absorption at work were negatively associated. Factors associated with neurosurgical practice such as conflict of work into family life, unbalanced effort to reward ratio, work duration were negatively associated. Pleasure at work was protective. Conclusion Prevalence of burnout is high among French neurosurgeons. Predictive models can be used to identify and prevent burnout among profiles at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3031336257,"Building a density map over large areas could provide essential information of land development intensity and settlement condition. It is crucial for supporting studies and planning of human settlement environment. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) is a comprehensive data set of mapping human settlement at a global scale, which was produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission. The built-up density is an important layer of GHSL data set. Currently, the validation of the GHSL built-up area products was preliminarily conducted over the United States and European countries. However, as a typical East Asian region, China is quite different from the United States, Europe, and other regions in terms of building forms and urban layouts. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an accuracy assessment of GHSL data set in Asian countries like China. With individual building footprint data of 20 typical cities in China, this paper presents our effort to validate the GHSL built-up area products. The aggregation mean and neighborhood search based algorithms are adopted for matching building footprint data and the GHSL products, through the regression analysis at per-pixel level, the building density map in raster format are generated as validation data. The accuracy index of GHSL built-up area was calculated for the study areas, and the validation methods were explored for GHSL built-up products at large scale. The results show that the built-up layer aggregated by the building footprint have the highest correlation with the coarse resolution GHSL built-up products, but GHSL tends to underestimate the building density of low-density areas and overestimate the areas with high density. This study suggests that GHSL built-up area products in 20 representative Chinese cities of China could provide quantitative information about built-up areas, but the product accuracy still need to be improved in the regions with heterogeneous formations of human settlements like China. There is a big picture of mapping high accuracy built-up density of China with the training data set acquired by the study."
https://openalex.org/W3032886052,"The aim of the study was to investigate therapeutic efficacy of single- or two-fraction radiotherapy in conjunction with IDO1-inhibition in a syngeneic rat glioblastoma model. IDO is known to cause immunosuppression through breakdown of tryptophan in the tumor microenvironment.Gene expression analyses of IDO in glioblastoma were performed with data from publicly available datasets. Fractionation studies were done on animals to evaluate tumor size, immune cell infiltration of tumors and serum profile on day 18 after tumor inoculation. Survival analyses were done with animals carrying intracranial glioblastomas comparing two-fraction radiotherapy+IDO1-inhibition to controls. IDO inhibition was achieved by administration of 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT), and radiotherapy (RT) was delivered in doses of 8Gy.The expression of IDO1 was increased on gene level in glioblastoma stem cells. Tumor size was significantly reduced in animals treated with 1-MT+RTx 2 (both long and short intervals, i.e. 7 and 4 days between the treatments) as compared to control animals, animals treated with only 1-MT or animals treated with 1-MT+RTx1. Serum levels of IL-1A were significantly altered in all treated animals as compared to control animals. Survival was significantly increased in the animals treated with 1-MT+RTx2 (7-day interval) compared to control animals.Addition of two-fraction RT to IDO1 inhibition with 1-MT significantly reduced tumor size in animals with glioblastoma. Survival was significantly increased in animals treated with two-fractioned RT+1-MT as compared to untreated controls increased significantly.The currently used combination of only two fractions of radiotherapy and immune therapy is a promising area of research, increasing efficacy compared to single fraction irradiation, while potentially lowering radiation side effects compared to radiation in current clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3030042449,"Adaptive behaviour has become a crucial aspect in current flood risk management strategies across the globe, especially in response to potential consequences of flood hazards and facing challenges of climate change. There are several factors which influence the motivation to implement flood risk management strategies such as property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) measures. This paper assesses and evaluates the role of risk communication, which is a vital and overarching driver or barrier in the successful implementation of PLFRA measures. We explored this issue through a bootstrapped Q-methodology with 20 residents in the urban area of Graz, Austria, who have been affected by flood events in the past. Additionally, semi-structured interviews concerning risk communication were conducted with the participants to understand the preferred risk communication modes. The results show that respondents have a high level of perceived self-efficacy (most have implemented PLFRA measures), that there is general distrust in public protection measures and that there is a high understanding of residual risk. Considering the communication modes preferred by a majority of respondents, face-to-face interaction with unbiased experts is more attractive than online applications. Additionally, citizens want to be engaged in decision-making processes concerning public protection measures in their area. This calls for participatory processes in flood risk management which involve mutual knowledge transfer and social learning."

X. perforans was first identified in Florida in 1991 and by 2006 was the only xanthomonad associated with bacterial spot disease in tomato. The ability of an X. perforans strain to outcompete X. euvesicatoria both in vitro and in vivo was at least in part associated with the production of three bacteriocins designated Bcn-A, Bcn-B, and Bcn-C. The objective of this study was to characterize the genetic determinants of these bacteriocins. Bcn-A activity was confined to one locus consisting of five ORFs of which three (ORFA, ORF2 and ORF4) were required for bacteriocin activity. The fifth ORF is predicted to encode an immunity protein to Bcn-A based on in vitro and in vivo assays. The first ORF encodes Bcn-A, a 1,398 amino acid protein, which bioinformatic analysis predicts to be a member of the RHS family of toxins. Based on results of homology modeling, we hypothesize that the amino terminus of Bcn-A interacts with a protein in the outer membrane of X. euvesicatoria. The carboxy terminus of the protein may interact with an as yet unknown protein(s) and puncture the X. euvesicatoria membrane, thereby delivering the accessory proteins into the target and causing cell death. Bcn-A appears to be activated upon secretion based on cell fractionation assays. The other two loci were each shown to be single ORFs encoding Bcn-B and Bcn-C. Both gene products possess homology toward known proteases. Proteinase activity for both Bcn-B and Bcn-C was confirmed using a milk agar assay. Bcn-B is predicted to be an ArgC-like serine protease, which was confirmed by PMSF inhibition of proteolytic activity, whereas Bcn-C has greater than 50% amino acid sequence identity to two zinc metalloproteases."
https://openalex.org/W3029198700,"Kidney transplants from donors after circulatory death (DCD) make up an increasing proportion of all deceased donor kidney transplants in the United States (US). However, DCD grafts are considered to be of lower quality than kidneys from donors after brain death (DBD). It is unclear whether graft survival is different for these two types of donor kidneys.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US deceased donor kidney recipients using data from the United Network of Organ Sharing from 12/4/2014 to 6/30/2018. We employed a Cox proportional hazard model with mixed effects to compare all-cause graft loss and death-censored graft loss for DCD versus DBD deceased donor kidney transplant recipients. We used transplant center as the random effects term to account for cluster-specific random effects. In the multivariable analysis, we adjusted for recipient characteristics, donor factors, and transplant logistics.Our cohort included 27,494 DBD and 7,770 DCD graft recipients transplanted from 2014 to 2018 who were followed over a median of 1.92 years (IQR 1.08-2.83). For DCD compared with DBD recipients, we did not find a significant difference in all-cause graft loss (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.05 in univariable and HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.95-1.13] in multivariable analysis) or for death-censored graft loss (HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-1.06) in univariable and 1.05 (95% CI 0.99-1.11) in multivariable analysis).For a contemporary cohort of deceased donor kidney transplant recipients, we did not find a difference in the likelihood of graft loss for DCD compared with DBD grafts. These findings signal a need for additional investigation into whether DCD status independently contributes to other important outcomes for current kidney transplant recipients and indices of graft quality."
https://openalex.org/W3029895519,"Background Over a third of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) prescriptions in the US are written for women over age 60. Use of HT more than 5 years is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease; breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers; thromboembolic stroke; gallbladder disease; dementia; and incontinence. Objectives To explore older women’s perceptions of the benefits and risks of long-term HT and examine factors influencing their decisions to use HT > 5 years despite medical risks. Methods A qualitative approach was selected to broadly explore thought processes and social phenomena underlying long-term users’ decisions not to discontinue HT. Interviews were conducted with 30 women over age 60 reporting use of systemic HT more than 5 years recruited from an urban area in California and a small city in the Rocky Mountain region. Transcripts of interviews were analyzed using conventional grounded theory methods. Results Women reported using HT to preserve youthful physical and mental function and prevent disease. Gynecologists had reassured participants regarding risk, about which all 30 expressed little concern. Participants, rather than providers, were the principal drivers of long-term use. Conclusions Participants perceived estrogen to have anti-aging efficacy, and using HT imparted a sense of control over various aspects of aging. Maintaining this sense of control was prioritized over potential risk from prolonged use. Our findings provide an additional perspective on previous work suggesting the pharmaceutical industry has leveraged older women’s self-esteem, vanity, and fear of aging to sell hormones through marketing practices designed to shape the beliefs of both clinicians and patients. Efforts are needed to: 1) address misconceptions among patients and providers about medically supported uses and risks of prolonged HT, and 2) examine commercial influences, such as medical ghostwriting, that may lead to distorted views of HT efficacy and risk."
https://openalex.org/W3031647411,"We employed the widely-tested biophysiological modeling software, Niche Mapper™ to investigate the metabolic function of the Late Triassic dinosaurs Plateosaurus and Coelophysis during global greenhouse conditions. We tested a variety of assumptions about resting metabolic rate, each evaluated within six microclimate models that bound paleoenvironmental conditions at 12° N paleolatitude, as determined by sedimentological and isotopic proxies for climate within the Chinle Formation of the southwestern United States. Sensitivity testing of metabolic variables and simulated “metabolic chamber” analyses support elevated “ratite-like” metabolic rates and intermediate “monotreme-like” core temperature ranges in these species of early saurischian dinosaur. Our results suggest small theropods may have needed partial to full epidermal insulation in temperate environments, while fully grown prosauropods would have likely been heat stressed in open, hot environments and should have been restricted to cooler microclimates such as dense forests or higher latitudes and elevations. This is in agreement with the Late Triassic fossil record and may have contributed to the latitudinal gap in the Triassic prosauropod record."
https://openalex.org/W3029385710,"Objectives To retrospectively determine the diagnostic ability of MRI in differentiating between intradural extramedullary spinal schwannomas and meningiomas. Methods A total of 199 patients with spinal intradural extramedullary tumors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI between January 2012 and December 2018 were included in this study. Two radiologists independently analyzed the presence of cystic change, dural tail sign, and neural foraminal extension. Clinical and MRI features between the two groups were compared by univariable and multivariable analyses using logistic regression. Interobserver agreements were calculated using kappa statistics. Results Patients with schwannoma showed significantly higher frequency of cystic change (96% vs 24%, P < 0.001), neural foraminal extension (29% vs 3%, P = 0.001), and lumbar location (41% vs 5%, P = 0.008). Patients with meningioma showed significantly higher frequency of dural tail sign (64% vs 1%, P < 0.001), thoracic location (75% vs 31%, P = 0.007), older age (59.7 years vs 47.6 years, P < 0.001), higher female predominance (83% vs 50%, P < 0.001), and smaller size (19.8 cm vs 28.8 cm, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that cystic change (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 0.02), dural tail sign (P < 0.001; OR, 36.23), age (P = 0.032; OR, 1.06), and lumbar location (P = 0.006; OR, 0.02) were independent factors. Interobserver agreements were almost perfect for all analyses. Conclusions MRI features were useful in differentiating between intradural extramedullary schwannomas from meningiomas. The presence of cystic change and dural tail sign were independently significant discriminators."
https://openalex.org/W3031730448,"Background Carotid artery plaque is an established marker of subclinical atherosclerosis with pronounced sex-dimorphism. Here, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with carotid plaque burden (CPB) and to examine potential sex-specific genetic effects on plaque sizes. Methods and results We defined six operationalizations of CPB considering plaques in common carotid arteries, carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries. We performed sex-specific genome-wide association analyses for all traits in the LIFE-Adult cohort (n = 727 men and n = 550 women) and tested significantly associated loci for sex-specific effects. In order to identify causal genes, we analyzed candidate gene expression data for correlation with CPB traits and corresponding sex-specific effects. Further, we tested if previously reported SNP associations with CAD and plaque prevalence are also associated with CBP. We found seven loci with suggestive significance for CPB (p<3.33x10-7), explaining together between 6 and 13% of the CPB variance. Sex-specific analysis showed a genome-wide significant hit for men at 5q31.1 (rs201629990, β = -0.401, p = 5.22x10-9), which was not associated in women (β = -0.127, p = 0.093) with a significant difference in effect size (p = 0.008). Analyses of gene expression data suggested IL5 as the most plausible candidate, as it reflected the same sex-specific association with CPBs (p = 0.037). Known plaque prevalence or CAD loci showed no enrichment in the association with CPB. Conclusions We showed that CPB is a complementary trait in analyzing genetics of subclinical atherosclerosis. We detected a novel locus for plaque size in men only suggesting a role of IL5. Several estrogen response elements in this locus point towards a functional explanation of the observed sex-specific effect."
https://openalex.org/W3032178368,"The quality of oral health care might be evaluated based on Donabedian’s structure-process-outcome model. This study assessed the association between the oral health public services structure and work process of oral health teams (OHT) and performance indicators (access and problem-solving capacity) in Brazil. Secondary data from a national program obtained through interviews and by observation in 2013/2014 were analyzed. The performance indicators were Coverage of First Scheduled Dental Appointment (FDA) (< or ≥ the mean) and Ratio between Completed Treatments and First Scheduled Dental Appointments (CT/FDA) (< 1 or ≥ 1). The structure was assessed by the sum of available instruments, equipment, and supplies. Latent class analyses were used to identify similar groups (consolidated, developing, and incipient) of OHT according to the work process (planning of actions, health promotion and intersectoral actions, and integral health care). Each OHT was also described regarding the number of the health team in which the OHT operates, whether the primary care unit receives students/teaches, frequency of care provided outside of OHT coverage, and participation in telehealth. Multiple logistic regression models were adjusted for each performance indicator. A total of 16189 (99,8%) and 16192 (99,9%) OHTs located in 4344 (78,0%) municipalities had complete data on the work process and structure. 91.92% of OHTs presenting CT/FDA ≥ 1 and 37.05% presenting FDA ≥ the mean. Consolidated planning of actions and better structural conditions were associated with better performance. A higher frequency of CT/FDA ≥ 1 was observed among OHTs with consolidated integral health care and those that performed telehealth. OHTs that served individuals outside of OHT coverage daily and that worked with two to nine Health Teams presented a higher frequency of FDA ≥ the mean. OHTs with better structural and work process conditions had better performance."
https://openalex.org/W3029696021,"In epithelial cells, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel, plays a key role in water and electrolytes secretion. A dysfunctional CFTR leads to the dehydration of the external environment of the cells and to the production of viscous mucus in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Here, we applied the quadriwave lateral shearing interferometry (QWLSI), a quantitative phase imaging technique based on the measurement of the light wave shift when passing through a living sample, to study water transport regulation in human airway epithelial CFBE and CHO cells expressing wild-type, G551D- and F508del-CFTR. We were able to detect phase variations during osmotic challenges and confirmed that cellular volume changes reflecting water fluxes can be detected with QWLSI. Forskolin stimulation activated a phase increase in all CFBE and CHO cell types. This phase variation was due to cellular volume decrease and intracellular refractive index increase and was completely blocked by mercury, suggesting an activation of a cAMP-dependent water efflux mediated by an endogenous aquaporin (AQP). AQP3 mRNAs, not AQP1, AQP4 and AQP5 mRNAs, were detected by RT-PCR in CFBE cells. Readdressing the F508del-CFTR protein to the cell surface with VX-809 increased the detected water efflux in CHO but not in CFBE cells. However, VX-770, a potentiator of CFTR function, failed to further increase the water flux in either G551D-CFTR or VX-809-corrected F508del-CFTR expressing cells. Our results show that QWLSI could be a suitable technique to study water transport in living cells. We identified a CFTR and cAMP-dependent, mercury-sensitive water transport in airway epithelial and CHO cells that might be due to AQP3. This water transport appears to be affected when CFTR is mutated and independent of the chloride channel function of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W3030724913,"Glycosylation can affect various protein properties such as stability, biological activity, and immunogenicity. To produce human therapeutic proteins, a host that can produce glycoproteins with correct glycan structures is required. Microbial expression systems offer economical, rapid and serum-free production and are more amenable to genetic manipulation. In this study, we developed a protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 multiple gene knockouts and knockins in Kluyveromyces marxianus, a probiotic yeast with a rapid growth rate. As hyper-mannosylation is a common problem in yeast, we first knocked out the α-1,3-mannosyltransferase (ALG3) and α-1,6-mannosyltransferase (OCH1) genes to reduce mannosylation. We also knocked out the subunit of the telomeric Ku domain (KU70) to increase the homologous recombination efficiency of K. marxianus. In addition, we knocked in the MdsI (α-1,2-mannosidase) gene to reduce mannosylation and the GnTI (β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I) and GnTII genes to produce human N-glycan structures. We finally obtained two strains that can produce low amounts of the core N-glycan Man3GlcNAc2 and the human complex N-glycan Man3GlcNAc4, where Man is mannose and GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosamine. This study lays a cornerstone of glycosylation engineering in K. marxianus toward producing human glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W3030917446,"Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica exhibit high desiccation tolerance, enabling long-term survival in low water activity (aw) environments. Although there are many reports on the effects of low aw on bacterial survival, the mechanism by which bacteria acquire desiccation tolerance and resistance to heat inactivation in low-aw foods remains unclear. We focused on the glass transition phenomenon, as bacteria may acquire environmental tolerance by state change due to glass transition. In this study, we determined the glass transition temperature (Tg) in S. enterica serovars under different aw conditions using thermal rheological analysis (TRA). The softening behaviour associated with the state change of bacterial cells was confirmed by TRA, and Tg was determined from the softening behaviour. Tg increased as the aw decreased in all S. enterica serovars. For example, while the Tg of five S. enterica serovars was determined as 35.16°C to 57.46°C at 0.87 aw, the Tg of all the five serovars increased by 77.10°C to 83.30°C at 0.43 aw. Furthermore, to verify the thermal tolerance of bacterial cells, a thermal inactivation assay was conducted at 60°C for 10 min under each aw condition. A higher survival ratio was observed as aw decreased; this represented an increase in Tg for Salmonella strains. These results suggest that the glass transition phenomenon of bacterial cells would associate with environmental tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3031277139,"Background and aims Exposure to tobacco, alcohol and fast-food use in films is associated with initiation of these behaviours. India is the world’s largest film producer, but the extent of such imagery in Bollywood (Hindi cinema) films is unclear. We therefore aimed to describe the extent of and trends in tobacco, alcohol and fast-food imagery in Bollywood films, between 1994–2013. Methods For the 15 top-grossing films each year between 1994–2013, the number of five-minute intervals containing product images were determined separately for tobacco, alcohol and fast-food. Both the proportion of films containing at least one image occurrence, and occurrences per film, were described overall and by year. Negative binomial regression described associations between film rating and occurrences/film, and estimated time-trends in occurrences/film, adjusted for rating. Results We analysed 93 U-rated (unrestricted), 150 U/A-rated (parental guidance for children aged <12 years) and 55 A-rated (restricted to adult audience) films, containing 9,226 five-minute intervals (mean intervals/film 30.8, SD 4.0). 70% (n = 210), 93% (n = 278) and 21% (n = 62) of films contained at least one tobacco, alcohol and fast-food occurrence, respectively. Corresponding total mean occurrences/film were 4.0 (SD 4.9), 7.0 (4.7) and 0.4 (0.9). Tobacco occurrences were more common in U/A films (incidence rate ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.06–2.09) and A films (2.95; 1.95–4.48) than U-rated films. Alcohol occurrences were also more common in A-rated films than U-rated films (1.48; 1.15–1.85). Tobacco occurrences/film became less common over the observed period (adjusted trend -4% per annum; -2 to -7%; p <0.001), while alcohol (+2%; 0–3%; p = 0.02), and fast food (+8%; 2–14%; p = 0.01) occurrences/film became more common. Conclusions Although the extent of tobacco imagery in Bollywood films fell over 1994–2013, it is still frequently observed. Alcohol imagery is widespread, even in U-rated films, and trends in both alcohol and fast-food imagery are upwards."
https://openalex.org/W3031655315,"The wheat curl mite, Aceria tosichella Keifer, one of the most destructive arthropod pests of bread wheat worldwide, inflicts significant annual reductions in grain yields. Moreover, A. tosichella is the only vector for several economically important wheat viruses in the Americas, Australia and Europe. To date, mite-resistant wheat genotypes have proven to be one of the most effective methods of controlling the A. tosichella—virus complex. Thus, it is important to elucidate A. tosichella population genetic structure, in order to better predict improved mite and virus management. Two genetically distinct A. tosichella lineages occur as pests of wheat in Australia, Europe, North America, South America and the Middle East. These lineages are known as type 1 and type 2 in Australia and North America and in Europe and South America as MT-8 and MT-1, respectively. Type 1 and type 2 mites in Australia and North America are delineated by internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1) and cytochrome oxidase I region (COI) sequence differences. In North America, two A. tosichella genotypes known as biotypes are recognized by their response to the Cmc3 mite resistance gene in wheat. Aceria tosichella biotype 1 is susceptible to Cmc3 and biotype 2 is virulent to Cmc3. In this study, ITS1 and COI sequence differences in 25 different populations of A. tosichella of known biotype 1 or biotype 2 composition were characterized for ITS1 and COI sequence differences and used to model spatio-temporal dynamics based on biotype prevalence. Results showed that the proportion of biotype 1 and 2 varies both spatially and temporally. Greater ranges of cropland and grassland within 5000m of the sample site, as well as higher mean monthly precipitation during the month prior to sampling appear to reduce the probability of occurrence of biotype 1 and increase the probability of occurrence of biotype 2. The results suggest that spatio-temporal modeling can effectively improve A. tosichella management. Continual integration of additional current and future precipitation and ground cover data into the existing model will further improve the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of A. tosichella in annual wheat crops, allowing producers to make informed decisions about the selection of varieties with different A. tosichella resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W3031744557,"Researchers contribute to the frontiers of knowledge by establishing facts and reaching new conclusions through systematic investigations, and by subsequently publishing the outcomes of their research findings in the form of research papers. These research publications are indicative of researchers' scientific impact. Different bibliometric indices have been proposed to measure the impact or productivity of a researcher. These indices include publication count, citation count, number of coauthors, h-index, etc. The h-index, since its inception, has been ranked as the foremost impact indicator by many studies. However, as a consequence of the various short comings identified in h-index, some variants of h-index have been proposed. For instance, one dimension which requires significant attention is determining the ability of exceptional performers in a particular research area. In our study, we have compared effectiveness of h-index and some of its recent variants in identifying the exceptional performers of a field. We have also found correlation of h-index with recently proposed indices. A high correlation indicates same effect of these indices as of h-index and low correlation means these indices make non-redundant contribution while ranking potential researchers of a field of study. So far, effectiveness of these indices has not been explored/validated on real data sets of same field. We have considered these variants/modifications of h-index along with h-index and tested on comprehensive data set for the field of Computer Science. The Award winners' data set is considered as the benchmark for the evaluation of these indices for individual researchers. Results show that there is a low correlation of these indices with h-index, and in identifying exceptional performers of a field these indices perform better than h-index."

This study compared the effects of training one multi-joint exercise (leg press) or two single-joint exercises (leg extension and kickback) on dynamic and isometric strength and the transferability of dynamic strength between exercises. Fifty-three physically active women were randomized to a multi-joint (MJ) training group (age = 21.95±0.82 years, mass = 64.85±5.76 kg, height = 167.35±2.47 cm; n = 20), single-joint (SJ) training group (age = 22.56±1.66 years, mass = 64.85±5.76 kg, height = 165.94±2.84 cm; n = 18), or a control (CON) group (age = 21.27±0.68 years, mass = 68.43±4.86 kg, height = 168.63±2.84 cm; n = 15). The training groups participated in an 8-week supervised single- or multi-joint lower limb training consisting of 18 sessions. Pre- and post-training, six repetitions maximum (RM) and maximal voluntary isometric contraction in the three exercises were assessed, along with electromyography of the superficial quadriceps muscles. Improvements in all dynamic exercises were greatest after training the specific exercises (ES = 1.26-2.14, P<0.001-0.025) and all were greater in the training groups than in the CON group (ES = 1.43-3.31, P<0.001-0.021). The SJ group improved 6RM in leg extension and kickback more than leg press (ES = 1.51 and 2.04, respectively, P<0.001), whereas the MJ group improved leg press 6RM more than kickback (ES = 1.10, P = 0.002). However, leg press and leg extension strength improved similarly in the MJ group (ES = 0.54, P = 0.072). All strength and electromyographic measures remained unchanged in the CON group (ES = 0.00-0.44, P = 0.412-0.966). Improved dynamic strength in leg press, kickback and leg extension is best attained by training the specific exercises, but both training modalities can improve strength across all exercises."
https://openalex.org/W3028619368,"Infectious diseases are often transmitted through local interactions. Yet, both surveillance and control measures are implemented within administrative units. Capturing local transmission processes and spatial coupling between regions from aggregate level data is therefore a technical challenge that can shed light on both theoretical questions and practical decisions. Fox rabies has been eliminated from much of Europe through oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programmes. The European Union (EU) co-finances ORV to maintain rabies freedom in EU member and border states via a cordon sanitaire. Models to capture local transmission dynamics and spatial coupling have immediate application to the planning of these ORV campaigns and to other parts of the world considering oral vaccination. We fitted a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to data on three decades of fox rabies cases and ORV campaigns from Eastern Germany. Specifically, we find that (i) combining regional spatial coupling and heterogeneous local transmission allows us to capture regional rabies dynamics; (ii) incursions from other regions account for less than 1% of cases, but allow for re-emergence of disease; (iii) herd immunity achieved through bi-annual vaccination campaigns is short-lived due to population turnover. Together, these findings highlight the need for regular and sustained vaccination efforts and our modelling approach can be used to provide strategic guidance for ORV delivery. Moreover, we show that biological understanding can be gained from inference from partially observed data on wildlife disease."
https://openalex.org/W3030070770,"Nucleoside monophosphate kinases play crucial roles in biosynthesis and regeneration of nucleotides. These are bi-substrate enzymes that catalyze reversible transfers of a phosphoryl group between ATP and nucleoside monophosphate. These enzymes are comprised of the CORE domain, the NMP-binding domain, and the LID domain. Large conformational rearrangement of the three domains occurs during the catalytic cycle. Although many structures of CMP kinase have been determined, only limited structural information has been available on the conformational changes along the reaction pathway. We determined five crystal structures of CMP kinase of Thermus thermophilus HB8 in ligand-free form and the CMP ""open"", CMP ""closed"", ADP-CDP-Gd3+-, and CDP-bound forms at resolutions of 1.7, 2.2, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 Å, respectively. The ligand-free form was in an open conformation, whereas the structures of the CMP ""closed"", ADP-CDP-Gd3+-, and CDP-bound forms were in a closed conformation, in which the shift of the NMP-binding domain and LID domain caused closure of the substrate-binding cleft. Interestingly, the CMP ""open"" form was in an open conformation even with CMP bound, implying intrinsic conformational fluctuation. The structure of the ADP-CDP complex is the first structure of CMP kinase with a phosphoryl group donor and an acceptor. Upon simultaneous binding of ADP and CDP, the side chains of several residues in the LID domain moved toward the nucleotides without global open-closed conformational changes compared to those in the CMP ""closed"" and CDP complexes. These global and local conformational changes may be crucial for the substrate recognition and catalysis. The terminal phosphate groups of ADP and CDP had similar geometry to those of two ADP in AMP kinase, suggesting common catalytic mechanisms to other nucleoside monophosphate kinases. Our findings are expected to contribute to detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism of CMP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W3031778859,"The formation of a tube-like structure is a basic step in the making of functional hearts in vertebrates and invertebrates and therefore, its understanding provides important information on heart development and function. In Drosophila, the cardiac tube originates from two bilateral rows of dorsally migrating cells. On meeting at the dorsal midline, coordinated changes in cell shape and adhesive properties transform the two sheets of cells into a linear tube. ECM and transmembrane proteins linked to the cytoskeleton play an important role during these dynamic processes. Here we characterize the requirement of Cbl-Associated Protein (CAP) in Drosophila heart formation. In embryos, CAP is expressed in late migrating cardioblasts and is located preferentially at their luminal and abluminal periphery. CAP mutations result in irregular cardioblast alignment and imprecisely controlled cardioblast numbers. Furthermore, CAP mutant embryos show a strongly reduced heart lumen and an aberrant shape of lumen forming cardioblasts. Analysis of double heterozygous animals reveals a genetic interaction of CAP with Integrin- and Talin-encoding genes. In post-embryonic stages, CAP closely colocalizes with Integrin near Z-bands and at cell-cell contact sites. CAP mutants exhibit a reduced contractility in larval hearts and show a locally disrupted morphology, which correlates with a reduced pumping efficiency. Our observations imply a function of CAP in linking Integrin signaling with the actin cytoskeleton. As a modulator of the cytoskeleton, CAP is involved in the establishment of proper cell shapes during cardioblast alignment and cardiac lumen formation in the Drosophila embryo. Furthermore, CAP is required for correct heart function throughout development."
https://openalex.org/W3032830304,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes have recently been employed to assess genetic diversity, as they can be used to infer both demographic history and adaptation to environments with different pathogen pressure. Here, we sampled 120 individuals of the Chinese egret (Egretta eulophotes), a globally vulnerable species, from four breeding populations across China. We assessed the levels of genetic diversity, selection pressure, and population differentiation at seven TLR loci (TLR1LB, TLR2A, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR15). Using a variety of metrics (SNPs, heterozygosity, nucleotides, haplotypes), our analyses showed that genetic diversity was lower at 4 of the 7 TLR loci in the vulnerable Chinese egret compared to the more common little egret (Egretta garzetta). The selection test indicated TLRs, except for TLR5, were under purifying selection in TLR evolution, suggesting that low TLR genetic diversity in the Chinese egret may be caused by purifying selection. Moreover, analysis of molecular variance indicated low but significant population differentiation among four populations at all of the TLR loci in this egret. However, some comparisons based on fixation index analyses did not show significant population differentiation, and Bayesian clustering showed admixture. Our finding suggested that these four populations of the Chinese egret in China may be considered a single unit for conservation planning. These results, the new report of TLR genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory vulnerable Ardeid species, will provide fundamental TLR information for further studies on the conservation genetics of the Chinese egret and other Ardeids."

This study investigates how the presence and abundance of seedlings of a previously dominant, now threatened species (Dipterocapus dyeri Pierre), varies across a range of environmental conditions. Dipterocapus dyeri seedling abundance and site characteristics were recorded at 122 observation points (4 m2) at nine clusters from two sites. Seedling presence (p = 0.065) and abundance varied significantly (p = 0.001) between the two sites, and was strongly correlated with adult D. dyeri dominance and lower soil pH, and weakly correlated with canopy openness and total stand basal area. Dipterocarpus dyeri seedlings were also grown in shade houses with three light levels on two soils. Seedling survival was significantly lower at the lowest light level (<10% full irradiance) at 13% for the forest soil and 25% for degraded soil. At higher irradiance the seedling survival rates were greater than 99%. Moisture levels remained high at the lowest light level and many seedlings died from fungal infection. We concluded that secondary forests which contain adequate numbers of adult D. dyeri as seed sources, light availability, soil pH of < 5.0, and good drainage strongly favour survival and growth of D. dyeri seedlings. Historically, D. dyeri was dominant in moist deciduous tropical forest across south-eastern Vietnam, but today it is rare. Active management of these recovering forests is essential in order to recover this high-value, climax forest species."
https://openalex.org/W3031522795,"Attempts to control invasive species using species-specific pheromones need to incorporate an understanding of interactive effects among those pathways. The larvae of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) utilise chemical cues to repulse, attract or suppress conspecific larvae. We can exploit these effects to reduce toad abundance, but the effects of each cue may not be additive. That is, exposure to one type of cue may lessen the impact of exposure to another cue. To assess this possibility, we exposed toad larvae to combinations of cues. Tadpoles that had been exposed to the suppression cue during larval development exhibited no response to the attraction cue, resulting in lower capture rates in attractant-baited traps. Suppression, however, did not affect a tadpole’s response to the alarm cue, and exposure to the alarm cue during tadpole development did not affect response to the attraction cue. Tadpoles exposed to the suppression cue were smaller than control tadpoles at 10 days post-exposure, and consequently were more vulnerable to gape-limited invertebrate predators. Our results demonstrate that the responses by toad tadpoles to chemical cues interact in important ways, and are not simply additive when combined. Control efforts need to incorporate an understanding of such interactions if we are to most effectively use chemical-communication pathways to control invasive amphibians."
https://openalex.org/W3032061317,"The evolution of the results of Progress in International Reading Literacy Study in 2006, 2011 and 2016, as well as the difficulties found by teachers implementing the core competences, have led to the need to reflect on new assessment models. The objective of our research was to design a communicative competence assessment model and verify its effect on primary education teachers. The method applied was a focus group study. Participants came from four primary education schools in the province of Seville (Spain). The data were gathered through discussion groups. The COREQ checklist was followed. Qualitative thematic analysis of the data was carried out using Atlas-ti. An inductive coding scheme was established. The results have enabled the construction of a communicative competence assessment model and its application in primary education classrooms with HERACLES. The effects of the assessment model and the computer software were different according to teachers' profiles. On the one hand, teachers open to educational innovation remained positive when facing the systematic and thorough assessment model. On the other hand, teachers less receptive to changes considered the model to be complex and difficult to apply in the classroom. In conclusion, HERACLES had a beneficial effect on communicative competence assessment throughout the curriculum and made teachers aware of the different dimensions of communicative competence (speaking, listening, reading and writing) and discourse levels (genre, macrostructure and microstructure)."
https://openalex.org/W3032215544,"Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a keystone species and an obligate mutualist of the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), is rapidly declining throughout its range. Evidence suggests this decline is leading to a downward trend in local nutcracker populations, which would in-turn decrease whitebark pine regeneration. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate temporal variation in nutcracker habitat use as a function of whitebark pine and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) habitat, at local and landscape scales, (2) develop metrics for predicting when whitebark pine communities require intervention to sustain nutcracker visitation, and (3) test McKinney et al. (2009) and Barringer et al.'s (2012) models predicting nutcracker occurrence. Between 2009 and 2013, we carried out 3,135 audio-visual Clark's nutcracker surveys at 238 random points in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Using Bayesian occupancy models and cross-product model selection, we evaluated the association between nutcracker occurrence and habitat variables during five stages of the nutcracker annual cycle, while accounting for imperfect detection. Nutcracker occurrence was most strongly associated with the presence of cone-bearing whitebark pine trees (rather than cone density) and the area of whitebark pine on the landscape. To promote a high, >75%, probability of occurrence at a site within the study area, we recommend a management plan that achieves a landscape composed of a minimum of 12,500-25,000 ha of cone-bearing whitebark pine habitat within a 32.6 km radius. Additionally, an optimal habitat mosaic includes moderate levels of Douglas-fir habitat. Models currently used to guide whitebark pine management strategies underpredicted nutcracker occurrence in our study area, suggesting these strategies may not be appropriate in the region. We cannot predict how this mutualistic relationship will change as the population density of each species shifts. We therefore suggest conducting periodic surveys to re-evaluate the relationship as the environment changes and management strategies are implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3029064315,"The prevalence of dementia has increased rapidly in Japan, while the proportion of the population accounted for by working-age individuals is facing a sharp decline. Optimizing the balance between work and caregiving for persons with dementia is a major public health issue.Using a nationally representative sample, this study investigated the working status of caregivers (CGs) for elderly people (care recipients) with dementia (CRDs) and assessed the effects of sociodemographic factors on this status.Data were obtained from the 2013 Comprehensive Survey of the Living Conditions for CRDs and CGs (the latter aged 65 years or less). Individual data of CRDs and CGs were linked, and 452 pairs were extracted. The Japanese version of the Kessler 6 (K6) with a cut-off point of 13 was used to assess general psychological distress among CGs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with the forward selection method was used to identify the predictors of their working status.Overall, the mean age of CGs was 57.1 ± 6.8 years, with 57.5% (260/452) performing paid work. Male sex, higher educational attainment, and having their own house were associated with having paid work for CGs, while higher age, spending almost all day performing nursing care, and participation in helping with toilet activities and laundry were associated with not performing paid work.Several sociodemographic factors, including nursing care-related factors, are associated with the employment status of CGs. Further research should examine detailed information on CRDs' activities of daily living, behavioral and psychological symptoms, medical service use, and social support to strengthen the system of supportive services for both CRDs and their CGs."
https://openalex.org/W3029302366,"Several studies have suggested that record high unemployment during the Great Recession was associated with deleterious changes in diet and weight-related health. However, studies have yet to explore whether the Great Recession was also associated with obesity-related health in utero.We investigated whether increasing county-level unemployment was associated with large-for-gestational age (LGA) births, using repeated cross-sectional data from California birth records between 2008 and 2011 (n = 1,715,052). LGA was defined as >90th percentile, using the Oken reference. We use the annual 1-year lagged value for county-level unemployment (2007-2010) and limit our analyses to singleton, term births. Linear probability models, with county and year fixed-effects were used to examine the unemployment-LGA association. All models control for county-level foreclosure rates, child gender, and maternal age, parity, education, and race/ethnicity.An increase in county-level unemployment was not statistically significantly associated with the prevalence of LGA (percentage point [PP]: 0.12; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.25). But, over the period of observation, for every one standard deviation increase in unemployment, LGA prevalence increased by 5% and p = 0.08.These results cautiously suggest some deleterious effects of the Great Recession on obesity-related health in utero."
https://openalex.org/W3029627700,"Numerous studies have noted the presence of a dysexecutive component of the ALS-FTD. The most widely replicated result refers to the significantly reduced verbal fluency of ALS patients when compared to healthy people. As ALS patients have motor alterations that interfere with production, qualitative studies have the advantage of being independent of the degree of motor disability and revealing patients' cognitive state. This study examined the production differences between 42 ALS patients who presented with different degrees of dementia and motor impairment and 42 healthy people. Production processes were studied by extending the administration time of a letter fluency task to 2 minutes for the phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) and semantic verbal fluency (SVF) categories. This ensured that the qualitative aspects of verbal fluency were addressed, paying special attention to the new perseverations and intrusions, as well as any clinical correlates that may exist.The ALS patients produced a significantly lower number of responses in PVF (p = .017) and SVF (p = .008). The rest of the indicators for frontal lobe alteration also suggested the existence of a dysfunction. The most remarkable results were the number of intrusions on the PVF task, which was much higher in the ALS group (p = .002). However, the number of perseverations did not differ significantly.This study highlights the value of intrusions in addressing cognitive deterioration in ALS patients. This deterioration seems to be independent of the degree of motor impairment and of behavioural alterations. Therefore, the value of the intromissions on the verbal fluency task was highlighted as an indicator of a new cognitive alteration, which can be easily evaluated, even retrospectively."
https://openalex.org/W3030079146,"Quantified computed tomography (qCT) is known for correlations with airflow obstruction and fibrotic changes of the lung. However, as qCT studies often focus on diseased and elderly subjects, current literature lacks physiological qCT values during body development. We evaluated chest CT examinations of a healthy cohort, reaching from infancy to adulthood, to determine physiological qCT values and changes during body development.Dose-optimized chest CT examinations performed over the last 3 years using a dual-source CT were retrospectively analysed. Exclusion criteria were age >30 years and any known or newly diagnosed lung pathology. Lung volume, mean lung density, full-width-at-half-maximum and low attenuated volume (LAV) were semi-automated quantified in 151 patients. qCT values between different age groups as well as unenhanced (Group 1) and contrast-enhanced (Group 2) protocols were compared. Models for projection of age-dependant changes in qCT values were fitted.Significant differences in qCT parameters were found between the age groups from 0 to 15 years (p < 0.05). All parameters except LAV merge into a plateau level above this age as shown by polynomial models (r2 between 0.85 and 0.67). In group 2, this plateau phase is shifted back around five years. Except for the volume, significant differences in all qCT values were found between group 1 and 2 (p < 0.01).qCT parameters underly a specific age-dependant dynamic. Except for LAV, qCT parameters reach a plateau around adolescence. Contrast-enhanced protocols seem to shift this plateau backwards."
https://openalex.org/W3030431911,"Although reversible in some patients, primary hypothyroidism is considered a permanent condition requiring lifelong hormone therapy. This study aimed to investigate the factors predicting the successful discontinuation of levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism.A retrospective study was performed in primary hypothyroidism patients who met inclusion criteria: patients who maintained stable L-T4 therapy for more than 1 year, following gradual dose reduction of L-T4 based on the clinical decision (L-T4 tapering); patients receiving either no L-T4 or a fixed minimum dose for more than 1 year after L-T4 tapering. Reduction in L-T4 dosage by 12.5-50 μg within 3 months was considered as L-T4 tapering. Serum free T4, TSH, and clinical symptoms were evaluated before, during and after tapering. Logistic regression and decision tree analyses were performed to predict the successful discontinuation of L-T4.Among 382 patients, 22.5% and 58.4% showed successful discontinuation (T4-Discontinued) and dose reduction (T4-Reduced) of L-T4 therapy, while other did not obtained any reduction of L-T4 dose (T4-Unchanged). The median number of tapering visit was 1.0 (range, 1.0-4.0). In T4-Discontinued group, the TSH level and the positive rate of anti-thyroperoxidase at the time of L-T4 initiation were lower, the duration of L-T4 therapy was shorter, and the maintenance dose of L-T4 at the time of tapering was lower than those in the T4-Unchanged group. In ultrasonography, normal parenchyma was preserved in the T4-Discontinued group while others showed higher rates of heterogeneous or hypoechoic parenchymal changes. Among those different characteristics, the longer duration of L-T4 therapy and the higher maintenance dose of L-T4 at the time of tapering significantly predicted the failure of discontinuation of L-T4 in multivariate analysis. A decision tree showed that patients with a duration of L-T4 therapy >4.6 years had lower success rate of discontinuation.Shorter duration of L-T4 therapy and lower L-T4 dose at the time of tapering are the predictable factors for successful L-T4 tapering in stably maintained primary hypothyroidism patients."
