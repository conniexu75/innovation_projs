https://openalex.org/W3164845562,"Glycemic traits are used to diagnose and monitor type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic health. To date, most genetic studies of glycemic traits have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Here we aggregated genome-wide association studies comprising up to 281,416 individuals without diabetes (30% non-European ancestry) for whom fasting glucose, 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge, glycated hemoglobin and fasting insulin data were available. Trans-ancestry and single-ancestry meta-analyses identified 242 loci (99 novel; P < 5 × 10-8), 80% of which had no significant evidence of between-ancestry heterogeneity. Analyses restricted to individuals of European ancestry with equivalent sample size would have led to 24 fewer new loci. Compared with single-ancestry analyses, equivalent-sized trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the number of estimated variants in 99% credible sets by a median of 37.5%. Genomic-feature, gene-expression and gene-set analyses revealed distinct biological signatures for each trait, highlighting different underlying biological pathways. Our results increase our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology by using trans-ancestry studies for improved power and resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3165551447,"Structural variations (SVs) and gene copy number variations (gCNVs) have contributed to crop evolution, domestication, and improvement. Here, we assembled 31 high-quality genomes of genetically diverse rice accessions. Coupling with two existing assemblies, we developed pan-genome-scale genomic resources including a graph-based genome, providing access to rice genomic variations. Specifically, we discovered 171,072 SVs and 25,549 gCNVs and used an Oryza glaberrima assembly to infer the derived states of SVs in the Oryza sativa population. Our analyses of SV formation mechanisms, impacts on gene expression, and distributions among subpopulations illustrate the utility of these resources for understanding how SVs and gCNVs shaped rice environmental adaptation and domestication. Our graph-based genome enabled genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based identification of phenotype-associated genetic variations undetectable when using only SNPs and a single reference assembly. Our work provides rich population-scale resources paired with easy-to-access tools to facilitate rice breeding as well as plant functional genomics and evolutionary biology research."
https://openalex.org/W3164592241,"Damaged mitochondria need to be cleared to maintain the quality of the mitochondrial pool. Here, we report mitocytosis, a migrasome-mediated mitochondrial quality-control process. We found that, upon exposure to mild mitochondrial stresses, damaged mitochondria are transported into migrasomes and subsequently disposed of from migrating cells. Mechanistically, mitocytosis requires positioning of damaged mitochondria at the cell periphery, which occurs because damaged mitochondria avoid binding to inward motor proteins. Functionally, mitocytosis plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial quality. Enhanced mitocytosis protects cells from mitochondrial stressor-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial respiration; conversely, blocking mitocytosis causes loss of MMP and mitochondrial respiration under normal conditions. Physiologically, we demonstrate that mitocytosis is required for maintaining MMP and viability in neutrophils in vivo. We propose that mitocytosis is an important mitochondrial quality-control process in migrating cells, which couples mitochondrial homeostasis with cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W3165008993,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease of the lower and upper motor neurons with sporadic or hereditary occurrence. Age of onset, pattern of motor neuron degeneration and disease progression vary widely among individuals with ALS. Various cellular processes may drive ALS pathomechanisms, but a monogenic direct metabolic disturbance has not been causally linked to ALS. Here we show SPTLC1 variants that result in unrestrained sphingoid base synthesis cause a monogenic form of ALS. We identified four specific, dominantly acting SPTLC1 variants in seven families manifesting as childhood-onset ALS. These variants disrupt the normal homeostatic regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) by ORMDL proteins, resulting in unregulated SPT activity and elevated levels of canonical SPT products. Notably, this is in contrast with SPTLC1 variants that shift SPT amino acid usage from serine to alanine, result in elevated levels of deoxysphingolipids and manifest with the alternate phenotype of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy. We custom designed small interfering RNAs that selectively target the SPTLC1 ALS allele for degradation, leave the normal allele intact and normalize sphingolipid levels in vitro. The role of primary metabolic disturbances in ALS has been elusive; this study defines excess sphingolipid biosynthesis as a fundamental metabolic mechanism for motor neuron disease. Clinical and genetic evaluation of individuals with childhood-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identifies a new monogenic cause for early-onset ALS and proposes a specific metabolic mechanism leading to motor neuron disease via sphingolipid excess."
https://openalex.org/W3165432826,"Northern East Asia was inhabited by modern humans as early as 40 thousand years ago (ka), as demonstrated by the Tianyuan individual. Using genome-wide data obtained from 25 individuals dated to 33.6-3.4 ka from the Amur region, we show that Tianyuan-related ancestry was widespread in northern East Asia before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At the close of the LGM stadial, the earliest northern East Asian appeared in the Amur region, and this population is basal to ancient northern East Asians. Human populations in the Amur region have maintained genetic continuity from 14 ka, and these early inhabitants represent the closest East Asian source known for Ancient Paleo-Siberians. We also observed that EDAR V370A was likely to have been elevated to high frequency after the LGM, suggesting the possible timing for its selection. This study provides a deep look into the population dynamics of northern East Asia."
https://openalex.org/W3165653012,"Thermogenic adipocytes possess a therapeutically appealing, energy-expending capacity, which is canonically cold-induced by ligand-dependent activation of β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we uncover an alternate paradigm of GPCR-mediated adipose thermogenesis through the constitutively active receptor, GPR3. We show that the N terminus of GPR3 confers intrinsic signaling activity, resulting in continuous Gs-coupling and cAMP production without an exogenous ligand. Thus, transcriptional induction of Gpr3 represents the regulatory parallel to ligand-binding of conventional GPCRs. Consequently, increasing Gpr3 expression in thermogenic adipocytes is alone sufficient to drive energy expenditure and counteract metabolic disease in mice. Gpr3 transcription is cold-stimulated by a lipolytic signal, and dietary fat potentiates GPR3-dependent thermogenesis to amplify the response to caloric excess. Moreover, we find GPR3 to be an essential, adrenergic-independent regulator of human brown adipocytes. Taken together, our findings reveal a noncanonical mechanism of GPCR control and thermogenic activation through the lipolysis-induced expression of constitutively active GPR3."
https://openalex.org/W3165101514,"The hippocampus supports many facets of cognition, including learning, memory, and emotional processing. Anatomically, the hippocampus runs along a longitudinal axis, posterior to anterior in primates. The structure, function, and connectivity of the hippocampus vary along this axis. In human hippocampus, longitudinal functional heterogeneity remains an active area of investigation, and structural heterogeneity has not been described. To understand the cellular and molecular diversity along the hippocampal long axis in human brain and define molecular signatures corresponding to functional domains, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing on surgically resected human anterior and posterior hippocampus from epilepsy patients, identifying differentially expressed genes at cellular resolution. We further identify axis- and cell-type-specific gene expression signatures that differentially intersect with human genetic signals, identifying cell-type-specific genes in the posterior hippocampus for cognitive function and the anterior hippocampus for mood and affect. These data are accessible as a public resource through an interactive website."
https://openalex.org/W3164197617,"Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) decline occurs with aging and neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated the NCT pathway in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–fused in sarcoma (ALS–FUS). Expression of ALS–FUS led to a reduction in NCT and nucleoporin (Nup) density within the nuclear membrane of human neurons. FUS and Nups were found to interact independently of RNA in cells and to alter the phase-separation properties of each other in vitro. FUS–Nup interactions were not localized to nuclear pores, but were enriched in the nucleus of control neurons versus the cytoplasm of mutant neurons. Our data indicate that the effect of ALS-linked mutations on the cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS, rather than on the physiochemical properties of the protein itself, underlie our reported NCT defects. An aberrant interaction between mutant FUS and Nups is underscored by studies in Drosophila, whereby reduced Nup expression rescued multiple toxic FUS-induced phenotypes, including abnormal nuclear membrane morphology in neurons. ALS-linked mutations in FUS trigger defects within the nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway in human neurons and Drosophila. Aberrant interactions between FUS and nucleoporins are thought to underlie these defects."
https://openalex.org/W3164826641,"Drugs of abuse induce persistent remodeling of reward circuit function, a process thought to underlie the emergence of drug craving and relapse to drug use. However, how circuit-specific, drug-induced molecular and cellular plasticity can have distributed effects on the mesolimbic dopamine reward system to facilitate relapse to drug use is not fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3)-dependent plasticity in the ventral pallidum (VP) drives potentiation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens during relapse to cocaine seeking after abstinence. We show that two distinct VP DRD3+ neuronal populations projecting to either the lateral habenula (LHb) or the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display different patterns of activity during drug seeking following abstinence from cocaine self-administration and that selective suppression of elevated activity or DRD3 signaling in the LHb-projecting population reduces drug seeking. Together, our results uncover how circuit-specific DRD3-mediated plasticity contributes to the process of drug relapse."
https://openalex.org/W3164211796,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating fatal neurodegenerative disease. An alternative to the amyloid cascade hypothesis is that a viral infection is key to the etiology of late-onset AD, with β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides playing a protective role. In the current study, young 5XFAD mice that overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish, Florida, and London familial AD mutations were infected with one of two strains of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), 17syn+ and McKrae, at three different doses. Contrary to previous work, 5XFAD genotype failed to protect mice against HSV-1 infection. The region- and cell-specific tropisms of HSV-1 were not affected by the 5XFAD genotype, indicating that host-pathogen interactions were not altered. Seven- to ten-month-old 5XFAD animals in which extracellular Aβ aggregates were abundant showed slightly better survival rate relative to their wild-type (WT) littermates, although the difference was not statistically significant. In these 5XFAD mice, HSV-1 replication centers were partially excluded from the brain areas with high densities of Aβ aggregates. Aβ aggregates were free of HSV-1 viral particles, and the limited viral invasion to areas with a high density of Aβ aggregates was attributed to phagocytic activity of reactive microglia. In the oldest mice (12-15 months old), the survival rate did not differ between 5XFAD and WT littermates. While the current study questions the antiviral role of Aβ, it neither supports nor refutes the viral etiology hypothesis of late-onset AD."
https://openalex.org/W3164492903,"Studies of research policies and scientific production are essential for strengthening educational systems and achieving objectives such as quality improvement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of research policies on the scientific production of public and private Peruvian universities. An observational, descriptive, secondary analysis study of the research policies of 92 universities and two graduate schools licensed by the National Superintendence of Higher Education of Peru (SUNEDU) was conducted for the period from 2016–2020. Scientific publications from educational institutions were collected from Scopus and Web of Science for the study period, and researchers certified by the National Council of Science and Technology of Peru (CONCYTEC) were divided by group and level. Multiple regression analysis was performed using two models. The analysis indicated that research policies did not influence scientific production in Scopus or Web of Science in either 2019 or 2020 (Model I) but that type of management (p &lt; 0.01), number of National Scientific, Technological, and Technological Innovation Registry (RENACYT) researchers (p &lt; 0.001) and 2016 scientific production (p &lt; 0.001) did influence production when these variables were incorporated into the model (Model II). However, time of licensing and management type had no effects. The number of research policies implemented by Peruvian universities and licensed graduate schools was not large. Therefore, it is recommended that project funding policies, research training, and research collaboration be strengthened and that the management capacity of research centers and institutes be increased."
https://openalex.org/W3165431420,"Abstract Emerging evidences suggest that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Here, the aim of this study is to investigate the biological function of long intervening noncoding RNA Linc00284 in colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression levels of Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met were evaluated by qPCR and/or Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Ki67 and Phh3 in tumor tissues. The interaction between Linc00284, miR-27a and c-Met was validated by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Cell function experiments, including CCK-8, wound-healing and transwell invasion assays, were conducted. The in vivo studies were performed with the subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse models. Our findings reveal that Linc00284 is upregulated in CRC tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 in comparison with corresponding para-carcinoma tissues and human fetal colonic mucosa cells FHC. High expression of Linc00284 in tumor tissues is associated with tumor metastasis and predicts a poor clinical outcome in CRC patients. Serum Linc00284 is increased, while miR-27a is decreased in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analysis indicates that serum Linc00284 and miR-27a produce the area under the curve (AUC) value of at 0.8151 and 0.7316 in patients with colorectal cancer compared to healthy individuals, respectively. Additionally, results in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that Linc00284 silencing significantly suppresses CRC cell proliferation and/or invasion. Mechanistically, Linc00284 promotes c-Met expression by acting as miR-27a sponge, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, thereby causing malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. Taken together, Linc00284 exhibits oncogenic function and the disturbance of Linc00284/miR-27a/c-Met regulatory axis contributes to CRC progression, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Importantly, the expression levels of serum Linc00284 and miR-27a may serve as clinical biomarkers for CRC diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3165767728,"Iron is essential for erythropoiesis and other biological processes, but is toxic in excess. Dietary absorption of iron is a highly regulated process and is a major determinant of body iron levels. Iron excretion, however, is considered a passive, unregulated process, and the underlying pathways are unknown. Here we investigated the role of metal transporters SLC39A14 and SLC30A10 in biliary iron excretion. While SLC39A14 imports manganese into the liver and other organs under physiological conditions, it imports iron under conditions of iron excess. SLC30A10 exports manganese from hepatocytes into the bile. We hypothesized that biliary excretion of excess iron would be impaired by SLC39A14 and SLC30A10 deficiency. We therefore analyzed biliary iron excretion in Slc39a14-and Slc30a10-deficient mice raised on iron-sufficient and -rich diets. Bile was collected surgically from the mice, then analyzed with nonheme iron assays, mass spectrometry, ELISAs, and an electrophoretic assay for iron-loaded ferritin. Our results support a model in which biliary excretion of excess iron requires iron import into hepatocytes by SLC39A14, followed by iron export into the bile predominantly as ferritin, with iron export occurring independently of SLC30A10. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular determinant of mammalian iron excretion and can serve as basis for future investigations into mechanisms of iron excretion and relevance to iron homeostasis.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular determinant of mammalian iron excretion and can serve as basis for future investigations into mechanisms of iron excretion and relevance to iron homeostasis. Iron (Fe) is a dietary nutrient essential for erythropoiesis and other biological processes (1Katsarou A. Pantopoulos K. Basics and principles of cellular and systemic iron homeostasis.Mol. Aspects Med. 2020; 75: 100866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In excess, Fe catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to dysfunction in organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. Fe absorption is a critical determinant of body Fe levels. Much of our understanding of Fe absorption comes from the study of inherited diseases of Fe excess such as hereditary hemochromatosis (2Corradini E. Buzzetti E. Pietrangelo A. Genetic iron overload disorders.Mol. Aspects Med. 2020; 75: 100896Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by deficiency in hepcidin, a hormone that inhibits dietary Fe absorption. Hepcidin is synthesized mainly by the liver. Its expression is stimulated by Fe and inflammation and inhibited by anemia. Hepcidin inhibits Fe absorption by posttranslationally downregulating expression and activity of ferroportin, a protein that exports Fe from enterocytes and macrophages into the blood. In hereditary hemochromatosis, hepcidin deficiency leads to unabated Fe absorption, Fe excess, and toxicity. In theory, Fe levels are determined by absorption and excretion. Our understanding of mechanisms of Fe absorption has advanced greatly over recent decades. In contrast, little is established about pathways of Fe excretion. Excretion is considered passive and unregulated. It is attributed to turnover of intestinal epithelium, blood loss, and exfoliation of dead skin (1Katsarou A. Pantopoulos K. Basics and principles of cellular and systemic iron homeostasis.Mol. Aspects Med. 2020; 75: 100866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, Fe can also undergo biliary excretion (3Brissot P. Deugnier Y. Guyader D. Zanninelli G. Loréal O. Moirand R. Lescoat G. Iron overload and the biliary route.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 277-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some studies report that only minor amounts of Fe are excreted in the bile under conditions of Fe excess, while others report that increases in bile Fe levels are not proportionate to increases in liver Fe levels in conditions of Fe excess (4Lévy P.

Nevertheless, non-transferrin-bound Fe (NTBI), a pathologic form of Fe present in states of Fe excess, is excreted into the bile (9Brissot P. Bolder U. Schteingart C.D. Arnaud J. Hofmann A.F.

Physiol. 1994; 267: G135-G142PubMed Google Scholar). NTBI also undergoes enterohepatic circulation, the process by which substances in the bile are reabsorbed by the intestines for return to the liver. Inorganic Fe can bind to bile salts and remains soluble at neutral pH (11Jacobs A. Miles P.M.

Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 68: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fe-binding proteins are also present in the bile. Transferrin and lactoferrin translocate from the blood to the bile (13Regoeczi E. Chindemi P.A.

Slc39a14 deficiency attenuates liver Fe excess in mice on Fe-rich diets or in mice deficient in hemochromatosis proteins Hfe or Hfe2 or hepatic transferrin. To our knowledge, SLC39A14 is the only known transporter shown in vivo to be specific to NTBI. For this reason, and because SLC39A14 also imports NTBI into hepatocytes, we focused on this transporter in this study on biliary excretion of excess Fe. Specifically, we hypothesized that biliary excretion of excess Fe would be impaired by SLC39A14 deficiency because import of excess Fe into hepatocytes is impaired by SLC39A14 deficiency. To test this, we analyzed biliary Fe excretion in Slc39a14-deficient mice (Slc39a14KO/KO) raised on Fe-sufficient and -rich diets. We also studied the metal transporter SLC30A10 (ZNT10).

Like SLC39A14 deficiency, SLC30A10 deficiency causes a rare inherited disease of Mn excess and neurological dysfunction due to impaired gastrointestinal Mn excretion (28Anagianni S. Tuschl K. Genetic disorders of manganese metabolism.Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2019; 19: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Winslow J.W.W. Limesand K.H. Zhao N. The functions of ZIP8, ZIP14, and ZnT10 in the regulation of systemic manganese homeostasis.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 3304Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). (In contrast, unlike SLC39A14 deficiency, SLC30A10 deficiency also leads to liver cirrhosis and polycythemia. While the cause of polycythemia is unclear, liver cirrhosis is attributed to liver Mn excess.) As mentioned above, SLC39A14 imports Mn and NTBI into the liver. Given that SLC3010 exports Mn from the liver, we considered that SLC30A10 may also export NTBI from the liver and that biliary excretion of excess Fe may be impaired by SLC30A10 deficiency. To test this, we analyzed biliary Fe excretion in Slc30a10-deficient mice (Slc30a10KO/KO) raised on Fe-sufficient and -rich diets. Here we present our analysis of SLC39A14 and SLC30A10 in biliary Fe excretion and discuss the implications of our findings to the understanding of Fe homeostasis. As described above, we hypothesized that biliary excretion of excess Fe by hepatocytes would be impaired by Slc39a14 deficiency, because import of excess Fe into hepatocytes requires Slc39a14. To test this, we first established that Slc39a14 deficiency impairs hepatocyte Fe loading in mice with dietary Fe loading, as previously reported (30Jenkitkasemwong S. Wang C.-Y. Coffey R. Zhang W. Chan A. Biel T. Kim J.-S. Hojyo S. Fukada T. Knutson M.D. SLC39A14 is required for the development of hepatocellular iron overload in murine models of hereditary hemochromatosis.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 138-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slc39a14+/+ and Slc39a14KO/KO mice were weaned onto diets containing 50 or 10,000 ppm Fe. Bile, blood, and tissues were then collected from mice at 2 months of age and first analyzed for phenotypes relevant to Fe homeostasis. The Fe-rich diet had no effect on body mass, although male Slc39a14KO/KO mice were smaller than Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on either diet (Fig. S1A). The Fe-rich diet also had no impact on hemoglobin levels, hematocrits, serum Fe levels, or transferrin saturations in Slc39a14+/+ or Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. S1, B–E). In contrast, the Fe-rich diet increased liver mass in all mice (Fig. S1F). It also increased nonheme Fe levels in all mice although liver Fe levels were lower in Slc39a14KO/KO than Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on Fe-rich diets (Fig. S1G). The Fe-rich diet increased hepcidin RNA levels in all mice although the increase in female Slc39a14+/+ mice did not reach significance (Fig. S1H). Fe levels were also analyzed in other tissues. The Fe-rich diet increased Fe levels in the spleens of Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. S1I). It also increased Fe levels in the kidney and heart of Slc39a14KO/KO but not Slc39a14+/+ mice (Fig. S1, J and K), but had no effect on Fe levels in the pancreas for any mice (Fig. S1L). We next performed tissue Fe stains to examine the cellular localization of excess Fe. Fe was detected mainly in periportal hepatocytes in Slc39a14+/+ mice and in nonparenchymal cells in Slc39a14KO/KO mice raised on Fe-rich diets (Fig. S1, M and N). Fe staining was not observed in the pancreas for any mouse group (Fig. S2A). Fe was detected in splenic red pulp macrophages, with staining most intense in Slc39a14KO/KO mice raised on Fe-rich diets (Fig. S2B). (Fe staining was undetectable in the spleens of male Slc39a14KO/KO mice raised on the Fe-sufficient diet. A similar finding was noted with nonheme Fe measurements (Fig. S1I). The relevance of this is not clear.) Fe was detected in enterocytes of mice on Fe-rich diets, with staining most prominent near the apical surface, although intensity varied regionally even within samples (Fig. S2, C and D). The above analyses indicated that Slc39a14 deficiency impaired hepatocyte Fe loading in mice raised on an Fe-rich diet, as previously reported (30Jenkitkasemwong S. Wang C.-Y. Coffey R. Zhang W. Chan A. Biel T. Kim J.-S. Hojyo S. Fukada T. Knutson M.D. SLC39A14 is required for the development of hepatocellular iron overload in murine models of hereditary hemochromatosis.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 138-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that biliary excretion of excess Fe is impaired by Slc39a14 deficiency, we next analyzed the bile collected surgically from mice at the time of harvest. The Fe-rich diet decreased bile flow rates in all mice except male Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 1A). Bile flow rates did not differ between Slc39a14+/+ and Slc39a14KO/KO mice for either sex on either diet (p values not shown in Fig. 1A). The Fe-rich diet increased bile nonheme Fe levels in Slc39a14+/+ mice but not in Slc39a14KO/KO mice, with and without normalization to liver mass (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine if increases in bile Fe levels were proportionate to increases in liver Fe levels, we calculated ratios of bile to liver Fe levels. The Fe-rich diet had no impact on ratios in Slc39a14+/+ mice but did decrease them in Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 1D). The Fe-rich diet also increased nonheme Fe levels excreted into the bile per hour in Slc39a14KO/KO mice but not Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 1E). Overall, these data indicated that Slc39a14 deficiency impairs biliary excretion of excess Fe under conditions of dietary Fe loading. (There was insufficient female mouse bile for all analyses in this report. Bile yields were lower for females given their smaller size. Also, female bile samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry, as described below.) To determine the biochemical nature of excess Fe in the bile, we first identified proteins abundantly expressed in the bile from Fe-loaded mice. Bile samples from five female Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on Fe-sufficient and -rich diets were digested with trypsin, labeled with TMT11plex, fractionated, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2A, Tables 1 and 2). Hemoglobin subunits Hba, Hbb-b1, and Hbb-b2 were more abundant in mice on the Fe-sufficient diet. Ferritin light chain (Ftl1) was more abundant in mice on the Fe-rich diet. Ferritin heavy chain (Fth1), lactoferrin (Ltf), and transferrin (Tf) did not differ in abundance. (Both Fth1 and Ltf were identified only by single unique peptides.)Table 1Bile proteins identified by mass spectrometry as less abundant (p < 0.05) in bile from female Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on Fe-rich diet than on Fe-sufficient diet, arranged in descending order by –log(p)SymbolNameAccession%#FClogFCpadj p−log pHbaHemoglobin subunit alphaP01942316−3.45−1.822.97E-042.38E-023.53AldoaFructose-bisphosphate aldolase AP05064167−1.80−0.951.25E-034.40E-022.90Hist1h1cHistone H1.2P15864313−1.77−0.931.59E-034.93E-022.80SetProtein SETQ9EQU552−2.02−1.102.47E-036.23E-022.61Ca2Carbonic anhydrase 2P0092072−1.76−0.923.43E-037.49E-022.46Sept8Septin-8Q8CHH942−1.88−1.004.40E-037.97E-022.36Smpd3Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3Q9JJY362−2.59−1.424.80E-038.15E-022.32NarsAsparagine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmicQ8BP4732−1.61−0.816.13E-038.92E-022.21Hbb-b1Hemoglobin subunit beta-1P02088655−2.46−1.361.12E-021.21E-011.95Calm2Calmodulin-2P0DP27133−1.84−0.981.89E-021.54E-011.72Hbb-b2Hemoglobin subunit beta-2P02089475−2.00−1.081.91E-021.54E-011.72Ppt1Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1O88531177−1.72−0.892.28E-021.64E-011.64Acot1Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 1O5513763−1.73−0.902.90E-021.81E-011.54Uqcrc1Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1, mitochondrialQ9CZ1353−1.74−0.904.55E-022.34E-011.34Atp5f1bATP synthase subunit beta, mitochondrialP564802814−1.81−0.964.68E-022.38E-011.33Accession: accession number from UniProtKB; %, percent coverage; #, number unique peptides; adj p, adjusted p.

Given this, we considered that increased Fe saturation of bile Tf could contribute to increased bile nonheme Fe levels, even though mass spectrometry indicated that Tf did not differ in abundance between bile samples from mice on Fe-sufficient and -rich diets. By ELISA, Tf levels were ∼50 to 100 μg/ml bile (and ∼50–150 μg/ml bile/g liver) across all groups (Fig. 2, B and C). Assuming a molecular weight of 80 kD for Tf, 50 to 100 μg Tf/ml equates to 0.625 to 1.25 μM, which could bind 1.25 to 2.5 μM Fe or 70 to 140 ng Fe/ml bile (Table S1). For reference, bile nonheme Fe levels were ∼20 μg/ml in Slc39a14+/+ mice on Fe-rich diets (Fig. 1B). This suggested that the majority of bile nonheme Fe was not bound to Tf. Since Ftl1 levels were more abundant in mice on the Fe-rich diet, we next focused on ferritin subunits Ftl1 and Fth1. Bile Ftl1 and Fth1 levels were measured by ELISA. The Fe-rich diet increased bile Ftl1 and Fth1 levels in Slc39a14+/+ but not Slc39a14KO/KO mice, although Fth1 levels were lower than Ftl1 levels for all mice except Slc39a14KO/KO mice on Fe-rich diets (Fig. 2D). Similar results were observed when bile Ftl1 and Fth1 levels were normalized to liver mass (Fig. 2E). We next measured Ftl1 and Fth1 in liver lysates and serum by ELISA for comparison. We first analyzed the liver. The Fe-rich diet increased liver lysate Ftl1 levels in Slc39a14+/+ and Slc39a14KO/KO mice, although levels were lower in Slc39a14KO/KO mice than Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on the Fe-rich diet (Fig. 2F, left graph). In contrast, the Fe-rich diet decreased liver lysate Fth1 levels but only in Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 2F, right graph). Ftl1 levels were higher than Fth1 levels for all groups except Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on the Fe-sufficient diet. We next focused on the serum. The Fe-rich diet increased serum Ftl1 and Fth1 levels in Slc39a14+/+ and Slc39a14KO/KO mice, although Ftl1 levels were lower in Slc39a14KO/KO than Slc39a14+/+ mice raised on Fe-rich diets and Fth1 levels were lower than Ftl1 levels for all groups (Fig. 2G). To compare the relative abundance of ferritin subunits in the bile, liver lysates, and serum, we next calculated ratios of Ftl1 to Fth1 levels. Ftl1:Fth1 ratios were greater in the bile than liver or serum in Slc39a14+/+ mice on Fe-rich diets but lower in the bile than liver or serum in Slc39a14KO/KO mice on Fe-rich diets (Fig. 2H). The Fe-rich diet increased Ftl1:Fth1 ratios for all compartments for all mice except Slc39a14KO/KO bile. Overall, these data confirmed the mass spectrometric analysis indicating that ferritin is enriched in Fe-loaded bile. The difference in Ftl1:Fth1 ratios for the bile, liver lysates, and serum also suggested that bile ferritin is biochemically distinct from liver and serum ferritin in conditions of dietary Fe loading. We next evaluated if Ftl1 and Fth1 levels were proportionate to liver Fe levels by calculating ratios of Ftl1 or Fth1 to liver nonheme Fe levels. For bile, the Fe-rich diet increased Ftl1:liver Fe ratios in Slc39a14+/+ mice but decreased ratios in Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 2I), while the Fe-rich diet decreased bile Fth1:liver Fe ratios in all mice (Fig. 2J). For liver lysates, the Fe-rich diet decreased Fth1:liver Fe ratios in male Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig. 2K). For serum, the Fe-rich diet increased Ftl1:liver Fe ratios in all mice and decreased Fth1:liver Fe ratios in male Slc39a14KO/KO mice (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W3165364810,"Transgenic mammalian cells are used for numerous research, pharmaceutical, industrial, and clinical purposes, and dominant selectable markers are often used to enable the selection of transgenic cell lines. Using HEK293 cells, we show here that the choice of selectable marker gene has a significant impact on both the level of recombinant protein expression and the cell-to-cell variability in recombinant protein expression. Specifically, we observed that cell lines generated with the NeoR or BsdR selectable markers and selected in the antibiotics G418 or blasticidin, respectively, displayed the lowest level of recombinant protein expression as well as the greatest cell-to-cell variability in transgene expression. In contrast, cell lines generated with the BleoR marker and selected in zeocin yielded cell lines that expressed the highest levels of linked recombinant protein, approximately 10-fold higher than those selected using the NeoR or BsdR markers, as well as the lowest cell-to-cell variability in recombinant protein expression. Intermediate yet still-high levels of expression were observed in cells generated with the PuroR- or HygR-based vectors and that were selected in puromycin or hygromycin, respectively. Similar results were observed in the African green monkey cell line COS7. These data indicate that each combination of selectable marker and antibiotic establishes a threshold below which no cell can survive and that these thresholds vary significantly between different selectable markers. Moreover, we show that choice of selectable marker also affects recombinant protein expression in cell-derived exosomes, consistent with the hypothesis that exosome protein budding is a stochastic rather than determinative process.

The creation of transgenic mammalian cell lines was pioneered in the 1980s by Berg and colleagues (1Mulligan R.C. Berg P.

U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In general, this process involves transfecting or transducing cells with a recombinant DNA vector that carries the gene of interest and a selectable marker gene and then selecting for transgene-expressing cells using an appropriate antibiotic (3Southern P.J. Berg P. Transformation of mammalian cells to antibiotic resistance with a bacterial gene under control of the SV40 early region promoter.J. Mol. Appl.

U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This approach has been widely employed, has led to the creation of many useful transgenic cell lines, and is still in use today. However, many of the antibiotic-resistant cell clones generated by this approach express low or undetectable levels of the linked transgene (5Hunter M. Yuan P. Vavilala D. Fox M. Optimization of protein expression in mammalian cells.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2019; 95: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As a result, experiments that require high-level expression of the transgene of interest often require the isolation, expansion, and screening of dozens (or more) single-cell clones (SSCs) before one can obtain a cell line that displays the desired level of transgene expression. Many researchers have devoted significant time, effort, and resources to improving the outcomes of mammalian cell transgenesis experiments. Much of this effort has been directed at improved vector design, resulting in the identification of many cis-acting features that affect transgene expression, including transcriptional regulatory regions (6Humphries R.K.

Transgene delivery can also be achieved via replicating episomes, as plasmids carrying Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) origin of replication (OriP) and the EBV nuclear antigen 1 gene (EBNA1) may boost transgene expression via elevated gene dosage effects (22Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Stable replication of plasmids derived from Epstein-Barr virus in various mammalian cells.Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Researchers have also invented technologies that direct transgene integration into sites of the host cell chromosome that are compatible with high-level, stable transgene expression, such as recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (23Turan S. Zehe C. Kuehle J. Qiao J. Bode J. Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) - a rapidly-expanding toolbox for targeted genomic modifications.Gene. 2013; 515: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), phage ΦC31-mediated DNA integration (24Chalberg T.W.

Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering.Cell. 2014; 157: 1262-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). Although these site-directed insertional strategies represent a significant technological advance, several are limited to specific, previously engineered recipient cell lines, all require the isolation, expansion, and characterization of numerous SCCs, and none are designed specifically for eliciting the very highest levels of transgene expression. While these and other studies have led to significant improvements and advanced the field of mammalian cell transgenesis, none have systematically interrogated the relative effectiveness of the available dominant selectable markers. The five dominant selectable markers in widespread are the NeoR, BsdR, HygR, PuroR, and BleoR genes, which confer resistance to the selective antibiotics G418/geneticin, blasticidin, hygromycin B, puromycin, and zeocin, respectively (3Southern P.J.

It is therefore unclear whether the choice of selectable marker has any predictable effects on the outcome of mammalian cell transgenesis experiments. This report shows that the choice of selectable marker and the process of antibiotic selection has a significant effect on the expression of linked recombinant proteins. Furthermore, many of the experiments in this paper addressed the effects of selectable marker on expression of a recombinant exosomal cargo protein, CD81, so that our results might have relevance to the engineering of exosomes. Exosomes are small, extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of ~30–150 nm in diameter that are released by all human cell types, can transmit signals and molecules to other cells in a pathway of intercellular vesicle traffic, and are of increasing use as delivery vehicles for vaccines and therapeutics (30Pegtel D.M. Gould S.J. Exosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 487-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). HEK293 cell lines are commonly used for biochemical and cell biological studies and are an approved cell factory for producing biological materials and drugs (5Hunter M. Yuan P. Vavilala D. Fox M.

To document the results of a classic plasmid-based mammalian cell transgenesis experiment (4Canaani D. Berg P.

Protein Sci. 2019; 95: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we transfected HEK293 cells with pcDNA3-3xNLS-tdTomato-2a-BsdR, which carries two independent functional genes. One is designed to express the NeoR gene from the SV40 early promoter, and the other is designed to express a bicistronic ORF encoding (i) 3xNLS-tdTomato, a form of the red fluorescent protein tdTomato (32Shaner N.C.

Vignali D.A. Development of 2A peptide-based strategies in the design of multicistronic vectors.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2005; 5: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and (iii) the selectable marker blasticidin deaminase (29Kimura M. Kamakura T. Tao Q.Z. Kaneko I. Yamaguchi I. Cloning of the blasticidin S deaminase gene (BSD) from Aspergillus terreus and its use as a selectable marker for Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Pyricularia oryzae.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). (Fig. 1A). Two days after transfection, the cells were placed into complete media containing either 400 ug/ml G418 to select for G418-resistant cell lines or 20 ug/ml blasticidin to select for blasticidin-resistant cell lines. Two weeks later, the cells were pooled and examined by flow cytometry to determine the range of 3xNLS-tdTomato expression in each cell population (Fig. 1, B and C). Assaying thousands of cells from these polyclonal cell lines revealed that ~50% of cells in the G418-resistant line cells lacked detectable levels of 3xNLS-tdTomato expression. This is not surprising, given that the 3xNLS-tdTomato gene represents a sizeable proportion of the transfected plasmid and will therefore be disrupted in a significant proportion of G418-resistant cell lines due to the random nature of plasmid linearization that occurs during transgene insertion into host chromosomes (4Canaani D. Berg P. Regulated expression of human interferon beta 1 gene after transduction into cultured mouse and rabbit cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Hunter M. Yuan P. Vavilala D. Fox M. Optimization of protein expression in mammalian cells.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2019; 95: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the blasticidin-resistant cell line contained a far lower percentage of nonexpressing cells, consistent with the fact that this transgene enforces a 1:1 stoichiometry between 3xnNLS-tdTomato expression and blasticidin deaminase enzymes expression. However, this cell line also displayed a pronounced cell-to-cell variability in 3xNLS-tdTomato expression, demonstrating that resistance to BsdR showed no correlation to any particular level of transgene expression. These conclusions were also apparent from fluorescence microscopy experiments (Fig. 1, D–I). These results raised the question of whether all dominant selectable markers yield cell lines with similarly low and heterogeneous levels of recombinant protein expression. To explore this possibility, we created a new set of expression vectors designed to drive expression of a single gene comprised of a CMV promoter upstream of a bicistronic ORF that encoded 3xNLS-tdTomato separated by the p2a peptide from downstream NeoR (3Southern P.J.

Clones from each transfection were then pooled to generate five distinct cell lines, which were then examined for 3xNLS-tdTomato expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, B–G; Table 1). The NeoR- and BsdR-resistant cell lines displayed the lowest average relative brightness and high degrees of cell-to-cell variation in 3xNLS-tdTomato fluorescence (458, with a coefficient of variance (c.v.) = 103; and 522, with a c.v. = 82, respectively).

In the present study, we sequenced and annotated the complete chloroplast genome of U. compressa (alpha-numeric code: RD9023) and focused on the assessment of genome length, homology, gene order and direction, intron size, selection strength, and substitution rate. We compared the chloroplast genome with the mitogenome. The generated phylogenetic tree was analyzed based on single and aligned genes in the chloroplast genome of Ulva compared to mitogenome genes to detect evolutionary trends. U. compressa and U. mutabilis chloroplast genomes had similar gene queues, with individual genes exhibiting high homology levels. Chloroplast genomes were clustered together in the entire phylogenetic tree and shared several forward/palindromic/tandem repetitions, similar to those in U. prolifera and U. linza. However, U. fasciata and U. ohnoi were more divergent, especially in sharing complementary/palindromic repetitions. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of the aligned genes from their chloroplast genomes and mitogenomes confirmed the evolutionary trends of the extranuclear genomes. From phylogenetic analysis, we identified the petA chloroplast genes as potential genetic markers that are similar to the tufA marker. Complementary/forward/palindromic interval repetitions were more abundant in chloroplast genomes than in mitogenomes. Interestingly, a few tandem repetitions were significant for some Ulva subspecies and relatively more evident in mitochondria than in chloroplasts. Finally, the tandem repetition [GAAATATATAATAATA × 3, abbreviated as TRg)] was identified in the mitogenome of U. compressa and the conspecific strain U. mutabilis but not in other algal species of the Yellow Sea. Owing to the high morphological plasticity of U. compressa, the findings of this study have implications for the rapid non-sequencing detection of this species during the occurrence of green tides in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3165884004,"Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) interacts with actin and myosin to modulate cardiac muscle contractility. These interactions are disfavored by cMyBP-C phosphorylation. Heart failure patients often display decreased cMyBP-C phosphorylation, and phosphorylation in model systems has been shown to be cardioprotective against heart failure. Therefore, cMyBP-C is a potential target for heart failure drugs that mimic phosphorylation or perturb its interactions with actin/myosin. Here we have used a novel fluorescence lifetime-based assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of actin-cMyBP-C binding. Actin was labeled with a fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 568, AF568) near its cMyBP-C binding sites; when combined with the cMyBP-C N-terminal fragment, C0-C2, the fluorescence lifetime of AF568-actin decreases. Using this reduction in lifetime as a readout of actin binding, a high-throughput screen of a 1280-compound library identified three reproducible hit compounds (suramin, NF023, and aurintricarboxylic acid) that reduced C0-C2 binding to actin in the micromolar range. Binding of phosphorylated C0-C2 was also blocked by these compounds. That they specifically block binding was confirmed by an actin-C0-C2 time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET) binding assay. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and transient phosphorescence anisotropy (TPA) confirmed that these compounds bind to cMyBP-C, but not to actin. TPA results were also consistent with these compounds inhibiting C0-C2 binding to actin. We conclude that the actin-cMyBP-C fluorescence lifetime assay permits detection of pharmacologically active compounds that affect cMyBP-C-actin binding. We now have, for the first time, a validated high-throughput screen focused on cMyBP-C, a regulator of cardiac muscle contractility and known key factor in heart failure.

We now have, for the first time, a validated high-throughput screen focused on cMyBP-C, a regulator of cardiac muscle contractility and known key factor in heart failure. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C, Fig. 1) has been identified as a therapeutic target for systolic or diastolic dysfunction in heart failure and cardiomyopathy. cMyBP-C may contribute to heart failure due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). HCM is a common heart disease, affecting around 1:500 individuals, for which there are few therapeutic treatments (1Spudich J.A. Three perspectives on the molecular basis of hypercontractility caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations.Pflugers Arch. 2019; 471: 701-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In HCM the heart typically becomes enlarged, hypercontractile, and unable to relax effectively. The systolic contraction is preserved, but diastolic relaxation is diminished. HCM is associated with heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac death at any age. The primary cause of HCM is most often a missense mutation in one of several sarcomeric proteins or the truncation of cMyBP-C. In addition to cMyBP-C, the sarcomeric proteins associated with HCM include those associated with the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments, including myosin, troponin, tropomyosin, leiomodin, and titin. DCM results from missense mutations in some of the same sarcomeric genes as for HCM (but not cMyBP-C truncations) as well as Z-disk proteins (2Arimura T. Ishikawa T. Nunoda S. Kawai S. Kimura A.

DCM can also be caused by mutations in nonsarcomeric genes, such as those encoding proteins of the nucleus, ion channels, and cytoskeleton (3Hershberger R.E. Hedges D.J. Morales A. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The complexity of a diverse genetic architecture.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2013; 10: 531-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Any one of these mutations leads to dilation of the ventricular chambers and defects in systolic contraction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that increasing or decreasing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C allows for tuning cardiac contraction and relaxation through phosphorylation-sensitive interactions with actin and myosin. These interactions and their effects are complex, and it is not yet fully understood how they are integrated. Binding to actin is proposed to activate the thin filament in low calcium conditions by repositioning tropomyosin to the unblocked position, thereby stimulating contraction (4Mun J.Y. Previs M.J.

Binding to actin has also been observed to shift F-actin to a more ordered state, similar to the effect of myosin binding to actin (6Colson B.A. Rybakova I.N. Prochniewicz E. Moss R.L. thomas D.D.

During relaxation, cMyBP-C bound to actin is proposed to generate a drag on the sliding of the filaments, thereby slowing relaxation (8Walcott S. Docken S. Harris S.P.

Decreases in phosphorylation of cMyBP-C have been observed in heart failure and HCM patients, including those affected by mutations in cMyBP-C and sarcomeric proteins other than cMyBP-C (24Jacques A.M.

Therefore, targeting cMyBP-C with drugs that mimic phosphorylation and that modulate its binding to actin or myosin is a promising approach to improve cardiac muscle function in heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Recently, cardiac-specific, small-molecule effectors of myosin have been developed to activate or inhibit cardiac muscle contraction in heart failure and HCM (26Malik F.I. Hartman J.J. Elias K.A.

McDowell R.S. et al.A small-molecule inhibitor of sarcomere contractility suppresses hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mice.Science. 2016; 351: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). While some ongoing human clinical trials are promising, alternative strategies, such as targeting cardiac-specific actomyosin accessory proteins (i.e., cMyBP-C) may prove valuable as well. Despite strong evidence implicating cMyBP-C as an ideal target for therapy, no cMyBP-C small-molecule modulator has been identified. A critical barrier to progress in this area is that high-throughput screening (HTS) assays based on cMyBP-C functional activities have not been available. Current in vitro actin or myosin-binding assays, such as cosedimentation, are labor-intensive and low-throughput, limited in the number of samples that can be tested. Recent development of fluorescence lifetime plate readers (28Cornea R.L. Gruber S.J. Lockamy E.L. Muretta J.M. Jin D. Chen J. Dahl R. Bartfai T. Zsebo K.M. Gillispie G.D. Thomas D.D. High-throughput FRET assay yields allosteric SERCA activators.J. Biomol. Screen. 2013; 18: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) now allows for high-throughput (∼3 min/microplate), high-precision (picoseconds for lifetime and nanometers for distances) assays that are scalable (in-plate, 1536-well plates, detection) and reduce labor. We recently developed a fluorescence lifetime HTS assay for detecting the interaction of F-actin with N-terminal cMyBP-C domains C0-C2 (15Bunch T.A. Lepak V.C. Bortz K.M. Colson B.A. A high-throughput fluorescence lifetime-based assay for detecting binding of myosin-binding protein C to F-actin.J. Gen. Physiol. 2021; 153e202012707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time-resolved fluorescence (TR-F) assay reported a significant reduction in lifetime of IAEDANS attached to actin at Cys-374 when incubated with C0-C2. This reduction was concentration-dependent and correlated with actin binding of C0-C2 as measured by cosedimentation assays. The high precision of the TR-F assay was demonstrated by resolving significant changes in binding due to phosphorylation and mutations relevant to HCM and function. In the present study, we have used this TR-F assay, using a fluorescence lifetime plate reader (see Experimental procedures) to screen the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC). We selected this library because it is a diverse collection of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds that includes all major drug target classes, inhibitors, pharma-developed tools, and approved drugs. To reduce interference with compounds exhibiting fluorescence at shorter wavelengths (29Schaaf T.M. Li A. Grant B.D. Peterson K. Yuen S. Bawaskar P. Kleinboehl E. Li J. Thomas D.D. Gillispie G.D.

Chem. 2008; 51: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we labeled actin with the red-shifted fluorescent dye, Alexa Fluor 568 (AF568), which was excited by a 532-nm microchip laser. This screen reproducibly identified three compounds that appeared to reduce MyBP-C binding to actin in the micromolar range. We then tested these “Hit” compounds for dose dependence in the TR-F assay and further evaluated their efficacy in biochemical and biophysical secondary assays. To verify compound–target engagement, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) determined the micromolar affinity of the three Hit compounds to cMyBP-C. Transient phosphorescence anisotropy (TPA) provided further proof that the Hit compounds did not bind to actin and that they inhibited C0-C2–actin interactions. Finally, we developed a novel TR-FRET assay as an alternative method to monitor C0-C2 binding to actin. We used this TR-FRET assay to confirm the effects of the identified Hits on actin binding. This is the first HTS assay to identify compounds that specifically bind to human cMyBP-C and modulate its interactions with actin. The results of this study provide proof-of-concept validation for the TR-F assay in identifying effective cMyBP-C-specific modulators of actomyosin function. This new tool will be valuable in the development of new therapies for cardiac muscle diseases. We have previously described a TR-F based C0-C2–actin-binding assay utilizing IAEDANS-labeled actin. The lifetime, τ, of IAEDANS attached to actin was reduced upon C0-C2 binding. This provided a rapid way to monitor binding in a multiwell plate format conducive to screening libraries of compounds that modulate actin-cMyBP-C binding (15Bunch T.A. Lepak V.C. Bortz K.M. Colson B.A. A high-throughput fluorescence lifetime-based assay for detecting binding of myosin-binding protein C to F-actin.J. Gen. Physiol. 2021; 153e202012707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, a high percentage of compounds fluoresce at the shorter wavelength used to excite IAEDANS (8Walcott S. Docken S. Harris S.P. Effects of cardiac Myosin binding protein-C on actin motility are explained with a drag-activation-competition model.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 10-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To decrease this problem, we tested the TR-F response of C0-C2 binding to actin, where the actin was labeled with probes that are excited at longer wavelengths, permitting the use of a longer-wavelength laser (29Schaaf T.M. Li A. Grant B.D. Peterson K. Yuen S. Bawaskar P. Kleinboehl E. Li J. Thomas D.D. Gillispie G.D. Red-shifted FRET biosensors for high-throughput fluorescence lifetime screening.Biosensors (Basel). 2018; 8PubMed Google Scholar). TR-F decays of Alexa Fluor 546 (AF546) and Alexa Fluor 568 (AF568)-labeled actin in the presence of cMyBP-C N-terminal fragment (C0-C2) (Fig. 2A) were analyzed by one-exponential fitting (see Experimental procedures) to determine fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 2, B and C and Fig. S1A). Both probes on actin showed lifetime decreased with increasing C0-C2 concentration, indicating binding. This effect was reduced with phosphorylated C0-C2, indicating less binding (Fig. 2D). As AF568 showed a greater change in lifetime upon C0-C2 binding to F-actin, we used this probe for the HTS screen. Analysis of TR-F binding curves with 1 μM AF568-actin revealed that at 2 μM C0-C2 the lifetime is highly sensitive to phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 2D). Since our goal was to detect compounds that show differences in binding similar to those detected upon PKA phosphorylation, we selected these concentrations of AF568-actin (1 μM) and C0-C2 (2 μM) to perform the screen. From cosedimentation assays (15Bunch T.A. Lepak V.C. Bortz K.M. Colson B.A. A high-throughput fluorescence lifetime-based assay for detecting binding of myosin-binding protein C to F-actin.J. Gen. Physiol. 2021; 153e202012707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we know that these correspond to binding ratios of ∼1:7 C0-C2:actin, which is similar to that found in the muscle sarcomere. We performed HTS using the LOPAC library (see Experimental procedures). The screen was performed in duplicate with two different preparations of AF568-actin and C0-C2 samples. Each screen tested the effect of the compounds on the lifetime of AF568-actin and the effect of the compounds on the lifetime of AF568-actin in the presence of C0-C2 (AF568-actin:C0-C2). The Z′ factor for this screen was calculated as 0.5 ± 0.1 using DMSO-only controls, validating the robustness of this HTS assay (see Experimental procedures). Compounds that altered the lifetime of AF568-actin alone by more than 4 standard deviations (SD) of the mean of controls (no compound) were excluded from the analysis of the AF568-actin:C0-C2 results. This removed 210 and 106 compounds from the first and second screen, respectively. The change in lifetime of AF568-actin due to effects of each compound on AF568-actin:C0-C2 complex was determined by subtracting the effects of each compound on AF568-actin alone from the effects on AF568-actin:C0-C2. Since C0-C2 binding reduced AF568-actin lifetime, compounds interfering with C0-C2 binding to actin increased the lifetime of AF568-actin:C0-C2. Positive changes from both screens were sorted, ranked, and compared. The top 25 compounds revealed three compounds (designated “Hits”) in common and 22 that were not repeatable (Tables S1 and S2). Two additional suboptimal (explained in Experimental procedures) screens of the same library also yielded only these three Hit compounds in the top 25 preliminary hits. Each of these had 22 false positives that were not identified in any of the other screens (Tables S3 and S4). Thus, the Hit rate was 0.23%. Suramin showed the greatest effect, with an average change in lifetime that was 6.5 SD above the median (of all compounds not excluded due to large effects on AF568-actin alone); NF023 (a suramin analog) was 3.8 SD above the median; and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) was 3.0 SD above the median. These three Hit compounds were tested further in orthogonal assays. Using the same conditions as in the primary screen, we determined the concentration dependence of each of the three Hit compounds on the AF568-actin lifetime effects. As observed in the screen, all three Hit compounds had little effect on AF568-actin alone (Fig. 3A). C0-C2 reduced the lifetime of AF568, and all three Hit compounds, in a concentration-dependent manner, returned AF568 to the lifetime observed for AF568-actin alone (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with all three Hit compounds inhibiting C0-C2 binding to actin. The apparent EC50 (concentration of compound needed for half-maximal effect) of the Hit compounds as measured by TR-F is 5–20 μM (Fig. 3, Table 1). In a separate dose–response assay utilizing 3 μM C0-C2, we compared the effects of the compounds on nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated C0-C2. When AF568-actin was bound to C0-C2 phosphorylated by PKA, a decreased lifetime of AF568 was observed (though the decrease was smaller than with nonphosphorylated C0-C2) and all three Hit compounds again returned AF568 lifetime to that of AF568-actin alone (Fig. 3B). In the second dose-response assay, 3 μM instead of 2 μM C0-C2 was used in the second dose–response assay so that effects of compounds on phosphorylated C0-C2 could be readily detected, as phosphorylation of C0-C2 itself (in the absence of compounds) reduces binding to actin.Table 1Summary of Hit compound effects on the dose–response of AF568-actin-C0-C2 TR-F (left) and ITC (right) parameters of compound binding to C0-C2CompoundTR-FTR-FTR-F+PKATR-F+PKAITCITCITCITCITCEC50 (μM)nEC50 (μM)nKd (μM)nΔHΔGΔSSuramin5.9 ± 1.23.64.8 ± 1.21.216.6 ± 1.03.4−17.4−26.832.3NF02316.3 ± 1.23.217.5 ± 11.81.842.0 ± 3.42.1−30.2−24.6−19.2ATA7.9 ± 1.93.44.3 ± 0.91.425.9 ± 2.23.1−10.2−25.852.9Average data are provided as mean ± SE and each experiment was done with two separate protein preparations.

TR-F data is from Figure 3A measured at 2 μM C0-C2 and TR-F+PKA data is from Figure 3, B–D measured at 3 μM C0-C2. Potential binding of these three Hit compounds to cMyBP-C was evaluated by ITC. ITC titration curves of C0-C2 with each of the three identified compounds are shown in Figure 4, A–C. Very clear binding curves with saturation at an excess of C0-C2 indicate that there is direct interaction between the Hit compounds and C0-C2. Fitting the binding curves in Figure 4, A–C (and replicates done with a separate preparation of C0-C2) yielded dissociation constants of 15–75 μm and stoichiometries of C0-C2:compound of 1:2–3 (Table 1). For suramin, but not NF023 or ATA, weak interactions with actin alone (Kd=∼200 μM) were noted (Fig. S2). Compound-induced changes in TR-F and ITC results showing direct binding of the Hit compounds to C0-C2 suggested that the Hit compounds bind to C0-C2, and this modulates its binding with actin. We attempted to confirm effects on binding using a standard cosedimentation assay where F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation and the amount of C0-C2 bound to the F-actin in the pellet was quantitated. Unfortunately, all three Hit compounds caused C0-C2 to nonspecifically (in the absence of any actin) bind to the centrifuge tubes used for the assay. This was the case even though the tubes are precoated with BSA to prevent nonspecific sticking. Since the compounds cause C0-C2 to bind nonspecifically to the centrifuge tube, we tested whether the compounds denature C0-C2 and cause it to become insoluble. We tested all three drugs for causing C0-C2 to aggregate by measuring absorbance in the visible range, beyond the absorption of protein or the drugs themselves. For suramin and NF023, we did not detect absorption, but for ATA we detected absorption (actually a reduction in transmitted light due to light scatter). This suggests that ATA causes some C0-C2 aggregation, which probably contributes to the background that interfered with our cosedimentation assay for this specific drug (Fig. S3). As an alternative to cosedimentation, we performed an intermolecular FRET assay to follow C0-C2 binding to actin (Fig. 5A). Actin was labeled with the fluorescent donor fluorescein-5-maleimide (FMAL) and incubated with increasing concentrations of C0-C2 labeled with the acceptor tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) at amino acid Cys225 (see Experimental procedures) in the C1 domain. Binding of TMR-C0-C2 to FMAL-actin resulted in TR-FRET (Figs. 5B and S1B). TR-FRET binding curves for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated C0-C2 showed that this TR-FRET was dose-dependent (Fig. 5C).

However, only a few cold-adapted AcXEs have been reported, and the underlying mechanisms for their cold adaptation are still unknown because of the lack of structural information. Here, a cold-adapted AcXE, AlAXEase, from the Arctic marine bacterium Arcticibacterium luteifluviistationis SM1504T was characterized. AlAXEase could deacetylate xylooligosaccharides and xylan, which, together with its homologs, indicates a novel SGNH-type carbohydrate esterase family. AlAXEase showed the highest activity at 30 °C and retained over 70% activity at 0 °C but had unusual thermostability with a Tm value of 56 °C. To explain the cold adaption mechanism of AlAXEase, we next solved its crystal structure. AlAXEase has similar noncovalent stabilizing interactions to its mesophilic counterpart at the monomer level and forms stable tetramers in solutions, which may explain its high thermostability. However, a long loop containing the catalytic residues Asp200 and His203 in AlAXEase was found to be flexible because of the reduced stabilizing hydrophobic interactions and increased destabilizing asparagine and lysine residues, leading to a highly flexible active site. Structural and enzyme kinetic analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures revealed that the flexible catalytic loop contributes to the cold adaptation of AlAXEase by modulating the distance between the catalytic His203 in this loop and the nucleophilic Ser32.

This study reveals a new cold adaption strategy adopted by the thermostable AlAXEase, shedding light on the cold adaption mechanisms of AcXEs. Acetyl xylan esterases (AcXEs) (EC 3.1.1.72) are a kind of carbohydrate esterases (CEs) that hydrolyze ester bonds to liberate acetic acid from acetylated hemicellulose, typically xylans and xylooligosaccharides (1Adesioye F.A.

Technol. 2016; 93-94: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). AcXEs are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals (1Adesioye F.A. Makhalanyane T.P. Biely P. Cowan D.A. Phylogeny, classification and metagenomic bioprospecting of microbial acetyl xylan esterases.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2016; 93-94: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Microbial AcXEs are capable of facilitating the access of main-chain depolymerizing enzymes to xylan (2Komiya D. Hori A. Ishida T. Igarashi K. Samejima M. Koseki T. Fushinobu S. Crystal structure and substrate specificity modification of acetyl xylan esterase from Aspergillus luchuensis.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 83e01251-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), thereby playing an important role in terrestrial and marine xylan degradation and recycling. Based on amino acid similarities, microbial AcXEs fall into nine families, CE families 1 to 7, 12, and 16 (3Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B.

In addition to the hydrolysis of acetylated xylooligosaccharides, many AcXEs are also capable of hydrolyzing other acetylated oligosaccharides/monosaccharides with relatively high activities, especially for the acetylated glucose (7Tian Q.

Except for those from families CE1, CE4, CE5, and CE7, AcXEs from the other CE families also belong to the SGNH hydrolase subfamily of the GDSL family (1Adesioye F.A. Makhalanyane T.P. Biely P.

GDSL family esterases are characterized by the nucleophilic serine located in the conserved GDSL motif rather than in the canonical GxSxG motif reported in other serine esterases (10Akoh C.C.

Some of the GDSL enzymes are further classified into the SGNH hydrolase subfamily because of the presence of four strictly conserved active site residues Ser, Gly, Asn, and His in the four conserved blocks I, II, III, and V, respectively (11Li J.

Li X.L. Chen H.Z. Ljungdahl L.G. Characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AxeA efficiently deacetylates acetylated xylan at low temperatures of 15 to 30 °C (18Blum D.L. Li X.L. Chen H.Z. Ljungdahl L.G.

However, owing to the lack of structural information, the underlying mechanisms for the cold adaptation of AcXEs are still unknown by far. Cold-adapted enzymes help their source strains to adapt to extremely cold environments. Compared with mesophilic/thermophilic homologs, cold-adapted enzymes display higher catalytic activity at low temperatures because of their more flexible structures (19Nagel Z.D. Cun S. Klinman J.P.

Most cold-adapted enzymes show a global rather than uniform distribution of their flexibility throughout the whole structure, therefore resulting in their low thermostability (21Siddiqui K.S. Cavicchioli R. Cold-adapted enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 403-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, some cold-adapted enzymes are also reported to have unusual thermal stability, such as the vibriolysin E495 from an Arctic sea ice bacterium (22Xie B.B. Bian F. Chen X.L. He H.L. Guo J.

Biol. 2007; 372: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Compared with its mesophilic homologs, E495 has similar noncovalent stabilizing interactions but higher flexibility because of the reduction of hydrogen-bond stability in the dynamic structure, suggesting the optimization of hydrogen-bonding dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation of enzymes (22Xie B.B. Bian F. Chen X.L. He H.L. Guo J. Gao X. Zeng Y.X. Chen B. Zhou B.C. Zhang Y.Z.

For CpPAH and DpIDH, both enzymes have local flexibility around their active sites, which leads to their cold adaptation without compromising the global stability of proteins (23Leiros H.K. Pey A.L.

Thus, cold-active enzymes may have diverse cold adaption strategies, and the cold adaption mechanisms for other enzymes, especially for the SGNH-type AcXEs, need to be further explored. Arcticibacterium luteifluviistationis SM1504T is a cold-adapted bacterium isolated from an Arctic surface seawater sample from King’s Fjord, Svalbard (25Li D.D. Peng M. Wang N. Wang X.J. Zhang X.Y. Chen X.L. Su H.N. Zhang Y.Z. Shi M. Arcticibacterium luteifluviistationis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from Arctic seawater.Int. J. Syst. Evol.

Complete genome sequence of Arcticibacterium luteifluviistationis SM1504T, a cytophagaceae bacterium isolated from Arctic surface seawater.Stand Genomic Sci. 2018; 13: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here, we identified and characterized a novel SGNH-type AcXE, AlAXEase, from strain SM1504T, which, together with its homologs, represents a new SGNH-type CE family. AlAXEase deacetylated xylooligosaccharides and acetyl xylan. Biochemical characterization showed that AlAXEase is a cold-adapted enzyme with high thermostability. We further solved the crystal structure of AlAXEase to probe the structural basis for its cold adaptation. Structural and enzyme kinetic analyses combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of WT AlAXEase and its mutant E190A at different temperatures revealed that AlAXEase has a long and flexible catalytic loop around its active site that contributes to the cold adaptation of AlAXEase by modulating the distance between the catalytic His203 in this loop and the nucleophilic Ser32. A gene encoding a GDSL family protein (GenBank Accession No. WP_111370902) was obtained from the genome sequence of the marine cold-adapted bacterium A. luteifluviistationis SM1504T based on gene annotation, which was designated as AlAXEase. AlAXEase is 669 bp in length, encoding a putative lipolytic enzyme of 222 amino acid residues. Based on the SignalP 5.0 prediction, AlAXEase contains an N-terminal signal peptide sequence (14 residues in length). AlAXEase shows the highest sequence identity (66%) to an uncharacterized GDSL family protein from Emticicia aquatilis (GenBank Accession No. WP_188769581). Among all the characterized GDSL enzymes, AlAXEase is most closely related to the SGNH-type acetyl xylan esterase Axe2 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (4Alalouf O. Balazs Y. Volkinshtein M. Grimpel Y. Shoham G. Shoham Y. A new family of carbohydrate esterases is represented by a GDSL hydrolase/acetylxylan esterase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41993-42001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with a low sequence identity of 24%, suggesting that AlAXEase is a potential novel SGNH-type CE. To reveal the relationship between AlAXEase and other CEs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed, including AlAXEase and its homologs, Axe2 and its homologs, and characterized enzymes from known SGNH-type CE families 2, 3, 6, 12, and 16 (Fig. 1). The tree showed that AlAXEase and its homologs are clustered as a separate group from all other characterized SGNH-type CEs (Fig. 1). Based on these data, we suggest that AlAXEase and its homologs represent a new SGNH-type CE family. Multiple sequence alignment showed that AlAXEase contains the four characteristic sequence blocks of SGNH hydrolases, blocks I, II, III, and V (Fig. 2), further supporting that AlAXEase is a SGNH hydrolase. AlAXEase has a catalytic triad possibly formed by Ser32, Asp200, and His203 (Fig. 2). The catalytic Ser32 is located in the conserved GDSxT motif (block I) close to the N terminus, while Asp200 and His203 are located in the conserved DxxHL(P) motif (block V) (Fig. 2). Residues Gly69 and Asn98 were predicted to be involved in the oxyanion hole, which are located in blocks II and III, respectively (Fig. 2). AlAXEase without the predicted signal peptide was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) with the coexpression of the chaperone protein groES-groEL and purified. The recombinant AlAXEase with a calculated molecular mass of 23.5 kDa could hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPC2), 1-napthyl acetate, and phenyl acetate but showed no detectable activity against pNP-acylesters with an acyl chain length of more than two carbon atoms (Table 1), suggesting that AlAXEase may have a small substrate-binding pocket. Using pNPC2 as the substrate, AlAXEase exhibited the highest activity at 30 °C and retained more than 70% of the highest activity at 0 °C (Fig. 3A), indicating that it is a cold-adapted enzyme. However, AlAXEase displayed unexpected tolerance to heat treatment, retaining 75% of the highest activity at 50 °C and 45% at 60 °C after 1 h incubation (Fig. 3B). Moreover, AlAXEase had a relatively high Tm value of 56 °C (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the cold-adapted AlAXEase has unusual thermal stability. The cold-adapted AlAXEase was also resistant to mechanic stirring (Fig. S1). AlAXEase exhibited the highest activity at pH 9.0 and was stable in a range of pH 5.0 to 11.0 (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2). AlAXEase is also a halotolerant enzyme, whose activity was not influenced by 3.0 M NaCl (Fig. 3E). Among all the tested metal ions, only 10 mM of Cu2+, Fe2+, or Fe3+ severely inhibited AlAXEase activity, whereas the other metal ions had no or weak inhibitory effect on AlAXEase activity (Table 2). AlAXEase activity was not influenced by the metal chelator EDTA but severely inhibited by 10 mM PMSF (Table 2), suggesting that AlAXEase is a serine hydrolase.Table 1The substrate specificity of AlAXEaseSubstrateSpecific activity (U/mg)p-Nitrophenyl acetate9.10 ± 0.09p-Nitrophenyl butyrate--aUndetectable.p-Nitrophenyl caproate--aUndetectable.p-Nitrophenyl caprylate--aUndetectable.1-Napthyl acetate2.21 ± 0.18Phenyl acetate2.23 ± 0.44Isopropenyl acetate--aUndetectable.Menthyl acetate0.40 ± 0.09Florfenicol0.07 ± 0.01Ethyl 2-chlorobenzoate0.10 ± 0.01Ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate0.10 ± 0.01β-D-galactose pentaacetate3.63 ± 0.01β-D-glucose pentaacetate3.89 ± 0.06Sucrose octaacetate3.61 ± 0.341,2,3,5-Tetra-O-acetyl-D-xylofuranose3.02 ± 0.211,2,3,4-Tetra-O-acetyl-D-xylopyranose3.88 ± 0.14Benzyl β-D-xylobioside pentaacetate0.38 ± 0.03Xylan (partially acetylated)0.29 ± 0.03N-acetyl-D-glucosamine--aUndetectable.a Undetectable.

Open table in a new tab To reveal the natural substrates of AlAXEase, we also measured the activity of AlAXEase against different kinds of acetylated carbohydrates (Table 1). Similar to the acetyl xylan esterase Axe2 from G. stearothermophilus (Table S1), AlAXEase could deacetylate many acetylated monosaccharides and disaccharides including galactose, glucose, xylose in furanose and pyranose configurations, sucrose, and xylobioside, as well as partially acetylated xylan, with the highest activity toward acetylated glucose and xylopyranose (Table 1), indicating that AlAXEase is a CE. AlAXEase hardly degraded N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Table 1), suggesting its high specificity for the O-acetyl groups rather than the N-acetyl groups of acetylated carbohydrates. Further kinetic analysis revealed that, among the acetylated monosaccharides, acetylated xylopyranose is the optimal substrate of AlAXEase, to which AlAXEase showed the highest substrate affinity and the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) (Fig. 3F and Table S2). Moreover, AlAXEase could hydrolyze both acetylated xylobioside and acetyl xylan (Table 1). All these data indicate that AlAXEase is an acetyl xylan esterase. To reveal the underlying cold adaption mechanism of AlAXEase, we solved the crystal structure of WT AlAXEase by the molecular replacement method using selenomethionine (SeMet)-AlAXEase structure as the starting model because of the low sequence identities (lower than 24%) shared by AlAXEase and proteins with available structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The crystal of AlAXEase belongs to the P1211 space group, and the structure of AlAXEase was solved at 2.50 Å resolution. The statistics for refinement are summarized in Table 3. Structural data show that each asymmetric unit contains four AlAXEase molecules (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W3164355433,"Dietary lipid composition has been shown to impact brain morphology, brain development, and neurologic function. However, how diet uniquely regulates brain lipid homeostasis compared with lipid homeostasis in peripheral tissues remains largely uncharacterized. To evaluate the lipid response to dietary changes in the brain, we assessed actively translating mRNAs in astrocytes and neurons across multiple diets. From this data, ethanolamine phosphate phospholyase (Etnppl) was identified as an astrocyte-specific fasting-induced gene. Etnppl catabolizes phosphoethanolamine (PEtN), a prominent headgroup precursor in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) also found in other classes of neurologically relevant lipid species. Altered Etnppl expression has also previously been associated with humans with mood disorders. We evaluated the relevance of Etnppl in maintaining brain lipid homeostasis by characterizing Etnppl across development and in coregulation with PEtN-relevant genes, as well as determining the impact to the brain lipidome after Etnppl loss. We found that Etnppl expression dramatically increased during a critical window of early brain development in mice and was also induced by glucocorticoids. Using a constitutive knockout of Etnppl (EtnpplKO), we did not observe robust changes in expression of PEtN-related genes. However, loss of Etnppl altered the phospholipid profile in the brain, resulting in increased total abundance of PE and in polyunsaturated fatty acids within PE and phosphatidylcholine species in the brain. Together, these data suggest that brain phospholipids are regulated by the phospholyase action of the enzyme Etnppl, which is induced by dietary fasting in astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3164757121,"This study aims to highlight the relationships between the structure of smell compounds and their odors. For this purpose, heterogeneous data sources were screened, and 6038 odorant compounds and their known associated odors (162 odor notes) were compiled, each individual molecule being represented with a set of 1024 structural fingerprint. Several dimensional reduction techniques (PCA, MDS, t-SNE and UMAP) with two clustering methods (k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering AHC) were assessed based on the calculated fingerprints. The combination of UMAP with k-means and AHC methods allowed to obtain a good representativeness of odors by clusters, as well as the best visualization of the proximity of odorants on the basis of their molecular structures. The presence or absence of molecular substructures has been calculated on odorant in order to link chemical groups to odors. The results of this analysis bring out some associations for both the odor notes and the chemical structures of the molecules such as ""woody"" and ""spicy"" notes with allylic and bicyclic structures, ""balsamic"" notes with unsaturated rings, both ""sulfurous"" and ""citrus"" with aldehydes, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and sulfur compounds, and ""oily"", ""fatty"" and ""fruity"" characterized by esters and with long carbon chains. Overall, the use of UMAP associated to clustering is a promising method to suggest hypotheses on the odorant structure-odor relationships."

In higher plants, many plant-specific MAPs have emerged during evolution as advantageous to their sessile lifestyle.

Here we demonstrate that the domain of unknown function 4005 (DUF4005) of the Arabidopsis IQD family protein ABS6/AtIQD16 is a novel MT-binding domain.

Furthermore, we showed that a conserved stretch of 15 amino acid residues within the DUF4005 domain, which shares sequence similarity with the C-terminal MT-binding domain of human MAP Kif18A, is required for the binding to MTs. Transgenic lines overexpressing the DUF4005 domain displayed a spectrum of developmental defects, including spiral growth and stunted growth at the organismal level.

Microtubules (MTs) are polymers assembled by α- and β-tubulin dimers and play critical roles in determining cell shape, cell polarity, intracellular transport, and cell division in eukaryotic cells. Given the sessile nature of terrestrial plants and the restriction of cell movement by the cell wall, dynamic responses of MTs are essential for higher plants to respond to the developmental and environmental cues (1Elliott A.

Are microtubules tension sensors?.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). During plant cell cycles, MTs adopt several different types of arrays. In interphase cells, distinct cortical MT (cMT) organizations are formed depending on the specific developmental stage and physiological state of the plant cell (1Elliott A. Shaw S.L. Update: Plant cortical microtubule arrays.Plant Physiol. 2018; 176: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). cMTs are closely associated with the cell membrane, where they serve as tracks for cellulose synthases (CESAs) (5Paredez A.R.

Specialized cells such as trichomes, guard cells, and pavement cells all have their signature patterns of MT organizations (1Elliott A. Shaw S.L. Update: Plant cortical microtubule arrays.Plant Physiol. 2018; 176: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In dividing cells, before entering mitosis, MTs are part of a ring-like structure called preprophase band (PPB) at the cell cortex, which forecasts the position of the future cell division plane (9Schaefer E. Belcram K. Uyttewaal M. Duroc Y. Goussot M. Legland D. Laruelle E. de Tauzia-Moreau M.L. Pastuglia M. Bouchez D. The preprophase band of microtubules controls the robustness of division orientation in plants.Science. 2017; 356: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In mitosis, like in other eukaryotic cells, MTs form the conserved spindle structure, ensuring the faithful separation of chromosomes (10Ambrose J.C. Cyr R. Mitotic spindle organization by the preprophase band.Mol. Plant. 2008; 1: 950-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During cytokinesis, MTs are the major component of the phragmoplast, a plant-specific structure that directs the assembly of the cell plate and the new cell wall between daughter cells (11Smertenko A.

Many MAP families were conserved across kingdoms of life, such as the MT severing enzyme katanin, the MT polymerase MAP215, the kinesin motors, the augmin complex, and the MT plus-end tracking protein EB1 (13Hamada T. Microtubule organization and microtubule-associated proteins in plant cells.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 312: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, an increasing number of plant-specific MAPs have been identified, highlighting a complex complement of MAPs in plants (1Elliott A. Shaw S.L.

For example, CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING1/POM-POM2 (CSI1/POM2), a novel plant MAP, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interacting partners of CESA, and CSI1 functions as bridges between the CESA complexes and cMTs during cellulose biosynthesis (6Gu Y.

Genetic lesions in plant MAP coding genes often perturb MT dynamics and organization, cause defects in anisotropic cell expansion, and eventually lead to abnormal cell and organ morphogenesis, such as impaired hypocotyl elongation and altered morphogenesis of leaf epidermal pavement cells and trichomes (13Hamada T. Microtubule organization and microtubule-associated proteins in plant cells.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 312: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In loss-of-function mutants of the Arabidopsis KATANIN1 (KTN1) gene, encoding the p60 catalytic subunit of the MT severing enzyme katanin, MTs are highly disorganized and unable to form ordered parallel arrays in elongating hypocotyl cells (15Bichet A.

Consequently, ktn1 mutants have shortened hypocotyls, reduced trichome branching number, and smaller pavement cells with less prominent indentations (15Bichet A. Desnos T. Turner S. Grandjean O.

Many plant MAPs are members of protein families, which suggests that conserved family members may share redundant functions. For example, Arabidopsis TON1 recruiting motif (TRM) family members TRM6, 7, and 8 collectively control the formation of PPB and the precision of cell division orientation (9Schaefer E. Belcram K.

The preprophase band of microtubules controls the robustness of division orientation in plants.Science. 2017; 356: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The plant-specific IQ67 domain (IQD) family proteins were defined by the presence of a conserved IQ67 domain of 67 amino acid residues (18Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.BMC Evol. Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The IQ67 domain harbors 1 to 3 tandem repeats of calmodulin-binding IQ motifs, each containing two conserved isoleucine (I) and glutamine (Q) amino acid residues (18Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.BMC Evol. Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among the 33 known IQD family members in Arabidopsis thaliana, only a few have been functionally characterized. Among them, AtIQD1 has been shown to localize to both the nucleus and cMTs and interacts with kinesin light chain-related protein-1 (KLCR1) (19Bürstenbinder K. Savchenko T. Muller J. Adamson A.W. Stamm G. Kwong R. Zipp B.J. Dinesh D.C. Abel S. Arabidopsis calmodulin-binding protein IQ67-domain 1 localizes to microtubules and interacts with kinesin light chain-related protein-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1871-1882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). AtIQD13 associates with both the plasma membrane and MTs to regulate the formation of secondary cell wall pits in xylem cells (20Sugiyama Y. Wakazaki M. Toyooka K. Fukuda H. Oda Y.

Mutations in AtIQD5 lead to altered pavement cell morphology and render plants hypersensitive to an MT-destabilizing drug oryzalin (21Liang H. Zhang Y. Martinez P. Rasmussen C.G. Xu T. Yang Z.

Our previous study found that ABNORMAL SHOOT 6 (ABS6)/AtIQD16 promotes cMT severing and ordering through a direct interaction with KTN1 (23Li Y. Deng M. Liu H. Li Y. Chen Y. Jia M. Xue H. Shao J. Zhao J. Qi Y. An L. Yu F. Liu X. ABNORMAL SHOOT 6 interacts with KATANIN 1 and SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 to promote cortical microtubule severing and ordering in Arabidopsis.J Integr. Plant Biol. 2021; 63: 646-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Despite an increasing body of evidence suggesting that at least a subset of IQD proteins function as MAPs in plants, the interacting mechanisms between IQD proteins and MTs remain unclear. In this study, we determined that the DUF4005 domain of ABS6/AtIQD16 is a novel MT-binding domain in plants. We showed that the DUF4005 domain, a peptide of 59 amino acids, binds directly to MTs in vitro. Fluorescent protein-labeled DUF4005 domain decorates all types of MT arrays in planta. We further demonstrated that a conserved region of 15 amino acid residues in DUF4005 is indispensable for MT binding. Moreover, the overexpression of the DUF4005 domain leads to a spectrum of developmental defects associated with the perturbation of MT homeostasis and abnormal cell morphogenesis. These findings provide new insight into our understanding of the molecular basis of MT binding in Arabidopsis IQD proteins. ABS6 is an Arabidopsis IQD family protein, which is also designated AtIQD16 (18Abel S. Savchenko T. Levy M. Genome-wide comparative analysis of the IQD gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.BMC Evol. Biol. 2005; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the full-length ABS6 amino acid sequences, conserved domain search identified two IQ motifs (amino acid residues 100–120 and 123–141, respectively), a coiled coil motif (residues 231–251), and a Domain of Unknown Function 4005 (DUF4005) (residues 329–387) (Fig. 1A). Previously, we have shown that a GFP fusion of the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1–200) of ABS6 does not associate with MTs in Arabidopsis protoplasts (23Li Y. Deng M. Liu H. Li Y. Chen Y. Jia M. Xue H. Shao J. Zhao J. Qi Y. An L. Yu F. Liu X. ABNORMAL SHOOT 6 interacts with KATANIN 1 and SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 to promote cortical microtubule severing and ordering in Arabidopsis.J Integr. Plant Biol. 2021; 63: 646-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated a direct MT-binding capability for the C-terminal region (residues 201–423) of ABS6, establishing ABS6/AtIQD16 as a bona fide MAP (23Li Y. Deng M. Liu H. Li Y. Chen Y. Jia M. Xue H. Shao J. Zhao J. Qi Y. An L. Yu F. Liu X. ABNORMAL SHOOT 6 interacts with KATANIN 1 and SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 to promote cortical microtubule severing and ordering in Arabidopsis.J Integr. Plant Biol. 2021; 63: 646-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To identify the potential MT-binding domain in ABS6, we generated a series of truncated forms of the C-terminal region of ABS6 fused at their C-termini with GFP (Fig. 1A). Among them, ABS6329–387 corresponds to the DUF4005 domain (Fig. 1A). Next we determined their cellular localizations by transiently expressing these GFP fusions in mesophyll protoplasts from an Arabidopsis MT marker line, mRFP-TUB6 (Fig. 1B) (24Ambrose C. Allard J.F. Cytrynbaum E.N. Wasteneys G.O. A CLASP-modulated cell edge barrier mechanism drives cell-wide cortical microtubule organization in Arabidopsis.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 430Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Among the different forms of ABS6, ABS6329–387-GFP, as well as the longer versions ABS6201–423-GFP and ABS6301–423-GFP showed GFP fluorescent signals that overlapped with RFP signals from mRFP-TUB6, whereas ABS6387–423-GFP showed diffused GFP signals in the cytosol (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the DUF4005 domain colocalizes with cMTs and may mediate the association between ABS6 and cMTs. To test whether the DUF4005 domain could bind directly to MTs, we performed the in vitro MT cosedimentation assay. N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant ABS6329–387(GST-ABS6329–387) or GST was incubated with taxol-stabilized MTs. When incubated with MTs, GST was mostly found in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation, while MTs were sedimented in the pellet fraction, indicating that GST is not associated with MTs (Fig. 2A). In contrast, GST-ABS6329–387 was present in the pellet after incubation and centrifugation, together with MTs (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the amount of GST-ABS6329–387 in the pellet increased as the input of GST-ABS6329–387 increased in the incubation (Fig. 2A). To determine the binding affinity of GST-ABS6329–387 for taxol-stabilized MTs, We performed additional MT cosedimentation assays with a fixed concentration of MTs and increasing concentrations of GST-ABS6329–387. The binding affinity of GST-ABS6329–387 for taxol-stabilized MTs was estimated based on the quantification of MT-bound GST-ABS6329–387 and free GST-ABS6329–387 in each cosedimentation assay. Data were fit to the bimolecular binding curve (Fig. 2B). A Kd of 0.996 ± 0.147 μM was estimated for the binding of GST-ABS6329–387 to MTs (Fig. 2B). These data confirmed that ABS6329–387 binds to MTs. Finally, we asked whether ABS6329–387 could interact with free tubulins. In pull-down assays, tubulin was incubated with GST- or GST-ABS6329–387-bound glutathione beads. After elution, both tubulin and GST-ABS6329–387 were detected in the pull-down fraction, whereas the interaction between tubulin and GST alone was not detected, indicating that ABS6329–387 is able to bind tubulin (Fig. 2C). Taken together, we establish the DUF4005 domain of ABS6/IQD16 as an MT-binding domain. We identified 21 proteins in Arabidopsis containing the DUF4005 domain in the Pfam database, all of which belong to the IQD family (Fig. 3A). These DUF4005-containing IQD proteins shared conserved domain arrangements, including one or two IQ motifs in the N-terminal region and one DUF4005 domain in the C-terminal region (Fig. 3A). Next, we sought to identify key amino acids that are essential for MT binding in DUF4005. Multiple alignments of DUF4005 sequences of Arabidopsis IQD proteins revealed that a region encompassing proline 344 to arginine 358 in ABS6 is highly conserved (Fig. 3B). To test whether this conserved motif is required for MT binding, we generated three mutated versions of ABS6329–387, designated Δ(P-R), Δ(P-S), and Δ(K-R). In Δ(P-R), the entire conserved region from P344 to R358 was deleted (Fig. 4A). Shorter deletions, from P344 to S352 and from K354 to R358 were generated as Δ(P-S) and Δ(K-R), respectively (Fig. 4A). In cosedimentation assays, GST-Δ(P-S) could still bind to MTs, whereas binding of GST-Δ(P-S) and GST-Δ(K-R) to MTs was hardly detectable (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the residues from K354 to R358 were indispensable for MT binding in vitro. Next, we investigated whether the mutated versions of DUF4005 could associate with MTs in plant cells by expressing Δ(P-R)-GFP, Δ(P-S)-GFP, and Δ(K-R)-GFP fusion proteins in mRFP-TUB6 protoplasts, respectively. Consistent with their inability to bind MTs in vitro, Δ(P-R)-GFP and Δ(K-R)-GFP yielded diffused GFP signals in cytosol that were not associated with mRFP-labeled MTs (Fig. 4C). However, despite the apparent MT binding of Δ(P-S) in cosedimentation assays, overall the MT signals for Δ(P-S)-GFP were weak and the majority of Δ(P-S)-GFP signals were diffused in the cytosol, suggesting that residues from P344 to S352 are required for efficient MT binding in vivo (Fig. 4C). Together, these results suggest that a conserved motif from P344 to R358 in the DUF4006 domain of ABS6 is necessary for MT binding.Figure 4A conserved region in DUF4005 is necessary for MT binding.

Surprisingly, we identified similar sequences between the conserved region in DUF4005 and the MT-binding domain in the C-terminal tail of human Kif18A. Residing within the last 100 amino acid residues of Kif18A, the C-terminal MT-binding domain of Kif18A has a high affinity for MTs and binds to MTs in an ATP-independent manner (25Stumpff J. Du Y.

Biol. 2011; 21: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We retrieved additional sequences of Kif18A homologs from various animal species, and the C-terminal tails are highly conserved among Kif18A homologs in vertebrates (Fig. 4D). Partial alignments between sequences of C-terminal tails of Kif18A homologs and the DUF4005 domain of ABS6 revealed that residues between P344 and R358 in ABS6 are highly similar in Kif18A homologs in vertebrates, including zebrafish (Danio rerio), African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis), chicken (Gallus gallus), and several mammals (Fig. 4D), suggesting it may represent a common MT-binding motif shared by different types of MAPs. One common mechanism of MAP-MT interaction is through the electrostatic interaction between the basic domain of MAPs and the acidic C-terminal tail (E-hook) of tubulin (27Lefevre J. Chernov K.G. Joshi V. Delga S. Toma F. Pastre D. Curmi P.A. Savarin P. The C terminus of tubulin, a versatile partner for cationic molecules: Binding of tau, polyamines, and calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3065-3078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The conserved region essential for MT-binding in ABS6329–387 is highly basic (Figs. 3 and 4). If the binding of ABS6329–387 to MTs is dependent on electrostatic interactions, we should be able to observe dissociation of ABS6329–387 from MTs at high salt concentrations. Indeed, in cosedimentation assays carried out at different NaCl concentrations, the MT-binding ability of GST-ABS6329–387 decreased as the concentration of NaCl increased (Fig. 5, A and B). At 100 mM NaCl, the level of MT-bound GST- ABS6329–387 was reduced to ∼45% of that at 0 mM NaCl while 250 mM or 500 mM NaCl almost completely prevented the binding of ABS6329–387 to MTs (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, we subjected MTs to limited proteolysis with subtilisin to remove the tubulin C-terminal tails (28Spittle C. Charrasse S. Larroque C. Cassimeris L. The interaction of TOGp with microtubules and tubulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20748-20753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that subtilisin-treated MTs migrated as two bands, verifying the partial removal of the tubulin C-terminal tail (Fig. 5C). The amount of GST-ABS6329–387 cosedimented with subtilisin-treated MTs was markedly reduced compared with that cosedimented with mock-treated MTs (Fig. 5, C and D). Together, these data suggest that ABS6329–387 likely binds MTs through electrostatic interactions with the C-terminal tail of tubulin. Since the DUF4005 domain of ABS6 is capable of direct MT binding, it is possible that ectopic expression of this domain may affect MT homeostasis and plant development. To this end, we transformed constitutive 35S promoter-driven ABS6329–387-GFP fusion gene into the WT background and generated stable transgenic lines (Fig. 6A). A range of developmental defects were observed in ABS6329–387-GFP overexpression (OE) lines, and these lines were placed into weak, moderate, and strong categories based on the severity of growth abnormalities (Fig. 6A). Weak ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines were mostly indistinguishable from WT when grown in soil (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, moderate ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines displayed pronounced left-handed helical growth, whereas strong ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines led to severely stunted growth (Fig. 6A). The severity of developmental defects in ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines correlated with the levels of ABS6329–387 transcripts, with higher ABS6329–387 expressions associated with stronger growth defects (Fig. 6, A and B). Next, we examined the impact of ectopic expression of ABS6329–387-GFP on cell morphogenesis and examined leaf epidermal pavement cells and trichomes. WT pavement cells showed the stereotypical “jigsaw” puzzle shape with interlocked lobes and indentations, and WT trichomes typically have three or four straight branches (Fig. 6, C and D). In agreement with the overall weak growth phenotype, pavement cells and trichomes in weak ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines were similar in shapes to those in the WT (Fig. 6, C and D). In moderate ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines, pavement cells were smaller and had fewer number of lobes, compared with those in WT (Fig. 6C). Trichomes maintained their overall shapes in moderate ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines, but they appeared curly, in contrast to the straight branches in WT trichomes (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, in strong ABS6329–387-GFP OE lines, both pavement cells and trichomes were drasti"

In Thailand, studies on health outcomes and quality of life of Thai transgender youths have not included assessments from nationally-representative samples. The objective of this study is to assess the extent that behavioral health outcomes and exposure to violence varied by gender among respondents of the National School Survey on Alcohol Consumption, Substance Use and Other Health-Risk Behaviors.We used data from a nationally-representative self-administered survey of secondary school students in years 7, 9 and 11 and classified participants as cisgender boys, cisgender girls, transgender boys, and transgender girls. Participants also answered questions on depressive experience, suicidality, sexual behaviors, alcohol and tobacco use, drug use, and past-year experience of violence. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and modified multivariate Poisson regression with adjustment for sampling weights to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) with 95% confidence intervals.A total of 31,898 respondents (82.8% of those who returned complete and valid questionnaires) answered questions on sex and gender identity and were included in the analyses (n = 31,898 respondents), approximately 2.5% of whom identified as transgender. Transgender boys had a higher prevalence suicidal ideation than cisgender boys (APR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.89, 4.67) and cisgender girls (APR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.55, 3.40). Transgender girls were less likely than cisgender boys and girls to be ever drinkers, while transgender boys were more likely than cisgender boys and girls to be ever drinkers. Transgender girls had higher past-year exposure to sexual violence than cisgender boys (APR = 2.74; 95% CI = 1.52, 4.95) and cisgender girls (APR = 4.93; 95% CI = 2.52, 9.67).We found disparities in behavioral health and experience of violence between transgender and cisgender adolescents in Thailand. The findings highlighted the need for program managers and policy makers to consider expanding local efforts to address health gaps in the LGBTQ community to also include school-going youth population."

RAB11A is a small GTPase that mediates the anterograde transport of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. Loss of RAB11A-dependent trafficking in mature intestinal epithelial cells results in increased epithelial proliferation and nuclear accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key Hippo-signaling transducer that senses cell–cell contacts and regulates tissue growth. However, it is unclear how RAB11A regulates YAP intracellular localizations. In this report, we examined the relationship of RAB11A to epithelial junctional complexes, YAP, and the associated consequences on colonic epithelial tissue repair. We found that RAB11A controls the biochemical associations of YAP with multiple components of adherens and tight junctions, including α-catenin, β-catenin, and Merlin, a tumor suppressor. In the absence of RAB11A and Merlin, we observed enhanced YAP–β-catenin complex formation and nuclear translocation. Upon chemical injury to the intestine, mice deficient in RAB11A were found to have reduced epithelial integrity, decreased YAP localization to adherens and tight junctions, and increased nuclear YAP accumulation in the colon epithelium.

Notably, phosphorylation at S127 promotes binding of YAP to 14-3-3, leading to cytoplasmic sequestration. In the absence of S127 phosphorylation, YAP translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a coactivator for various transcription factors, particularly the TEA domain family of transcription factors (16Piccolo S.

YAP can also be sequestered in the cytoplasm as part of the β-catenin destruction complex and is released upon Wnt signaling leading to both Wnt and YAP-dependent transcriptional responses (2Kim N.-G.

Using genetic knockdown (KD) and knockout models in mouse and human colonic epithelial cells, this report examined the consequences of Rab11a activity on coordinated YAP trafficking between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and the impact of this positioning on epithelial repair. Interestingly, YAP demonstrates dependencies on Merlin and RAB11A for sequestration and perijunctional localization of YAP. These observations on the spatial assembly and positioning of YAP-associated scaffolds lend insight into trafficking mechanisms regulating YAP signaling and subsequent control of cell proliferation and tissue repair. Previously, we reported that in IECs, RAB11A expression effected both the expression levels of YAP and its nuclear localization (39Agostino L. Nie Y. Goswami S. Tong K. Yu S. Bandyopadhyay S. Flores J. Zhang X. Balasubramanian I. Joseph I. Sakamori R. Farrell V. Li Q. Yang C.S. Gao B. et al.Recycling endosomes in mature epithelia restrain tumorigenic signaling.Cancer Res. 2019; 79: 4099-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of both control and RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for YAP and RAB11A, imaged by laser scanning confocal microscopy. YAP was observed on numerous fluorescent puncta with an observed localization to the periphery of intercellular junctional region (Fig. 1A). RAB11A staining identified a similar cytoplasmic localization of small fluorescent cytoplasmic puncta. Pearson's correlation analysis identified that YAP and RAB11A were colocalized in some subpopulation of these puncta (Fig. 1A, correlation quantified in Fig. S1A). RAB11A-KD resulted in reduction of cytoplasmic and peripheral YAP while the fluorescent staining for YAP was dramatically increased in nuclei (Fig. 1A, nuclear YAP quantified in Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation assays of cell lysates from control and RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cell lines using anti-RAB11A antibodies resulted in coprecipitation of YAP with endogenous RAB11A (Fig. 1C). More specifically, RAB11A coprecipitated with YAP that was phosphorylated on S127 (Fig. S1C), a key cytoplasmic retention signal. The phosphorylated YAP (S127) was diminished upon depletion of RAB11A, consistent with our previous report (39Agostino L. Nie Y. Goswami S. Tong K. Yu S. Bandyopadhyay S. Flores J. Zhang X.

The observed colocalization of RAB11A and YAP opened the possibility that RAB11A may contribute to Hippo–YAP signaling and its reliance on cell–cell contacts for tension sensing (2Kim N.-G. Koh E.

A reasonable supposition given the adherens junction protein α-catenin was shown to bind YAP and regulates YAP phosphorylation status and cytoplasmic retention (29Schlegelmilch K. Mohseni M. Kirak O. Pruszak J. Rodriguez J.R. Zhou D. Kreger B.T. Vasioukhin V. Avruch J. Brummelkamp T.R. Camargo F.D. Yap1 acts downstream of alpha-catenin to control epidermal proliferation.Cell. 2011; 144: 782-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In control Caco-2 cell monolayers, α-catenin possessed distinct and sharp cell–cell junction staining with a lesser degree of diffuse cytoplasmic perijunctional staining (Fig. 1D, correlation with RAB11A quantified in Fig. S1B). RAB11A-KD in Caco-2 cells resulted in a diffused labeling of cell–cell contacts for α-catenin, which was now observed as scattered fluorescence staining throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, D and F). Similar results were obtained in preparations of immunostained Rab11a-deficient enteroids and mouse intestinal epithelia (Fig. S1D). In control Caco-2 cells, Pearson's correlation analysis comparing localization of YAP and α-catenin identified a significant correlation (r = 0.69) in control cells compared with a diminished correlation (r = 0.3) in RAB11A-KD cells (Fig. 1, D and E). By indirect immunofluorescence, RAB11A and α-catenin were colocalized to cell junctions in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1F) as well as in mouse enteroids (Fig. S1E). Protein levels of α-catenin in RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells were slightly elevated, when compared with control cells, and RAB11A was coimmunoprecipitated by α-catenin antibody pulldowns (Fig. 1G). We further analyzed YAP localization in a rescued RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cell line, where a mouse Rab11a that was resistant to the human RAB11A-targeting shRNA was expressed (Fig. 1H). Re-expression of mouse Rab11a redistributed the nuclear YAP to intercellular junctions (Fig. 1, I and J). In addition, the high index of proliferation marked by Ki67 in RAB11A-KD cells, as we previously reported (39Agostino L. Nie Y. Goswami S. Tong K. Yu S. Bandyopadhyay S. Flores J. Zhang X. Balasubramanian I. Joseph I. Sakamori R. Farrell V. Li Q. Yang C.S. Gao B. et al.Recycling endosomes in mature epithelia restrain tumorigenic signaling.Cancer Res. 2019; 79: 4099-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was also significantly reduced in the rescued cell line (Fig. 1, K and L). Thus, RAB11A has a pronounced impact on the localization of YAP and the adherens junction component, α-catenin. To dissect the underlying mechanism of YAP localization, control and RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells were subjected to cellular fractionation, density gradient centrifugation, and immunoblotting to assess intracellular compartmentalization of YAP and adherens junction components. In control cells, YAP and RAB11A cosedimented in low-density fractions (nos. 1–5; Fig. 2A). These fractions were also enriched for α-catenin and β-catenin (Fig. 2A) as well as GRP78 (endoplasmic reticulum), Gm130 (Golgi), and Rab7 (lysosome) (Fig. S2A). The actin membrane cytoskeleton scaffolding protein, Merlin, was also detected in these fractions (Fig. 2A). YAP, Merlin, α-catenin, and RAB11A were repeatedly observed in the top half of the sucrose gradients and diminished in the nucleus bottom fraction enriched for the nuclear marker, histone H3. A small amount of β-catenin was observed in the densest fractions correlating with nuclear compartment. In RAB11A-KD cells, the sedimentation profiles of YAP changed, and it was now observed in three distinct regions of the gradient. The top lowest density quarter of the gradient contained YAP, and the same fractions contained a trace amount of residual RAB11A (Fig. 2A). YAP was also detected in the densest nuclear-containing fractions as identified by histone H3 (Fig. 2A), an observation consistent with the nuclear YAP immunofluorescent localization (Figs. 1, A, B, and D and 2B). There was also a similar sedimentation towards denser gradients for both β-catenin and Merlin (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence imaging identified YAP–β-catenin perijunctional colocalization in control Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In RAB11A-KD cells, a loss of such perijunctional colocalization corresponded to a detectable increase of YAP–β-catenin nuclear localization (Fig. 2, B and C). The changes in colocalization of YAP with adherens junction proteins were further demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using anti-YAP antibodies. Merlin, α-catenin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin were all immunoprecipitated with YAP in control and RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2D, quantified in Fig. 2E). Interestingly, upon RAB11A-KD, YAP association with Merlin or α-catenin showed significant reduction (Fig. 2, D and E); YAP association with β-catenin significantly increased (Fig. 2, D and E), whereas YAP association with E-cadherin remained unchanged (Fig. 2, D and E and Fig. S2B). These changed interactions were not because of elevated total YAP, as precipitated YAP abundance was equivalent in control and RAB11A-KD samples (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2B). RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells had 22% increase in TEA domain report activities (39Agostino L. Nie Y. Goswami S. Tong K. Yu S. Bandyopadhyay S. Flores J. Zhang X. Balasubramanian I. Joseph I. Sakamori R. Farrell V. Li Q. Yang C.S. Gao B. et al.Recycling endosomes in mature epithelia restrain tumorigenic signaling.Cancer Res. 2019; 79: 4099-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Increased YAP–β-catenin association and nuclear localization correlated with a modified physiological response that was detected by an eightfold higher basal activity of TOP-Flash Wnt reporter in RAB11A-KD cells under serum-starved condition, that is, the absence of Wnt ligand (Fig. 2F) (43Zeng G. Apte U. Cieply B. Singh S. Monga S.P.S. siRNA-mediated beta-catenin knockdown in human hepatoma cells results in decreased growth and survival.Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). While Wnt3a ligand treatment of control Caco-2 cells elicited an increase in TOP-Flash activity, there was no detectable effect of Wnt treatment on RAB11A-KD cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that RAB11A modulates the adherens junctions, which in turn dictate YAP cytoplasmic retention or nuclear localization. The observation of a RAB11A-dependent association between YAP and Merlin may provide mechanistic insight into membrane trafficking and its role in junctional scaffolding and Hippo–YAP signaling (44Gladden A.B. Hebert A.M. Schneeberger E.E. McClatchey A.I. The NF2 tumor suppressor, Merlin, regulates epidermal development through the establishment of a junctional polarity complex.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We next examined the impact of RAB11A on Merlin association with adherens junction components and the resultant impact on Hippo–YAP effector proteins. In control cells, Merlin was perijunctionally localized with α-catenin (Fig. 3, A and B) and YAP (Fig. 3, C and D); this was in agreement with the localization of α-catenin–YAP (Fig. 1, D and E). In RAB11A-KD cells, Merlin was dramatically dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). Fluorescence colocalization between Merlin and α-catenin or YAP or β-catenin was significant in control Caco-2 cells compared with their colocalization in RAB11A-KD Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Disrupted Merlin localization was also observed in Rab11a-deficient mouse enteroids (Fig. S3A). In control Caco-2 cells, anti-Merlin antibodies precipitated Merlin along with YAP, β-catenin, α-catenin, and E-cadherin (Fig. 3H, quantified in Fig. 3G and Fig. S3B for E-cadherin), consistent with the immunofluorescence by anti-YAP (Fig. 2, D and E). In RAB11A-KD cells, the amounts of YAP, β-catenin, and α-catenin coprecipitated were significantly reduced than that for controls (Fig. 3G). We noted that the trend of relative amounts of individual proteins precipitated was consistent with the results obtained using anti-YAP antibodies (please compare with Fig. 2D). To determine the requirement of active RAB11A in forming the RAB11A–Merlin complex, cells were transfected with a dominant-neg"
https://openalex.org/W3165249152,"One becomes accustomed to repeated exposures, even for a novel event. In the present study, we investigated how predictability affects habituation to novelty by applying a mathematical model of arousal that we previously developed, and through the use of psychophysiological experiments to test the model's prediction. We formalized habituation to novelty as a decrement in Kullback-Leibler divergence from Bayesian prior to posterior (i.e., information gain) representing arousal evoked from a novel event through Bayesian update. The model predicted an interaction effect between initial uncertainty and initial prediction error (i.e., predictability) on habituation to novelty: the greater the initial uncertainty, the faster the decrease in information gain (i.e., the sooner habituation occurs). This prediction was supported by experimental results using subjective reports of surprise and event-related potential (P300) evoked by visual-auditory incongruity. Our findings suggest that in highly uncertain situations, repeated exposure to stimuli can enhance habituation to novel stimuli."

However, it is unknown if HCM-associated mutations within S2 dysregulate actomyosin dynamics by disrupting its interaction with C0-C2, ultimately leading to HCM. Herein, we study three S2 mutations known to cause HCM: R870H, E924K, and E930Δ. First, experiments using recombinant proteins, solid-phase binding, and isothermal titrating calorimetry assays independently revealed that mutant S2 proteins displayed significantly reduced binding with C0-C2. In addition, CD revealed greater instability of the coiled-coil structure in mutant S2 proteins compared with S2Wt proteins. Second, mutant S2 exhibited 5-fold greater affinity for PKA-treated C0-C2 proteins. Third, skinned papillary muscle fibers treated with mutant S2 proteins showed no change in the rate of force redevelopment as a measure of actin–myosin cross-bridge kinetics, whereas S2Wt showed increased the rate of force redevelopment. In summary, S2 and C0-C2 interaction mediated by phosphorylation is altered by mutations in S2, which augment the speed and force of contraction observed in HCM.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a global genetic heart disease affecting 1 in 500 people, including approximately 600,000 people in the United States and 14.25 million people worldwide. Importantly, cardiomyopathies, including HCM, are the most commonly identified causes of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes (1McKenna W. Deanfield J. Faruqui A. England D. Oakley C.

Clearly, the interaction between S2 and C0-C2 is critical to thin and thick filament arrangements in the sarcomere and, hence, heart function (5Gruen M. Gautel M.

Despite this importance, the exact molecular interactions and structure–function relationship between S2 and M domain remain unknown. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no studies in the literature have reported the effect(s) of S2 mutations on their interaction with the C0-C2 region of cMyBP-C in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The recently published myosin mesa hypothesis suggests that the binding of C0-C2 to S2 allows myosin heads to adopt a structurally ordered state that limits their ability to interact with actin, known as the super-relaxed (SRX) state (33McNamara J.W.

Trans. 2015; 43: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another factor understood to regulate the SRX state is the interaction between myosin S1 heads and proximal myosin S2 (35Woodhead J.L. Craig R.

Accordingly, the hypercontractile nature of HCM can be explained if myosin heads have transitioned into the DRX state, which would increase the total number of myosin heads available for contraction, leading to increased force of contractions (33McNamara J.W.

Through this mechanism, the interaction of S2 with C0-C2 and myosin S1 plays a major role in determining the speed and force of contraction. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that this SRX state is regulated by cMyBP-C phosphorylation through its binding to myosin S2 (33McNamara J.W. Singh R.R. Sadayappan S.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that mutations in S2 affect its binding with C0-C2 and, hence, contractility. The present study tests this hypothesis by defining the in vitro binding of S2 and C0-C2 of cMyBP-C in the context of S2 mutations and C0-C2 phosphorylation, respectively (25Sadayappan S. Osinska H.

Although these mutations significantly reduced the interaction of S2 and C0-C2 domain of cMyBP-C, we found that they unexpectedly increased their affinity for the C0-C2 domain of cMyBP-C upon PKA phosphorylation, compared with WT S2 controls. Overall, our studies demonstrate that myosin S2 and C0-C2 interactions, which are mediated by phosphorylation, play a major role in regulating contractility, consistent with the mutation roles as causative for HCM. To define whether HCM-associated mutations within the proximal 126 residues (838–963) of human cardiac myosin S2 (hS2) affect its interaction with human C0-C2 (hC0-C2) region of cMyBP-C (Fig. S1), we used three different HCM-causing mutations, R870H (human recombinant proximal S2 protein with R870H mutation [hS2R870H]), E924K (human recombinant proximal S2 protein with E924K mutation [hS2E924K]), and E930Δ (human recombinant proximal S2 protein with E930Δ mutation [hS2E930Δ]) (46Richard P.

The amino acid sequence of the S2 region of human β-MyHC and mouse α-MyHC is highly conserved (Fig. S2). The interaction partner mouse recombinant C0-C2 protein (mC0-C2) domains of cMyBP-C with phospho-ablation (AAA) and phospho-mimetic mutations were used in the study to define their affinities to hS2 (Fig. 1, C and D).

Based on these studies, we hypothesized that mutations in the S2 region affect the S2–C0-C2 interaction differentially either in presence or absence of C0-C2 phosphorylation. Therefore, the following independent experiments were performed in the presence and absence of C0-C2 phosphorylation to determine if these post-translational modifications affect S2 binding in the presence and absence of the indicated mutations. In vitro phosphorylation of hC0-C2 (hC0-C2p) was achieved by treating the hC0-C2 proteins with PKA, and the C0-C2 phosphorylation level was confirmed by Western blot analysis using phospho-site-specific antibodies (Fig. S4). Solid-phase binding assay (SPBA) experiments were first performed to define whether the S2 mutations affect their maximal binding capacity (Bmax), which indicates the level of available binding sites (molar ratios). The rate of equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is a measure of binding affinity. In the present study, binding properties (Bmax and Kd) of the mutant S2 proteins with hC0-C2 protein in the presence and absence of phosphorylation were determined, compared with hS2Wt proteins. For this experiment, we first generated antibody against hS2 peptide (838-PLLKSAEREKEMASMKEE-855 codons) and validated its specificity by Western blot (Fig. S6), as well as upper and lower detection limits of anti-S2 antibody and anti-C0 domain-specific cMyBP-C antibody (21Sadayappan S.

Concentration-dependent binding of hS2Wt and mutant S2 proteins at 20 μM was established using various concentrations of hC0-C2 (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 μM) (Fig. S8). From this initial experiment, we determined that Bmax of each mutant hS2 (hS2R870H, hS2E924K, and hS2E930Δ) with dephosphorylated hC0-C2 was significantly reduced compared with the values obtained using hS2Wt (Fig. 2, A–C and Table 1). Compared with hS2Wt (Bmax = 1.22 ± 0.06), the Bmax of mutant hS2 protein was significantly decreased by approximately 24% across"

Nevertheless the specific contribution of HED to risky sexual behavior among FSWs in Ethiopia is not well documented for prevention activities.The purpose of this study was to explore the determinants and consequences of HED among FSWs in Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling was conducted among 4886 FSWs in 11 major towns in Ethiopia in 2014. A structured interview was performed, and data were examined using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses.Most (66%) FSWs consumed alcohol, and the prevalence of HED was 29.1%. Compared to street-based FSWs, those who worked in bars/hotels and local drinking houses had 2.19 and 1.29 times higher odds of HED, respectively. FSWs who started selling sex when younger than 18 years (compared to those who started when older than 25 years) and those who were forced into selling sex had 1.48 and 2.91 times higher odds of HED, respectively. FSWs with more income from selling sex and FSWs who chewed khat reported increased odds of HED. Moreover, FSWs with experience of HED reported 1.27 and 1.44 times higher odds of physical beating and condom breakage/slippage, respectively. Furthermore, the population attributable risk fraction of HED among FSWs showed that 6.2% of physical beating and 8.9% of condom breakage/slippage could be attributed to HED.In general, several factors increase the experience of HED, and HED in turn increases the likelihood of violence and condom breakage. These factors could inform programs and intervention activities among FSWs populations."

The folding of the RTX domain is initiated at a C-terminal scaffold structure and proceeds vectorially from the C-terminal toward the N-terminal end of the protein (25Bumba L. Masin J. Macek P.

CyaA selectively binds the CD11b subunit of the complement receptor 3 (CR3) of phagocytes, also known as the αMβ2 integrin CD11b/CD18, or Mac-1 (26Guermonprez P. Khelef N. Blouin E. Rieu P.

In particular, the capacity of the RTX domain to undergo the calcium-dependent folding appeared to be critical for the capacity of CyaA to engage the CR3 receptor of phagocytes, penetrate the cellular membrane, and deliver the cytotoxic AC domain into target cell membrane (25Bumba L. Masin J. Macek P. Wald T. Motlova L. Bibova I. Klimova N. Bednarova L. Veverka V. Kachala M. Svergun D.I. Barinka C. Sebo P.

Moreover, acylation of the conserved lysine 983 residue and the structural integrity of the RTX domain of CyaA were found to be crucial also for the capacity of CyaA to trigger production of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice (31Hasan S.

To delimit the structures involved in CR3 binding and protective immunogenicity of the RTX domain, we constructed and characterized a set of RTX fragments that functionally folded in the presence of Ca2+ ions and competed with CyaA for CR3 binding. We also show that short and soluble RTX fragments can be used as superior vaccine antigens for induction of CyaA-neutralizing antibodies. The presented results define the CR3-interacting segment of the RTX domain and demonstrate that a 267 residue-large portion of the RTX domain β-rolls is dispensable for CR3 binding and CyaA toxin activities. Previous studies yielded an indirect evidence that the CR3-binding structure of CyaA comprises the folded interface of the RTX β-rolls II and III between residues 1132 and 1355 of CyaA (27El-Azami-El-Idrissi M.

We thus produced the CyaA1132-1355 segment as a stand-alone recombinant protein to test its capacity to induce CyaA-neutralizing antibodies, when used as antigen (Fig. 1). However, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CyaA1132-1355 polypeptide was unable to undergo the calcium-induced folding and did not form the typical RTX β-roll structures even at >1 mM Ca2+ ion concentrations (data not shown). Therefore, we aimed to generate a hybrid RTX block III/V that would fold properly into β-roll due to the presence of the C-terminal folding initiating scaffold structure of block V (25Bumba L. Masin J. Macek P. Wald T. Motlova L. Bibova I. Klimova N. Bednarova L. Veverka V. Kachala M. Svergun D.I. Barinka C. Sebo P.

Cell. 2016; 62: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could support the folding of the interface linking the RTX β-rolls II and III in CyaA1132-1355. In the absence of structural data, it was not possible to reliably predict the resulting orientation of the fused segments of β-rolls III and V, as two consecutive nonapeptide repeats form one turn of the β-roll. Therefore, we engineered two constructs that differed by one nonapeptide repeat at the end of the RTX block III. The two CyaA segments comprising residues 1132–1294 or 1132–1303, respectively, were fused to the C-terminal segment of the block V comprised within residues 1562–1681 of CyaA, yielding the RTX-1 and RTX-2 proteins (Figs. 1 and 2A). Far-UV CD spectra of the RTX-1 and RTX-2 proteins revealed that both polypeptides undergo a Ca2+-dependent structural transition from natively disordered conformations into compact β-roll protein structures characterized by prominent negative peaks at 218 nm in the spectra (Fig. 2B). However, different Ca2+ concentrations were needed for completion of β-roll formation in the two proteins. Folding of RTX-1 was initiated already at ∼0.3 mM Ca2+ and was complete at ∼1 mM Ca2+. In contrast, completion of RTX-2 folding occurred only at ∼10 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 2C). This indicated that perturbed structural consecutiveness of the nonapeptide repeats affected the threading and cooperative folding of the consecutive RTX repeats in the RTX-2 construct. In contrast, the characteristic Ca2+ loading-driven cooperativeness of vectorial folding was well preserved in the RTX-1 construct. To corroborate this observation, we determined the low-resolution structures of the Ca2+-loaded RTX-1 and RTX-2 proteins in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The overall structural parameters were calculated from experimental scattering curves (Fig. 2D), and the values are displayed in Table 1. The distance distribution functions (pr), derived from scattering intensities (Iq), revealed that the RTX-1 and RTX-2 proteins formed compact objects with asymmetric shapes. The maximum size of the particle derived from the pair-distance distribution function (Dmax) was 7.8 nm for RTX-1 and d 8.0 nm for RTX-2, respectively. The molecular masses of the proteins estimated from the Porod volumes were proportional to those calculated from amino acid sequences and corresponded to monomeric protein species. The low-resolution SAXS models of RTX-1 and RTX-2 revealed elongated protein structures, differing slightly in their shapes (Fig. 2E).Table 1Overall parameters of SAXS dataSasbdb accession codeRTX-1RTX-2SASDL62SASDL72Data collection parameters InstrumentP12 (PETRA III) Beam geometry (mm2)0.2 × 0.12 Wavelength (Å)1.24 q range (nm−1)0.03–4.49 Concentration range (mg ml−1)1.0–8.00.625–5.0 Temperature (K)283Structural parameters I0 [from Pr]48673775 Rg (nm) [from Pr]2.332.27 I0 [from Guinier]49513814 Rg (nm) [from Guinier]2.462.34 Dmax (nm)7.88.0 Porod volume estimate (nm3)4136Molecular mass determination Partial specific volume (cm3 g−1)0.7240.724 Contrast (Δρ × 1010 cm−2)3.0473.047 Molecular mass (kDa) [from I0]2927 Molecular mass (kDa) [from Porod volume]4136 Calculated molecular mass from the sequence3334Modeling parameters SymmetryP1P1 Number of models averaged2020 χ21.371.20Software employed Primary data reductionPRIMUS (40Konarev P.V.

To avoid the Ca2+-chelating aluminum hydroxide adjuvant and preserve the Ca2+-dependent fold, the proteins were emulsified in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant and 30 μg of the antigens was intraperitoneally injected into mice twice in 2 weeks interval. Mouse immune sera were collected 3 weeks after the second immunization and as shown in Figure 2F, by difference to nonimmune control serum, the sera raised against the RTX-1 and RTX-2 proteins blocked CyaA binding to the CR3-expressing human THP-1 monocytic cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-RTX-1 serum was more potent in blocking CyaA binding than the anti-RTX-2 serum. This translated into a higher capacity of the 1:50 diluted anti-RTX-1 serum to inhibit the penetration of CyaA into THP-1 cells and elevate cytosolic cAMP concentration (Fig. 2G). To assess its vaccine antigen potential, the nonfolded RTX-1 protein was next used for immunization of mice following adsorption to the aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant approved for use in pediatric vaccines. As shown in Figure 1, Figure 3, 1:50 diluted sera from mice immunized with alum-adjuvanted RTX-1 (-Ca2+) were less potent in inhibition of CyaA binding to THP-1 cells than the 1:50 diluted sera raised against the Ca2+-loaded RTX-1 in Freund’s adjuvant (Ca2+). This difference could be due to the different adjuvant potencies and immune response shaping effects elicited by the two different adjuvants. Alternatively, this result could also indicata a limited propensity of the RTX-1 protein to fold into a stable and immunogenic β-roll structure upon release from alum into the body fluids containing the physiological 2 mM Ca2+ concentrations. To enhance the folding capacity and structural stability of the RTX-1 antigen, we extended its termini by addition of portions of the CyaA polypeptide. Three additional constructs of increasing length were generated by (i) extending the N-terminal portion of RTX-1 up to CyaA residue 1008 through addition of residues of RTX block I (RTX1008); (ii) up to residue 908 by further adding a fragment of the acylated domain of CyaA (RTX908); or (iii) by extending the protein up to residue 770 by addition of the entire acylated domain of CyaA (RTX770). All constructs were also extended on the C-terminal end up to the last residue of CyaA through addition of the secretion signal segment (c.f. Fig. 1). All the proteins were produced in E. coli cells in the presence of the CyaC acyltransferase that catalyzes the posttranslational fatty-acylation of ε-amino groups of the Lys860 and Lys983 residues (5Basar T.

The acylation status of the proteins was then characterized by mass spectrometry, which revealed that both Lys860 and Lys983 residues of RTX770 and the Lys983 of the RTX908 were predominantly modified by a mixture of palmitoyl (C16:0) and palmitoleyl (C16:1) chains, with a small proportion of myristoyl (C14:0) and octadecenoyl (C18:1) groups (data not shown). Hence, the overall acylation status of the acylated proteins resembled that of intact recombinant CyaA (6Osickova A. Khaliq H. Masin J. Jurnecka D. Sukova A. Fiser R. Holubova J. Stanek O. Sebo P.

Chem. 2020; 295: 9268-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectra revealed that all three proteins underwent the characteristic Ca2+-induced structural transition from an unfolded into a compact protein structure (Fig. 4A). However, compared with the spectra of the RTX908 and RTX1008 proteins, the Ca2+-free RTX770 protein exhibited a less intense negative band at 200 nm and a more pronounced negative shoulder at 222 nm. This indicated partial folding of the N-terminal non-RTX portion of the RTX770 construct that can be predicted to adopt an α-helical structure and would thus fold independently of Ca2+ ions. Moreover, the apparent affinity of the RTX770 protein for Ca2+ ions appeared to be higher than that of the RTX908 and RTX1008 proteins, suggesting that folding of the N-terminal segment of RTX770 stabilized the fold of the C-terminal β-roll structure (Fig. 4B). The overall stability of the individual Ca2+-loaded construct folds was examined by thermal unfolding experiments using nanodifferential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF). The midpoints of the thermal melting curves (Tm) of RTX-1 and RTX1008 differed by 8 °C, with unfolding of RTX-1 occurring with a Tm of 60 °C compared with the higher Tm of 68 °C determined for RTX1008 (Fig. 4C). The longer and partially acylated RTX908 protein exhibited a similar Tm value of about 69 °C, while the even longer RTX770 construct unfolded at an increased temperature with a Tm value of 72 °C.

In the current study, we evaluate this biomarker in open-angle glaucoma (OAG), as there is increasing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the pathophysiology of this disease.Plasma GDF-15 concentrations were measured with ELISA in 200 OAG patients and 61 age-matched controls (cataract without glaucoma). The OAG patient group consisted of high tension glaucoma (HTG; n = 162) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG; n = 38). Groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test with Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc correction. GDF-15 concentration was corrected for confounders identified with forward linear regression models.Before correcting for confounders, median plasma GDF-15 levels was significantly lower in the combined OAG group (p = 0.04), but not when analysing HTG and NTG patients separately. Forward linear regression analysis showed that age, gender, smoking and systemic hypertension were significant confounders affecting GDF-15 levels. After correction for these confounders, GDF-15 levels in OAG patients were no longer significantly different from controls. Subgroup analysis of the glaucoma patients did not show a correlation between disease severity and plasma GDF-15, but did reveal that for NTG patients, intake of dietary supplements, which potentially improve mitochondrial function, correlated with lower plasma GDF-15.The present study suggests that plasma GDF-15 is not suited as biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction in OAG patients."

The stifle joint angle, patellar ligament length, patellar length, size of the femoral condyle, trochlear length, and trochlear angle were measured and included in multiple linear regression analyses to ascertain their effects on the proximodistal patellar position. Radiographs were divided into MPL and control groups. The effects of MPL on the proximodistal patellar position and morphological factors were also examined.The final model for the proximodistal patellar position revealed that the patella became distal as the ratio of the patellar ligament length to patellar length decreased, the trochlear angle relative to the femur increased, the trochlear length relative to the patellar length increased, or the trochlear length relative to the femoral condyle width decreased. The proximodistal patellar position in the MPL group was not significantly different from that in the control group despite the trend towards a distally positioned patella (p = 0.073). The MPL group showed a significantly shorter trochlea (p<0.001) and greater trochlear angle relative to the femur (p = 0.029) than the control group.The proximodistal patellar position depends on multiple factors, and its determination based on PLL/PL alone may not be appropriate. Dogs with MPL did not have a proximally positioned patella compared with dogs without MPL. Although hindlimbs with MPL had a shorter trochlea than those without patellar luxation, this difference did not appear to be sufficient to displace the patellar position proximally in small dogs, possibly compensated by increased trochlear angle relative to the femur."
https://openalex.org/W3164200972,"RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) is a key protein in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. Loss of RAD51AP1 leads to defective HR, genome instability, and telomere erosion. RAD51AP1 physically interacts with the RAD51 recombinase and promotes RAD51-mediated capture of donor DNA, synaptic complex assembly, and displacement-loop formation when tested with nucleosome-free DNA substrates. In cells, however, DNA is packaged into chromatin, posing an additional barrier to the complexities of the HR reaction. In this study, we show that RAD51AP1 binds to nucleosome core particles (NCPs), the minimum basic unit of chromatin in which approximately two superhelical turns of 147 bp double-stranded DNA are wrapped around one histone octamer with no free DNA ends remaining. We identified a C-terminal region in RAD51AP1, including its previously mapped DNA-binding domain, as critical for mediating the association between RAD51AP1 and both the NCP and the histone octamer. Using in vitro surrogate assays of HR activity, we show that RAD51AP1 is capable of promoting duplex DNA capture and initiating joint-molecule formation with the NCP and chromatinized template DNA, respectively. Together, our results suggest that RAD51AP1 directly assists in the RAD51-mediated search for donor DNA in chromatin. We present a model, in which RAD51AP1 anchors the DNA template through affinity for its nucleosomes to the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament."
https://openalex.org/W3164471051,"The prevalence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise globally. Currently, autoimmunity presents in over 100 different forms and affects around 9% of the world’s population. Current treatments available for autoimmune diseases are inadequate, expensive, and tend to focus on symptom management rather than cure. Clinical trials have shown that live helminthic therapy can decrease chronic inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal autoimmune inflammatory conditions. As an alternative and better controlled approach to live infection, we have identified and characterized two peptides, Acan1 and Nak1, from the excretory/secretory component of parasitic hookworms for their therapeutic activity on experimental colitis. We synthesized Acan1 and Nak1 peptides from the Ancylostoma caninum and Necator americanus hookworms and assessed their structures and protective properties in human cell–based assays and in a mouse model of acute colitis. Acan1 and Nak1 displayed anticolitic properties via significantly reducing weight loss and colon atrophy, edema, ulceration, and necrosis in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid–exposed mice. These hookworm peptides prevented mucosal loss of goblet cells and preserved intestinal architecture. Acan1 upregulated genes responsible for the repair and restitution of ulcerated epithelium, whereas Nak1 downregulated genes responsible for epithelial cell migration and apoptotic cell signaling within the colon. These peptides were nontoxic and displayed key immunomodulatory functions in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by suppressing CD4+ T cell proliferation and inhibiting IL-2 and TNF production. We conclude that Acan1 and Nak1 warrant further development as therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmunity, particularly gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.

There are more than 100 autoimmune conditions described with an additional 40 diseases suspected (1Luo X. Miller S.D. Shea L.D. Immune tolerance for autoimmune disease and cell transplantation.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2016; 18: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, autoimmune incidence is rising annually in both developing and industrialized countries, currently affecting 3% to 12% of individuals, depending on the country (2Bach J.-F. The hygiene hypothesis in autoimmunity: The role of pathogens and commensals.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Treatment is costing more than $100 billion dollars annually just in the United States (NIAID, 2020). The vast majority of autoimmune conditions are incurable, and new treatments are urgently needed. Helminth therapy has been shown to be a promising treatment option for many autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical trials for diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease have found that treatment with a low-dose inoculation of helminths has overall successfully improved patient Disease Activity Index (3Summers R.W.

However, helminthic therapy is controversial and the idea of live infection will be difficult to standardize and accept for a significant subset of patients. Therefore, the utilization of the immunomodulatory proteins and peptides secreted by helminths have become a more attractive target for drug development (5Navarro S. Pickering D.A. Ferreira I.B.

Helminths produce and secrete immunomodulatory proteins, glycoproteins, and small-molecular-weight (MW) compounds from their oral openings or outer surfaces to avoid detection and expulsion from the host (8Mulvenna J.

Although many studies focused on higher-MW proteins (>5 kDa), there are limited examples in the literature about lower-MW products (1–5 kDa). Anti-inflammatory protein-2 is an ∼19-kDa protein shown to generate a proregulatory imprint on mesenteric lymphoid tissues that results in long-term protection against allergic asthma (5Navarro S. Pickering D.A. Ferreira I.B. Jones L. Ryan S. Troy S. Leech A. Hotez P.J. Zhan B. Laha T. Prentice R. Sparwasser T. Croese J. Engwerda C.R. Upham J.W. et al.Hookworm recombinant protein promotes regulatory T cell responses that suppress experimental asthma.Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8362ra143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The protein has promising translational properties as anti-inflammatory protein-2 can modulate costimulatory molecules on human dendritic cells (DCs) obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro and suppress allergen-specific T cell proliferation. AcK1 and BmK1 are two low-MW peptides (∼4 kDa each) found in the excretory/secretory component of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum and the human filarial nematode Brugia malayi, respectively (10Chhabra S. Chang S.C. Nguyen H.M. Huq R. Tanner M.R. Londono L.M. Estrada R. Dhawan V. Chauhan S. Upadhyay S.K. Gindin M. Hotez P.J. Valenzuela J.G. Mohanty B. Swarbrick J.D. et al.Kv1.3 channel-blocking immunomodulatory peptides from parasitic worms: Implications for autoimmune diseases.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 3952-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both peptides were found to suppress mouse T cell proliferation in vitro and suppress mitogen stimulation in T cells (10Chhabra S. Chang S.C. Nguyen H.M. Huq R. Tanner M.R. Londono L.M. Estrada R. Dhawan V. Chauhan S. Upadhyay S.K. Gindin M. Hotez P.J. Valenzuela J.G. Mohanty B. Swarbrick J.D. et al.Kv1.3 channel-blocking immunomodulatory peptides from parasitic worms: Implications for autoimmune diseases.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 3952-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ack1 and BmK1 contain a ShKT domain, which characteristically adopts a fold comprising two almost perpendicular stretches of helices that are interconnected by three disulfide bonds, stabilizing the structure (11Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Menez A. On the convergent evolution of animal toxins. Conservation of a diad of functional residues in potassium channel-blocking toxins with unrelated structures.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4302-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The ShKT domain was originally identified in a toxin isolated from the Stichodactyla helianthus sea anemone (12Castañeda O. Sotolongo V. Amor A.M. Stöcklin R. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L. Engström Å. Wernstedt C. Karlsson E. Characterization of a potassium channel toxin from the Caribbean sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus.Toxicon. 1995; 33: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The ShK toxin blocks voltage-gated potassium channels that are crucial for the activation of terminally differentiated effector memory T cells (13Norton R.S. Pennington M.W. Wulff H. Potassium channel blockade by the sea anemone toxin ShK for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 3041-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Many potassium channel–blocking peptides contain a critical conserved “functional dyad” consisting of a lysine and a neighboring aromatic or aliphatic residue (14Mouhat S. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Contribution of the functional dyad of animal toxins acting on voltage-gated Kv1-type channels.J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ShK possesses the functional dyad, made up of a lysine and a tyrosine residue, which are proposed to contribute to activity (15Pennington M.W. Mahnir V.M. Krafte D.S. Zaydenberg I. Byrnes M.E. Khaytin I. Crowley K. Kem W.R. Identification of three separate binding sites on SHK toxin, a potent inhibitor of voltage-dependent potassium channels in human T-lymphocytes and rat brain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A derivative of the ShK toxin, dalazatide, has recently undergone a randomized phase 1b trial for the treatment of the autoimmune disease plaque psoriasis (16Tarcha E.J. Olsen C.M. Probst P. Peckham D. Muñoz-Elías E.J. Kruger J.G. Iadonato S.P. Safety and pharmacodynamics of dalazatide, a Kv1.3 channel inhibitor, in the treatment of plaque psoriasis: A randomized phase 1b trial.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0180762Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The study reported that dalazatide was well tolerated and improved skin lesions by modulating T cell surface and activation marker expression, as well as inhibiting mediators of inflammation within the blood (NCT02435342). Transcriptomic characterization of the human hookworm, Necator americanus, has shown that the ShKT domain family of proteins are one of the most abundantly expressed protein families in adult hookworms (17Cantacessi C. Mitreva M. Jex A.R. Young N.D. Campbell B.E. Hall R.S. Doyle M.A. Ralph S.A. Rabelo E.M. Ranganathan S. Sternberg P.W. Loukas A. Gasser R.B. Massively parallel sequencing and analysis of the Necator americanus transcriptome.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2010; 4e684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that one or more hookworm-secreted peptides may have immunomodulatory activity similar to other known immunomodulatory proteins of the ShKT domain family. Here we describe two low-MW peptides identified from the N. americanus and A. caninum hookworms that possess ShKT domains. Acan1 was identified from EST databases through custom blast algorithms using specific cysteine configurations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to map Nak1, previously identified in another study (10Chhabra S. Chang S.C. Nguyen H.M. Huq R. Tanner M.R. Londono L.M. Estrada R. Dhawan V. Chauhan S. Upadhyay S.K. Gindin M. Hotez P.J. Valenzuela J.G. Mohanty B. Swarbrick J.D. et al.Kv1.3 channel-blocking immunomodulatory peptides from parasitic worms: Implications for autoimmune diseases.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 3952-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both peptides form the characteristic three intramolecular disulfide bonds and contain multiple helical segments within their three-dimensional structure similar to those in the ShKT family. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of Acan1 and Nak1 was determined in vivo using a colitis model and in in vitro models using primary human immune cells. Peptide stability was additionally determined using human serum and simulated human intestinal and gastrointestinal fluid. Collectively, these data show promise for the two new immune-modulating proteins. Using a custom algorithm, seven peptides comprising sequences with a plurality of suitably spaced cysteine residues were identified in the transcriptomes of A. caninum and N. americanus. These peptides contain the cysteine configuration of the ShK toxin (Fig. 1). To determine sequence identity, optimal alignment of amino acid and/or nucleotide sequences was conducted by computerized implementations of algorithms, i.e., BLAST. The Nak1 and Nak2 peptides were previously identified by Chhabra, et al. (10Chhabra S. Chang S.C. Nguyen H.M. Huq R. Tanner M.R. Londono L.M. Estrada R. Dhawan V. Chauhan S. Upadhyay S.K. Gindin M. Hotez P.J. Valenzuela J.G. Mohanty B. Swarbrick J.D. et al.Kv1.3 channel-blocking immunomodulatory peptides from parasitic worms: Implications for autoimmune diseases.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 3952-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Each peptide is shown to possess the conserved cysteines (highlighted in red), and the putative disulfide bond connections are shown by the black lines. Only Acan1 was found to possess the functional dyad (highlighted in green and purple) that is responsible for the ShK toxin activity. The linear hookworm peptides were synthesized on rink amide resin using solid phase peptides synthesis (SPPS). The sequences of Name1 and Name2 could not be synthesized in full using SPPS, and therefore, a native chemical ligation approach was used to successfully produce the Name2 peptide. This was achieved by ligating the N- and C-terminal segments together at the third cysteine residue of the sequence. Name1 was unable to be synthesized. The disulfide bonds of each peptide were formed by random oxidative folding in aqueous buffer, which was optimized through multiple different buffer conditions. All peptides were most amenable to folding in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature with the aid of both reduced (2 mM) and oxidized (0.5 mM) glutathione (pH 8.2). During random oxidation of Name3 and Name4, the N-terminal glutamine was found to cyclize to form pyroglutamic acid. Both Name3 and Name4, with and without pyroglutamic acid, were used for further experimentation, as they were unable to be separated via reversed phase (RP)-HPLC. Peptide fractions with >95% purity were used for experimentation (Fig. S1). Acan1 and Nak1 were chosen of the seven peptide homologs for further immunomodulation experimentation, as they were shown to be the most suppressive in an initial cytometric bead array (CBA) screen of proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. S2). Folding of the synthetic peptides was initially examined using one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. These spectra confirmed that each peptide has a well-defined structure based on the quality of the data in terms of signal dispersion and peak linewidth. Further analyses were performed to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the hookworm peptides Acan1 and Nak1, in order to compare them with ShK (18Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Solution structure of ShK toxin, a novel potassium channel inhibitor from a sea anemone.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra allowed for sequential manual assignment (Fig. S3). The 3D structures for Acan1 and Nak1 were calculated using simulated annealing and structural restraints (Table S1) derived from the NMR data, and both peptides were shown to resemble that of ShK (Fig. 2A). The structure calculations with no disulfide bonds were performed, revealing well-defined structural ensembles (Fig. S4). Structures were then calculated for all 15 possible disulfide bond isomers for both peptides, with the native disulfide connectivity generating the lowest target function average (Table S2). Although the helminth peptides adopt a predominantly helical structure with a short 310 helix separating the two α-helices, the locations and lengths of the helices differ slightly between each peptide (Fig. 2B). In ShK, two short α-helices encompass residues 14 to 19 and 21 to 25 and a 310 helix is located between residues 9 and 11. The α-helices in Acan1 are located between residues 11 and 17, and 23 and 32 with the 310 helix between 19 and 21, whereas in Nak1, α-helices are located between residues 7 and 15, and 25 and 31 and a 310 helix is located between 18 and 20. Despite the similarities in 3D structures, only Acan1 was found to possess the functional dyad that is crucial for the activity of ShK on the Kv1.3 channels (Fig. 2C). The side chains of Lys22 (blue) and Tyr23 (cyan) in ShK are located on a short helical region orientating outward. Compared with ShK, the side chains of the residues in the dyad in Acan1 are shown to possess a different orientation, appearing to angle away from each other. To determine whether Acan1 and Nak1 are able to inhibit human Kv1.3 channel, a two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to examine their effects on channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Fig. 3). ShK was used as a control and found to inhibit Kv1.3 with an IC50 of 57 pM (data not shown), replicating the low picomolar values described in the previous literature (19Pennington M.W. Chang S.C. Chauhan S. Huq R. Tajhya R.B. Chhabra S. Norton R.S. Beeton C. Development of highly selective Kv1.3-blocking peptides based on the sea anemone peptide ShK.Mar. Drugs. 2015; 13: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Acan1 inhibited the channel with an IC50 value of 829 nM, a concentration 15,000 times higher than the positive control, ShK. Nak1 was found to have little efficacy on blocking the channel, likely due to the lack of functional dyad within the sequence. The stability of each peptide was determined via LC/MS quantification during 24-h incubations in 100% human serum, and porcine simulated gastrointestinal and intestinal fluid (Fig. 4). Both Acan1 (purple) and Nak1 (green) were found to be stable in 100% human serum over the time course, whereas ShK (red) began to degrade after the 4 h time point (Fig. 4A). In simulated gastrointestinal fluid, all peptides were shown to be stable (Fig. 4B). In simulated intestinal fluid, ShK (red) was completely degraded after 6 h with a half-life of 0.8 h. By contrast, Acan1 (purple) and Nak1 (green) did not fully degrade until 24 h and had a half-life of 2.4 and 4.4 h, respectively (Fig. 4C). The linear control peptide R3 B1-22R I15A (20Haugaard-Kedstrom L.M. Lee H.S. Jones M.V. Song A. Rathod V. Hossain M.A. Bathgate R.A.D. Rosengren K.J. Binding conformation and determinants of a single-chain peptide antagonist at the relaxin-3 receptor RXFP3.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 15765-15776Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (blue) was found to be fully degraded within the first hour of each experiment. The lower stability of ShK demonstrates that the disulfide bonds alone are not sufficient to confer high stability. It is likely that the stability of the hookworm peptides in hostile protease-rich environments may have resulted from evolutionary adaptations by helminths that can live in the small intestine for decades. Owing to their origin and similar structural scaffold of helminth peptides Acan1 and Nak1 to the ShK toxin, it was hypothesized that both peptides would have modulatory effects on human T cells. To investigate this hypothesis, the potential toxicity of Acan1 and Nak1 to human PBMC was first assessed by quantifying cell surface phosphatidylserine following peptide treatment. To do this, apoptotic cell populations were identified using flow cytometry following Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining (Fig. S5). Cells treated with either synthetic peptide (10 μg/ml) retained a similar percentage of live cell (unstained) populations as the untreated control, whereas the heat-treated cells (positive control) showed an increase in earlyFITC+ to lateFITC+Propidium+ apoptotic populations (Fig. 5A). Consequently, the anti-inflammatory potential of Acan1 and Nak1 was determined using a cytokine suppression assay. In preliminary intracellular staining assays using human PBMC, it was revealed that Nak1 did not inhibit LPS-induced productions of IL-6, IL-8, or MIP-1β in classical (CD14+) or intermediate (CD14+/CD16+) monocytes after 24-h treatment (Fig. S6). Additional preliminary data had shown that Acan1 did not significantly alter the viability/proliferation of metabolically active cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction following 4 days of LPS stimulation and peptide treatment (Fig. S7). It has been reported that ShK principally inhibits T cell function through ion channel modulation and calcium-dependent signaling (21Fung-Leung W.-P. Edwards W. Liu Y. Ngo K. Angsana J. Castro G. Wu N. Liu X. Swanson R.V. Wickenden A.D. T cell subset and stimulation strength-dependent modulation of T cell activation by Kv1.3 blockers.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0170102Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Accordingly, human PBMCs were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate and ionomycin (PI) to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels and induce T cell cytokine production. Activated cells were then treated with peptide for 24 h and IL-2 and TNF measured by CBA (Fig. 5B). Both Acan1 and Nak1 suppressed PI-induced IL-2 release in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Acan1 additionally decreased TNF secretion. Next, given the observed suppression of proinflammatory TNF by Acan1, the antiproliferative capacity of the peptide was assessed on MACS-purified CD3+ T cells. CellTrace Violet (CTV)-stained T cells were activated via TCR stimulation using anti-CD3/CD28 beads and treated with 10 μg/ml ciclosporin (positive control), 100 μg/ml Acan1, or 100 μg/ml unfolded Acan1 (negative control) for 4 days. Following incubation, T cell division was evaluated by flow cytometry and CTV fluorescence (Fig. S8). Folded but not unfolded Acan1 suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation in two different donors, albeit to a lesser extent than the calcineurin inhibitor, ciclosporin (Fig. 5C). Of interest, Acan1 showed no significant effect on CD8+ T cell division. Collectively, these data suggest a CD4+ helper T cell modulatory mechanism for Acan1 but requires further investigation. To determine the therapeutic potential of synthetic hookworm peptides in a model of acute inflammation, mice were treated once prophylactically with varying doses of Acan1 (20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 μg) or Nak1 (40, 20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 μg) and assessed over 4 days (Fig. 6A). Over the course of the study, the vehicle (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid [TNBS]) group experienced a 15% weight loss (Fig. 6B). Mice treated with 1 μg of Acan1 (0.05 mg/kg−1) via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route displayed significantly reduced weight loss at day 3 (p < 0.05), compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 6B), but no significant improvement in weight loss was observed in the Nak1-treated group. Colon pathology was assessed on day 4 (Fig. 6C) and was consistent with enhanced protection against TNBS-induced colitis. Acan1-treated mice had visibly longer and normal-looking colons when compared with the vehicle control group (p = 0.0079), which manifested shortened, thickened, and erythematous tissue. Nak1-treated mice were also found to have significantly longer colons compared with disease control (p = 0.0238) (Fig. 6D). The colons were scored macroscopically based on the following parameters: adhesion, edema, wall thickening, and ulceration (Fig. 6E). It was found that mice treated with Acan1 displayed a significant reduction (p = 0.008) in the overall macroscopic pathology score. Macroscopic histological observations (Fig. 6F) of naive mouse colon displayed normal colon tissue architecture. This included the anatomy of the lamina propria, gastric mucosa, goblet cells, and colonic musculature. Colons of vehicle-treated mice exhibited extensive histological damage and severe lesions, including thickening of the lamina propria and colon wall, evidence of edema and mucosal erosion with destruction of goblet cells. Mice treated with either Acan1 or Nak1 had healthy colons, possessing architecture comparable with the naive (healthy control) group, with normal crypts and goblet cells, good mucosal integrity, and no ulceration. Together, these results show that hookworm-derived peptides, particularly Acan1 and to a lesser extent Nak1, can suppress TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation in vivo. We next performed transcriptomics on the colons of each mouse cohort using a custom 57 gene NanoString panel that targeted genes critical in inflammation, immune regulation, gut barrier homeostasis, epithelial homeostasis, and tissue destruction. A multivariate analysis principal component analysis was performed to identify genes that contribute the most to the largest sources of variation within the dataset (Fig. 7). No significant differences between the contributions of the groups were identified along PC1 (x-axis) for both Acan1 (Fig. 7A) and Nak1 (Fig. 7B). However, a significant difference between the contribution of groups alongside PC2 was observed between Acan1 and naive (p = 0.00182), Acan1 and vehicle (p = 0.04369), and naive and Acan1 (linear) (p = 0.0363), as well as along PC2 between Nak1 (linear) and vehicle (p = 0.0382). Together the two principal components captured 42% of the variation in the datasets for Acan1 and 41% for Nak1. The genes with the largest contributions to PC1 and PC2 variation are shown by the arrows. These included Tnfrsf14, Foxo1, Ctla4, Tgfb1, and Mki67 (Fig. 7A) and Tnfaip3, Nfkb2, Tnfrsf14, Nfkb1, and Mmp9 (Fig. 7B). We next visualized differential gene expression (DE) between treatment and vehicle control using volcano plots. This was achieved by pairing the log2 fold change (FC) and relative p value for each gene within each comparison. As shown, when comparing the Acan1 cohort with the vehicle cohort a significant DE of 16 genes was identified, characterized largely by positive FC (Fig. 7C). Unlike Acan1, when comparing the Nak1 group with the vehicle control group, significant p values were identified in only three genes and all were characterized by negative FC (Fig. 7D). Our controls, the linear Acan1 (Fig. 7E) and Nak1 (Fig. 7F) versus the vehicle control, showed insignificant DE of genes and very low significant values from a small cluster of genes (Fig. 7E). These data are further validation that the folded version of both peptides is required for activity. The well-characterized TNBS-induced colitis mouse model is a widely used in vivo model that shares many clinical, histological, and biochemical features with human UC (22Shepherd C. Giacomin P.

In order to identify changes in the series, the breakpoint technique was performed; the rates were modelled and predictions of the incidence of TB until 2025 were made.AMPC showed a fall of 0.69% per month in TB and human immunodeficiency virus (TB-HIV) co-infection, a fall of 0.01% per month in general and lung TB and a fall of 0.33% per month in extrapulmonary TB. With the breakpoint technique, general and pulmonary TB changed in structure in late 2007, and extrapulmonary TB and TB-HIV co-infection changed in structure after 2014, which is considered the cut-off point. The IMA(3) models were adjusted for general and pulmonary TB and TB-HIV co-infection, and the AR(5) models for extrapulmonary TB, and predictions were performed.The rapid molecular test for TB is the method currently recommended by the WHO for the diagnosis of the disease and its main advantage is to provide faster, more accurate results and to already check for drug resistance. It is necessary that professionals encourage the use of this technology in order to optimize the diagnosis so that the treatment begins as quickly as possible and in an effective way. Only by uniting professionals from all areas with health policies aimed at early case identification and rapid treatment initiation it is possible to break the chain of TB transmission so that its rates decrease and the goals proposed by the WHO are achieved."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of an Aspergillus immunochromatographic technology (ICT) IgG/M lateral flow device (LFD) for the serological diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) among Ugandan adult asthmatics.374 adult (aged ≥18years) asthmatics in the African Severe Asthma Program study, Ugandan site constituted the study population. ABPA and SAFS were diagnosed according to standard criteria. Asthmatics who did not meet the above criteria constituted a control group. The LFD tests were performed and read according to manufacturer's instructions.ABPA was found in 12/374 (3.2%) and SAFS in 60/374 (16%) participants. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the Aspergillus ICT for the diagnosis of ABPA were 0.0%, 96.4%, 0.0% and 96.7% respectively, and for SAFS 6.7%, 97.1%, 30.8% and 84.5% respectively. False positive and negative rates were 3.5% and 3.2% for ABPA and 2.4% and 14.9% for SAFS, respectively. Patients with a positive LFD significantly had higher median Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE levels compared to those with negative LFD (median: 0.06 kUA/l VS 0.03 kUA/L, P = 0.011).The Aspergillus ICT IgG/M LFD had a poor diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of both ABPA and SAFS. Its greatest value may be in distinguishing chronic and allergic aspergillosis in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3165364724,"Peters Plus Syndrome (PTRPLS OMIM #261540) is a severe congenital disorder of glycosylation where patients have multiple structural anomalies, including Peters anomaly of the eye (anterior segment dysgenesis), disproportionate short stature, brachydactyly, dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, and variable additional abnormalities. PTRPLS patients and some Peters Plus-like (PTRPLS-like) patients (who only have a subset of PTRPLS phenotypes) have mutations in the gene encoding β1,3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). B3GLCT catalyzes the transfer of glucose to O-linked fucose on thrombospondin type-1 repeats. Most B3GLCT substrate proteins belong to the ADAMTS superfamily and play critical roles in extracellular matrix. We sought to determine whether the PTRPLS or PTRPLS-like mutations abrogated B3GLCT activity. B3GLCT has two putative active sites, one in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal glycosyltransferase domain. Using sequence analysis and in vitro activity assays, we demonstrated that the C-terminal domain catalyzes transfer of glucose to O-linked fucose. We also generated a homology model of B3GLCT and identified D421 as the catalytic base. PTRPLS and PTRPLS-like mutations were individually introduced into B3GLCT, and the mutated enzymes were evaluated using in vitro enzyme assays and cell-based functional assays. Our results demonstrated that PTRPLS mutations caused loss of B3GLCT enzymatic activity and/or significantly reduced protein stability. In contrast, B3GLCT with PTRPLS-like mutations retained enzymatic activity, although some showed a minor destabilizing effect. Overall, our data supports the hypothesis that loss of glucose from B3GLCT substrate proteins is responsible for the defects observed in PTRPLS patients, but not for those observed in PTRPLS-like patients.

Most mutations in PTRPLS cause splicing or frameshift defects that can disrupt the transcription and/or translation of B3GLCT and are predicted to be loss of function. However, there are also several missense and nonsense mutations in B3GLCT (Fig. 1A). The missense mutations result in amino acid (aa) changes: D349N, G393E, G394E (Fig. 1A). PTRPLS-like patients have Peters anomaly and a subset of the additional phenotypes found in PTRPLS patients (3Weh E. Reis L.M. Tyler R.C. Bick D. Rhead W.J. Wallace S. McGregor T.L. Dills S.K.

While most PTRPLS-like patients have no mutations in B3GLCT, suggesting that mutations in other genes are causative for the phenotypes observed, some PTRPLS-like patients have heterozygous missense mutations in B3GLCT: T179S, V245M, R337H, and Q457R (personal communication, Dr Elena V.

The premature termination from Y366∗ and R412∗ results in deletion of the REEL motif, raising the question of whether these two mutations cause mislocalization of the truncated B3GLCT.

The “DxD” motif marks the active site of GT-A fold glycosyltransferases and is responsible for the binding of nucleotide sugar donors and the chelation of divalent cation cofactors for catalysis (6Taujale R.

Nonetheless, the presence of two distinct domains in B3GLCT raises the question of whether PTRPLS is caused by loss of function of the N-terminal or C-terminal domains. B3GLCT catalyzes the transfer of glucose (Glc) to O-linked fucose (O-Fuc) on thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), forming a unique glucose-β1,3-fucose disaccharide (GlcFuc) (5Sato T. Sato M.

For instance, secretion of a portion of ADAMTS9 (TSRs2-8) is completely inhibited in POFUT2−/− HEK293T cells, but only reduced by 20% in B3GLCT−/− cells compared with wild type (WT) (26Holdener B.C. Percival C.J. Grady R.C. Cameron D.C. Berardinelli S.J. Zhang A. Neupane S. Takeuchi M. Jimenez-Vega J.C. Uddin S.M.Z. Komatsu D.E. Honkanen R. Dubail J. Apte S.S.

Thus, the embryonic lethality of Pofut2 knockout mice can be explained by loss of secretion of ADAMTS9. In contrast, ADAMTS20 TSR2-8, with almost identical TSR domain structures compared with ADAMTS9, is completely dependent on B3GLCT for secretion, implying that the white spotting and hydrocephalus observed in B3glct knockout mice are due at least in part to loss of ADAMTS20 secretion (26Holdener B.C. Percival C.J. Grady R.C. Cameron D.C. Berardinelli S.J. Zhang A. Neupane S. Takeuchi M. Jimenez-Vega J.C. Uddin S.M.Z. Komatsu D.E. Honkanen R. Dubail J. Apte S.S.

Taken together, these data raise the question of whether PTRPLS/PTRPLS-like mutations in B3GLCT will affect the secretion of a subset of POFUT2/B3GLCT substrate proteins by affecting the function and/or stability of B3GLCT. To address the questions raised above, we analyzed the domain structure of B3GLCT in more detail and demonstrated that the C-GT domain of B3GLCT is responsible for the transfer of Glc to O-Fuc on TSRs. We then introduced PTRPLS/PTRPLS-like mutations individually to human B3GLCT and performed kinetic analysis of the WT and mutant forms of the enzyme using in vitro enzyme assays. We also investigated the function of the mutant enzymes in vivo with cell-based assays by investigating the ability of the mutants to rescue the secretion of ADAMTS20 TSR2-8 from B3GLCT−/− cells. Our data suggested that PTRPLS mutations eliminated the function of B3GLCT, but PTRPLS-like mutants did not. We also generated a homology model of B3GLCT to predict the structural impact of these PTRPLS/PTRPLS-like mutations. Overall, our studies advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that result in PTRPLS. We began by analyzing the domain distribution of human B3GLCT as illustrated in Figure 1A, including signal peptide (aa 1–68), N-terminal GT-like (N-GT-like) domain (aa 69–240), cysteine-rich linker domain (aa 241–263), C-terminal GT domain (C-GT) (aa 264–468), and C-terminus with ER retention signal REEL (aa 469–498). Both the N- and C-terminal domains have residues analogous to those found in GT-A fold enzymes, including a DxD motif, 132EEE134 and 349DDD351, respectively. The DxD motifs were conserved in vertebrates, but the N-terminal DxD motif was not conserved in fruit flies (Figs. 1B and S1). Sequence analysis showed that the C-GT domain also has a highly conserved G-loop (393GGG395), xED motif (419PDD421), and C-terminal Histidine (C-His, H463), all common GT-A fold elements (6Taujale R. Venkat A. Huang L.C. Zhou Z. Yeung W. Rasheed K.M. Li S. Edison A.S. Moremen K.W. Kannan N. Deep evolutionary analysis reveals the design principles of fold A glycosyltransferases.Elife. 2020; 9e54532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1B and S1). The G-loop confers flexibility, and the xED-Asp functions as a catalytic base in inverting GT-A fold enzymes (6Taujale R. Venkat A. Huang L.C. Zhou Z. Yeung W. Rasheed K.M. Li S. Edison A.S. Moremen K.W. Kannan N. Deep evolutionary analysis reveals the design principles of fold A glycosyltransferases.Elife. 2020; 9e54532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The putative N-terminal glycosyltransferase domain has some of these features including a potential G-loop (187AAG189) (Figs. 1B and S1). Other conserved features are difficult to predict, including the catalytic base (possibly D212 or D216) and the C-terminal His (Figs. 1B and S1). To evaluate which domain is responsible for the glucosyltransferase activity, we first subcloned human B3GLCT with the REEL motif removed (B3GLCTΔREEL) to allow secretion to the medium for purification. We then mutated both DxD motifs (E132A and D349N) to abolish the 132EEE134 and 349DDD351 individually in B3GLCTΔREEL to further evaluate which of the two putative GT domains is responsible for catalytic activity. The D349N is also a PTRPLS mutation (3Weh E. Reis L.M. Tyler R.C. Bick D. Rhead W.J. Wallace S. McGregor T.L. Dills S.K. Chao M.C. Murray J.C. Semina E.V. Novel B3GALTL mutations in classic Peters plus syndrome and lack of mutations in a large cohort of patients with similar phenotypes.Clin. Genet. 2014; 86: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We first used in vitro enzyme assays to analyze whether the E132A and D349N mutants could transfer glucose to O-fucosylated TSR3 from human thrombospondin-1 (Fuc-O-TSR3). After a 20 min transfer reaction (within the linear phase of the assay, Fig. S2), the D349N mutant completely lost catalytic activity, but E132A catalyzed the reaction at a similar level to the WT B3GLCTΔREEL (Fig. 2A). Since the N-terminal GT domain is not involved in transfer of glucose, and identification of some GT-A elements needed for catalysis is not clear, we termed it as “N-GT-like” in our domain map of human B3GLCT (Fig. 1A). To further analyze the function of the domain mutants under physiological conditions, we tested the ability of the E132A and D349N mutants to rescue the secretion of ADAMTS20 TSR2-8 in B3GLCT−/− cells. For these assays we used full-length human B3GLCT with the REEL motif intact (B3GLCT-FL) to retain transfected B3GLCT within the ER. ADAMTS20 TSR2-8 was secreted into the media from WT HEK293T cells but lost its secretion in B3GLCT−/− cells (Fig. 2, B and C, media), as shown previously (26Holdener B.C. Percival C.J. Grady R.C.

The E132A mutant rescued the secretion of ADAMTS20 TSR2-8 similar to WT B3GLCT-FL (Fig. 2B, media), whereas D349N completely lost the ability to rescue (Fig. 2C, media). Both the E132A and D349N mutants were detected in cell lysate at comparable levels to transfected WT B3GLCT. Serial dilution of cotransfected enzyme plasmids allowed us to mimic the endogenous B3GLCT cellular level in WT HEK293T cells for better analysis (Fig. 2, B and C, cell lysate).

The transcription factor FOXO1 plays a dominant role in stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Understanding the transcriptional regulation of Foxo1 may be conducive to the development of insulin-independent strategies for the control of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Here, we found that elevated plasma levels of adenine nucleotide in type 2 diabetes are the major regulators of Foxo1 transcription. We treated lean mice with 5′-AMP and examined their transcriptional profiles using RNA-seq. KEGG analysis revealed that the 5′-AMP treatment led to shifted profiles that were similar to db/db mice. Many of the upregulated genes were in pathways associated with the pathology of type 2 diabetes including Foxo1 signaling. As observed in diabetic db/db mice, lean mice treated with 5′-AMP displayed enhanced Foxo1 transcription, involving an increase in cellular adenosine levels and a decrease in the S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio. This reduced methylation potential resulted in declining histone H3K9 methylation in the promoters of Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck. In mouse livers and cultured cells, 5′-AMP induced expression of more FOXO1 protein, which was found to be localized in the nucleus, where it could promote gluconeogenesis.

While insulin exerts its effects on gluconeogenesis in the liver by inactivating FOXO1 proteins (4Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H.

The mechanism of hepatic Foxo1 transcriptional regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus is unknown. The factors that stimulate hepatic Foxo1 transcription are generally considered to be less important than FOXO1 protein phosphorylation and are almost ignored in type 2 diabetes. Our previous observations demonstrate that the elevation of plasma adenine nucleotides is an upstream regulator in type 2 diabetic db/db mice (18Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zhao Y. Zhao M. Wang S. Hua Z.

An increasing amount of evidence highlights a critical role for the adenine nucleotides in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus (20Antonioli L. Blandizzi C. Csoka B. Pacher P. Hasko G. Adenosine signalling in diabetes mellitus--pathophysiology and therapeutic considerations.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2015; 11: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that adenine nucleotides stimulate hepatic Foxo1 transcription via suppressing histones methylation in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, indicating that adenine nucleotides-driven hepatic Foxo1 transcription is crucial for excessive glucose production in type 2 diabetic mice. To explore the unbiased biological association of the role of adenine nucleotides in diabetes, we used RNA sequencing to measure all poly A-containing transcripts in the livers of control and model mice. The significantly enriched pathways were identified by using the KEGG database. Mapping of annotated DEGs to KEGG pathways resulted in 249 DEGs of 42 pathways and 656 DEGs of 44 pathways in the livers of 5′-AMP-treated (Fig. 1A, upper) and db/db mice (lower), respectively (Supporting information S1–S4). Among these, a total of 42 KEGG pathways were disrupted simultaneously in both mouse models, indicating a high degree of similarity in gene transcription changes between the AMP group and the DB group. The 175 genes that are significantly changed in the AMP group overlapped with the same genes in the DB group (Fig. 1B, left). A heat map of the 175 genes with significant regulatory functions was constructed (Fig. 1B, right). Pearson r analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between biological repeats in each group. Next, we used ingenuity pathway analysis to identify the top 20 classic pathways implicated by gene expression changes, revealing many metabolic pathways, including glucagon signaling, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance, which showed consistent changes in the AMP and the DB group (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the Foxo signaling pathway was found to be one of the largest spots and was shown in the KEGG enrichment diagram of the AMP group (Fig. 1D), and the gluconeogenesis-related genes in the Foxo signaling pathway were activated (Fig. 1E). Similarly, the Foxo signaling pathway in the DB group has changed (Supporting Information S5). Although KEGG pathway analysis showed some changes between the AMP group and the DB group, there was no significant difference in the pathways related to type 2 diabetes (Fig. S1). Therefore, we speculate that 5′-AMP is likely to regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis through Foxo signaling. To verify the reliability of RNA-Sequencing data, eight responsive genes of 175 genes changed both in the AMP and the DB group were analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 2A, the mRNA levels of Mfsd2a, Slc25a25, Etnppl, Actg1, Klf3, Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck were elevated in both groups. 5′-AMP significantly increased the transcription of gluconeogenesis-related genes including Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck, which were closely related to Foxo signaling and insulin resistance. Then, we investigated the function of 5′-AMP in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo. 5′-AMP increased the glucose area under the curve during the pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) (Fig. 2B). PTT experiments confirmed that gluconeogenesis also increased in the db/db mice (Fig. 2B). Using different gluconeogenic substrates, we also found that 5′-AMP significantly increased glucose appearance with intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of glycerol (Fig. 2C), lactate (Fig. 2D), fructose (Fig. 2E), and glutamine (Fig. 2F), respectively. The same results were obtained with db/db mice (Fig. 2, C–F). PTT experiments confirmed that 5′-AMP accelerated the consumption of gluconeogenic substrate pyruvate (Fig. 2G). Moreover, inhibition of FOXO1 function by selective FOXO1 inhibitor AS1842856 (21Wu L.F. Li G.P. Feng J.L. Pu Z.J. Molecular mechanisms of adenosine-induced apoptosis in human HepG2 cells.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) eliminated 5′-AMP-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis during PTT (Fig. 2H). Together, these results indicate that 5′-AMP stimulates Foxo1 transcription and promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis. To investigate the underlying mechanism of 5′-AMP-dependent hepatic gluconeogenesis, we first examined the effects of 5′-AMP on the expression levels of Foxo1 mRNA and protein. 5′-AMP caused a dose-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of Foxo1, Pepck, and G6Pc in mouse livers (Fig. S2). Western blotting analysis showed that the FOXO1 protein level was also increased in 5′-AMP-treated livers (Fig. 3A). Moreover, 5′-AMP decreased the phosphorylation level of FOXO1 (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity of FOXO1 was significantly increased after 5′-AMP, and the immunofluorescence of FOXO1 was mainly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that 5′-AMP enhances Foxo1 transcription as well as FOXO1 nuclear translocation. To clarify how 5′-AMP stimulates hepatic Foxo1 transcription, a transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (AD) was used to explore the underlying mechanism. The results revealed that the AD significantly blocked the transcription level of Foxo1 in the livers of 5′-AMP-treated mice and db/db mice, excluding the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation of Foxo1 mRNA by 5′-AMP (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that 5′-AMP increased Foxo1 mRNA level through a process involving de novo gene transcription. Because 5′-AMP can be dephosphorylated into adenosine by 5′-nucleotidase anchored on the cell membranes, the function of 5′-AMP may play a role via increasing intracellular adenosine levels or acting on specific cell surface receptors (21Wu L.F. Li G.P. Feng J.L. Pu Z.J. Molecular mechanisms of adenosine-induced apoptosis in human HepG2 cells.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Administration of adenosine also increased hepatic Foxo1 transcription (Fig. 4C) and promoted gluconeogenesis in mice (Fig. 4D). To determine whether the effects of adenosine were due to the engagement of adenosine receptors, mice were treated with the broad-spectrum adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline. Theophylline treatment did not lower Foxo1 mRNA levels seen in 5′-AMP mice (Fig. 4E). Next, we found that a methyl donor betaine reduced Foxo1 mRNA in the livers of 5′-AMP-treated mice (Fig. 4F) and db/db mice (Fig. 4G). Cycloleucine acts as a competitive inhibitor of methionine S-adenosyl transferase involved in regulating the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the cellular methylation potential (22Lombardini J.B. Coulter A.W. Talalay P. Analogues of methionine as substrates and inhibitors of the methionine adenosyltransferase reaction. Deductions concerning the conformation of methionine.Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 481-499PubMed Google Scholar). The methylation inhibitor cycloleucine significantly increased Foxo1 mRNA levels in WT livers (Fig. 4F). HPLC analysis showed that betaine, but not theophylline, increased the ratio of SAM/SAH in the livers of 5′-AMP mice (Fig. 4, H and I) and db/db mice (Fig. 4J). As expected, cycloleucine significantly reduced the ratio of SAM to SAH in mouse livers (Fig. 4I). These results demonstrate that 5′-AMP-stimulated Foxo1 transcription is closely related to cellular methylation potential. Then we examined whether 5′-AMP influences DNA methylation. As shown in Figure 4K, the DNA methylation levels of the Foxo1 promoter remained unchanged in the livers of 5′-AMP-treated mice. Similar results were observed in that of db/db mice (Fig. 4K). Histone methylations are known to control gene expression (23Moore L.D. Le T. Fan G. DNA methylation and its basic function.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2013; 38: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Increased histones methylation of some specific amino acid residues is generally associated with transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin formation, which ensures stable repression and genomic integrity (24Mozzetta C. Boyarchuk E. Pontis J. Ait-Si-Ali S. Sound of silence: The properties and functions of repressive Lys methyltransferases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Then we detected a significant reduction in total H3K9me2 methylation in the livers of 5′-AMP-treated mice (Fig. 5A). The observation of a reduction in methylation epitopes associated with transcriptional repression (H3K9) chromatin suggests that hypomethylation may occur at the genome-wide level. Then, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed to compare histone methylation levels in Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck promoter regions. Compared with the control group, 5′-AMP resulted in a significant decrease of H3K9me2 levels in the promoter regions of Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck (Fig. 5B). The results of the ChIP analysis were confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 5C). We also detected a significant reduction in H3K9 methylation in db/db livers by western blotting analysis (Fig. 5D). ChIP assay and qPCR analysis demonstrated that the H3K9me2 levels, as observed in 5′-AMP-treated mice, were markedly decreased in the promoter regions of Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck in db/db mice (Fig. 5, E and F). Together, our results suggest that the overall decrease of H3K9me2, specifically the reduction of Foxo1, G6Pc, and Pepck promoter locus, results in transcriptional stimulation of these genes in 5′-AMP-treated and db/db mice. To confirm the results we obtained from the mouse livers, we used HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of 5′-AMP on the regulation of Foxo1 in vitro. The results showed that 5′-AMP resulted in a significant increase of glucose production in HepG2 cells (Fig. S3). HPLC analysis revealed that 5′-AMP caused a significant decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio (Fig. 6A). Then, we investigated whether nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist (theophylline) and adenosine transporter inhibitor (dipyridamole) affect cell methylation potential and are related to Foxo1 transcription. As shown in Figure 6A, theophylline did not affect the 5′-AMP-decreased cellular methylation potential, and the adenosine transport inhibitor dipyridamole significantly inhibited the effect of 5′-AMP on methylation potential (Fig. 6A). To further explore the possible involvement of cellular methylation potential, we added SAM and the methylation inhibitor cycloleucine to observe the changes in the SAM/SAH ratio (Fig. 6B). The addition of SAM restored the 5′-AMP-decreased ratio of SAM/SAH. Twenty-four hours after the incubation of cycloleucine, the SAM/SAH ratio decreased significantly (Fig. 6B). The qRT-PCR analysis showed that 5′-AMP significantly increased Foxo1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells, and the addition of theophylline did not affect the regulation of Foxo1 transcription by 5′-AMP (Fig. 6C). Notably, dipyridamole significantly decreased 5′-AMP-stimulated Foxo1 transcription (Fig. 6C). In HepG2 cells, cycloleucine increased Foxo1 transcription like 5′-AMP (Fig. 6D), and SAM eliminated the effects of 5′-AMP on Foxo1 transcription regulation (Fig. 6D), further indicating that 5′-AMP regulates Foxo1 transcription by affecting the methylation potential of cells. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to show the subcellular location of FOXO1. While FOXO1 was mainly located in the cytoplasm in control cells, 5′-AMP significantly increased FOXO1accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 6E). The theophylline did not affect 5′-AMP-regulated FOXO1 nuclear accumulation, but dipyridamole inhibited the appearances of FOXO1 in the nucleus. Moreover, SAM increased the intracellular cytoplasmic FOXO1 protein level and reduced the nuclear FOXO1 accumulation. Contrarily, cycloleucine markedly increased the appearances of FOXO1 in the nucleus (Fig. 6E). Hepatic Foxo1 transcription is activated in the livers of patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetic mice (10Qu S. Altomonte J. Perdomo G. He J. Fan Y. Kamagate A. Meseck M. Dong H.H.

The role of FOXO1 in β-cell failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2013; 9: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that stimulates hepatic Foxo1 transcription in type 2 diabetes is unknown and almost ignored. In the present study, we showed that 5′-AMP increased FOXO1 accumulation in the nucleus both in vivo and in vitro, thus promoting gluconeogenesis. This characterization was initially based on the induction of Foxo1 at the transcription level, for the first time revealing that adenine nucleotides-driven Foxo1 transcription is essential for excess glucose production in type 2 diabetes. Free fatty acid (FFA) is an important link between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (26Hawkins M. Tonelli J. Kishore P. Stein D. Ragucci E. Gitig A. Reddy K.

Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, A2A adenosine receptors have been thought to play a role in modulating the function of FOXO1 (30Friedman B. Corciulo C. Castro C.M. Cronstein B.N.

In our observations, adenosine transport inhibitor, but not adenosine receptor antagonist, significantly reduced 5′-AMP-stimulated Foxo1 transcription. Adenosine also has its direct biochemical function, which is not directly related to the adenosine receptor pathway (18Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zhao Y. Zhao M. Wang S. Hua Z. Zhang J.

Under the pathological state of type 2 diabetes, the sustained high concentration of adenosine may passivate the regulatory effect of adenosine receptors. Our results suggest that 5′-AMP-stimulated Foxo1 transcription is related to the transports rather than cell surface receptors. Exogenous 5′-AMP results in a dose-dependent elevation in adenosine levels in the liver, thereby increasing SAH and decreasing SAM/SAH ratio (33Xia L. Ma S. Zhang Y. Wang T. Zhou M. Wang Z. Zhang J.

We aimed to verify this role of RAP for LRP1 and two other LDLR family receptors, LDLR and vLDLR, and to investigate the mechanisms of respective interactions using a cell culture model system, purified system, and in silico modelling. Upon coexpression of RAP with clusters of the ligand-binding complement repeats (CRs) of the receptors in secreted form in insect cells culture, the isolated proteins had increased yield, enhanced folding, and improved binding properties compared with proteins expressed without RAP, as determined by circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance. Within LRP1 CR-clusters II and IV, we identified multiple sites comprised of adjacent CR doublets, which provide alternative bivalent binding combinations with specific pairs of lysines on RAP. Mutational analysis of these lysines within each of isolated RAP D1/D2 and D3 domains having high affinity to LRP1 and of conserved tryptophans on selected CR-doublets of LRP1, as well as in silico docking of a model LRP1 CR-triplet with RAP, indicated a universal role for these residues in interaction of RAP and LRP1. Consequently, we propose a new model of RAP interaction with LDLR family receptors based on switching of the bivalent contacts between molecules over time in a dynamic mode.

Consequently, we propose a new model of RAP interaction with LDLR family receptors based on switching of the bivalent contacts between molecules over time in a dynamic mode. The receptors from the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family are expressed in many tissues where they recognize various dissimilar ligands involved in numerous biological processes. In humans, these receptors are represented by LDLR, LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (vLDLR), ApoER2, LRP2, LRP1B, and LRP4 (1Dieckmann M. Dietrich M.F. Herz J. Lipoprotein receptors--an evolutionarily ancient multifunctional receptor family.Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 1341-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In circulation, LDLR, LRP1, and vLDLR are responsible for endocytosis of various proteins and lipoproteins (2Gent J. Braakman I. Low-density lipoprotein receptor structure and folding.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and misfunction of these receptors may result in atherosclerotic disease and other abnormalities. In other tissues, LRP1, vLDLR, and ApoER2 are involved in cell signaling and tissue remodeling, and all are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (3Cooper J.M. Lathuiliere A. Migliorini M. Arai A.L.

Other pathological processes implicating the LDLR family receptors involve cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity, Parkinson's disease, and others (5Lane-Donovan C. Philips G.T. Herz J.

Med. 2012; 85: 19-28PubMed Google Scholar). Better knowledge of respective receptor–ligand interactions is important for understanding these processes and fundamental discoveries in the future. The LDLR family receptors are composed of the same domain types serving specific functional roles. The ligand-binding function is generally served by highly homologous complement-type repeats (CRs) organized in clusters (7Go G.W. Mani A. Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family orchestrates cholesterol homeostasis.Yale J. Biol. Med. 2012; 85: 19-28PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. The mammalian low-density lipoprotein receptor family.Ann. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Relatively simple in structure, LDLR, vLDLR, ApoER2, and LRP4 have one cluster formed by seven to eight CRs, whereas other receptors have four clusters of CRs formed by similar or larger numbers of repeats. In a prominent member of the family, LRP1, there are two major ligand-binding clusters termed II and IV, less significant clusters for ligand binding include cluster III and cluster I (Fig. S1), which is known to participate with cluster II in binding of only one ligand, activated forms of alpha-2-macroglobulin (9Actis Dato V.

LRP1 also binds triglyceride-rich particles, fibronectin, matrix proteases, and blood clotting factors with a total number of more than 40 of disparate ligands (9Actis Dato V. Chiabrando G.A. The role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis and inflammation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19: 1780Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each CR domain is formed from ∼40 amino acids and connected to an adjacent CR domain with a flexible linker that, in the case of LRP1, is composed of three to ten amino acids. Each CR domain's structure is enforced by three internal disulfide bonds formed from six conserved cysteines and by coordination of a Ca2+ ion with four conserved acidic residues (11Fass D.

During ligand binding, the conserved acidic residues and an aromatic residue interact with ε-amino group and aliphatic portion of a “critical” lysine of the ligand, respectively, and additional interface residues provide weaker binding energy. This mechanism was described for the interactions of vLDLR with a human rhinovirus (13Verdaguer N. Fita I. Reithmayer M. Moser R. Blaas D.

Such a mode of interaction was termed “bivalent” regarding the interaction of LRP1 and an isolated fragment of RAP composed of its D1 and D2 domains (D1/D2) bearing a high-affinity site for binding to LRP1. On D1/D2, the “critical” lysines K60 and K191 are located on D1 and D2, respectively; both these domains are connected with a flexible linker, and therefore both lysines have mutual flexibility (23Prasad J.M.

In contrast, the two “critical” lysines of the second high-affinity LRP1-binding site of RAP, K256, and K270 are located on the single domain (D3), which has a rigid structure with minimal mutual flexibility of the lysines. The role of these lysines was established by testing interactions of isolated D3 with LRP1 and its CR-doublet 5–6 (26Dolmer K. Campos A. Gettins P.G. Quantitative dissection of the binding contributions of ligand lysines of the receptor-associated protein (RAP) to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1).J. Biol.

Structure of an LDLR-RAP complex reveals a general mode for ligand recognition by lipoprotein receptors.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); therefore the interaction of D3 with both full-size LRP1 and LDLR also corresponds to the bivalent mode. Thus, each of the two sites of RAP can bivalently interact with LRP1; however, it is unclear how these binding events are mutually coordinated during the interaction of both molecules. In LRP1, the binding sites for RAP are located within clusters II, III, and IV. Each of the isolated clusters is able to interact with RAP with affinity comparable to that for the full-length receptor (KD 1–5 nM) (23Prasad J.M. Young P.A. Strickland D.K.

Within cluster IV, the active binding CR doublets have not yet been identified; however, previous studies indicated that the majority of its CRs are capable of binding LRP1 (30Sarafanov A.G.

Notably, the data show that the absence of the conserved aromatic residue in any domain of a CR doublet (Fig. S1) correlates with its inability to bind RAP as shown for CRs 1–2 (cluster I), 9–10 (cluster II), and 19–20 (cluster III). Thus, these studies show that numerous LRP1 sites are capable to facilitate bivalent binding combinations with RAP. However, like the sites on RAP, it is unclear how these sites in LRP1 are coordinated during its interaction with RAP. Until now, the chaperone function of RAP has been supported only for LRP1, LRP2, and vLDLR, but not LDLR. Indeed, (i) disruption of the RAP gene in mouse model resulted in impairing the expression of these receptors, except LDLR (21Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J.

Due to the ability of RAP to interact with all LDLR family receptors, it is used as a model ligand to study their interactions with other ligands based on similarity of the respective mechanisms. In particular, the bivalent binding mode has also been described for the interactions of LRP1 with blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) (35Young P.A. Migliorini M. Strickland D.K.

In our study, we aimed to characterize interactions of RAP with selected LDLR family receptors in several model systems on to obtain a deeper insight into these mechanisms. Our basic approach was to test RAP interactions with ligand-binding fragments of LRP1, LDLR, and vLDLR within living cells upon the coexpression of RAP with proteins (Fig. 1A). For this, we used an insect-cell-based platform, which is not capable of providing a relevant folding factor for the receptors as resulted in production of their fragments mostly in misfolded forms (28Kurasawa J.H.

To dissect the mechanism of RAP and LRP1 interaction to smaller molecular determinants (Fig. 1B), we tested binding of their fragments, including mutated variants, using a purified system and in silico modeling. The resulting data support the function of RAP as a folding chaperone for the tested receptors and a bivalent mechanism of the interactions, which occur in dynamic mode. First, we tested coexpression of RAP and LRP1 cluster II, based on the previously reported increase of LRP1 exodomain production upon coexpression with RAP in mammalian cell culture (19De Nardis C. Lossl P. van den Biggelaar M. Madoori P.K. Leloup N. Mertens K. Heck A.J. Gros P.

The goal was to verify the suitability of an insect-cell-based (baculovirus) system for testing RAP and LDLR family receptor fragments' interactions within living cells. In particular, insect cells are not capable of providing, at least in sufficient amount, a factor to facilitate the folding of the CR domains, which results in protein secretion mostly in misfolded multimeric forms due to mislinking of the conserved cysteines (28Kurasawa J.H.

We first showed the involvement of the mTOR pathway in glucose-related signaling. We also used the surface sensing of translation technique, based on puromycin incorporation into newly translated proteins, to demonstrate that glucose treatment increased protein translation.

In insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells, glucose uptake tightly regulates both protein expression levels and cellular function. However, chronic high glucose weakens pancreatic β-cell response, leading to the loss of β-cell function, which is a main issue of type 2 diabetes mellitus (1Leahy J.L.

The critical role of glucose in insulin secretion is well described both in rodent and human β-cells (3Henquin J.C.

As examples, exposure of the rat β-cell line INS-1E to high glucose induced the expression of more than 2000 genes within 12 h (4Schmidt S.F. Madsen J.G.S. Frafjord K.Ø. Poulsen L.l.C. Salö S.

Moreover, in rat islets, glucose coordinately increased the translation of proinsulin, and the proconvertase PC1/3 (also named Pcsk1), an endopeptidase that is necessary for the conversion of proinsulin into insulin (7Alarcón C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. The biosynthesis of the subtilisin-related proprotein convertase PC3, but no that of the PC2 convertase, is regulated by glucose in parallel to proinsulin biosynthesis in rat pancreatic islets.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less information is available on whether and how glucose regulates protein expression in human β-cells. Recently, using the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1 (8Ravassard P. Hazhouz Y. Pechberty S. Bricout-Neveu E. Armanet M. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. A genetically engineered human pancreatic β cell line exhibiting glucose-inducible insulin secretion.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 3589-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and human islets, we unexpectedly observed through global transcriptomic analyses that glucose regulates an extremely limited number of genes (9Richards P. Rachdi L. Oshima M. Marchetti P. Bugliani M. Armanet M. Postic C. Guilmeau S. Scharfmann R. MondoA is an essential glucose-responsive transcription factor in human pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggested that glucose might control protein expression levels through translational regulation. To study glucose-regulated translation in human β-cells, we adapted the surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) technique in order to capture and identify the nascent proteome. The SUnSET technique was developed by Schmidt et al. (10Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), allowing the monitoring and quantification of global protein translation by Western blotting, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), or immunohistochemistry. This is a nonradioactive technique, based on a pulse of puromycin that is followed by the use of anti-puromycin antibodies to detect newly puromycin-labeled peptides. Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic and has a structural similarity to aminoacyl-transfer RNA (11Pestka S. Inhibitors of ribosome functions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1971; 25: 487-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, puromycin reaction requires its incorporation into growing peptide chains by the formation of a peptide linkage. The result is the formation of a puromycin-tagged nascent peptide chain unable to undergo further elongation (11Pestka S. Inhibitors of ribosome functions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1971; 25: 487-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Of interest, at the low concentration used in SUnSET, puromycin binds only at the C terminus of the full-length protein, allowing one to monitor full-length protein translation (12Miyamoto-Sato E. Nemoto N. Kobayashi K. Yanagawa H. Specific bonding of puromycin to full-length protein at the C-terminus.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SUnSET is now validated as an accurate alternative to traditional isotope methods for measuring relative rates of protein synthesis in cells (10Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P.

Here, we describe and validate the use of the SUnSET approach to demonstrate through FACS and Western blot that glucose increases protein translation in the human cell line EndoC-βH2 (19Scharfmann R. Pechberty S. Hazhouz Y. von Bülow M. Bricout-Neveu E. Grenier-Godard M. Guez F. Rachdi L. Lohmann M. Czernichow P. Ravassard P.

We next defined and quantified newly synthesized proteins by mass spectrometry. We identified more than 2000 proteins using this approach. We demonstrate that, although glucose regulates a very limited number of genes in human β-cells (9Richards P. Rachdi L. Oshima M. Marchetti P. Bugliani M. Armanet M. Postic C. Guilmeau S. Scharfmann R. MondoA is an essential glucose-responsive transcription factor in human pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it activates the expression of a large number of proteins (more than 700) involved in the translation machinery, in glucose metabolism and in insulin exocytosis. Among these proteins, we observed that, in human β-cells, glucose increased the translation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) without any effect on PCSK2, another member of the same proconvertase family. Taken together, we validate the use of the SUnSET approach in human β-cells and demonstrate that glucose regulates the human β-cell proteome through specific protein translation. Glucose plays major roles in β-cells, not only for insulin secretion but also to tightly regulate protein levels (6Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J.

Verchere C.B. Rhodes C.J. Translational control of glucose-induced islet amyloid polypeptide production in pancreatic islets.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we previously observed by a transcriptomic analysis that glucose modulates the expression of an extremely limited number of genes in the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1 (9Richards P. Rachdi L. Oshima M. Marchetti P. Bugliani M. Armanet M. Postic C. Guilmeau S. Scharfmann R. MondoA is an essential glucose-responsive transcription factor in human pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that glucose regulation in β-cells might mainly take place at a posttranscriptional level, affecting protein translation. Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is tightly linked to protein translation (21Roux P.P. Topisirovic I. Signaling pathways involved in the regulation of mRNA translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2018; 38e00070-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and its activation is mainly associated to amino acid availability (22Liu G.Y. Sabatini D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Of interest, glucose is also a potent activator of the mTOR pathway in β-cells (23Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Liu H. Pappan K.L. Remedi M.S. McDaniel M.L. Glucose-stimulated DNA synthesis through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is regulated by KATP channels effects on cell cycle progression in rodent islets.J. Biol.

Invest. 2019; 130: 4124-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested whether glucose stimulates mTOR activity in the human β-cells EndoC-βH2. Following 24-h starvation, glucose treatment (30 min) induced a concentration-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (P-rpS6), a downstream target of mTOR complex1 (mTORC1/S6 kinase pathway) at serine 240/244 (Fig. 1, A and B for quantification). A parallel increase was also observed for the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), another downstream target of mTOR signaling (Fig. 1, A and C for quantification).The phosphorylation of rpS6 and 4EBP1 by glucose was blocked by rapamycin (RAPA), a specific inhibitor of mTORC1 (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1, A and B for quantification). Taken together, glucose activates the mTOR pathway in EndoC-βH2 cells, which suggests that it regulates protein translation. To study the effect of glucose on protein translation in EndoC-βH2 cells, we used the SUnSET method that is based on the quantification of the rate of puromycin incorporation into newly synthesized proteins (10Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we glucose-starved EndoC-βH2 cells for 24 h, followed by a 30-min glucose pulse (20 mM) and the addition of puromycin during the last 10 min before cell collection. There, we first analyzed the effect of glucose on puromycin incorporation into EndoC-βH2 cells using FACS (Fig. 2A). We observed that 20 mM glucose increased puromycin incorporation, which was blocked when EndoC-βH2 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (Fig. 2A). We next analyzed puromycin incorporation by Western blot at 0.5, 5.6, and 20 mM glucose. Under these settings, glucose treatment increased puromycin incorporation in a glucose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C for quantification). Of importance, glucose did not increase puromycin incorporation in EndoC-βH2 cells when the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide. Moreover, rapamycin pretreatment sharply decreased puromycin incorporation upon glucose stimulation (Fig. 2B). Taken together, glucose stimulated protein synthesis in EndoC-βH2 cells in an mTOR-dependent fashion. We next performed a time course of glucose effect on puromycin incorporation. We cultured EndoC-βH2 cells at 5.6 mM glucose and pulsed them with 20 mM glucose for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h with puromycin added during the last 10 min. Western blot analyses indicated that puromycin incorporation at 20 mM glucose plateaued from 2 h of treatment (Fig. 2D), and we selected 4 h glucose pulse for the following experiments. Note that, in this setting, cycloheximide pretreatment blocked puromycin incorporation in all tested conditions (Fig. 2D). Based on this result, we concluded that the SUnSET technique is a valid method for measuring in vitro changes in protein translation in human β-cells.

Sci. 2016; 140: 47-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mouse islets, PCSK1 expression has been shown to be regulated by glucose at the translational levels (6Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Glucose-regulated translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis with that of the proinsulin endopeptidases PC2 and PC3 in the insulin-producing MIN6 cell line.Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus looked at the regulation of PCSK1 expression by glucose in EndoC-βH2 cells. First, we observed that, in these cells, glucose did not increase PCSK1 mRNA steady-state levels (Fig. 3A and (9Richards P. Rachdi L. Oshima M. Marchetti P. Bugliani M. Armanet M. Postic C. Guilmeau S. Scharfmann R. MondoA is an essential glucose-responsive transcription factor in human pancreatic β-cells.Diabetes. 2018; 67: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that, upon glucose stimulation, variation in PCSK1 protein steady-state levels could not be observed on total lysates from EndoC-βH2 cells (Fig. 3B and Fig. S2 for quantification), which might be due to the stability of the protein. We thus used the more dynamic SUnSET approach. We stimulated EndoC-βH2 cells with 20 mM glucose for 4 h and pulsed them for 10 min with puromycin. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-puromycin antibodies, followed by Western blot using anti-PCSK1 antibody. It demonstrated that 20 mM glucose increased puromycin incorporation into PCSK1, which was not the case when EndoC-βH2 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide or when puromycin was omitted (Fig. 3, C and E for quantification). As expected, in EndoC-βH2 cells, glucose did not modulate actin translation (Fig. 3D). Of interest, PCSK1 neosynthesis upon glucose stimulation was fast as a time course experiment indicated that a 15-min glucose treatment was sufficient to induce PCSK1 translation (Fig. 3F). Taken together, we validated the SUnSET method as an accurate approach to identify proteins whose translation is modulated by glucose in EndoC-βH2 cells. To identify additional human β-cell proteins with increased translation under high-glucose condition, we performed a 4-h pulse with 20 mM glucose including a 10-min puromycin treatment followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-puromycin antibodies. Protein silver staining indicated that glucose increased the total amount of immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 4A). Note that extremely limited amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated when puromycin was omitted or when EndoC-βH2 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (Fig. 4A). Similar conclusions were obtained when proteins that had incorporated puromycin were immunoprecipitated and blotted using puromycin antibodies: again, the puromycin signal was higher in EndoC-βH2 cells cultured at 20 versus 5.6 mM glucose and this difference was blunted when cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (Fig. 4B). Immunoprecipitated proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry by the S-TRAP method. Data were processed with MaxQuant (29Cox J. Mann M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized ppb-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (7873) Google Scholar). We performed two independent experiments and focused on proteins common to both experiments. We identified more than 2000 proteins by mass spectrometry. We detected 703 proteins that included PCSK1 with a 2-fold enrichment in the 20 mM glucose-treated groups compared with 5.6 mM. Such proteins were not detected in controls performed in the absence of puromycin treatment or upon cycloheximide pretreatment (Table S1). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using Metascape (30Zhou Y. Zhou B. Pache L. Chang M. Khodabakhshi A.H. Tanaseichuk O. Benner C. Chanda S.K. Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) highlighted proteins translated upon glucose stimulation associated with metabolism of RNA, RNA splicing, amino acid metabolism, and protein translation (Fig. 4C). As an example, glucose induced the translation of many proteins associated with the eukaryotic ribosomal subunits 40S and 60S (Fig. 4D). We also observed an increased translation of most of the eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4 (eIF4) protein family members (eIF4E/G/H) involved in recognition and binding of the 5' cap structure of mRNA. Finally, the translation of proteins of the eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3 (eIF3) complex (eIF3 B, C, E, H, K, and L) that leads to the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit on mRNA in the translation initiation complex was also controlled by glucose. We also observed an increased translation of seven aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (amino acid code: H, K, W, F, M, S, Q, and Y) linking tRNA with their respective amino acids. Such data thus further support the fact that glucose improves protein translation in human β-cells. By performing targeted Gene Ontology annotation using the PANTHER classification, we highlighted many proteins involved in glucose metabolism (Fig. 5A). This was the case for proteins associated with glycolysis such as 6-phosphofructokinase, liver type (PFKL) and muscle type (PFKM), and Aldolase C (ALDOC). This was also the case for enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta (PDHB) and isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha (IDH3A). This was finally the case for the five complexes (CoI-CoV) involved in oxidative phosphorylation. As examples, it was the case for NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone iron-sulfur proteins 1 and 3 (NDUS1; NDUS3), NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2 (NDUV2), and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit 1 (NDUFS1) from complex I (CoI), and the succinate dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein subunit proteins A and B (SDHA, SDHB) from complex II (CoII) (Fig. 5B). The PANTHER classification also highlighted a large number of proteins implicated in insulin exocytosis (Fig. 5C). As examples, we further confirmed increased puromycin incorporation upon glucose treatment in PCSK1 as observed by Western blot (Fig. 3C). We also found that glucose induced translation of Ras-like small G protein RAP-1A that is required for the first phase of potentiation of insulin secretion (31Shibasaki T. Takahashi H. Miki T. Sunaga Y. Matsumura K. Yamanaka M. Zhang C. Tamamoto A. Satoh T. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Essential role of Epac2/Rap1 signaling in regulation of insulin granule dynamics by cAMP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19333-1933831Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We also detected proteins such as calcium-dependent secretion activator 1 (CADPS) known to be implicated in the calcium signaling pathway, in large dense-core vesicles formation and important to insulin secretion (Fig. 5D) (32Braun M. Ramracheya R. Bengtsson M. Clark A. Walker J.N. Johnson P.R. Rorsman P. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an autocrine excitatory transmitter in human pancreatic beta-cells.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1694-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also identified the voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1 (CACNA2D1) that is known to affect insulin secretion by suppressing voltage-gated calcium channel transport to the plasma membrane, thereby reducing Ca2+ signaling (33Mastrolia V. Flucher S.M. Obermair G.J. Drach M. Hofer H. Renström E. Schwartz A. Striessnig J. Flucher B.E. Tuluc P. Loss of α2δ-1 calcium channel subunit function increases the susceptibility for diabetes.Diabetes. 2017; 66: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CACNA2D1 acts on endosomes linked to the Golgi as a recycling carrier to the cell surface such as the glucose translated secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1 (SCAMP1) (Fig. 5D). Finally, glucose increased the translation of key proteins involved in insulin exocytosis. This was the case for proteins important for vesicle fusion (SNARE proteins) such as syntaxin-1A (STX1A), syntaxin-3 (STX3), and syntaxin-12 (STX12) and for multiple proteins involved in vesicular protein trafficking such as member of the transmembrane P24 trafficking protein (TMED7, TMED9, TMED10) and the vesicle-trafficking protein SEC22b (SC22B) (Fig. 5D). Among the 703 proteins showing a 2-fold enrichment of puromycin incorporation under 20 mM glucose in EndoC-βH2 cells (Table S1), we selected three proteins for further validation. We first focused on mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) (also called Erk1 or p42MAPK) and MAPK3 (also called Erk2 or p44MAPK). MAPK signaling is ubiquitous and involved in many cellular functions including cell growth, survival, and differentiation. In β-cells, MAPKs are required for β-cell mass regulation and insulin secretion (34Ikushima Y.M. Awazawa M. Kobayashi N. Osonoi S. Takemiya S. Kobayashi H. Suwanai H. Morimoto Y. Soeda K. Adachi J. Muratani M. Charron J. Mizukami H. Takahashi N. Ueki K.

Western blot analysis indicated that glucose increased MAPK levels (Fig. 6, A–C for quantification). Immunoprecipitations using anti-puromycin antibody followed by Western blot using anti-MAPK antibody demonstrated a parallel increase of puromycin incorporation into MAPKs (Fig. 6, D–F for quantification). We next concentrated on the cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-alpha regulatory subunit 1 (PRKAR2A). This protein is one of the four different regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). The inactive holoenzyme of PKA is a tetramer composed of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits as PRKAR2A. PKA signaling is essential for β-cell differentiation and insulin secretion (35Blanchet E. Van de Velde S. Matsumura S. Hao E. LeLay J. Kaestner K. Montminy M.

Incretin action in the pancreas: Potential promise, possible perils, and pathological pitfalls.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Here, Western blot analysis indicated that glucose did not regulate the PRKAR2A steady-state level (Fig. 6, G and H for quantification). On the other hand, by using the dynamic SUnSET approach we observed that glucose induces PRKAR2A translation (Fig. 6, I and J for quantification). Taken together, through the use of a puromycin incorporation-based approach, we demonstrated that glucose regulates the translation of proteins involved in glucose metabolism and insulin exocytosis in human β-cells. Glucose has been shown to play major roles in β-cell proliferation, survival, and function both in rodent and human (37Dadon D. Tornovsky-Babaey S. Furth-Lavi J. Ben-Zvi D. Ziv O.

https://openalex.org/W3164960928,"Ruminants have a very complex digestive system adapted for the digestion of cellulose rich food. Gene duplications have been central in the process of adapting their digestive system for this complex food source. One of the new loci involved in food digestion is the lysozyme c locus where cows have ten active such genes compared to a single gene in humans and where four of the bovine copies are expressed in the abomasum, the real stomach. The second locus that has become part of the ruminant digestive system is the chymase locus. The chymase locus encodes several of the major hematopoietic granule proteases. In ruminants, genes within the chymase locus have duplicated and some of them are expressed in the duodenum and are therefore called duodenases. To obtain information on their specificities and functions we produced six recombinant proteolytically active duodenases (three from cows, two from sheep and one from pigs). Two of the sheep duodenases were found to be highly specific tryptases and one of the bovine duodenases was a highly specific asp-ase. The remaining two bovine duodenases were dual enzymes with potent tryptase and chymase activities. In contrast, the pig enzyme was a chymase with no tryptase or asp-ase activity. These results point to a remarkable flexibility in both the primary and extended specificities within a single chromosomal locus that most likely has originated from one or a few genes by several rounds of local gene duplications. Interestingly, using the consensus cleavage site for the bovine asp-ase to screen the entire bovine proteome, it revealed Mucin-5B as one of the potential targets. Using the same strategy for one of the sheep tryptases, this enzyme was found to have potential cleavage sites in two chemokine receptors, CCR3 and 7, suggesting a role for this enzyme to suppress intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3165196678,"Treatment of hematologic malignancies is a formidable challenge for hematologists and there is an urgent need to identify safe and efficacious agents either via synthesis in the laboratory or isolation from natural products. Here, we report the cytotoxicity of extracts from mushroom Gymnopilus purpureosquamulosus Høil (G. pps) and describe its molecular mechanisms. Using leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines, 28-35 ppm G. pps extract inhibited cell proliferation by ~46-79%, which correlates with activation of apoptosis as indicated by increase in annexin V-positive cells (~5-8-fold), production of reactive oxygen species (~2-3-fold), cells in sub G0/G1 phase (~3-13-fold), caspase 3 enzymatic activity (~1.6-2.9-fold), DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage and down-regulation of prosurvival proteins. Mitochondrial membrane potential decreased and leakage of pro-apoptotic factors to cytoplasm was observed, consistent with the activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed activation of the ASK1-MEK-SAPK/JNK and ASK1-P38 MAPK pathways possibly due to changes in the cellular redox status as suggested by decreased protein levels of peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Moreover, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine alleviated the cytotoxicity of G. pps. Pharmacological inhibition of SAPK/JNK and P38 alleviated the G. pps-mediated cytotoxicity. The extract activated apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma patient cell samples but not in mononuclear cells from healthy donors further supporting the therapeutic values of G. pps for hematologic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3165780018,"Cathelicidins such as the human 37-amino acid peptide (LL-37) are peptides that not only potently kill microbes but also trigger inflammation by enabling immune recognition of endogenous nucleic acids. Here, a detailed structure-function analysis of LL-37 was performed to understand the details of this process. Alanine scanning of 34-amino acid peptide (LL-34) showed that some variants displayed increased antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus. In contrast, different substitutions clustered on the hydrophobic face of the LL-34 alpha helix inhibited the ability of those variants to promote type 1 interferon expression in response to U1 RNA or to present U1 to the scavenger receptor (SR) B1 on the keratinocyte cell surface. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments of the LL-34 variants LL-34, F5A, I24A, and L31A demonstrated that these peptides form cognate supramolecular structures with U1 characterized by inter-dsRNA spacings of approximately 3.5 nm, a range that has been previously shown to activate toll-like receptor 3 by the parent peptide LL-37. Therefore, while alanine substitutions on the hydrophobic face of LL-34 led to loss of binding to SRs and the complete loss of autoinflammatory responses in epithelial and endothelial cells, they did not inhibit the ability to organize with U1 RNA in solution to associate with toll-like receptor 3. These observations advance our understanding of how cathelicidin mediates the process of innate immune self-recognition to enable inert nucleic acids to trigger inflammation. We introduce the term ""innate immune vetting"" to describe the capacity of peptides such as LL-37 to enable certain nucleic acids to become an inflammatory stimulus through SR binding prior to cell internalization."

To this end, six out of 31 provinces in China are first selected as research samples, central and provincial new energy policies in the period of 2010 to 2019 are collected to establish a text corpus with 23, 674 documents. Then, the policy corpus is fed to two different topic models, one is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation for modeling static policy topics, another is the Dynamic Topic Model for extracting topics over time. Finally, the obtained topics are mapped into policy tools for comparisons. The dynamic policy topics are further analyzed with the panel data from provincial new energy industries. The results show that the provincial new energy policies moved to different tracks after about 2014 due to the regional conditions such as the economy and CO2 emission intensity. Underdeveloped provinces tend to use environment-oriented tools to regulate and control CO2 emissions, while developed regions employ the more balanced policy mix for improving new energy vehicles and other industries. Widespread hysteretic effects are revealed during the correlation analysis of the policy topics and new energy capacity."

https://openalex.org/W3164717259,"Weight loss after bariatric surgery varies widely between individuals, partly due to genetic differences. In addition, genetic determinants of abdominal obesity have been shown to attenuate weight loss after dietary intervention with special attention paid to the rs1358980-T risk allele in the VEGFA locus. Here we aimed to test if updated genetic risk scores (GRSs) for adiposity measures and the rs1358980-T risk allele are linked with weight loss following gastric bypass surgery.Five hundred seventy six patients with morbid obesity underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A GRS for BMI and a GRS for waist-hip-ratio adjusted for BMI (proxy for abdominal obesity), respectively, were constructed. All patients were genotyped for the rs1358980-T risk allele. Associations between the genetic determinants and weight loss after bariatric surgery were evaluated.The GRS for BMI was not associated with weight loss (β = -2.0 kg/100 risk alleles, 95% CI -7.5 to 3.3, p = 0.45). Even though the GRS for abdominal obesity was associated with an attenuated weight loss response adjusted for age, sex and center (β = -14.6 kg/100 risk alleles, 95% CI -25.4 to -3.8, p = 0.008), it was not significantly associated with weight loss after adjustment for baseline BMI (β = -7.9 kg/100 risk alleles, 95% CI -17.5 to 1.6, p = 0.11). Similarly, the rs1358980-T risk allele was not significantly associated with weight loss (β = -0.8 kg/risk allele, 95% CI -2.2 to 0.6, p = 0.25).GRSs for adiposity derived from large meta-analyses and the rs1358980-T risk allele in the VEGFA locus did not predict weight loss after gastric bypass surgery. The association between a GRS for abdominal obesity and the response to bariatric surgery may be dependent on the association between the GRS and baseline BMI."

https://openalex.org/W3165552295,"Brr2 is an essential Ski2-like RNA helicase that exhibits a unique structure among the spliceosomal helicases. Brr2 harbors a catalytically active N-terminal helicase cassette and a structurally similar but enzymatically inactive C-terminal helicase cassette connected by a linker region. Both cassettes contain a nucleotide-binding pocket, but it is unclear whether nucleotide binding in these two pockets is related. Here we use biophysical and computational methods to delineate the functional connectivity between the cassettes and determine whether occupancy of one nucleotide-binding site may influence nucleotide binding at the other cassette. Our results show that Brr2 exhibits high specificity for adenine nucleotides, with both cassettes binding ADP tighter than ATP. Adenine nucleotide affinity for the inactive C-terminal cassette is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of the active N-terminal cassette, as determined by slow nucleotide release. Mutations at the intercassette surfaces and in the connecting linker diminish the affinity of adenine nucleotides for both cassettes. Moreover, we found that abrogation of nucleotide binding at the C-terminal cassette reduces nucleotide binding at the N-terminal cassette 70 Å away. Molecular dynamics simulations identified structural communication lines that likely mediate these long-range allosteric effects, predominantly across the intercassette interface. Together, our results reveal intricate networks of intramolecular interactions in the complex Brr2 RNA helicase, which fine-tune its nucleotide affinities and which could be exploited to regulate enzymatic activity during splicing."

https://openalex.org/W3164665290,"Wound healing after Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation often entails fibrosis as a foreign body reaction to the silicone plate. Poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) forms an antifouling surface that inhibits fibrosis during wound healing. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of the implantation of AGV coated with PMPC (wPMPC) versus AGV without PMPC (woPMPC) in rabbits.Six New Zealand White rabbit does underwent AGV implantation in both eyes. For each rabbit, one eye was randomly selected for implantation of AGV wPMPC and a conventional AGV (woPMPC) was implanted in the contralateral eye. Gross conjunctival vascularity was compared between the two groups at the first, second, and fourth weeks after surgery. The eyes were enucleated in four weeks and subjected to staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stain. The fibrosis and inflammation status among the eye samples were compared by measuring the thickness of the fibrotic walls and counting the number of chronic inflammatory cells around the AGV. Counting of inflammatory cells and measuring fibrotic wall thickness were done in a blinded method to eliminate observer bias. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test.Gross and histological examinations revealed no toxic effects of PMPC. There were no apparent differences in overall conjunctival vascularity between the two groups at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after surgery. The average inflammatory cell counts were 14.3 ± 5.8 per slide and 27.3 ± 8.6 per slide in the wPMPC and woPMPC groups, respectively (p = 0.037). The average thicknesses of the fibrotic wall were 57.9 ± 11.3 μm and 81.5 ± 21.3 μm in the wPMPC and woPMPC groups, respectively (p = 0.025).Compared to the woPMPC group, the number of inflammatory cells and fibrosis were significantly decreased in the wPMPC group."

With this context, our paper addresses the problem of pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR). This problem entails recognizing attributes such as age-group, clothing style, accessories, footwear style etc. This multi-label problem is extremely challenging even for human observers and has rightly garnered attention from the computer vision community. Towards a solution to this problem, in this paper, we adopt trainable Gabor wavelets (TGW) layers and cascade them with a convolution neural network (CNN). Whereas other researchers are using fixed Gabor filters with the CNN, the proposed layers are learnable and adapt to the dataset for a better recognition. We propose a two-branch neural network where mixed layers, a combination of the TGW and convolutional layers, make up the building block of our deep neural network.

Soil samples were also collected from each plot. The soil samples were analyzed following standard laboratory procedures. The result of the analysis showed that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in species diversity and richness among different land-use practices. Coffea arabica was dominant in homestead gardens and natural forests while Grevillea robusta showed had maximum richness in plantations and farm forests in the Watershed. Furthermore, home garden agroforestry practice was significantly (p<0.05) affected soil pH compared to other land-use systems (cultivated land, natural forest, and plantation forest. While Organic carbon (OC), Total nitrogen (TN), and Carbon to Nitrogen ratio (C: N) did not show significance difference among land-use systems in the watershed. The study has concluded that different land-use practices had a positive impact on sustaining species diversity, richness, and improve soil properties. Therefore, the study suggests that improving and expanding home garden agroforestry practices in the area are indispensable for environmental protection and soil fertility enhancement."

We examined a model of Community-Led Testing (CLT) in Nepal, exploring the feasibility of HIV and HCV testing by trained lay service providers who had similar backgrounds to those of PWIDs. We also assessed the prevalence of HIV and HCV within this study population and the associated risk factors among PWIDs.A mix-methods cross-sectional study was conducted among 1029 PWIDs in five major districts of Nepal from July 2019 to February 2020. Trained PWID peers performed the screening for HIV and HCV using Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits. Acceptability and feasibility of the testing was assessed. The participants' sociodemographic characteristics and injecting and non-injecting risk characteristics were determined. The association of risk and prevention characteristics with testing results were assessed using multiple logistic regression.PWIDs shared that the test providers were friendly and competent in counseling and testing. Of total PWIDs (n = 1,029), 20.6% were HCV-positive and 0.2% were HIV-positive. HCV positivity was associated with needle sharing (AOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.27,2.64; p = 0.001) and reuse of syringe/needle (AOR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.79; p = 0.002). In addition, PWIDs were more likely to be HCV-positive who started opioid substitution therapy (OST) (AOR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.80, p = 0.002) and attended the rehabilitation center (AOR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.53, p = 0.017).This CLT model was found to be a novel approach of testing of HIV and HCV which was acceptable to PWIDs in Nepal and showed the high prevalence of HCV and its association with injecting-related risk behaviors and being users of OST and rehabilitation. The findings highlight the need of community-led testing in hotspots, OST settings, and rehabilitation centers to screen new HIV and HCV infections."
