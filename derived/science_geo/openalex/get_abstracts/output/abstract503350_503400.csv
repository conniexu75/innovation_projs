https://openalex.org/W2009256046,"Exendin-4 is a glucagon-like receptor 1 agonist clinically used against type 2 diabetes that has also shown neuroprotective effects in experimental stroke models. However, while the neuroprotective efficacy of Exendin-4 has been thoroughly investigated if the pharmacological treatment starts before stroke, the therapeutic potential of the Exendin-4 if the treatment starts acutely after stroke has not been clearly determined. Further, a comparison of the neuroprotective efficacy in normal and aged diabetic mice has not been performed. Finally, the cellular mechanisms behind the efficacy of Exendin-4 have been only partially studied. The main objective of this study was to determine the neuroprotective efficacy of Exendin-4 in normal and aged type 2 diabetic mice if the treatment started after stroke in a clinically relevant setting. Furthermore we characterized the Exendin-4 effects on stroke-induced neuroinflammation. Two-month-old healthy and 14-month-old type 2 diabetic/obese mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. 5 or 50 µg/kg Exendin-4 was administered intraperitoneally at 1.5, 3 or 4.5 hours thereafter. The treatment was continued (0.2 µg/kg/day) for 1 week. The neuroprotective efficacy was assessed by stroke volume measurement and stereological counting of NeuN-positive neurons. Neuroinflammation was determined by gene expression analysis of M1/M2 microglia subtypes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We show neuroprotective efficacy of 50 µg/kg Exendin-4 at 1.5 and 3 hours after stroke in both young healthy and aged diabetic/obese mice. The 5 µg/kg dose was neuroprotective at 1.5 hour only. Proinflammatory markers and M1 phenotype were not impacted by Exendin-4 treatment while M2 markers were significantly up regulated. Our results support the use of Exendin-4 to reduce stroke-damage in the prehospital/early hospitalization setting irrespectively of age/diabetes. The results indicate the polarization of microglia/macrophages towards the M2 reparative phenotype as a potential mechanism of neuroprotection."

In this study, we describe a novel synthetic PPARγ ligand UNIST HYUNDAI Compound 1 (UHC1) that binds tightly to PPARγ without the classical agonism and which blocks cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)-mediated PPARγ phosphorylation. We modified the non-agonist PPARγ ligand SR1664 chemically to improve its solubility and then developed a novel PPARγ ligand, UHC1. According to our docking simulation, UHC1 occupied the ligand-binding site of PPARγ with a higher docking score than SR1664. In addition, UHC1 more potently blocked CDK5-mediated PPARγ phosphorylation at Ser-273. Surprisingly, UHC1 treatment effectively ameliorated the inflammatory response both in vitro and in high-fat diet-fed mice. Furthermore, UHC1 treatment dramatically improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-fed mice without causing fluid retention and weight gain. Taken together, compared with SR1664, UHC1 exhibited greater beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism by blocking CDK5-mediated PPARγ phosphorylation, and these data indicate that UHC1 could be a novel therapeutic agent for use in type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders."

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of expression, humoral immunity and prognostic significance of MAGE CTA in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). mRNA or protein expression frequencies were determined for MAGE-A1, -A3, -A4, -A10 and -C1 (CT7) in tissue samples obtained from 400 patients with EOC. The presence of autologous antibodies against the MAGE antigens was determined from 285 serum samples. The relationships between MAGE expression, humoral immunity to MAGE antigens, and clinico-pathologic characteristics were studied. The individual frequencies of expression were as follows: A1: 15% (42/281), A3: 36% (131/390), A4: 47% (186/399), A10: 52% (204/395), C1: 16% (42/267). Strong concordant expression was noted with MAGE-A1:–A4, MAGE-A1:–C1 and MAGE-A4:–A10 (p<0.0005). Expression of MAGE-A1 or -A10 antigens resulted in poor progression free survival (PFS) (OR 1.44, CI 1.01–2.04, p = 0.044 and OR 1.3, CI 1.03–1.64, p = 0.03, respectively); whereas, MAGE-C1 expression was associated with improved PFS (OR 0.62, CI 0.42–0.92, p = 0.016). The improved PFS observed for MAGE-C1 expression, was diminished by co-expression of MAGE-A1 or -A10. Spontaneous humoral immunity to the MAGE antigens was present in 9% (27/285) of patients, and this predicted poor overall survival (log-rank test p = 0.0137). These findings indicate that MAGE-A1, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A3, and MAGE-A10 are priority attractive targets for polyvalent immunotherapy in ovarian cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2044327558,"Hallmarks of cancer are fundamental principles involved in cancer progression. We propose an additional generalized hallmark of malignant transformation corresponding to the differential expression of a family of mitochondrial ncRNAs (ncmtRNAs) that comprises sense and antisense members, all of which contain stem-loop structures. Normal proliferating cells express sense (SncmtRNA) and antisense (ASncmtRNA) transcripts. In contrast, the ASncmtRNAs are down-regulated in tumor cells regardless of tissue of origin. Here we show that knockdown of the low copy number of the ASncmtRNAs in several tumor cell lines induces cell death by apoptosis without affecting the viability of normal cells. In addition, knockdown of ASncmtRNAs potentiates apoptotic cell death by inhibiting survivin expression, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Down-regulation of survivin is at the translational level and is probably mediated by microRNAs generated by dicing of the double-stranded stem of the ASncmtRNAs, as suggested by evidence presented here, in which the ASncmtRNAs are bound to Dicer and knockdown of the ASncmtRNAs reduces reporter luciferase activity in a vector carrying the 3'-UTR of survivin mRNA. Taken together, down-regulation of the ASncmtRNAs constitutes a vulnerability or Achilles' heel of cancer cells, suggesting that the ASncmtRNAs are promising targets for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2062240607,"Although many terpenes have shown antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activity, the mechanism of action is not well established. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the spin-labeled 5-doxyl stearic acid revealed remarkable fluidity increases in the plasma membrane of terpene-treated Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. For an antiproliferative activity assay using 5×10(6) parasites/mL, the sesquiterpene nerolidol and the monoterpenes (+)-limonene, α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole inhibited the growth of the parasites with IC50 values of 0.008, 0.549, 0.678 and 4.697 mM, respectively. The IC50 values of these terpenes increased as the parasite concentration used in the cytotoxicity assay increased, and this behavior was examined using a theoretical treatment of the experimental data. Cytotoxicity tests with the same parasite concentration as in the EPR experiments revealed a correlation between the IC50 values of the terpenes and the concentrations at which they altered the membrane fluidity. In addition, the terpenes induced small amounts of cell lysis (4-9%) at their respective IC50 values. For assays with high cell concentrations (2×10(9) parasites/mL), the incorporation of terpene into the cell membrane was very fast, and the IC50 values observed for 24 h and 5 min-incubation periods were not significantly different. Taken together, these results suggest that terpene cytotoxicity is associated with the attack on the plasma membrane of the parasite. The in vitro cytotoxicity of nerolidol was similar to that of miltefosine, and nerolidol has high hydrophobicity; thus, nerolidol might be used in drug delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticles to treat leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2029835085,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are known to lower glucose levels and are also beneficial in the management of cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigated whether a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin, modulates endothelial cell network formation and revascularization processes in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vildagliptin enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary density in the ischemic limbs of wild-type mice, with accompanying increases in phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). In contrast to wild-type mice, treatment with vildagliptin did not improve blood flow in ischemic muscles of eNOS-deficient mice. Treatment with vildagliptin increased the levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and adiponectin, which have protective effects on the vasculature. Both vildagliptin and GLP-1 increased the differentiation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) into vascular-like structures, although vildagliptin was less effective than GLP-1. GLP-1 and vildagliptin also stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in HUVECs. Pretreatment with a PI3 kinase or NOS inhibitor blocked the stimulatory effects of both vildagliptin and GLP-1 on HUVEC differentiation. Furthermore, treatment with vildagliptin only partially increased the limb flow of ischemic muscle in adiponectin-deficient mice in vivo. GLP-1, but not vildagliptin, significantly increased adiponectin expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro. These data indicate that vildagliptin promotes endothelial cell function via eNOS signaling, an effect that may be mediated by both GLP-1-dependent and GLP-1-independent mechanisms. The beneficial activity of GLP-1 for revascularization may also be partially mediated by its ability to increase adiponectin production.

https://openalex.org/W2009621905,"Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) plays an important role in vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and vascular injury. Although KLF4 is expressed in the heart in addition to vascular cells, the role of KLF4 in cardiac disease has not been fully determined. The goals of this study were to investigate the role of KLF4 in cardiac hypertrophy and to determine the underlying mechanisms. Cardiomyocyte-specific Klf4 knockout (CM Klf4 KO) mice were generated by the Cre/LoxP technique. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by chronic infusion of the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO). Results showed that ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy was enhanced in CM Klf4 KO mice compared with control mice. Accelerated cardiac hypertrophy in CM Klf4 KO mice was accompanied by the augmented cellular enlargement of cardiomyocytes as well as the exaggerated expression of fetal cardiac genes, including atrial natriuretic factor (Nppa). Additionally, induction of myocardin, a transcriptional cofactor regulating fetal cardiac genes, was enhanced in CM Klf4 KO mice. Interestingly, KLF4 regulated Nppa expression by modulating the expression and activity of myocardin, providing a mechanical basis for accelerated cardiac hypertrophy in CM Klf4 KO mice. Moreover, we showed that KLF4 mediated the antihypertrophic effect of trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, because ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in CM Klf4 KO mice was attenuated by olmesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 antagonist, but not by trichostatin A. These results provide novel evidence that KLF4 is a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy by modulating the expression and the activity of myocardin."

Other proteins that are present when Aβ peptides deposit in vivo are likely to have an effect on these aggregation processes. To separate specific versus broad spectrum effects of proteins on Aβ aggregation, we tested a series of proteins not reported to have chaperone activity: catalase, pyruvate kinase, albumin, lysozyme, α-lactalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin. All tested proteins suppressed the fibrillation of Alzheimer Aβ(1–40) peptide at substoichiometric ratios, albeit some more effectively than others. All proteins bound non-specifically to Aβ, stabilized its random coils, and reduced its cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, pyruvate kinase and catalase were at least as effective as known chaperones in inhibiting Aβ aggregation. We propose general mechanisms for the broad-spectrum inhibition Aβ fibrillation by proteins. The mechanisms we discuss are significant for prognostics and perhaps even for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease.

https://openalex.org/W2007284300,"Macrophages are generated through the differentiation of monocytes in tissues and they have important functions in innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to their roles as phagocytes, macrophages can be further differentiated, in the presence of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), into osteoclasts (multinucleated giant cells that are responsible for bone resorption). In this work, we set out to characterize whether various inflammatory stimuli, known to induce macrophage polarization, can alter the type of multinucleated giant cell obtained from RANKL differentiation. Following a four-day differentiation protocol, along with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon gamma (IFNγ) as one stimulus, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) as the other, three types of multinucleated cells were generated. Using various microscopy techniques (bright field, epifluorescence and scanning electron), functional assays, and western blotting for osteoclast markers, we found that, as expected, RANKL treatment alone resulted in osteoclasts, whereas the addition of LPS/IFNγ to RANKL pre-treated macrophages generated Langhans-type giant cells, while IL-4 led to giant cells resembling foreign body giant cells with osteoclast-like characteristics. Finally, to gain insight into the modulation of osteoclastogenesis, we characterized the formation and morphology of RANKL and LPS/IFNγ-induced multinucleated giant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2047721009,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have exhibited therapeutic effects in multiple animal models so that are promising liver substitute for transplantation treatment of end-stage liver diseases. However, it has been shown that over-manipulation of these cells increased their tumorigenic potential, and that reducing the in vitro culture time could minimize the risk. In this study, we used a D-galactosamine plus lipopolysaccharide (Gal/LPS)-induced acute liver failure mouse model, which caused death of about 50% of the mice with necrosis of more than 50% hepatocytes, to compare the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord MSCs (hUCMSCs) before and after induction of differentiation into hepatocyte (i-Heps). Induction of hUCMSCs to become i-Heps was achieved by treatment of the cells with a group of growth factors within 4 weeks. The resulted i-Heps exhibited a panel of human hepatocyte biomarkers including cytokeratin (hCK-18), α-fetoprotein (hAFP), albumin (hALB), and hepatocyte-specific functions glycogen storage and urea metabolism. We demonstrated that transplantation of both cell types through tail vein injection rescued almost all of the Gal/LPS-intoxicated mice. Although both cell types exhibited similar ability in homing at the mouse livers, the populations of the hUCMSCs-derived cells, as judged by expressing hAFP, hCK-18 and human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF), were small. These observations let us to conclude that the hUCMSCs was as effective as the i-Heps in treatment of the mouse acute liver failure, and that the therapeutic effects of hUCMSCs were mediated largely via stimulation of host hepatocyte regeneration, and that delivery of the cells through intravenous injection was effective."
https://openalex.org/W2036338456,"Salidroside is one of the major phenolic glycosides in Rhodiola, which has been reported to possess various biological activities. In the present study the in vivo deglycosylation metabolism of salidroside was investigated and its aglycone p-tyrosol but not the original salidroside was identified as the main form in rat tissues following the administration of salidroside. After the i.v. administration of salidroside at a dose of 50 mg/kg in rats, salidroside was quantified only in the liver, kidney and heart tissues. The highest level of p-tyrosol was detected in the heart, followed by the spleen, kidney, liver and lungs, in order. Salidroside was detected only in the liver, in contrast, p-tyrosol was detectable in most tissues except the brain, and the kidney tissues contained a significant amount of p-tyrosol compared to the other tissues after the i.g. administration of 100 mg/kg salidroside. The excretion behaviour revealed that the administrated salidroside mainly eliminated in the form of salidroside but not its aglycone metabolite p-tyrosol through urine. After i.v. and i.g. administration in rats, 64.00% and 23.80% of the total dose was excreted through urine in the form of salidroside, respectively. In addition, 0.19% and 2.25% of the dose was excreted in the form of p-tyrosol through urine after i.v. and i.g. administration, respectively. The faecal salidroside and p-tyrosol concentrations were 0.3% and 1.48% of the total dose after i.v. administration, respectively. After the i.g. administration of salidroside, trace salidroside and p-tyrosol were quantified in faeces within 72 h. In addition, the biliary excretion levels of salidroside after i.v. and i.g. administration were 2.86% and 0.02% of the dose, respectively. The obtained results show that salidroside was extensively metabolised to its aglycone p-tyrosol and distributed to various organs and the orginal salidroside was cleared rapidly through urine following the administration of salidroside."

Design A retrospective cytology-based inception screening cohort of HIV-infected adults was analyzed using a 3-state Markov model of clinical pathogenesis of anal neoplasia. Methods Longitudinally ascertained cytology categories were adjusted for misclassification using estimates of cytology accuracy derived from the study cohort. Time-varying covariate effects were estimated as hazard ratios. Results (1) There was a moderate to high probability of regression of the high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) state (27–62%) at 2 years after initial cytology screening; (2) the probability of developing invasive anal cancer (IAC) during the first 2 years after a baseline HSIL cytology is low (1.9–2.8%); (3) infrared coagulation (IRC) ablation of HSIL lesions is associated with a 2.2–4.2 fold increased probability of regression to <HSIL; and (4) antiretroviral therapy, suppressed HIV plasma viral load, and CD4 ≥350/mm3 are each associated with reduced probability of progression from <HSIL to HSIL. Conclusions The finding of moderate to high rates of regression of the HSIL state accompanied by low rates of progression to IAC should inform both screening and precursor treatment guideline development. There appears to be a consistent and robust beneficial effect of antiretroviral therapy, suppressed viral load, and higher CD4 on the transition from the <HSIL state to the HSIL state."
https://openalex.org/W2008890574,"Cardiovascular malformations can be caused by abnormalities in Gata4 expression during fetal development. In a previous study, we demonstrated that ethanol exposure could lead to histone hyperacetylation and Gata4 over-expression in fetal mouse hearts. However, the potential mechanisms of histone hyperacetylation and Gata4 over-expression induced by ethanol remain unclear.Pregnant mice were gavaged with ethanol or saline. Fetal mouse hearts were collected for analysis. The results of ethanol fed groups showed that global HAT activity was unusually high in the hearts of fetal mice while global HDAC activity remained unchanged. Binding of P300, CBP, PCAF, SRC1, but not GCN5, were increased on the Gata4 promoter relative to the saline treated group. Increased acetylation of H3K9 and increased mRNA expression of Gata4, α-MHC, cTnT were observed in these hearts. Treatment with the pan-histone acetylase inhibitor, anacardic acid, reduced the binding of P300, PCAF to the Gata4 promoter and reversed H3K9 hyperacetylation in the presence of ethanol. Interestingly, anacardic acid attenuated over-expression of Gata4, α-MHC and cTnT in fetal mouse hearts exposed to ethanol.Our results suggest that P300 and PCAF may be critical regulatory factors that mediate Gata4 over-expression induced by ethanol exposure. Alternatively, P300, PCAF and Gata4 may coordinate over-expression of cardiac downstream genes in mouse hearts exposed to ethanol. Anacardic acid may thus protect against ethanol-induced Gata4, α-MHC, cTnT over-expression by inhibiting the binding of P300 and PCAF to the promoter region of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2029440397,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates a wide range of cellular responses in metazoans.

Eight Smads are divided into three subgroups in mammals: five R-Smads, one common Smad (Smad4), and two inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7).

Because signal transduction pathways are regulated by dynamic interplay between protein kinases and phosphatases, the SXS motif must be dephosphorylated by phosphatases to ensure proper balance of Smad signaling. Recent work demonstrates that R-Smads exported from the nucleus are dephosphorylated (15.Inman G.J. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S.

We thus undertook a screen for additional Smad phosphatases and identified CTDSPL2 (named SCP4 for small C-terminal domain Phosphatase-4) as a novel nuclear phosphatase for Smad1/5/8. We have demonstrated that SCP4 physically interacts with and specifically dephosphorylates Smad1/5/8, but not Smad2/3, at the C-terminal SXS motif. Furthermore, overexpression of SCP4 attenuates BMP-induced transcription. Conversely, depletion of SCP4 increases the C-terminal SXS motif phosphorylation and enables an increased sensitivity of cells to BMP2. Hence, SCP4-mediated dephosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 provides an additional mechanism in turning off the BMP signaling. Expression plasmids for epitope-tagged Smads, HA-tagged constitutively active ALK3(Q233D), and FLAG-tagged constitutively active TβRI(T202D) have been previously described (19.Lin X. Duan X.

Full-length SCP4, its phosphatase-dead mutant (D293E, D295N), and deletion mutants were obtained by PCR and cloned into EcoRI (5′) and SalI (3′) of pXF6F (derivative of pRK5, Genentech). Their sequence integrity was confirmed by sequencing. Reporter gene plasmids SBE-luc, PAI-1-luc, and Id1-luc were obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, David Luskutoff, and Peter ten Dijke, respectively. Antibodies against Smad1, P-Smad1, Smad2, P-Smad2 (Cell Signaling), Id1 (Epitomics), RNA polymerase II (PolII), and P-PolII-Ser-5 (phospho-Ser-5 in the CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)) (Covance) were obtained commercially. Rabbit anti-SCP4 polyclonal antibody was generated against the N-terminal 1–262 amino acids of SCP4 (Bethyl Laboratories), and P-Ser-206 (Smad1) antibody was raised against phospho-Ser-206 in the linker of Smad1 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Doxycycline was purchased from Clontech. HEK293T, HeLa, C2C12, ATDC5, HaCaT, and C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (19.Lin X.

HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for Myc-Smad1 and FLAG-SCP4. Twenty-four h after transfection, cell lysates were harvested by Myc lysis buffer (138 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40), and anti-FLAG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-SCP4 from transfected cell lysates by incubating with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 4 h. After extensive washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane, immunostained with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies, and finally detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). In vitro protein translation was performed from the pRK5-derived vector using SP6 RNA polymerase and the TnT® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Proteins fused with GST in pGEX vector were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST pulldown experiments were carried out as described previously (26.Dai F. Lin X. Chang C. Feng X.-H. Nuclear export of Smad2 and Smad3 by RanBP3 facilitates termination of TGF-β signaling.Dev.

(#1 target sequence, nucleotides 796–814 of coding region, GCAGTTCAAGTGAGGCCAT; #2 target sequence, nucleotides 1506–1524 of coding region, GAAGCTTGTAGAACTGAAT). Cells were transfected with siControl or siSCP4 using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). SCP4 cDNA was subcloned into pWPI-puro vector at EcoRI and PmeI sites to generate pWPI-SCP4. HEK293T cells were transfected with pWPI-SCP4 together with lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G. After 48 h of culture, lentiviruses were collected from medium, purified by centrifuge, and then used to infect host cells. Stable cells were selected in the presence of 2 ng/ml puromycin (Sigma). Eighteen h after transfection, cells were treated with BMP2 (5 ng/ml, 8 h) or TGF-β (2 ng/ml, 8 h) as described (26.Dai F. Lin X. Chang C. Feng X.-H.

Cells were then harvested and analyzed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All assays were done in triplicates, and all values were normalized for transfection efficiency against Renilla luciferase activities. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). One µg of total RNAs was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA using PrimeScript® RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) with β-actin as an internal loading control on an ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). Samples were done in triplicate, and data were analyzed using the 2−ΔCT method. Primers used for specific mouse genes are listed as below: Id1, 5′-AGAACCGCAAAGTGAGCAAGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGGTCCCGACTTCAGACT-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-TGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGTGGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGCTGA-3′ (reverse); osteocalcin 5′-TAGCAGACACCATGAGGACCATCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGCTTGGACATGAAGGCTTTGT-3′ (reverse). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, treated by 0.5% Triton X-100 treatment for 20 min, and blocked with 5% BSA. For staining, cells were probed with the indicated primary antibody, Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody, and then visualized under a Zeiss Axio confocal scanning laser microscope. Multipotent C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After cell density reaching 50% confluence, BMP2 (50 ng/ml) was added to induce osteoblast-like lineage differentiation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a marker for osteoblast differentiation. After BMP2 stimulation, C2C12 cells were washed with TB buffer twice (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then lysed with the lysis buffer (TB buffer, plus 0.1% Triton). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, 50 µl of whole cell lysates were incubated with 100 µl of ALP substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) at 37 °C for 1 h, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). For histochemical analysis of ALP activity, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 20 min with a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma), 0.5% N, N-dimethylformamide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 mg/ml Fast Blue BB salt (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at room temperature. Cells were examined by phase contrast microscopy Nikon SMZ 1500. Results are shown as means ± S.E. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Mean values were compared with controls by Student's t test. Ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 is the key step in activation of canonical BMP signaling. Conversely, dephosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 represents a critical event in terminating BMP signaling. Phosphatases that have been reported to dephosphorylate Smad1/5/8 include the pan-Smad phosphatase PPM1A (19.Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In various cell types, we found that PPM1A, but not the others, plays a major role of pan-Smad dephosphorylation (19.Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M. Wang J. Brunicardi F.C. Shi Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Feng X.-H. PPM1A functions as a Smad phosphatase to terminate TGFβ signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Here we used C2C12 cells, a mouse multipotent mesenchymal cell line, to study BMP physiological responses. As shown in Fig. 1A, nuclear accumulation of Smad1 was significantly increased upon 30 min of BMP2 stimulation, which was completely abolished by Dorsomorphin, a small molecule inhibitor for type I BMP receptor (27.Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Dorsomorphin inhibits BMP signals required for embryogenesis and iron metabolism.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). When compared with control cells, stable PPM1A depletion promoted profound accumulation of Smad1 in the nucleus of shPPM1A cells (Fig. 1A). Because dephosphorylation is required for nuclear export of Smads, Smad1 should be retained in the nucleus in shPPM1A cells if PPM1A were the sole phosphatase. We found that in shPPM1A cells, simultaneous BMP withdrawal and Dorsomorphin treatment (30 min after BMP stimulation) reduced the accumulation of Smad1 in the nucleus, suggesting that depletion of PPM1A is not sufficient to maintain full retention of Smad1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). The immunofluorescence staining in Fig. 1A is further supported by Western blotting analysis. In control cells, the P-Smad1 level was induced upon BMP2 stimulation and quickly diminished by simultaneous BMP withdrawal and Dorsomorphin treatment (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of PPM1A caused a much slower, but still apparent, diminishment of the P-Smad1 level in shPPM1A cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, depletion of PPM1A did not fully restore the P-Smad1 level to the highest point (Fig. 1B), suggesting that phosphatases other than nuclear PPM1A can also specifically target Smad1 dephosphorylation. We searched for specific phosphatases for BMP-activated Smad1/5/8. A new member in the FCP/SCP family, CTDSPL2 or SCP4, was identified as a phosphatase for Smad1 in the screen (28.Shen T. Sun C. Zhang Z. Xu N. Duan X. Feng X.-H. Lin X. Specific control of BMP signaling and mesenchymal differentiation by cytoplasmic phosphatase PPM1H.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SCP4 contains a FCP1-like phosphatase domain in its C terminus (see Fig. 3D). To validate the initial screen, we compared the effects of SCP4 and PPM1A depletion on the P-Smad1 level. The P-Smad1 level significantly decreased in the presence of 4-h exposure to BMP2 in comparison with the 2-h exposure (Fig. 1C). Notably, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of either SCP4 or PPM1A could visibly restore the P-Smad1 level, double depletion of SCP4 and PPM1A caused an even higher P-Smad1 level (Fig. 1C). We further determined the effect of SCP4 on Smad1 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells. To rule out the possibility that SCP4 dephosphorylates BMP receptors to prevent Smad1 phosphorylation and activation, we used a constitutively active mutant of BMP receptor ALK3(Q233D) to stimulate Smad1 phosphorylation. The P-Smad1 level was determined by a phospho-SXS motif-specific antibody. As expected, the level of P-Smad1 increased in the presence of HA-ALK3(Q233D) (Fig. 1D, lane 2), and it was reduced by pan-Smad phosphatase PPM1A (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Notably, FLAG-SCP4 also apparently decreased the ALK3(Q233D)-induced P-Smad1 level (Fig. 1C, lane 6). As controls, PPM1D or SCP1 exhibited no detectable effects on the phosphorylation level of Smad1 (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 and 5). Smad5 and Smad8 are two other BMP-activated R-Smads in vertebrates. We found that SCP4 could effectively dephosphorylate both Smad5 (Fig. 1E) and Smad8 (Fig. 1E). Consistent with our previous finding (20.Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Feng X.-H. Lin X. Protein serine/threonine phosphatase PPM1A dephosphorylates Smad1 in the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36526-36532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), PPM1A also reduced the levels of both P-Smad5 and P-Smad8 induced by ALK3(Q233D) (Fig. 1, E and F, lane 2). In contrast, PPP1CA (PP1α) had no effect on Smad5/8 dephosphorylation (Fig. 1, E and F, lane 4). Taken together, SCP4 is a novel phosphatase targeting dephosphorylation of BMP-specific R-Smads. We next determined whether the phosphatase activity of SCP4 is essential in reducing the P-Smad1 level. Amino acids Asp-293 and Asp-295 in the catalytic domain of SCP4 are predicted to be the key amino acids for the phosphatase activity. We generated a phosphatase-dead mutant of SCP4 with D293E and D295N substitutions, named SCP4DN. As shown in Fig. 1G, SCP4DN had no effect on ALK3(Q233D)-induced P-Smad1, suggesting that the phosphatase activity of SCP4 is necessary to dephosphorylate Smad1 (lane 4). To exclude the possibility that SCP4 causes reduction in Smad1 phosphorylation dependent on the 26 S proteasome, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was included. MG-132 had no apparent effect on the levels of total Smad1 and P-Smad1 and did not reverse the effect of SCP4 on the P-Smad1 level (Fig. 1G, compare lane 7 with lane 3). This suggests that SCP4-induced diminishment of the P-Smad1 level does not require the proteasome pathway. In addition to the C-terminal SXS motif, there are additional phosphorylation sites on Smad1 (29.Wrighton K.H. Lin X. Feng X.-H. Phospho-control of TGF-β superfamily signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To test whether SCP4 dephosphorylates these other sites, we chose to examine the effect of SCP4 on the linker region, especially Ser-206. Results in Fig. 2A demonstrate that SCP4 only decreased ALK3(Q233D)-induced P-Smad1(SXS), but not Ser-206 (P-Ser-206) (lane 3). This suggests that SCP4 is a Smad1 phosphatase only toward ligand-induced phosphorylation in the C-terminal SXS motif, but not the linker region. Because SCP4 is structurally similar to FCP1, we examined the ability of SCP4 to dephosphorylate phospho-Ser-5 in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (P-PolII-Ser-5). For this purpose, Tet-off-regulated expression of SCP4 was generated in HeLa cells, and its effect on P-PolII-Ser-5 was determined. In the presence of Tet-derivative doxycycline (+Dox, when SCP4 was not expressed), BMP2 treatment resulted in a strong increase in the endogenous P-Smad1 level (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Removal of Dox (−Dox) induced expression of exogenous FLAG-SCP4 and profoundly reduced the level of P-Smad1 in response to BMP2 (Fig. 2B, lane 2 versus lane 4). On the contrary, the level of P-PolII-Ser-5 remained unchanged in the absence or presence of Dox. The results suggest that, although SCP4 is closely related to FCP/SCP1 that can dephosphorylate the P-PolII-Ser-2/Ser-5 (30.Zhang Y. Kim Y. Genoud N. Gao J. Kelly J.W. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Dixon J.E.

Cell. 2006; 24: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), SCP4 may have a different substrate selectivity. To test whether SCP4 affects the TGF-β signaling pathway, the effect of SCP4 on the level of Smad2 phosphorylation (P-Smad2) was determined. As shown in Fig. 2C, Smad2 phosphorylation was achieved by co-expression of TβRI(T202D), a constitutively active type I TGF-β receptor (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Overexpression of SCP1 or SCP4 had no effect on the phosphorylation level of Smad2 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). In sharp cont"

Over time, microbial communities in the sediment grow in a stratified ecosystem with an oxic top layer and anoxic sub-surface layers. Winogradsky columns have been used extensively to demonstrate microbial nutrient cycling and metabolic diversity in undergraduate microbiology labs. In this study, we used high-throughput 16s rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the microbial diversity of Winogradsky columns. Specifically, we tested the impact of sediment source, supplemental cellulose source, and depth within the column, on microbial community structure. We found that the Winogradsky columns were highly diverse communities but are dominated by three phyla: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. The community is structured by a founding population dependent on the source of sediment used to prepare the columns and is differentiated by depth within the column. Numerous biomarkers were identified distinguishing sample depth, including Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria as biomarkers of the soil-water interface, and Clostridia as a biomarker of the deepest depth. Supplemental cellulose source impacted community structure but less strongly than depth and sediment source. In columns dominated by Firmicutes, the family Peptococcaceae was the most abundant sulfate reducer, while in columns abundant in Proteobacteria, several Deltaproteobacteria families, including Desulfobacteraceae, were found, showing that different taxonomic groups carry out sulfur cycling in different columns. This study brings this historical method for enrichment culture of chemolithotrophs and other soil bacteria into the modern era of microbiology and demonstrates the potential of the Winogradsky column as a model system for investigating the effect of environmental variables on soil microbial communities."

The liver controls lipid biogenesis and bile acid homeostasis. Infection of HBV causes various liver diseases and impairs liver regeneration. As there are very few reports available in the literature on lipid alterations by HBV infection or HBV-mediated liver injury, we have analyzed phospholipids that have important roles in liver regeneration by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) in the livers of HBV model mice. As a result, we identified different phosphatidylcholines (PCs) showing significant changes in their composition as well as cationized ion adduct formation in HBV-infected mouse livers which are associated with virus-mediated regeneration defects. To find the factor of altered PCs, the expression kinetics of enzymes was also examined that regulate PC biosynthesis during liver regeneration. It is noteworthy that the expression of choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase A (PCYT1A) was significantly delayed in wild type HBV-expressing livers. Moreover, the amount of hepatic total PC was also significantly decreased in wt HBV-expressing mice. These results suggest that infection of HBV alters the composition of PCs which may involve in HBV-mediated regeneration defects and liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052899911,"HIV-1 exploits multiple host proteins during infection. siRNA-based screenings have identified new proteins implicated in different pathways of the viral cycle that participate in a broad range of cellular functions. The human Mediator complex (MED) is composed of 28 elements and represents a fundamental component of the transcription machinery, interacting with the RNA polymerase II enzyme and regulating its ability to express genes. Here, we provide an evaluation of the MED activity on HIV replication. Knockdown of 9 out of 28 human MED proteins significantly impaired viral replication without affecting cell viability, including MED6, MED7, MED11, MED14, MED21, MED26, MED27, MED28, and MED30. Impairment of viral replication by MED subunits was at a post-integration step. Inhibition of early HIV transcripts was observed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of MED6, MED7, MED11, MED14, and MED28, specifically affecting the transcription of the nascent viral mRNA transactivation-responsive element. In addition, MED14 and MED30 were shown to have special relevance during the formation of unspliced viral transcripts (p < 0.0005). Knockdown of the selected MED factors compromised HIV transcription induced by Tat, with the strongest inhibitory effect shown by siMED6 and siMED14 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested physical interaction between MED14 and HIV-1 Tat protein.

Nimustine, a chloroethyl nitrosourea derivative, is used to treat various types of malignancy including gliomas. The present work focuses on the understanding of nimustine interaction with DNA to delineate its mechanism at molecular level. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) has been used to determine the binding sites of nimustine on DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to confirm conformational variations in DNA molecule upon nimustine-DNA interaction. Thermodynamic parameters of nimustine-DNA reaction have been calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Results of the present study demonstrate that nimustine is not a simple alkylating agent rather it causes major grove-directed-alkylation. Spectroscopic data suggest binding of nimustine with nitrogenous bases guanine (C6 = O6) and thymine (C4 = O4) in DNA major groove. CD spectra of nimustine-DNA complexes point toward the perturbation of native B-conformation of DNA and its partial transition into C-form. Thermodynamically, nimustine-DNA interaction is an entropy driven endothermic reaction, which suggests hydrophobic interaction of nimustine in DNA-major groove pocket. Spectral results suggest base binding and local conformational changes in DNA upon nimustine interaction. Investigation of drug-DNA interaction is an essential part of rational drug designing that also provides information about the drug's action at molecular level. Results, demonstrated here, may contribute in the development of new nitrosourea therapeutics with better efficacy and fewer side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2065597789,"Since MSX1 and PAX9 are linked to the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic tooth agenesis, we performed detailed mutational analysis of these two genes sampled from Japanese patients. We identified two novel MSX1 variants with an amino acid substitution within the homeodomain; Thr174Ile (T174I) from a sporadic hypodontia case and Leu205Arg (L205R) from a familial oligodontia case. Both the Thr174 and Leu205 residues in the MSX1 homeodomain are highly conserved among different species. To define possible roles of mutations at these amino acids in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic tooth agenesis, we performed several functional analyses. It has been demonstrated that MSX1 plays a pivotal role in hard tissue development as a suppressor for mesenchymal cell differentiation. To evaluate the suppression activity of the variants in mesenchymal cells, we used the myoD-promoter, which is one of convenient reporter assay system for MSX1. Although the gene products of these MSX1 variants are stable and capable of normal nuclear localization, they do not suppress myoD-promoter activity in differentiated C2C12 cells. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying our results, we performed further analyses including electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and co-immunoprecipitation assays to survey the molecular interactions between the mutant MSX1 proteins and the oligonucleotide DNA with MSX1 consensus binding motif or EZH2 methyltransferase. Since EZH2 is reported to interact with MSX1 and regulate MSX1 mediated gene suppression, we hypothesized that the T174I and L205R substitutions would impair this interaction. We conclude from the results of our experiments that the DNA binding ability of MSX1 is abolished by these two amino acid substitutions. This illustrates a causative role of the T174I and L205R MSX1 homeodomain mutations in tooth agenesis, and suggests that they may influence cell proliferation and differentiation resulting in lesser tooth germ formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2135396734,"SENSITIVE TO FREEZING 2 (SFR2) is classified as a family I glycosyl hydrolase but has recently been shown to have galactosyltransferase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. Natural occurrences of apparent glycosyl hydrolases acting as transferases are interesting from a biocatalysis standpoint, and knowledge about the interconversion can assist in engineering SFR2 in crop plants to resist freezing. To understand how SFR2 evolved into a transferase, the relationship between its structure and function are investigated by activity assay, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis. SFR2 has no detectable hydrolase activity, although its catalytic site is highly conserved with that of family 1 glycosyl hydrolases. Three regions disparate from glycosyl hydrolases are identified as required for transferase activity as follows: a loop insertion, the C-terminal peptide, and a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the catalytic site. Rationales for the effects of these regions on the SFR2 mechanism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2081647571,"In a clinical setting, acupuncture treatment consists of multiple components including somatosensory stimulation, treatment context, and attention to needle-based procedures. In order to dissociate somatosensory versus contextual and attentional aspects of acupuncture, we devised a novel form of placebo acupuncture, a visual manipulation dubbed phantom acupuncture, which reproduces the acupuncture needling ritual without somatosensory tactile stimulation. Subjects (N = 20) received both real (REAL) and phantom (PHNT) acupuncture. Subjects were retrospectively classified into two groups based on PHNT credibility (PHNTc, who found phantom acupuncture credible; and PHNTnc, who did not). Autonomic and psychophysical responses were monitored. We found that PHNT can be delivered in a credible manner. Acupuncture needling, a complex, ritualistic somatosensory intervention, induces sympathetic activation (phasic skin conductance [SC] response), which may be specific to the somatosensory component of acupuncture. In contrast, contextual effects, such as needling credibility, are instead associated with a shift toward relative cardiovagal activation (decreased heart rate) during needling and sympathetic inhibition (decreased SC) and parasympathetic activation (decreased pupil size) following acupuncture needling. Visual stimulation characterizing the needling ritual is an important factor for phasic autonomic responses to acupuncture and may undelie the needling orienting response. Our study suggests that phantom acupuncture can be a viable sham control for acupuncture as it completely excludes the somatosensory component of real needling while maintaining the credibility of the acupuncture treatment context in many subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2038041677,"Background Continuous support from follicular CD4+ T helper (Tfh) cells drives germinal center (GC) responses, which last for several weeks to produce high affinity memory B cells and plasma cells. In autoimmune Sle1 and NZB/W F1 mice, elevated numbers of Tfh cells persist, promoting the expansion of self-reactive B cells. Expansion of circulating Tfh like cells have also been described in several autoimmune diseases. Although, the signals required for Tfh differentiation have now been well described, the mechanisms that sustain the maintenance of fully differentiated Tfh are less understood. Recent data demonstrate a role for GC B cells for Tfh maintenance after protein immunization. Methods and Finding Given the pathogenic role Tfh play in autoimmune disease, we explored whether B cells are required for maintenance of autoreactive Tfh. Our data suggest that the number of mature autoreactive Tfh cells is controlled by GC B cells. Depletion of B cells in Sle1 autoimmune mice leads to a dramatic reduction in Tfh cells. In NZB/W F1 autoimmune mice, similar to the SRBC immunization model, GC B cells support the maintenance of mature Tfh, which is dependent mainly on ICOS. The CD28-associated pathway is dispensable for Tfh maintenance in SRBC immunized mice, but is required in the spontaneous NZB/W F1 model. Conclusion These data suggest that mature Tfh cells require signals from GC B cells to sustain their optimal numbers and function in both autoimmune and immunization models. Thus, immunotherapies targeting B cells in autoimmune disease may affect pathogenic Tfh cells."

https://openalex.org/W2051094821,"As nutritional status and inflammation are strongly connected, feeding and nutritional strategies could be effective to improve the ability of pigs to cope with disease. The aims of this study were to investigate the impact of a feed restriction on the ability of pigs to resist and be tolerant to a coinfection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) and the European H1N1 swine influenza virus, and the consequences for nutrient metabolism, with a focus on amino acids. Two groups of specific pathogen-free pigs were inoculated with Mhp and H1N1 21 days apart. One group was fed ad libitum, the other group was subjected to a two-week 40% feed restriction starting one week before H1N1 infection. The two respective mock control groups were included. Three days post-H1N1 infection, 200 g of feed was given to pigs previously fasted overnight and serial blood samples were taken over 4 hours to measure plasma nutrient concentrations. Throughout the study, clinical signs were observed and pathogens were detected in nasal swabs and lung tissues. Feed-restricted pigs presented shorter hyperthermia and a positive mean weight gain over the 3 days post-H1N1 infection whereas animals fed ad libitum lost weight. Both infection and feed restriction reduced postprandial glucose concentrations, indicating changes in glucose metabolism. Post-prandial plasma concentrations of the essential amino acids histidine, arginine and threonine were lower in co-infected pigs suggesting a greater use of those amino acids for metabolic purposes associated with the immune response. Altogether, these results indicate that modifying feeding practices could help to prepare animals to overcome an influenza infection. Connections with metabolism changes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2058620622,"Cofilin plays an essential role in cell migration and morphogenesis by enhancing actin filament dynamics via its actin filament-severing activity. Slingshot-1 (SSH1) is a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating actin dynamics by dephosphorylating and reactivating cofilin. In this study, we identified insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-4 as a novel SSH1-binding protein. Co-precipitation assays revealed the direct endogenous binding of IRS4 to SSH1. IRS4, but not IRS1 or IRS2, was bound to SSH1. IRS4 was bound to SSH1 mainly through the unique region (amino acids 335-400) adjacent to the C terminus of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of IRS4. The N-terminal A, B, and phosphatase domains of SSH1 were bound to IRS4 independently. Whereas in vitro phosphatase assays revealed that IRS4 does not directly affect the cofilin phosphatase activity of SSH1, knockdown of IRS4 increased cofilin phosphorylation in cultured cells. Knockdown of IRS4 decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, and treatment with an inhibitor of PI3K increased cofilin phosphorylation. Akt preferentially phosphorylated SSH1 at Thr-826, but expression of a non-phosphorylatable T826A mutant of SSH1 did not affect insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation, and an inhibitor of Akt did not increase cofilin phosphorylation. These results suggest that IRS4 promotes cofilin dephosphorylation through sequential activation of PI3K and SSH1 but not through Akt. In addition, IRS4 co-localized with SSH1 in F-actin-rich membrane protrusions in insulin-stimulated cells, which suggests that the association of IRS4 with SSH1 contributes to localized activation of cofilin in membrane protrusions."
https://openalex.org/W2009887276,"Tight regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical for vertebrate development and tissue maintenance, and deregulation can lead to a host of disease phenotypes, including developmental disorders and cancer. Proteins associated with primary cilia and centrosomes have been demonstrated to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signaling in interphase cells. The plant homeodomain zinc finger protein Jade-1 can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase-targeting β-catenin for proteasomal degradation and concentrates at the centrosome and ciliary basal body in addition to the nucleus in interphase cells. We demonstrate that the destruction complex component casein kinase 1α (CK1α) phosphorylates Jade-1 at a conserved SLS motif and reduces the ability of Jade-1 to inhibit β-catenin signaling. Consistently, Jade-1 lacking the SLS motif is more effective than wild-type Jade-1 in reducing β-catenin-induced secondary axis formation in Xenopus laevis embryos in vivo. Interestingly, CK1α also phosphorylates β-catenin and the destruction complex component adenomatous polyposis coli at a similar SLS motif to the effect that β-catenin is targeted for degradation. The opposing effect of Jade-1 phosphorylation by CK1α suggests a novel example of the dual functions of CK1α activity to either oppose or promote canonical Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner."

In this work, water precipitation process for the manufacturing of Xueshuantong injection, a botanical injection made from Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, was optimized using a design space approach as a sample. Saponin recovery and total saponin purity (TSP) in supernatant were identified as the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of water precipitation using a risk assessment for all the processes of Xueshuantong injection. An Ishikawa diagram and experiments of fractional factorial design were applied to determine critical process parameters (CPPs). Dry matter content of concentrated extract (DMCC), amount of water added (AWA), and stirring speed (SS) were identified as CPPs. Box-Behnken designed experiments were carried out to develop models between CPPs and process CQAs. Determination coefficients were higher than 0.86 for all the models. High TSP in supernatant can be obtained when DMCC is low and SS is high. Saponin recoveries decreased as DMCC increased. Incomplete collection of supernatant was the main reason for the loss of saponins. Design space was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation method with acceptable probability of 0.90. Recommended normal operation region are located in DMCC of 0.38–0.41 g/g, AWA of 3.7–4.9 g/g, and SS of 280–350 rpm, with a probability more than 0.919 to attain CQA criteria. Verification experiment results showed that operating DMCC, SS, and AWA within design space can attain CQA criteria with high probability."

The hyaluronate lyase (Hyl) presented on the surface of S. pneumoniae performs this role. Using glycan microarray screening, affinity electrophoresis, and isothermal titration calorimetry we show that the N-terminal module of Hyl is a hyaluronan-specific carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and the founding member of CBM family 70. The 1.2 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of CBM70 revealed it to have a β-sandwich fold, similar to other CBMs. The electrostatic properties of the binding site, which was identified by site-directed mutagenesis, are distinct from other CBMs and complementary to its acidic ligand, hyaluronan. Dynamic light scattering and solution small angle x-ray scattering revealed the full-length Hyl protein to exist as a monomer/dimer mixture in solution. Through a detailed analysis of the small angle x-ray scattering data, we report the pseudoatomic solution structures of the monomer and dimer forms of the full-length multimodular Hyl."

The dramatic environmental changes shape their physiological features, e.g. visual sensitivity, olfactory ability, and salinity tolerance. Anguilla marmorata, a catadromous eel, migrates upstream on dark nights, following the lunar cycle. Such behavior may be correlated with ontogenetic changes in sensory systems. Therefore, this study was designed to identify changes in spectral sensitivity and opsin gene expression of A. marmorata during upstream migration. Microspectrophotometry analysis revealed that the tropical eel possesses a duplex retina with rod and cone photoreceptors. The λmax of rod cells are 493, 489, and 489 nm in glass, yellow, and wild eels, while those of cone cells are 508, and 517 nm in yellow, and wild eels, respectively. Unlike European and American eels, Asian eels exhibited a blue-shifted pattern of rod photoreceptors during upstream migration. Quantitative gene expression analyses of four cloned opsin genes (Rh1f, Rh1d, Rh2, and SWS2) revealed that Rh1f expression is dominant at all three stages, while Rh1d is expressed only in older yellow eel. Furthermore, sequence comparison and protein modeling studies implied that a blue shift in Rh1d opsin may be induced by two known (N83, S292) and four putative (S124, V189, V286, I290) tuning sites adjacent to the retinal binding sites. Finally, expression of blue-shifted Rh1d opsin resulted in a spectral shift in rod photoreceptors. Our observations indicate that the giant mottled eel is color-blind, and its blue-shifted scotopic vision may influence its upstream migration behavior and habitat choice."
https://openalex.org/W2318460063,"Objective To investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) on barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells. Materials and Methods After pre-incubation with CORM-2 for 1 hour, cultured intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells were stimulated with 50 µg/ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Cytokines levels in culture medium were detected using ELISA kits. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) of IEC-6 cell monolayers in Transwells were measured with a Millipore electric resistance system (ERS-2; Millipore) and calculated as Ω/cm2 at different time points after LPS treatment. The permeability changes were also measured using FITC-dextran. The levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and ZO-1) and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation were detected using Western blotting with specific antibodies. The subsequent structural changes of TJ were visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results CORM-2 significantly reduced LPS-induced secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β. The LPS-induced decrease of TER and increase of permeability to FITC-dextran were inhibited by CORM-2 in a concentration dependent manner (P<0.05). LPS-induced reduction of tight junction proteins and increase of MLC phosphorylation were also attenuated. In LPS-treated cells, TEM showed diminished electron-dense material and interruption of TJ and desmosomes between the apical lateral margins of adjoining cells, which were prevented by CORM-2 treatment. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that CORM-2, as a novel CO-releasing molecule, has ability to protect the barrier function of LPS-stimulated intestinal epithelial cells. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokines release, restoration of TJ proteins and suppression of MLC phosphorylation are among the protective effects of CORM-2."

The objectives of the present study were to investigate the potential roles of testosterone in the innate immune responses and splenic lymphocyte proliferation in fresh water snake, Natrix piscator. Animals were mildly anesthetized and spleens were taken out to study the splenic macrophage phagocytosis, super oxide production and nitrite release using in vitro testosterone. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and were studied for mitogen induced proliferation in presence of in vitro testosterone. Testosterone suppressed the phagocytosis and nitrite release in a concentration dependent manner. Biphasic suppressive effect of testosterone was observed in superoxide production as judged by reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium salt where salt reduction was suppressed at lower and higher concentrations of testosterone. Mitogen induced splenic lymphocyte proliferation was also suppressed by testosterone. By suppressing immune responses, testosterone may, therefore, act as a physiological mechanism regulating the relative amount of energy invested into either reproductive effort or immunocompetence."

This deamination generates an in-frame premature stop codon that results in the production of apoB-48, the short isoform of apoB. The full-length (apoB-100) and short (apoB-48) isoforms of apoB are lipoproteins that mediate lipid transfer through the bloodstream. In many mammals, including humans, apoB is expressed in the small intestine and liver, whereas APOBEC1 is expressed only in the small intestine. However, in mice, APOBEC1 is expressed in both the small intestine and liver, and the level of high density lipoprotein, which is inversely associated with the development of coronary disease, is higher in mice than in humans (1.Greeve J.

Similarly, aberrant APOBEC1-driven editing of the mRNA encoding neurofibromin 1 may promote the formation of neurofibromatous tumors (15.Cappione A.J. French B.L. Skuse G.R. A potential role for NF1 mRNA editing in the pathogenesis of NF1 tumors.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Greeve et al. (8.Greeve J. Lellek H. Apostel F. Hundoegger K. Barialai A. Kirsten R. Welker S. Greten H. Absence of APOBEC-1 mediated mRNA editing in human carcinomas.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6357-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have suggested that most types of carcinoma, including hepatocellular carcinoma, are not associated with aberrant editing of the mRNAs encoding APOB, novel APOBEC1 target 1, or neurofibromin 1. However, more recently, APOBEC1-driven mRNA editing has been shown to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma (9.Valdmanis P.N. Roy-Chaudhuri B. Kim H.K. Sayles L.C. Zheng Y. Chuang C.H. Caswell D.R. Chu K. Zhang Y. Winslow M.M. Sweet-Cordero E.A. Kay M.A. Upregulation of the microRNA cluster at the Dlk1-Dio3 locus in lung adenocarcinoma.Oncogene. 2013; (10.1038/onc.2013.523)PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the role of aberrant APOBEC1-driven mRNA editing in tumorigenesis requires further clarification. In addition to its role in APOB mRNA editing, APOBEC1 can stabilize mRNAs that have one or more AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-UTR (16.Anant S. Davidson N.O. An AU-rich sequence element (UUUN[A/U]U) downstream of the edited C in apolipoprotein B mRNA is a high-affinity binding site for Apobec-1: binding of Apobec-1 to this motif in the 3′ untranslated region of c-Myc increases mRNA stability.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1982-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and can deaminate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethyluracil, which is one of several steps in the demethylation process of methylated DNA (17.Guo J.U. Su Y. Zhong C. Ming G.L. Song H. Hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET1 promotes active DNA demethylation in the adult brain.Cell. 2011; 145: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Because APOBEC1 can bind RNA, in this study, FLAG-tagged APOBEC1 (FL-A1) was expressed in the HuH7.5 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and used to co-immunoprecipitate its target RNAs, which were identified via a microarray analysis. The mRNA encoding interleukin-8 (IL8) was identified as a direct binding target of APOBEC1. Recombinant APOBEC1 is known to interact directly with some synthetic mRNAs, such as MYC, COX2, and IL8 (16.Anant S. Davidson N.O. An AU-rich sequence element (UUUN[A/U]U) downstream of the edited C in apolipoprotein B mRNA is a high-affinity binding site for Apobec-1: binding of Apobec-1 to this motif in the 3′ untranslated region of c-Myc increases mRNA stability.Mol.

Apobec-1 protects intestine from radiation injury through posttranscriptional regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression.Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1139-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); hence, the association of APOBEC1 with the IL8 mRNA observed here was somewhat predictable. Given the relatively high level of MYC expression in HuH7.5 cells, the association between MYC mRNA and FL-A1 was weak. Moreover, FL-A1 did not associate with IL8 mRNA in any of the other cell types examined. Further exploration of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between APOBEC1 and IL8 mRNA revealed that another factor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q isoform 6 (hnRNPQ6), enhanced this interaction. HuH7.5, HuH7, HuH6, PH5CH, and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. HuS cells were cultured as described previously (19.Aly H.H. Watashi K. Hijikata M. Kaneko H. Takada Y. Egawa H. Uemoto S. Shimotohno K. Serum-derived hepatitis C virus infectivity in interferon regulatory factor-7-suppressed human primary hepatocytes.J. Hepatol. 2007; 46: 26-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Human APOBEC1 was cloned into the EcoRI-NotI site of the pCAG-FLAG or pCAG-Myc vector. Human hnRNPQ6 was cloned into the BamHI-NotI site of the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. The plasmids were constructed using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech). The GAPDH, IL8, and MYC sequences were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The resulting plasmids were used as standards for absolute quantification. The pCAG-FLAG-APOBEC1, pCAG-Myc-APOBEC1, and pcDNA3-FLAG-hnRNPQ6 plasmids were transfected into cells using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio). All of the experiments were based on the transient transfection system. As negative controls, cells were transfected with the empty pCAG-FLAG, pCAG-Myc, or pcDNA3-FLAG vector. The RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract RNA. Complementary DNA was prepared by incubating the RNA samples with SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (for whole cell RNA samples) or random primers (for RNA samples collected from immunoprecipitates). The 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used for all quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses.

Cell lysates were incubated with IgG rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), or an anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was then added, and the immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were used for RNA extraction. Western blots were probed with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-Myc antibody (Sigma), anti-apoB antibody (Biodesign International), anti-ACF antibody (Abnova), or anti-actin antibody (AC-40; Sigma). Detection was carried out using ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare). The pGL4.10 and pGL4.75 vectors (Promega) were used for analyses of the 3′-UTR of the IL8 mRNA. Briefly, the CMV promoter from pGL4.75 (BspMI-HindIII) was inserted into pGL4.10 to construct pLuc2/CMV-SV40 poly(A). The SV40 poly(A) sequence was then substituted with the 3′-UTR of the IL8 mRNA to generate pLuc2-IL8. The deletion mutants were generated from the wild-type construct using the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo). The pGL4.74[hRluc/TK] construct (Promega) was used as an internal control. The constructs were transfected into cells using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio). Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used to co-transfect the cells with siRNAs. The mixtures of constructs and/or siRNAs and reagents were plated before the addition of the cells (reverse transfection method). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 100 µl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the samples were processed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The firefly and Renilla luciferase signals were determined using a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). To control for off-target effects of the expression plasmids or the transfection procedure, the firefly luciferase signal was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. A chemiluminescent ELISA system (Thermo Scientific) was used to measure IL8 levels in the culture medium, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells with the On-TARGET plus human A1CF (ACF) or human SYNCRIP (hnRNPQ) siRNAs (Thermo Scientific). Complementary DNA was amplified using PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the first round PCR primers were as follows: forward, ATGGCTACAGAACATGTTAATGG; reverse CATTGTAACAGGTCAGGACCG. The sequences of the second round PCR primers were as follows: forward, ATCCTGATCCTGAGGTTATGG; reverse, CATTGTAACAGGTCAGGACCG. As a control, the qPCR primers described above were used to detect GAPDH. HuH7.5, HuH6, PH5CH, HuS, and HEK293 cells were seeded 16 h prior to transfection with the FL-A1 plasmid. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in RIPA buffer. Each lysate was divided into two fractions, one of which was reacted with control IgG and the other with an anti-FLAG antibody. RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates and subjected to microarray analysis using the Human Oligo chip 25k (Toray Industries). Human brain cDNA was used as prey and APOBEC1 was used as the bait. Previous biochemical analyses showed that recombinant APOBEC1 binds to synthetic 3′-UTRs derived from the MYC and IL8 mRNAs (16.Anant S. Davidson N.O. An AU-rich sequence element (UUUN[A/U]U) downstream of the edited C in apolipoprotein B mRNA is a high-affinity binding site for Apobec-1: binding of Apobec-1 to this motif in the 3′ untranslated region of c-Myc increases mRNA stability.Mol.

To identify additional mRNAs that bind to APOBEC1 in the presence of other cellular proteins, extracts from HuH7.5 cells transiently expressing FL-A1 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody or IgG as a control and then analyzed using DNA microarrays. For 2,786 of the 25,000 genes examined, the signal intensity in the FL-A1 co-precipitate was significantly higher than that in the IgG co-precipitate, which was set to 1. Of these 2,786 RNAs, 68 had signal ratios (FL-A1/IgG) higher than that of the APOB mRNA (6.01), a known RNA target of APOBEC1 (supplemental Table S1). Among these 68 RNAs, which included 65 mRNAs, 1 noncoding RNA, and 2 processed pseudogene transcripts, 94% represented mRNAs with at least one core ARE sequence (AUUUA) in the 3′-UTR, and 30% were related to inflammatory responses, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signaling. The IL8 mRNA exhibited the highest signal ratio (58.31) among all transcripts examined, but the signal ratio of the MYC mRNA (1.04) was not elevated significantly, despite its robust expression in HuH7.5 cells (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1A). Taken together, these findings indicate that APOBEC1 binds preferentially to IL8 mRNA in HuH7.5 cells. Next, qPCR analyses were performed to validate the microarray results. In the microarray analysis, the expression level of the GAPDH mRNA in the FL-A1 co-precipitate was not significantly higher than that in the IgG co-precipitate (supplemental Table S1); therefore, GAPDH and APOB were used as negative and positive qPCR controls, respectively. For each transcript examined, the mRNA level in the FL-A1 co-precipitate was normalized to that in the control IgG co-precipitate. In agreement with the microarray data, the relative IL8 mRNA level in the FL-A1 co-precipitate was much higher than that of any other mRNA examined (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the relative MYC mRNA level in the FL-A1 co-precipitate was lower than that of the IL8 mRNA, although MYC was expressed at a much higher level than IL8 in HuH7.5 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The expression levels of the CXCL1 and CXCL5 mRNAs, which encode cytokines and were among the 68 RNAs with the highest microarray signal ratios (supplemental Table S1), were also examined by qPCR. In these experiments, IL18 mRNA was selected as a negative control to represent cytokine-encoding mRNAs. The relative CXCL1 and CXCL5 mRNA levels in the FL-A1 co-precipitate were higher than that of IL18 mRNA (Fig. 1B). Overall, the results of the qPCR analyses validated the microarray data and confirmed that APOBEC1 associates preferentially with IL8 mRNA in HuH7.5 cells. To determine whether it associates preferentially with IL8 mRNA in other cell types, APOBEC1 (FL-A1) was transiently expressed in HuH6 (a human hepatoblastoma-derived line), PH5CH (human non-neoplastic-derived hepatocytes), HuS (human immortalized hepatocytes) (19.Aly H.H. Watashi K. Hijikata M. Kaneko H. Takada Y. Egawa H. Uemoto S. Shimotohno K. Serum-derived hepatitis C virus infectivity in interferon regulatory factor-7-suppressed human primary hepatocytes.J. Hepatol. 2007; 46: 26-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and HEK293 cells. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody or IgG as a control and then analyzed using DNA microarrays. The interaction between FL-A1 and IL8 mRNA was much stronger in HuH7.5 cells than in HuH6, PH5CH, or HuS cells (supplemental Table S1). Notably, the level of the IL8 mRNA was below the limit of detection in HEK293 cells (supplemental Table S1). These results were confirmed by RT-qPCR analyses of the cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Similar qPCR experiments were also performed in the HuH7 cell line, which is the parental cell line of HuH7.5. A similar level of binding of APOBEC1 to IL8 mRNA to that observed in HuH7.5 cells was also observed in HuH7 cells (Fig. 1C). Recombinant APOBEC1 produced in Escherichia coli binds to the 3′-UTR of synthetic MYC mRNA, and overexpression of APOBEC1 stabilizes the MYC mRNA in mouse cells (16.Anant S. Davidson N.O. An AU-rich sequence element (UUUN[A/U]U) downstream of the edited C in apolipoprotein B mRNA is a high-affinity binding site for Apobec-1: binding of Apobec-1 to this motif in the 3′ untranslated region of c-Myc increases mRNA stability.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1982-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether the association between APOBEC1 and IL8 mRNA in intact cells leads to increased IL8 production, the effect of overexpression of FL-A1 on IL8 mRNA levels in HuH7.5 cells was examined. Transfection of the cells with an expression plasmid harboring FL-A1 increased the endogenous IL8 mRNA level significantly but had no effect on the mRNA level of APOB, a well known target of APOBEC1, or the levels of the IL18, CXCL1, and CXCL5 mRNAs (Fig. 2A). However, overexpression of FL-A1 enhanced the production of apoB-48 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the FLAG-tagged protein retained the editing ability of native APOBEC1. Notably, IL8 was more abundant in the culture medium of cells overexpressing FL-A1 than in that of the control cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the increased production of IL8 protein and mRNA mediated by overexpression of APOBEC1 was due to an effect at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, control or FL-A1-expressing HuH7.5 cells were treated with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D for 0–6 h and then analyzed by qRT-PCR. Degradation of the IL8 mRNA was delayed in cells that overexpressed FL-A1, whereas degradation of the GAPDH mRNA was not affected (Fig. 2D). This result suggests that binding of FL-A1 extends the half-life of IL8 mRNA, leading to increased IL8 production. Recombinant APOBEC1 binds to the synthetic full-length 3′-UTR of the IL8 mRNA (18.Anant S. Murmu N. Houchen C.W. Mukhopadhyay D. Riehl T.E. Young S.G. Morrison A.R. Stenson W.F. Davidson N.O. Apobec-1 protects intestine from radiation injury through posttranscriptional regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression.Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1139-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but it is unclear which part of the IL8 3′UTR is important for this interaction and whether APOBEC1 increases IL8 production via binding to this region of the mRNA. To investigate these issues, HuH7.5 cells were co-transfected with an empty or FL-A1-harboring expression plasmid and a reporter plasmid containing the full-length IL8 3′-UTR downstream of a luciferase coding sequence (pLuc-IL8) (Fig. 2E). Luciferase activity was higher in the FL-A1-expressing cells than the control cells (Fig. 2F). Next, a reporter plasmid containing only a part of the IL8 3′-UTR (nucleotides 513–854) (del 1) was constructed. This region contains two types of cis-elements, namely a cluster of AREs and a downstream (DST) element (20.Ravet K. Reyt G. Arnaud N. Krouk G. Djouani E.B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Iron and ROS control of the DownSTream mRNA decay pathway is essential for plant fitness.EMBO J. 2011; 31: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether one or both of these cis-element types are responsible for FL-A1-mediated regulation of IL8 expression, the following regions of the IL8 3′-UTR were removed from the del 1 luciferase reporter construct: (i) nucleotides 513–705 (del 2), containing a cluster of AREs; (ii) nucleotides 713–774 (del 3), containing part of the DST element; and (iii) nucleotides 650–673 (del 4), containing all of the AREs in the IL8 3′-UTR (Fig. 2E). Disruption of the DST element (del 3) did not affect the FL-A1-dependent increase in luciferase activity, but deletion of the AREs (del 2 and del 4) abolished this increase (Fig. 2F). Therefore, the cluster of AREs in the IL8 3′-UTR may be responsible for APOBEC1-dependent increases in IL8 production. In mouse enterocytes, APOBEC1 converts C to U at specific sites in the 3′-UTRs of various mRNAs (21.Rosenberg B.R. Hamilton C.E. Mwangi M.M. Dewell S. Papavasiliou F.N. Transcriptome-wide sequencing reveals numerous APOBEC1 mRNA-editing targets in transcript 3′ UTRs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); therefore, the ability of APOBEC1 to extend the half-life of the IL8 mRNA may be related to its editing role. To examine this possibility, the full-length sequence of the IL8 mRNA (1522 nucleotides), including the 300-nucleotide coding region and excluding the 5′ noncoding region and the 28 bp immediately upstream of the poly(A) attachment site, was scanned for mutations in control and FL-A1-expressing HuH7.5 cells (Fig. 3). The nucleotide sequences of each of the 50 independent clones of IL8 mRNA from the control cells and FL-A1-expressing cells were determined. No C to U mutations in the IL8 mRNA were identified in the control cells, whereas 19 FL-A1-expressing clones had C to U mutations that were scattered mainly throughout the 3′-UTR of IL8 (Fig. 3), although some synonymous C to U mutations were also found in the coding region of IL8. Of these 19 clones, two had both C to U conversions and other mutations (1-bp deletion (A), U to G mutation, and A to U mutation). In addition, two control clones and one FL-A1-expressing clone had other mutations only (control: 17-bp deletion or 1-bp (U) insertion in the 3′-UTR; FL-A1-expressing: 11-bp deletion in the 3′-UTR). Overall, these data suggest that APOBEC1 expression is involved in the generation of C to U mutations in IL8 mRNA. Given that the C to U mutation"

Prion diseases are transmissible fatal neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system that occur in animals and humans and are caused by unconventional agents termed prions. A hallmark of acquired prion diseases is a prolonged asymptomatic phase followed by the appearance of neurological signs, neuropathological changes, and the accumulation of a misfolded pathogenic isoform (PrPSc) 2The abbreviations used are: PrPScprion protein scrapie isoformPrPCcellular prion proteinPrPresprotease-resistant prion proteinPrPprion proteinBSEbovine spongiform encephalopathyCJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseasevCJDvariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseasePMCAprotein misfolding cyclic amplificationsPMCAserial PMCATSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathysCJDsporadic CJDPKproteinase KBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) in the central nervous system (1.Prusiner S.B.

Prion diseases can be transmitted within and between species, but crossing a so-called “species barrier” often results in prolonged incubation periods (2.Hill A.F. Collinge J. Prion strains and species barriers.Contrib. Microbiol. 2004; 11: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is only after adaptation of the agent to the new host that the incubation period shortens and the disease phenotype stabilizes. This species barrier effect is thought to be determined at least in part by prion protein sequence homology between the species involved (3.Moore R.A. Vorberg I. Priola S.A.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is the prototypic acquired prion disease of cattle, first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom (4.Wells G.A. Scott A.C. Johnson C.T. Gunning R.F.

The appearance of a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)) in the United Kingdom during the following decade was strongly suspected to result from dietary exposure of the human population to the BSE agent (6.Will R.G.

All cases of definite clinical vCJD are of one prion protein genotypic group (PRNP codon 129 MM). BSE is the only known zoonotic animal prion disease (5.Hope J. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: a tipping point in one health and food safety.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2013; 366: 37-47PubMed Google Scholar). Scrapie is the most intensively researched animal prion disease. It is endemic in sheep in many countries, including the United Kingdom. Scrapie prion strain diversity can be inferred from differences in incubation period, in PrPSc profile and distribution, and in vacuolar lesions in the brain (11.González L. Jeffrey M. Dagleish M.P. Goldmann W. Sisó S. Eaton S.L. Martin S. Finlayson J. Stewart P. Steele P. Pang Y. Hamilton S. Reid H.W. Chianini F. Susceptibility to scrapie and disease phenotype in sheep: cross-PRNP genotype experimental transmissions with natural sources.Vet. Res. 2012; 43: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Scrapie susceptibility and incubation period are largely determined by polymorphic variation in the sheep prion protein gene (Prnp) with those at 136, 154, and 171 and the VRQ, ARQ, and ARR alleles having the greatest effect (12.Hunter N.

Susceptibility to experimental BSE is associated with the ARQ/ARQ genotype, but BSE in VRQ/VRQ sheep can likewise be obtained (28.Bellworthy S.J. Dexter G. Stack M. Chaplin M. Hawkins S.A.

Comparative titration of experimental ovine BSE infectivity in sheep and mice.J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Discriminatory tests for sheep BSE based on differences in molecular profile were shown to remain effective after three serial experimental passages of the BSE agent in ARQ/ARQ sheep, but there was an indication of a shift in the biochemical properties of PrPres during these passages away from that associated with BSE (27.Stack M. González L. Jeffrey M. Martin S. Macaldowie C. Chaplin M. Thorne J. Sayers R. Davis L. Bramwell J. Grimmer S. Bellworthy S. Three serial passages of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in sheep do not significantly affect discriminatory test results.J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that adaptation of the BSE agent to an ovine host involves a change in the molecular properties of the BSE prions and that this change may have occurred prior to the introduction of statutory testing. In this scenario, sheep BSE in the field may have become indistinguishable from scrapie, but it may have retained its pathogenicity for humans. PrP misfolding and prion replication can be mimicked in cell-free PrP conversion assays such as protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (32.Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C.

Virol. 2014; 88: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results from these studies suggest that species, strain, and genotypic barriers to prion disease can be modeled in vitro. We have modeled serial passage of the BSE agent in sheep by conducting serial PMCA (sPMCA) using sheep BSE brain homogenates to seed ovine brain substrate of three Prnp genotypes and then testing whether this in vitro adaptation process results in changes in the potential of sheep BSE to convert human PrPC in a further PMCA reaction. Human tissues were obtained from the CJD Brain and Tissue Bank, which is part of the Medical Research Council Edinburgh Brain Banks. Tissues were collected with consent for research use. Ethical approval for the use of the human tissues in this study was covered by LREC 2000/4/157 (Professor James Ironside). All studies, including experimental inoculations, care of animals, and euthanasia, were carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Sheep were obtained from one of two facilities. Experiments performed at the Moredun Research Institute were carried out under licenses from the United Kingdom Government Home Office number 60/2656 (renewed in 2005 with number 60/3646). The remaining sheep were obtained from experiments carried out at the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service facilities at High Mowthorpe under project license number 70/5155. Animals were monitored daily for the presence of neurological signs compatible with TSE and were euthanized once those signs reached a predetermined end point, when showing signs of intercurrent disease unresponsive to treatment, or for welfare reasons. In all cases, euthanasia was performed by intravenous injection of barbiturate overdose followed by exsanguination. Nine samples of ovine brain tissue of the three major scrapie-susceptible or -resistant variants, differing in their Prnp polymorphism at codons 136, 154, and 171 (both PBS-perfused or non-perfused; two VRQ/VRQ, three ARQ/ARQ, and four ARR/ARR) were obtained from a scrapie-free flock (ARSU flock) at the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge, UK). The bovine (BSE-negative) sample came from cow with limited or no exposure to BSE reared under controlled conditions, and the tissues were provided by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency TSE Archive (Weybridge, UK). All brain tissues were stored at −80 °C immediately after animals were sacrificed. The disease status of these animals was confirmed at source by prion protein immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Brain stem samples from five sheep experimentally infected with BSE (homozygous VRQ/VRQ, ARQ/ARQ, and ARR/ARR BSE-infected sheep), the scrapie-infected sheep, and the BSE-infected cattle brain tissues were produced or collected by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Lasswade and Weybridge, UK). The BSE-positive cow was a field suspect that had been identified through passive surveillance, and the tissues were provided by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency TSE Archive. The disease status of the animals was confirmed at source by prion protein immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Prnp genotyping of the sheep involved in this study was performed on blood samples by PCR amplification and sequencing of the whole open reading frame of the Prnp gene on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer with the BigDye® terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). All tissues were handled exclusively in the category 3* biosafety containment facility according to stringent health and safety protocols. Human brain tissues (frontal cortex) were sampled from a frozen half-brain collected at autopsy with the appropriate consent for tissue retention and research use. The vCJD specimen was from a patient (PRNP codon 129 MM) with definite variant CJD diagnosis as defined by established criteria. The sCJD sample was from a patient with a diagnosis of sporadic CJD (VV2 subtype). The non-CJD human brain specimens used for PMCA substrate preparation were from frontal cortex from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (PRNP codon 129 MM) and dementia with Lewy bodies (PRNP codon 129 VV), and their use as PMCA substrates has been described previously (39.Barria M.A. Balachandran A. Morita M. Kitamoto T. Barron R. Manson J. Knight R. Ironside J.W. Head M.W. Molecular barriers to zoonotic transmission of prions.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2014; 20: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bovine, ovine, and human tissue homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared by manual homogenization of brain tissues using glass grinders (Fisher Scientific Ltd.) in PMCA conversion buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). A non-ionic detergent-insoluble nucleocytoskeletal fraction was cleared by centrifugation at 424 × g for 40 s. The supernatants were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use as PMCA substrate. EDTA (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to all brain homogenate substrates at a final concentration of 5 mm prior to conducting the PMCA reaction. When human tissue was used as substrate, heparin (LKT Laboratories) (10.Yokoyama T. Takeuchi A. Yamamoto M. Kitamoto T. Ironside J.W. Morita M. Heparin enhances the cell-protein misfolding cyclic amplification efficiency of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Neurosci. Lett. 2011; 498: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was added to the samples at a final concentration 1 mm. Substrates were seeded at 4 °C with a dilution of brain homogenate (previously titrated by Western blotting) such that the seed material contained sufficient PrPres to be detectable at the lower end of the linear range of a standard Western blot. A negative control aliquot not subjected to PMCA (20 µl) was immediately frozen at −80 °C, and the remainder (sample of 100 µl) was subjected to PMCA using a Misonix model 4000 sonicator. A single round of PMCA comprised 96 cycles of 20-s sonication at 80% total power output and a 29-min 40-s incubation at 37 °C. When serial PMCA reactions were performed, each new round was seeded at a 1:10 dilution with the product of the previous PMCA round (i.e. a 10-fold dilution of the PMCA product in fresh brain homogenate substrate). An aliquot of each sPMCA reaction product was retained for a use as a seed for human brain tissue substrate in phase III of the study. Equal volumes of PMCA products and their corresponding negative controls were digested using proteinase K (PK; Novagen®, EMD Millipore) at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the samples were then collected by centrifugation at 20,817 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were then resuspended in PMCA conversion buffer, and an equal volume of 4× NuPAGE® lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to each sample aliquot to a final concentration 1×. The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies 6H4 (IgG1; recognizing ovine PrP amino acids 148–155; Prionics), 12B2 (IgG1; recognizing ovine PrP amino acids 89–107) (41.Langeveld J.P. Jacobs J.G. Erkens J.H. Bossers A. van Zijderveld F.G. van Keulen L.J. Rapid and discriminatory diagnosis of scrapie and BSE in retro-pharyngeal lymph nodes of sheep.BMC Vet. Res. 2006; 2: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and 3F4 (IgG2a; recognizing human PrP amino acids 106–112; EMD Millipore). Samples were boiled at 100 °C for 10 min and loaded onto a NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and subjected to electrophoresis for 50 min at 200 V using preset gel cassettes (Invitrogen) and NuPAGE MES-SDS 1× running buffer (Invitrogen). A BenchMark prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) and a MagicMarkTM XP Western protein standard (Invitrogen) were run alongside the samples. The gels were then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Hybond-P, GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 30 V using 1× transfer buffer consisting of 4% 20× NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen), 16% MeOH, 80% distilled H2O. For immunodetection, the PVDF membrane was blocked with a solution of 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in TBS-T (200 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (polyoxyethelenesorbitan monolaurate, Fisher Scientific Ltd.) for 60 min. Then the PVDF membrane was incubated with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 6H4, 12B2, or 3F4 in TBS-T for 60 min and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) antibody for 60 min. The membranes were developed using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) and imaged using the ChemiDocTM XRS+ System (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. The difference in sheep BSE PrPres amplification efficiency in ovine substrates of different genotype was analyzed from three independent identical experiments. Serial PMCA products were analyzed by Western blot, and densitometry of the appropriate bands was performed using a volume tool of the XRS+ System Image LabTM 2.0 software. The background signal values of individual blots were subtracted before data were analyzed and portrayed using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 software. The total protein concentration of the brain homogenates was obtained using DCTM Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blot using anti-PrP primary antibody 6H4. The PrPC concentration was then obtained by densitometry using a known amount of recombinant PrPC run on the same blot. In experiments designed to normalize PrPC levels in sheep brain homogenates to be used as PMCA substrates, equivalent volumes of 10% brain homogenates were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-PrP primary antibody 6H4, the PrPC signal was quantitated by densitometry, and the dilution factors to reach equivalence were calculated. Ovine brain homogenates of equal PrPC amount (20 µg) were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min and then incubated with 500 units/µl peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F kit, New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deglycosylated proteins were precipitated using 4 volumes of ice-cold 80% MeOH and collected by centrifugation at 18,787 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Novex®, Invitrogen) and NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sampling buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the study. Phase I established the PMCA conditions that resulted in efficient amplification of cattle PrPres in normal cattle brain substrate and in normal ovine brain substrates of the VRQ/VRQ, ARQ/ARQ, and ARR/ARR genotypes. Phase II tested whether the BSE-like molecular signature of ovine BSE PrPres was stable when serially amplified in ovine substrates or whether there was a shift toward a scrapie-like molecular signature. Classical scrapie brain homogenates from VRQ/VRQ and ARQ/ARQ sheep were used to seed all three ovine polymorphic groups, providing a positive control for amplification and PrPres-type conservation. Phase III determined whether any molecular switch from a BSE-like to a scrapie-like molecular signature altered the ability of the sheep-adapted BSE PrPres to convert PrPC in human brain substrates. In this phase, the sPMCA products from rounds 1 and 8 produced in phase II were used to seed human brain substrates of the PRNP codon 129 MM and VV genotypes and subjected to a single round of PMCA. The PMCA products were then analyzed by Western blot after PK treatment using the anti-PrP mAb 3F4 (which detects human but not ovine or bovine PrP). Sheep BSE brain homogenates and positive control brain homogenates of cattle BSE and classical sheep scrapie gave the expected protein banding pattern corresponding to the three glycoforms of PrPres on Western blot analysis. The diglycosylated form of the protein (top band) exhibited the strongest signal followed by the mono- (middle band) and n"

The amyloidogenic protein human β2-microglobulin (hβ2m) can co-polymerize with its N-terminally truncated variant (ΔN6) in vitro to form hetero-polymeric fibrils that differ from their homo-polymeric counterparts. Discrimination between the different assembly precursors, for example by binding of a biomolecule to one species in a mixture of conformers, offers an opportunity to alter the course of co-assembly and the properties of the fibrils formed. Here, using hβ2m and its amyloidogenic counterpart, ΔΝ6, we describe selection of a 2′F-modified RNA aptamer able to distinguish between these very similar proteins. SELEX with a N30 RNA pool yielded an aptamer (B6) that binds hβ2m with an EC50 of ∼200 nm. NMR spectroscopy was used to assign the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the B6-hβ2m complex, revealing that the aptamer binds to the face of hβ2m containing the A, B, E, and D β-strands. In contrast, binding of B6 to ΔN6 is weak and less specific. Kinetic analysis of the effect of B6 on co-polymerization of hβ2m and ΔN6 revealed that the aptamer alters the kinetics of co-polymerization of the two proteins. The results reveal the potential of RNA aptamers as tools for elucidating the mechanisms of co-assembly in amyloid formation and as reagents able to discriminate between very similar protein conformers with different amyloid propensity.

https://openalex.org/W2010635529,"NK cells are able to form a functional memory suggesting that some NK cells are surviving the activation process. We hypothesized that NK cell activation causes the development of a distinct NK cell subset and studied the fate of murine post-activation NK cells. Activation was achieved by in vivo and in vitro exposures to the melanoma tumor cell line B16 that was followed by differentiation in IL-2. When compared with control NK cells, post-activation CD25(+) NK cells expressed little granzyme B or perforin and had low lysis activity. Post-activation NK cells expressed CD27, CD90, CD127, and were low for CD11b suggesting that tumor-induced activation is restricted to an early NK cell subset. Activation of NK cells led to decreases of CD16, CD11c and increases of CD62L and the IL-18 receptor. In vivo activated but not control NK cells expressed a variety of cytokines that included IFNγ, TNFα, GM-CSF and IL-10. These data suggest that the exposure of a subset of peripheral NK cells to the B16 tumor environment caused an exhaustion of their cytolytic capacity but also a gain in their ability to produce cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1999430792,"The Tongshu Capsule (TSC) is a prevalent form of traditional Chinese medicine widely used for its purported effects in treating mammary gland hyperplasia and inflammation. Though successful in several clinical studies, there is no clear evidence as to why TSC has a positive treatment effect, and little known about underlying mechanism that may account for it. In this study, we examined the effects of TSC and found that it has a comparatively strong growth inhibition on ERα positive breast cancer cells. TSC seems to cause G1 cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. Interestingly, TSC also down-regulated the expression of ERα and Cyclin D1. Consistently, TSC suppressed E2 mediated ERα downstream gene expression and cell proliferation in ERα positive breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D. Depletion of ERα partially abolished the effects of TSC on the decrease of Cyclin D1 and cell viability. Our findings suggest that TSC may have therapeutic effects on ERα positive breast cancers and moreover that TSC may suppress breast epithelial cell proliferation by inhibiting the estrogen pathway."
