https://openalex.org/W2010467127,"A photoinduced method for converting large quantities of silver nanospheres into triangular nanoprisms is reported. The photo-process has been characterized by time-dependent ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, allowing for the observation of several key intermediates in and characteristics of the conversion process. This light-driven process results in a colloid with distinctive optical properties that directly relate to the nanoprism shape of the particles. Theoretical calculations coupled with experimental observations allow for the assignment of the nanoprism plasmon bands and for the first identification of two distinct quadrupole plasmon resonances for a nanoparticle. Unlike the spherical particles they are derived from that Rayleigh light-scatter in the blue, these nanoprisms exhibit scattering in the red, which could be useful in developing multicolor diagnostic labels on the basis not only of nanoparticle composition and size but also of shape."

BMPs and TGF-βs have overlapping as well as specific effects on mesenchymal cell differentiation for which the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we report that Id1, a dominant negative inhibitor of basic helix-loop-helix proteins, is a direct target gene for BMP. BMP, but not TGF-β, strongly activates the Id1 promoter in an Smad-dependent manner. We identified two BMP-responsive regions in the mouse Id1 promoter, which contain three distinct sequence elements; one region contains two Smad binding elements (SBEs), and the other region contains a GGCGCC palindromic sequence flanked by two CAGC and two CGCC motifs. Whereas SBEs and GGCGCC sequence are critically important, the CAGC and CGCC motifs are needed for efficient BMP-induced Id1 promoter activation. Smads are part of nuclear transcription factor complexes that specifically bind to SBEs and GGCGCC sequence in response to BMP but not TGF-β. Multimerization of the all three distinct sequence motifs is needed to generate a highly sensitive and BMP/Smad-dependent specific enhancer. Our results provide important new insights into how the BMP/Smad pathway can specifically activate target genes.

Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 11Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). For BMPs, three distinct type II receptors for BMP,i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and activin type II receptors (ActR-II and ActR-IIB), and three distinct type I receptor,i.e. BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and ALK-2, have been identified. The mechanism of receptor activation has been best characterized for TGF-β but is very likely to occur in an analogous fashion for BMPs (10Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 11Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Receptor activation involves BMP-induced hetero-oligomerization of two sequentially acting kinases, with the type I receptor acting as a substrate for the type II receptor kinase. This is consistent with the notion that the type I receptor has been shown to confer signaling specificity to the type I-type II heteromeric complex (10Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 11Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Activated type I receptors initiate intracellular signaling through phosphorylating specific Smad proteins (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 13Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

Whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by TGF-β and activin receptors, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by BMP type I receptors. Based upon their functional properties, Smads can be divided into three distinct subclasses: they are (i) receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which transiently interact with activated type I receptors and become phosphorylated on two serine residues in their carboxyl-terminal SSXS motif, (ii) common partner Smads (Co-Smads), which assemble into heteromeric complexes with R-Smads that accumulate into the nucleus, where these complexes regulate the transcription of target genes, and (iii) inhibitory Smads (i.e. Smad6 and Smad7), which potently interfere with TGF-β/Smad signaling by competing with R-Smads for interaction with type I receptors or by inducing receptor degradation (12Attisano L.

Transcriptional activation of R- and Co-Smads is mediated via their conserved carboxyl-terminal regions, known as MH2 domains, which can recruit transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300. Smad3 and Smad4 were found to preferentially recognize, via their conserved amino-terminal regions known as MH1 domains, the 5′-GTCT-3′ sequence (also termed the Smad binding element (SBE)) (17Dennler S.

Multimers of SBE, when placed in front of a minimal promoter, can provide a strong enhancer function for TGF-β. SBE-like sequences are critically important for TGF-β-induced activation of multiple TGF-β-responsive genes (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 13Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

BMP R-Smads have been shown to weakly bind GCAT motifs or GCCG containing sequences found in promoters of the BMP target genesXVent2B and Smad6, respectively (20Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G.

However, BMP inducibility of reporter constructs containing multimerized GC-rich sequences is very low and requires R-Smad overexpression (22Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M.

Therefore, the mechanism on how the BMP/Smad pathway specifically activates target genes is still incompletely understood. The affinity of Smads for DNA is weak (18Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Smads need thus to co-operate with other DNA binding factors to bind efficiently to promoters of target genes. The 30-zinc finger nuclear protein OAZ associates with BMP R-Smads in response to BMP (24Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Expression of OAZ is cell type-specific and cannot be detected in mesenchymal cells. A member of the core binding factor (CBF) family of transcription factors, Cbfa1, also termed Runt-related gene 2 (RUNX2) was shown to interact directly with Smad1 and Smad5 (25Hanai J. Chen L.F.

RUNX2 precedes the appearance of osteoblasts, and mice deficient in RUNX2 lack osteoblasts, and bone ossification is completely blocked (27Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V.

RUNX2 and Smads have been shown to co-operate in transcriptional responses and BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (29Lee K.S. Kim H.J., Li, Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G.

Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10549-10554Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of RUNX2 in C2C12 cells was found to induce many of the extracellular matrix proteins induced by BMPs (29Lee K.S. Kim H.J., Li, Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, RUNX2 alone is not sufficient to induce the whole onset of osteoblast differentiation without co-operation with Smad5 (29Lee K.S. Kim H.J., Li, Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Thus, other BMP targets genes with critical roles in BMP-induced osteogenesis remain to be identified. Inhibitors of differentiation (Id) proteins act as dominant negative inhibitors of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, including members of the MyoD family of myogenic transcription factors, and also pocket proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein (31Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Id and basic helix-loop-helix proteins dictate in an opposite manner cellular programs of differentiation and proliferation in various cell types. Because BMPs can induce Id expression (32Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol.

Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar,35Melnikova I.N. Christy B.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1067-1079PubMed Google Scholar), 2O. Korchynskyi, unpublished results. 2O. Korchynskyi, unpublished results. Id proteins may serve an important effector function for BMPs. In the present paper we show that BMP specifically transcriptionally activates Id1 expression in C2C12 myoblasts and map two distinct BMP-specific responsive regions containing three pivotal distinct sequence motifs in the Id1 promoter. Expression plasmids for Smads and type I receptors have been previously described (36Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E.

Mouse Id1 promoter 5′ deletion constructs were made by PCR approach using mouse Id1-(−1575/+88) fragment as a template. For precise mapping of the BMP-responsive element, Id1 promoter fragments were PCR-amplified using Id1-(−1231/+88) fragment as a template and subcloned between KpnI and XmaI sites upstream of minimal adenoviral major late promoter (MLP) reporter construct (17Dennler S.

Site directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) protocol. The wild-type GTCT sites were replaced by the mutated GagT, the wild-type CAGC sites were changed into the mutated Ctca sequence, the wild-type GCCG elements were replaced by GaCG-mutated sequence, and the wild type GGCGCC palindrome, GC′-1, and GC′-2 sequence elements were replaced with GaattC, tGCa, tcaC, respectively. All constructs were DNA sequence-verified. C2C12, HepG2, and MDA-MB468 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C. Recombinant BMPs were a gift from Dr. K. Sampath (Curis, Inc.), activin A was from Dr. Y. Eto (Ajinomoto Co.), and recombinant TGF-β3 was obtained from Dr. K. Iwata (OSI Pharmaceuticals). Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 12-well (C2C12 cells) or 6-well (MDA-MB468 cells) plates. The next day, cells were transiently transfected with the reporters in the absence or presence of expression plasmids using pcDNA4 plasmid to keep total amount of transfected DNA constant. Transfection was carried out using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (4 μg of total plasmid DNA/well) in the case of MDA-MB468 and HepG2 cells or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection reagent (500 ng of total plasmid DNA/well) in the case of C2C12 cells, following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase co-transfection was used as an internal control for normalizing transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were quantified using the luciferase assay (Promega) with Victor luminometer (Wallac) as described previously (39Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated with using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with manufacturer protocol. 20 μg of total RNA/lane was loaded on denaturating (6% formaldehyde) 1% agarose gels. Blotting and hybridization using 32P-labeled (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) probes were performed as described previously (36Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S.

Thereby a construct was created with a 5′ site for NheI site followed by 2 SBEs, 1 GGCG site, 2 CAGC′ sites, 2 GGCGCC palindromes, 2 CAGC′ sites, 1 GGCG site, 2 SBEs, and an NheI 3′ site. The annealed oligonucleotides containing palindrome and two CAGC sites or two SBE sites were also used as specific competitors in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). To determine the functional importance of different elements that are present in BRE-Luc, the following four derivative constructs were made. (i) The CAGC-1,2- and GC′3,4-containing oligonucleotides were multimerized twice and subcloned into the SmaI site of MLP-Luc, (ii) SBE-2,3- and GC′-5-containing oligonucleotides were multimerized twice and inserted into the NheI site of MLP-Luc, and (iii) GC′-3,4-containing oligonucleotides and (iv) CAGC-1,2-containing oligonucleotides were multimerized twice, and both were subcloned into BglII site of 2× (SBE-2,3 and GC′-5) reporter construct. Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P.

Antibody against Id1 (diluted in assay 1:1000) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used in a 104-fold dilution. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Nuclear extracts from untreated C2C12 cells and C2C12 cells stimulated with BMP-6 (100 ng/ml) or TGF-β3 (5 ng/ml) were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M.

Previous studies show that BMPs, but not TGF-β, potently induce the expression of Id proteins (32Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we wanted to obtain new insights into the molecular mechanism of how certain genes can be selectively induced by BMP, but not by TGF-β, the Id genes were selected for further study. We found that BMP4 and BMP7 potently induce mRNA levels of Id1, Id2, and Id3 in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1 A). Induction of Id expression by BMPs peaks around 1–2 h. Among the three genes analyzed, Id3 was found to be most stably induced within the 1–24-h time period, and Id1 was found to be most rapidly induced upon BMP challenge (Fig. 1 A); Id1, likely to be an immediate early BMP response gene, was therefore chosen for further analysis. Induction of Id1 by BMP6 was indeed observed in the presence of cycloheximide (CHI), indicating that de novo protein synthesis is not required for this response (Fig. 1 B). Id1 is thus a direct BMP target gene. Id1 mRNA was actually more induced in the presence of BMP6 and CHI (Fig. 1 B), probably as a result of an increase in mRNA stability or loss of transcriptional repressors by CHI. The addition of actinomycin D (ActD), an inhibitor of transcription, inhibited the BMP-induced effect on Id1 expression (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the up-regulation of the Id1 protein is transcriptionally dependent. BMP6 stimulation also resulted in an up-regulation of the Id1 protein in C2C12 cells. This effect was blocked by ActD (and CHI) (Fig.1 C), indicating that in these cells BMP does not increase the Id1 expression by increasing the stability of the Id1 protein. When we transfected the mouse or human Id1-Luc reporter constructs in C2C12 cells and stimulated the cells with BMP or TGF-β, we found that only BMPs activated these Id1 reporters (Fig.2, A and B). On another transcriptional reporter, TGF-β activated a transcriptional response, indicating that C2C12 cells are TGF-β-responsive, as previously reported (5Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, BMP-induced activation of reporter is potently inhibited by dominant negative BMP type I receptors and stimulated by constitutively active (ca) BMP type I receptors, i.e. caALK2, caALK3, and caALK6 but not caALK4 and caALK5 (which are type I receptors for TGF-β and activin, respectively) (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). To examine whether Smad proteins are involved in the BMP6-induced transcriptional activation of Id1-Luc reporter, we co-transfected C2C12 cells with the mouse Id1-Luc reporter and expression constructs for R-Smads,i.e. Smad1 or Smad5 or inhibitory Smads, i.e.Smad6 or Smad7. We found that Smad1 or Smad5 strongly promoted both basal and BMP-induced activation of this reporter (Fig. 2 D) and that both I-Smads strongly inhibited both basal and BMP-induced luciferase levels (Fig. 2 E). These findings suggest an involvement of Smad proteins in BMP-induced activation of Id1-Luc reporter. The observation that basal levels are reduced by I-Smads suggests that there is autocrine BMP signaling in C2C12 cells. To show that Smad4 is required for the BMP6-induced activation of Id1-Luc reporter, we used MDA-MB468 cells. MDA-MB468 cells are human epithelial cells deficient in Smad4. In these cells, BMP6 has no effect on Id1-Luc reporter activity (Fig. 2 F). However, co-transfection of an expression construct encoding Smad4 restored the BMP6 activation of Id1-Luc reporter, demonstrating that Smad4 is necessary for the BMP6 transcriptional effect. This BMP6-induced activation of Id1-Luc reporter can be further enhanced by co-expressing Smad4 with Smad1 or Smad5. These results suggest that the Co-Smad4 and R-Smads (i.e. Smad1 and Smad5) co-operate in BMP6-induced activation of Id1-Luc reporter. By performing sequential deletion analysis of mouse Id1 promoter (Fig. 3 A), we found that Id1 promoter fragment −1231 to +88 (Id-(−1231/+88)) had similar activity as Id-(−1575/+88). The activity was completely lost in Id1-(−1070/+88) reporter construct. Subsequently, we sub-cloned Id1-(−1231/−996) fragment into a minimal promoter reporter construct and showed that it was highly sensitive to BMP when transfected into C2C12 cells (Fig. 3 B). Upon subdividing this fragment into two smaller fragments Id-(−1231/−1071) and Id(−1070/−996), we (nearly) lost completely the BMP responsiveness. In addition, Id1-(−1231 to −1055) reporter construct shows only little BMP responsiveness, which was regained when we extended this fragment to −1025. The minimal region, which remained BMP responsive, was Id1-(−1133/−1025) fragment (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, when we compared the mouse Id1 with the human Id1 promoter sequences, which are both strongly acti"
https://openalex.org/W2059694609,"Recently, we have shown that shear stress stimulates NO⋅ production by the protein kinase B/Akt (Akt)-dependent mechanisms in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) (Go, Y. M., Boo, Y. C., Park, H., Maland, M. C., Patel, R., Pritchard, K. A., Jr., Fujio, Y., Walsh, K., Darley-Usmar, V., and Jo, H. (2001) J. Appl. Physiol. 91, 1574–1581). Akt has been believed to regulate shear-dependent production of NO⋅ by directly phosphorylating endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at the Ser1179 residue (eNOS-S1179), but a critical evaluation using specific inhibitors or dominant negative mutants (AktAA or AktAAA) has not been reported. In addition, other kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA) and AMP kinase have also shown to phosphorylate eNOS-S1179. Here, we show that shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 is mediated by an Akt-independent, but a PKA-dependent, mechanism. Expression of AktAAor AktAAA in BAEC by using recombinant adenoviral constructs inhibited phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 if cells were stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but not by shear stress. As shown before, expression of AktAAinhibited shear-dependent NO⋅ production, suggesting that Akt is still an important regulator in NO production. Further studies showed that a selective inhibitor of PKA, H89, inhibited shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179and NO⋅ production. In contrast, H89 did not inhibit phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 induced by expressing a constitutively active Akt mutant (AktMyr) in BAEC, showing that the inhibitor did not affect the Akt pathway. 8-Bromo-cAMP alone phosphorylated eNOS-S1179 within 5 min without activating Akt, in an H89-sensitive manner. Collectively, these results demonstrate that shear stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in a PKA-dependent, but Aktindependent manner, whereas the NO⋅ production is regulated by the mechanisms dependent on both PKA and Akt. A coordinated interaction between Akt and PKA may be an important mechanism by which eNOS activity is regulated in response to physiological stimuli such as shear stress. Recently, we have shown that shear stress stimulates NO⋅ production by the protein kinase B/Akt (Akt)-dependent mechanisms in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) (Go, Y. M., Boo, Y.

Shear stress triggers a variety of biochemical and physical changes in cell structure and function. For example, shear stress regulates vascular tone and diameter, inflammatory responses, hemostasis, and vessel wall remodeling (1Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Laminar shear stress has been shown to play anti-atherogenic roles by inhibiting some of the key pro-atherogenic events, including apoptosis of endothelial cells and binding of monocytes to endothelium (2Dimmeler S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although it is well known that exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress stimulates production of NO⋅ from endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)1both in cultured cells and in intact vessels (7Rubanyi G.M. Romero J.C. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H1145-H1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which shear stress regulates NO⋅ production have not been clearly elucidated. eNOS is known as a Ca2+·calmodulin (CaM)-dependent form of NOS (9Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Indeed, most humoral ligands, including bradykinin, acetylcholine, and ATP, stimulate NO⋅ production from eNOS by raising the level of intracellular Ca2+, which forms Ca2+·CaM complex (9Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In the basal state, the majority of eNOS appears to be bound to caveolin-1 with its enzyme activity repressed in caveolae (10Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 11Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). This tonic inhibition of eNOS can be released by displacing caveolin-1 with Ca2+⋅CaM in response to Ca2+-mobilizing agonists (10Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Unlike Ca2+-mobilizing hormones, however, shear stress stimulates production of NO⋅ from eNOS by a mechanism that does not require a maintained intracellular Ca2+ level or CaM (8Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Schafer A. Scholz D. Aldershvile J. Busse R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Other potential mechanisms that could mediate the acute, shear-dependent activation of eNOS include phosphorylation, acylation, and translocation of the enzyme as well as its interaction with other molecules such as heat shock protein 90 (14–19). Recent evidence suggested that the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 (based on the bovine eNOS sequence and equivalent to human eNOS-S1177) by a sequential activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) pathway is the underlying mechanism by which shear stress stimulates NO⋅ production in a Ca2+⋅CaM-insensitive manner (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 20Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Busse R. Fleming I. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2000; 168: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cases of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sphingosine 1-phosphate, and estrogen, there is strong evidence supporting PI3K activation of Akt, which in turn is responsible for regulating the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS (17Fulton D.

For example, it has not been reported whether expression of a dominant negative Akt constructs such as AktAA or AktAAA can block the shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179and NO⋅ production in endothelial cells (19Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G. Berk B.C. Aebersold R. Corson M.A. J. Biol.

Other protein kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase G (PKG), and AMP kinase have also been shown to phosphorylate eNOS-S1179 (24Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J.

It may be possible that eNOS-S1179 can be phosphorylated by different protein kinases depending upon each given stimuli. Here, we examined whether Akt regulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in response to shear stress in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) by using adenoviral constructs expressing a constitutively active form (AktMyr) or dominant negative forms of Akt mutants (AktAA and AktAAA). Because our initial results indicated that shear stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in an Akt-independent manner, we examined other protein kinases to characterize their role in the phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that, unlike VEGF, shear stress stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 by an Akt-independent, but PKA-dependent, manner. BAEC harvested from descending thoracic aortas were maintained (37 °C, 5% CO2) in a growth medium (Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) and 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) without antibiotics) (28Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). BAEC used in this study were between passages 5 and 10. Unless specified otherwise, 2 million cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and grown to confluency in the growth medium before exposure to shear stress. BAEC were infected with recombinant adenovirus at ∼90% confluency. Cells were infected with adenovirus in serum-free DMEM for 1 h and then incubated for 48 h in a growth medium before the treatment. Three different recombinant adenoviral constructs (Ad-AktMyr, Ad-AktAA, and Ad-AktAAA) were used to overexpress Akt mutants. AktMyr is a constitutively active Akt mutant generated by fusing a myristoylation signal to its amino terminus (29Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). AktAA is an Akt mutant generated by substituting Ala at two major regulatory phosphorylation sites (Thr308 and Ser473) (29Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). AktAAA is another Akt mutant in which the phosphate transfer residue in catalytic site (Lys179), in addition to Thr308 and Ser473, was replaced by Ala (22Morales-Ruiz M. Lee M.J. Zollner S.

Both AktAAand AktAAA have been shown to inhibit Akt specifically in dominant negative manners (22Morales-Ruiz M. Lee M.J. Zollner S. Gratton J.P. Scotland R. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Hla T. Sessa W.C. J.

Infection efficiency of BAEC with recombinant adenovirus at 50 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) was close to 100% as determined by immunohistochemical staining of β-galactosidase as described previously (28Jo H.

A confluent BAEC monolayer grown in a 100-mm dish was exposed to non-pulsatile, laminar shear stress in a shear medium (phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) by rotating a Teflon cone (0.5° cone angle) as we described previously (30Rieder M.J.

Following experimental treatments, BAEC were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.75 ml of lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were clarified by spinning at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein content of each sample was measured by using a Bio-Rad DC assay (28Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J.

The intensities of immunoreactive bands in Western blots were analyzed by using the National Institutes of Health IMAGE program. The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies for phosphorylated forms of Akt-Thr308 (pT-Akt), Akt-Ser473(pS-Akt), eNOS-S1179 (pS-eNOS), and ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and total ERK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology; a polyclonal antibody for total Akt from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for total eNOS from Transduction Laboratories; and a monoclonal antibody against a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A confluent BAEC monolayer grown in a 100-mm tissue culture dish was exposed to laminar shear stress by rotating Krebs-Ringer carbonate buffer (25 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 11 mm glucose) with a cone in a 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. To measure accumulation of NO⋅ in the medium, a 1-ml sample was collected, replaced with fresh medium, and kept dark on ice until nitrite assay. After shear exposure, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer to measure the amount of protein and subsequent Western blot analysis. A fluorescence assay using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene was used to measure nitrite, because it accounts for more than 90% of total NO⋅ metabolite accumulating in the medium in response to shear stress (31Go Y.M.

The significance, p< 0.05, based on at least three or more independent experiments, was considered to be statistically significant. We first confirmed that shear stress stimulates phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. As shown previously (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar), exposure of BAEC to an arterial level of laminar shear stress (15 dyn/cm2) stimulated the phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1A). The phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 was apparent as early as 2 min after shear onset and reached a maximum by 30 min. During this time period the amount of eNOS did not change as determined by Western blot using an antibody detecting total eNOS. Shear stress also stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at the two key regulatory sites (Thr308 and Ser473) as determined by Western blots using antibodies specific for each phosphorylated site (Fig. 1B). The time courses of shear-dependent phosphorylations of Akt at both Thr308 and Ser473 residues were essentially identical. In addition, the time course of Akt phosphorylation was very similar to that of eNOS phosphorylation. To examine whether the shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt are regulated by PI3K-dependent mechanisms, BAEC were pretreated for 30 min with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, and then exposed to shear stress for up to 30 min. Treatment of the cells with wortmannin completely blocked shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 (Fig.2A). As shown previously (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar,31Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), wortmannin also blocked shear-dependent phosphorylation of Akt-Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig.2B). In contrast, wortmannin did not block shear-dependent phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Fig. 2C). It was noteworthy that wortmannin consistently abolished even the basal phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2B), whereas it did not inhibit the basal phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 (Fig.2A). The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that shear stress stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179and Akt-Thr308/Ser473 by a PI3K-dependent mechanism, confirming previous reports (14Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar,31Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To address the issue whether Akt regulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in response to shear stress, we used three different recombinant adenoviral constructs to transiently express a constitutively active Akt mutant (AktMyr tagged with HA) or two dominant negative constructs (AktAAA and AktAA tagged with HA) in BAEC. First, BAEC were infected with Ad-AktMyr (10 or 50 m.o.i.) or Ad-β-gal (50 m.o.i.) as a control. The dose-dependent expression of AktMyr was confirmed by Western blot with antibodies for HA and total Akt. Expression of AktMyr also activated Akt as determined by Western blots with antibodies specific to phosphorylated forms of Akt-Ser473 and Akt-Thr308 (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 3, expression of AktMyr alone was sufficient to stimulate phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179. In contrast, expression of β-galactosidase did not have any effect on phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179, showing the specific effect of AktMyr as the kinase. Here we directly examined whether Akt regulates shear-dependent NO⋅ production by phosphorylating eNOS-S1179 by infecting BAEC with dominant negative Akt mutants. First, we checked whether expression of AktAAinhibits shear-dependent NO⋅ production in BAEC. As shown previously (31Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), infection of BAEC with Ad-AktAA (50 m.o.i./cell) prevented production of NO⋅ stimulated by shear stress demonstrating the essential role of Akt in eNOS activation (Fig.4). In contrast, when cells were infected with Ad-β-gal as a control, shear stress still stimulated NO⋅production robustly (Fig. 4). This result demonstrates the dominant negative effect of AktAA on NO⋅ production in response to shear in a specific manner. Next, we examined whether overexpression of dominant negative Akt mutants would inhibit phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179stimulated by shear stress. In this study, BAEC were infected with Ad-AktAA or Ad-AktAAA and cells were subjected to shear stress (15 dyn/cm2 for 60 min) 1 day after the infection. The whole cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blots to determine the phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179. Because VEGF stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 by Akt-dependent mechanisms (17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), the growth factor was used as a positive control. To our surprise, overexpression of either AktAA or AktAAA did not have any significant effect on the phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 stimulated by shear stress (Fig. 5, A andC). On the other hand, overexpression of either AktAA or AktAAA substantially inhibited phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 induced by VEGF as expected (Fig. 5, B and D). Overexpression of Akt mutants induced by infection with Ad-AktAA and Ad-AktAAA were demonstrated by Western blots using antibodies specific either to total Akt (Fig. 5, A andB) or HA tag (Fig. 5, C and D). As controls, cells were also infected with Ad-β-gal, and it showed no obvious effect on eNOS-S1179 phosphorylation induced by shear stress (Fig. 5, C and D). These results clearly demonstrate that the dominant negative Akt mutants prevent eNOS-S1179 phosphorylation if it is stimulated by VEGF but not by shear stress. It is interesting to find that AktAAblocks shear-dependent NO⋅ production without inhibiting eNOS-S1179 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results show that shear stress stimulates phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 in an Akt-independent manner. The above results showing that the shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 is not mediated in an Akt-dependent manner prompted us to consider alternative mechanisms. In addition to Akt, several other protein kinases, including PKA, PKG, AMP kinase, and ERK pathways have been implicated in eNOS regulation (24Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D.

We chose to use selective inhibitors of PKA and ERK pathways to examine whether they regulate shear-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179. First, BAEC were pretreated with 0–20 μm H89, a highly selective PKA inhibitor for 30 min, and then sheared for 30 min. As shown in Fig.6A, H89 inhibited shear stress-dependent phosphorylation eNOS-S1179 in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum inhibitory effect observed at 10 μm. This result could be derived from two different possible mechanisms. One possibility is that PKA is an upstream regulator of Akt, which is then responsible for phosphorylating eNOS-S1179 directly. The other is that PKA, without involving Akt, is responsible for phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 directly or indirectly. If the former were true, H89 would be expected to inhibit Akt phosphorylation. If the latter were true, then H89 would not prevent Akt phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6B, the PKA inhibitor did not inhibit phosphorylation of Akt at the two major regulatory sites (Thr308 and Ser473). This result favors the latter mechanism that PKA is responsible for phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179 without involving an Akt pathway. Interestingly, H89 augmented the phosphorylation of Akt both in basal and sheared cells (Fig. 6B). This result showing that, even when Akt was intensely stimulated by H89, eNOS phosphorylation was not increased (rather, it was completely inhibited) provides further evidence against the role of Akt as the protein kinase directly phosphorylating eNOS-S1179. Next, we tested whether ERK pathway regulates the shear stress-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-S1179. BAEC were pretreated with 0–40 μm of PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (the upstream pro"

Our conclusions are based on the analogy between the martian gullies and terrestrial debris flows observed in Greenland and numerical simulations that show that above-freezing temperatures can occur at high obliquities in the near surface of Mars, and that such temperatures are only predicted at latitudes and for slope orientations corresponding to where the gullies have been observed on Mars."

When restricted to the cytoplasm, Mdm2 is degraded. The ability of PTEN to inhibit the nuclear entry of Mdm2 increases the cellular content and transactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Retroviral transduction of PTEN into U87MG (PTEN null) glioblastoma cells increases p53 activity and expression of p53 target genes and induces cell cycle arrest. U87MG/PTEN glioblastoma cells are more sensitive than U87MG/PTEN null cells to death induced by etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces DNA damage. Previously, tumor suppressor proteins have been supposed to act individually to suppress cancers. Our results establish a direct connection between the activities of two major tumor suppressors and show that they act together to respond to stresses and malignancies. PTEN protects p53 from survival signals, permitting p53 to function as a guardian of the genome. By virtue of its capacity to protect p53, PTEN can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy that relies on p53 activity. p53 induces PTEN gene expression, and here it is shown that PTEN protects p53, indicating that a positive feedback loop may amplify the cellular response to stress, damage, and cancer."

We show that HuR, a protein implicated in the stabilization of short-lived mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs), serves as an adapter for c-fos mRNA export through two pathways. One involves the HuR shuttling domain, HNS, which exhibits a heat shock–sensitive interaction with transportin 2 (Trn2); the other involves two protein ligands of HuR—pp32 and APRIL—which contain leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) recognized by the export receptor CRM1.

The molecular details of the engulfment of apoptotic cells are not fully understood. ced-6 and its human homologue gulp, encode an adapter protein, whose function in engulfment is highly evolutionarily conserved; however, the upstream and downstream components of CED-6 mediated signaling are not known. Recently, ced-1 has been shown to encode a transmembrane protein on phagocytic cells, with two functional sequence motifs in its cytoplasmic tail that are important for engulfment. In this study, using a combination of biochemical approaches and yeast two-hybrid analysis, we present evidence for a physical interaction between GULP/CED-6 and one of the two motifs (NP XY motif) in the cytoplasmic tail of CED-1. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of GULP was necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Since the precise mammalian homologue of CED-1 is not known, we undertook a database search for human proteins that contain the motifs shown to be important for CED-1 function and identified CD91/LRP (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) as one candidate. Interestingly, recent studies have also identified CD91/LRP as a receptor involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in mammals. The GULP phosphotyrosine binding domain was able to specifically interact with one specific NP XY motif in the CD91 cytoplasmic tail. During these studies we have also identified the mouse GULP sequence. These studies suggest a physical link between CED-1 or CD91/LRP and the adapter protein CED-6/GULP during engulfment of apoptotic cells and further elucidate the pathway suggested by the genetic studies."

Indeed, mutation of serine 1179 to an alanine residue (eNOS S1179A) prevents Akt-dependent phosphorylation and NO production, proving that this residue is indispensable for activation of the enzyme by this kinase (8Fulton D.

Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 1179 may be considered synonymous with the activation state of eNOS in response to two important physiological agonists for NO production, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fluid shear stress. Indeed, eNOS-derived NO is necessary for VEGF-induced angiogenesis and permeability changes in vivo (14Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F.

The mechanism by which localization influences eNOS activation is not completely understood. Previously it has been suggested that the localization of eNOS changes upon stimulation from membrane to cytosol and that the translocation is either important for activation or inactivation of the enzyme.

This suggested to us that the localization of eNOS phosphorylated on serine 1179 reflected an “activated pool” of the enzyme. Thus, the goal of the present study was to gain insights into where activated eNOS resides and where NO is produced in cells and to examine the relative distribution of total versus phosphorylated eNOS in Golgi versus cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane. Rabbits were injected with a phosphopeptide (QEVTSRIRTQpSFSLQERHLRG (where pS is phosphorylated serine) corresponding to amino acids 1169–1189 on bovine eNOS) coupled to KLH. Antibodies (Ab) were first purified by positive selection on phosphopeptide columns followed by negative selection on nonphospho-peptide columns (Dr. Mark Amano, Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories). The resultant Ab was identical in recognizing only eNOS phosphorylated on serine 1179 similar to the original phospho-eNOS (P-eNOS) Ab described (7Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I.

Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown as previously described (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

For transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 × 106cells/100-mm dish and transfected the next day with the cDNAs for WT eNOS, G2A eNOS, S1179A eNOS, S1179D eNOS, FLK, and Akt according to the manufacturer's instructions (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. Lysates were Dounce-homogenized (50 strokes), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and subjected to Western analysis as described previously (8Fulton D.

Confluent BAEC (150-mm dish) were serum-starved for 12 h before stimulation with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 3 min. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scrapped in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by homogenization (Dounce, 25 strokes). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were obtained by additional centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Low density caveolin-enriched membrane fractions were isolated as described previously (19Sowa G. Liu J. Papapetropoulos A. Rex-Haffner M. Hughes T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

BAEC or transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, Dounce-homogenized, and sonicated (three 20-s bursts at 30% of maximal power). The homogenate was then adjusted to 42.5% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 85% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (3 ml of 5% sucrose, 5 ml of 30% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in an SW40 rotor Beckman Instruments). A light-scattered band confined to the 5–30% sucrose interface was observed that contained caveolin but excluded most other proteins. Gradient fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the tube to yield a total of 12 fractions, and 50 μl of each fraction (2Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D. Durieux M.E.

Blots were probed with the P-eNOS antibody (as described above), eNOS monoclonal antibody (9D10, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), anti-β-COP polyclonal anti-body (1:1000; Affinity BioReagents), anti-β-actin, and anti-Akt and phospho-Akt (P-Akt, Cell Signaling) and followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ECL to detect the immunoreactive proteins. The percentage of total membrane protein in different gradient fractions was determined by laser densitometry and plotted as a percentage of total protein. COS cells were transfected as described and plated onto sterile coverslips. Cells were fixed in acetone/methanol 1:1 for 3 min at −20 °C and rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with 5% goat serum in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature followed by a 2-h incubation with polyclonal P-eNOS antibody and monoclonal eNOS antibody (H32, Transduction Labs) for 2 h at room temperature. The P-eNOS antibody was preabsorbed against a 10:1 molar ratio of either P-eNOS peptide (as described above) or unlabeled peptide. Anti-rabbit Texas Red-labeled (diluted 1:100) and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (1:100) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Slowfade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and cells were observed with an inverted Zeiss microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal imaging system. Primary HUVEC were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips and serum-starved for 24 h. Endothelial cells were stimulated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 3 min and fixed in 1:1 methanol/acetone solution for 3 min at −20 °C.

We have previously reported that over the physiological range, DAF-2 fluorescence is linearly related to NO production and sensitive to changes in NOS activation due to capacitative calcium entry (21Lin S.

Briefly, endothelial cells attached on a 25-mm glass coverslip were washed with physiological saline solution and loaded with 10 μm DAF-2 DA at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark and allowed to de-esterify for an additional 20 min. The glass coverslip with cells attached was mounted on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with Photometrics PXL camera and a Silicon Graphics computer with Delta Vision deconvolution software (Applied Precision, Seattle, WA). Fluorescence section images from individual DAF-2 DA-loaded cells were obtained at 0.2 μm increments with 490-nm wavelength excitation and 528-nm wavelength emission. The deconvolved images before and after (30 min) treatment with VEGF (50 ng/ml) were used for localization of DAF-2 fluorescence. To examine the phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 1179 in cells, we characterized the specificity of a P-eNOS antibody that recognizes this residue. As seen in Fig. 1A, incubation of recombinant eNOS with active Akt in the presence of ATP resulted in detection of P-eNOS (upper panel), whereas omission of ATP from the kinase reaction did not yield a phosphorylated product. Reprobing the blot with a total eNOS antibody showed the presence of the substrate (bottom panel). Next, COS cells were transfected with wild-type or eNOS S1179A in the absence or presence of Akt. As seen in 1B, the P-eNOS Ab only recognized phosphorylated wild-type but not the phosphorylation site mutant eNOS (upper panel). Finally, the relative level of P-eNOS was examined in endothelial cells infected with adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase (control) or constitutively activated Akt. As seen in 1C (left panel), the P-eNOS Ab detected enhanced phosphorylation in cells infected with activated Akt, with low level basal phosphorylation in cells infected with β-galactosidase virus, whereas total eNOS levels were unchanged (right panel). Next, we examined the time course of eNOS and Akt phosphorylation in BAEC in response to VEGF (50 ng/ml). As seen in Fig.2A, VEGF stimulated time-dependent increases in eNOS and Akt phosphorylation with maximal phosphorylation of both occurring at 3 min post-stimulation. Moreover, the total levels of eNOS and Akt were unchanged throughout. eNOS phosphorylation lasted longer than did Akt, suggesting that the kinetics of dephosphorylation were different for these proteins. Recently several papers have shown that the G-protein-coupled receptor agonist bradykinin and in some but not all papers, VEGF, promotes the dephosphorylation of threonine 495 (or 497 in bovine eNOS) concomitantly with an increase in serine 1179 phosphorylation (24Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 25Harris M.B. Ju H. Venema V.J. Liang H. Zou R. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Kemp B.E.

Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The authors suggest that both dephosphorylation and phosphorylation of these residues are requisite for activation of eNOS and NO release. To test this hypothesis in our cells, BAEC were treated with VEGF, and phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser-1179 and T497 was examined. As seen in Fig. 2B, VEGF stimulated P-eNOS on serine 1179 and did not reduce the phosphorylation on Thr-497 as seen with bradykinin. Identical results were seen using early passage porcine and human endothelial cells, and no changes were observed at later time points up to 60 min (not shown). We also wanted to see if Akt-stimulated NO release was associated with changes in threonine 497 phosphorylation. Previously, we and others have shown that infection of endothelial cells with an adenovirus expressing activated Akt promotes a large increase in NO release (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar,9Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2C, Akt-induced NO release occurs simultaneously with enhanced Ser-1179 phosphorylation but no change in threonine 497 phosphorylation. Thus, VEGF and activated Akt stimulate serine 1179 phosphorylation but not threonine 497 dephosphorylation in our cells. To examine if phosphorylation on serine 1179 influenced the bulk subcellular distribution of eNOS, we examined the proportional subcellular distribution of P-eNOS in high speed membranes (Fig.3A, pellet (P)) and supernatants (S) prepared from control or VEGF treated (50 ng/ml for 3 min) BAEC. As seen in fractions prepared from serum-starved BAEC, greater than 90% of the total eNOS is in the pellet, with very little in the supernatant, and the basal levels of phosphorylation were low in both pellet and supernatant. In contrast, all of the detectable total and P-Akt was in the supernatant fraction. Upon challenge with VEGF, the proportion of eNOS distributed in the pelletversus supernatant did not change, and both pools were phosphorylated on serine 1179. Under these conditions, the distribution of total and P-Akt did not change. Densitometry of the proportion of P-eNOS in the supernatants and pellet shows that the VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation occurred in both pools. Thus, in response to VEGF, eNOS in both cytosol and membranes is phosphorylated, and this does not result in the bulk translocation of total eNOS or Akt. To directly determine if the localization of eNOS was necessary for VEGF-induced phosphorylation on serine 1179, COS cells were transfected with the cDNA for the VEGF 2 receptor (Flk-1) and either wild-type eNOS or a non-acylated form of the enzyme, G2A eNOS (Fig. 3B). COS cells do not endogenously express VEGF receptors or eNOS. Previous work has demonstrated that G2A eNOS is not myristoylated or palmitoylated and is catalytically competent but does not localize to Golgi or plasma membrane and is distributed throughout the cytosol. Furthermore, upon agonist challenge, cells expressing G2A eNOS produce less NO (5Sessa W.C. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Expression of Flk-1 in COS cells results in VEGF-induced phosphorylation of WT eNOS on serine 1179. In contrast, VEGF receptor engagement does not lead to significant phosphorylation in cells transfected with G2A eNOS, thus demonstrating that localization is necessary for agonist-dependent phosphorylation on serine 1179. To more accurately characterize the distribution of activated eNOS in transfected COS cells and in endothelial cells, we utilized sodium carbonate extraction of cells followed by a discontinuous sucrose gradient. In this procedure, cholesterol-rich microdomains including lipid rafts and caveolae float as buoyant membranes at the 5–30% sucrose interface (fractions 2–3), whereas soluble proteins and heavy membranes remain at the bottom of the gradient (fractions 7–10). Initially, we examined the proportional distribution of P-eNOS and total eNOS and Akt in COS cells transfected with cDNAs for eNOS alone or eNOS in the presence of co-transfected Akt (Fig.4A). In all gradients, the distribution of caveolin-1 (CAV-1), the coat protein of caveolae, β-COP, a marker for Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles, and β-actin, a cytoskeletal marker, were also examined to confirm the adequate separation of the membrane fractions. In the absence or presence of Akt, eNOS distributed primarily into two distinct pools, light membranes highly enriched in caveolin-1 and heavy membranes enriched in β-COP and β-actin. P-eNOS was also distributed in both fractions, with the relative ratio of P-eNOS/total eNOS enhanced in cells co-transfected with Akt (see right panel,bottom). No obvious redistribution of eNOS into or out of each domain was observed (see right panels, topand center). Endogenous Akt was primarily in heavy membranes and was also basally phosphorylated. Overexpression of Akt increased the levels of both P-Akt and total Akt. Next, we examined the relative distribution of a form of eNOS that cannot be phosphorylated, eNOS S1179A, and a constitutively active form that produces eNOS basally, eNOS S1179D. As seen in Fig. 4B, the distribution of both eNOS mutants were virtually identical (see relative quantitation inright panel). Both eNOS S1179A and eNOS S1179D were distributed in light and heavy membranes similar to data found in Fig.4A. To examine if a similar distribution exists in endothelial cells, the distribution of phospho-proteins was examined in BAEC challenged with VEGF for 3 min before preparation of cellular extracts (Fig.5). Consistent with the data in Fig. 4, P-eNOS and total eNOS were enriched in two major pools, as was P-Akt and total- Akt. Upon activation of BAEC with VEGF, the relative levels of P-eNOS and P-Akt increased, but the distribution did not change (seeright panels). Collectively, these data suggest that overexpression of Akt or activation of Akt by VEGF will phosphorylate eNOS on serine 1179 in both light and heavy membrane fractions without bulk redistribution of eNOS or Akt. Moreover, the constitutively active form of eNOS distributes similarly to the non-phosphorylated mutant. Next we examined the intracellular localization of P-eNOS by confocal microscopy in COS cells transfected with eNOS in the absence and presence of β-galactosidase (control) or"

These compounds are intermediates in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and advanced lipoxidation end products (ALE) in tissue proteins during aging and in chronic disease. We studied the reaction of carbonyl compounds glyoxal (GO) and glycolaldehyde (GLA) with pyridoxamine (PM), a potent post-Amadori inhibitor of AGE formation in vitro and of development of renal and retinal pathology in diabetic animals. PM reacted rapidly with GO and GLA in neutral, aqueous buffer, forming a Schiff base intermediate that cyclized to a hemiaminal adduct by intramolecular reaction with the phenolic hydroxyl group of PM. This bicyclic intermediate dimerized to form a five-ring compound with a central piperazine ring, which was characterized by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, NMR, and x-ray crystallography. PM also inhibited the modification of lysine residues and loss of enzymatic activity of RNase in the presence of GO and GLA and inhibited formation of the AGE/ALENε-(carboxymethyl)lysine during reaction of GO and GLA with bovine serum albumin. Our data suggest that the AGE/ALE inhibitory activity and the therapeutic effects of PM observed in diabetic animal models depend, at least in part, on its ability to trap reactive carbonyl intermediates in AGE/ALE formation, thereby inhibiting the chemical modification of tissue proteins.

In vivo, the relative significance of different pathways of protein modification by carbonyl compounds would depend on the specific conditions, such as the level of oxidative stress and the status of carbonyl scavenging mechanisms. Reactive carbonyl species are formed in a variety of metabolic reactions. Some are generated by non-oxidative pathways such as the formation of MGO by the spontaneous decomposition of triose phosphates or during anaerobic metabolism of acetone and amino acids (15Ohmori S. Mori M. Shiraha K. Kawase M. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 290: 397-412PubMed Google Scholar). Other carbonyl species derive from oxidative reactions. For example, GO, MGO, and GLA are formed during the autoxidation of carbohydrates (8Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann-Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem.

Because carbonyl modification reactions can alter protein structure and function and cause the formation of high molecular weight protein aggregates, they have been implicated in the development of a number of pathologies via a condition known as “carbonyl stress” (4Miyata T. van-Ypersele-de-Strihou C.

Therefore, inhibition of synthesis and/or trapping of free and protein-bound carbonyls presents an important avenue for drug development. Therapeutic agents such as aminoguanidine,l-arginine, OPB-9195, tenilsetam, and metformin have been proposed to trap reactive carbonyl compounds (21Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney A. Ulrich P.

We have recently demonstrated that pyridoxamine, a natural intermediate of vitamin B6 metabolism, prevented the development of nephropathy in the rat model of diabetes (Baynes and co-authors, Refs.26Degenhardt T.P.

Our earlier studies of the mechanism of action of PM suggest that it acts by inhibiting the conversion of intermediates in protein glycation reactions (Amadori compounds) to advanced glycation end products, such as CML (Hudson and co-authors, Refs. 28Khalifah R.G.

In the present report, we extend our studies into the mechanism of action of PM by showing that it also inhibits protein modifications by GO and GLA, major products of sugar and lipid degradation. Pyridoxamine exerts this protective effect by competing with protein lysine residues for dicarbonyl and α-hydroxycarbonyl moieties of GO and GLA, respectively, to form relatively stable cyclic aminal derivatives, GOPM and GLAPM. Based on this work, we propose that the therapeutic effects of pyridoxamine observed in diabetic animal models (26Degenhardt T.P. Alderson N.L. Arrington D.D. Beattie R.J. Basgen J.M. Steffes M.W.

(2001) 2001 The American Diabetes Association 61st Scientific Sessions, Abstracts, pp. 696Google Scholar) are, in part, the result of its action in trapping a wide range of carbonyl intermediates in the pathway of protein modification by sugars and lipids. We suggest that pyridoxamine acts through this mechanism in addition to its inhibition of post-Amadori protein modifications established in our earlier studies (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

GO and Girard's reagent T were from Aldrich; RNase A was from Worthington Biochemical. All reactions were performed at 37 °C in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Sodium azide (0.02%) was added to prevent bacterial growth. The formation of CML in reactions between BSA and carbonyl compounds was measured by ELISA. The ELISA measurements used polyclonal anti-AGE antibody R618 (1:350) and were performed as described previously (29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To determine the epitope specificity of our polyclonal antibody R618, we purified the antibody by affinity chromatography on CML-BSA-coupled Pierce AminoLink Plus column. The reactivity of purified antibody toward several AGE-modified proteins was identical to that of unpurified antibody, 2B. Cussimanio, R. G. Khalifah, and B. G. Hudson, unpublished data. indicating that CML was the primary epitope recognized by R618 polyclonal antibody. RNase activity was determined by measuring the formation of acid-soluble oligonucleotide as described by Kalnitsky et al. (35Kalnitsky G. Hummel J.P. Dierkis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 2341512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. For the assay, 100 μl of 3 μg/ml RNase in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was mixed with 100 μl of 1% yeast RNA in the same buffer. After the incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of an ice-cold solution of 0.8% lanthanum nitrate in 18% perchloric acid. Incubation tubes were kept on ice for 5 min to ensure complete precipitation of undigested RNA and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant (20 μl) was diluted to 1 ml with distilled water, and the amount of digested (solubilized) RNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The activity of RNase incubated either alone or with PM at 37 °C was monitored separately and used as the reference for each incubation time. This reference activity did not change significantly over the course of incubation. The concentration of GO was determined using Girard's reagent T (36Mitchel R.E. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 81: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (5 μl of 10 mmsolution of GO) was mixed with 995 μl of 120 mm sodium borate, pH 9.3. An aliquot of this mixture (200 μl) was then added to 800 μl of 100 mm Girard's reagent T in the same sodium borate buffer. After the reaction had reached equilibrium (10 min at room temperature), the amount of reacted dicarbonyl groups was determined by measuring absorbance at 326 nm (36Mitchel R.E. Birnboim H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 81: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The concentration of GLA was determined by the DNPH assay (37Fields R. Dixon H.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) of the samples containing 10 mmglycolaldehyde were mixed with 1 ml of 200 μm DNPH in 1m HCl. After 20 min at room temperature, the amount of reacted carbonyls was determined by measuring absorbance at 380 nm (37Fields R. Dixon H.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ESI-LC-MS/MS was carried out in a positive ion mode on a Micromass Quattro LC mass spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly, MA) equipped with a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) series 1100 HPLC system and a Keystone (Bellefonte, PA) Aquasil C-18 microbore column. The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B), flow rate at 0.8 ml/min. The gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, 15% B; 2–40 min, 15–75% B, hold 5 min; 45–55 min, 75–15% B, hold 20 min. In some experiments, samples were analyzed by direct injection ESI-mass spectrometry. In this case, the carrier buffer consisted of 80% acetic acid and 20% methanol, flow rate at 0.03 ml/min. Colorless crystals of GOPM (0.28 × 0.20 × 0.16 mm) or GLAPM (0.24 × 0.20 × 0.08 mm) were coated in inert oil, mounted on the end of a thin glass fiber, and transferred to the cold stream of a Bruker SMART APEX charged coupled device-based diffractometer system (molybdenum Kα radiation, l = 0.71073 Å). The x-ray intensity data were measured at 190°K. Crystal quality and initial unit cell parameters were determined based on reflections taken from a set of three scans measured in orthogonal regions of reciprocal space. Subsequently a hemisphere of frame data was collected with a scan width of 0.3° and an exposure time of 20 s per frame. The first 50 frames were recollected at the end of the data set to monitor crystal decay. The raw data frames were integrated into reflection intensity files using the software SAINT+ (38Bruker Analytical X-ray Systems, Inc. SMART Version 5.624 and SAINT+ Version 6.02a. Bruker Analytical X-ray Systems, Inc., Madison, WI1998Google Scholar), which also applied corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects. The unit cell parameters were as follows: for GOPM, a = 18.3459 Å, b = 14.8104 Å, c = 12.8368 Å, α = 90°, β = 119.123°, γ=90°; for GLAPM, a = 17.5912 Å, b = 8.7332 Å, c = 18.6798 Å, α = 90°, β = 93.8200°, γ = 90°. The final unit cell parameters are based on the least squares refinement of 3867 and 5943 reflections (for GOPM and GLAPM, respectively) with I > 5(s)I. Analysis of the data showed negligible crystal decay during data collection. No correction for absorption was applied. GOPM and GLAPM crystallized in the space group C2/c as determined by the systematic absences in the intensity data. The structure was solved by a combination of direct methods and difference Fourier syntheses and refined by full matrix least squares against F2 using the SHELXTL software (39Sheldrick G.M. SHELXTL, Version 5.1. Bruker Analytical X-ray Systems, Inc., Madison, WI1997Google Scholar). The protonated GOPM species is situated about a crystallographic inversion center. The asymmetric unit therefore contains half of the GOPM cation and one trichloroacetate anion. For the diprotonated GLAPM cation, the asymmetric unit also contains one-half of the cation and one trichloroacetate anion. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized positions and refined using a riding model except for H1n bound to N1, which was located and refined with an isotropic displacement parameter. NMR data were collected on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. Structural characterization of GOPM was provided by gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence, gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple quantum-multiple bond coherence, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer, 1H, and13C NMR. Absorbance and absorbance spectra were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. The concentration of modified proteins was determined using second derivative analysis of absorbance spectra to exclude a contribution from carbonyl modification-related spectral components (40Butler W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 505-515Google Scholar). Because PM possesses a nucleophilic amino group (see Fig. 6), it has the potential to react with carbonyl compounds. We therefore measured the loss of reactive carbonyl and dicarbonyl groups in solutions of 10 mm GO or 10 mm GLA during the course of incubation with 15 mm PM. In our earlier studies, this concentration of PM was effective at inhibiting the formation of CML from the protein-Amadori intermediate in vitro (28Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 30Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PM reacted with both GO and GLA and trapped these carbonyl compounds (Fig. 1). The reaction of PM with GO was notably faster than with GLA (t½ = 0.94 and 5.0 h, respectively). Because GLA can be oxidized to GO (9Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), it was important to establish whether oxidation was necessary for the reaction of PM with GLA. The rate of GLA oxidation was relatively slow under our experimental conditions. After 72 h of incubation, when ∼90% of GLA had reacted with PM (Fig. 1B), only 21% of GLA had been converted to GO, as determined in separate incubations using the Girard's T assay (data not shown). Thus, PM appeared to react directly with both GLA and GO, as was also confirmed below by structural analysis of reaction products. Importantly, the reactivity of PM with GO was significantly greater than that of free amino acid lysine even though the lysine amino groups were at 2-fold excess over the amino groups of PM (Fig. 1A). In a slower reaction with GLA, PM still trapped this carbonyl compound more rapidly than did lysine (Fig.1B). To purify the GOPM adduct, we took advantage of its low solubility. Under the conditions of our experiments (10 mm GO and 15 mm PM), a visible precipitate formed during the course of reaction and was isolated by centrifugation at different incubation times. Although the absorbance of the solution gradually decreased, it still exhibited absorbance maxima characteristic of PM at neutral pH (256 and 324 nm) as shown in Fig.2A. The GOPM precipitate (2 mg) was dissolved in 3 ml of 0.5% trichloroacetic acid, and an aliquot of this solution was then diluted 200-fold into sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The spectrum of GOPM complex was significantly different from that of PM itself: the short wavelength maximum shifted to 282 nm and its relative intensity was increased (Fig. 2B). Reactions of PM and GLA proceeded more slowly but also yielded a precipitate. Similar changes in absorbance spectra were also observed, suggesting the formation of similar products from GO and GLA (data not shown). A direct injection electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of GOPM and GLAPM produced protonated molecular ions [M+H]+with m/z = 417 and 385, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The other prominent ions present in the spectra of GOPM and GLAPM (m/z = 209 and 193, respectively) were doubly charged molecular ions [M+2H]2+ based on the spacing of 13C isotope satellites of these ions at 0.5 atomic mass units and by their identical HPLC elution time with [M+H]+ ions. Fragmentation mass spectra (MS/MS) of all ions yielded peaks at m/z = 169 and 152, characteristic of the molecular ion and deamination product of PM, respectively (data not shown). To unequivocally establish novel structures of GOPM and GLAPM, we have performed solution1H and 13C NMR and x-ray crystallography experiments. The results (Table I and Fig. 3, A and B, insets) were consisted with the structures shown in Fig. 3C.Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of GOPMCarbon atom1-aFor carbon atom numbering, see Fig. 3C.1H NMR13C NMRppmppmC-2144.2C-3148.4C-4127.6C-5130.8C-67.89 (1H,s)138.1C-74.60 (1H,d), 4.18 (1H,d)45.12C-94.70 (1H,d)86.1C-114.59 (1H,d), 4.9 (1H,d)80.46, 87.63C-11 (-OH)5.54 (1H,d)C-122.67 (3H,s)18.26C-134.45 (2H,d)58.18C-13 (-OH)5.12 (1H,t)1-a For carbon atom numbering, see Fig. 3C. Open table in a new tab To investigate the efficiency of protection of protein from carbonyl stress, we evaluated the effect of PM on the chemical modification of RNase A and BSA by GO and GLA in vitro. BSA contains 58 lysines per molecule, and its chemical modification can be followed by ELISA measurement of CML. RNase, on the other hand, has two active site lysines, Lys-7 and Lys-41 (41Kartha G. Bello J. Harker D. Nature. 1967; 213: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar); therefore, the enzyme loses activity on reaction with carbonyl compounds. The incubations were carried out at equimolar concentrations of GO or GLA, PM, and protein lysines (6.7 mm) to compare the reactivity of PM and protein amino groups with carbonyl compounds. Although the inhibition of RNase activity by GO and GLA occurred with different kinetics, only about 20% of enzyme activity was detected after 288 h of incubation with either carbonyl compound (Fig.4, A and B). When RNase was incubated with these carbonyl compounds, but in the presence of PM, a protection of enzyme activity was observed. The protection was more prominent in the case of GO as compared with GLA (Fig. 4,A and B), which is consistent with the lower reactivity of PM toward GLA (Fig. 1). Because PM reacted more rapidly with GO or GLA as compared with lysine (Fig. 1), we predicted that PM would also inhibit the modification of protein lysine residues by reactive carbonyl compounds, specifically the formation of CML, a common product of the reaction of proteins with GO and GLA (9Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, PM inhibited the GO- and GLA-induced formation of CML-BSA. In contrast to the results of experiments with RNase, PM was more effective in inhibiting the formation of CML from GLA as compared with GO. This was also evident at lower molar ratios of PM to carbonyl compounds (Fig. 5,A and B, insets). Because the reaction between PM and GLA is slower when compared with the reaction between PM and GO (Fig. 1), these results imply the participation of an additional inhibitory mechanism that is different from carbonyl scavenging. Interestingly, Glomb and Monnier (9Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) have found that the conversion of GO to CML does not include a metal-catalyzed oxidative step, whereas the GLA-induced CML-BSA synthetic pathway has an alternative metal-catalyzed oxidative step and thus depends, in part, on the presence of transition metal ions. Transition metal ions, such as Cu2+, occur naturally in the sodium phosphate buffer that was used in our experiments (42Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These ions were catalytically active under our experimental conditions because chelation with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid partially inhibited GLA-induced but not GO-induced CML formation (data not shown), which is consistent with the mechanism proposed by Glomb and Monnier (9Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Because PM itself can chelate divalent metal ions (43Gustafson R.L. Martell A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 68: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Thompson D.M. Balenovich W. Hornich L.H.M. Richardson M.F. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1980; 46: 199-203Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this property may contribute to more efficient inhibition of GLA-induced CML formation by PM. Advanced protein glycation reactions, originally studied because of their role in the “browning” of food products, are now considered to be one of the major sources of protein modifications in chronic diseases and during normal aging (1Brownlee M.

We examined the antitumor effects of targeting SF/HGF and c-met expression in pre-established glioma xenografts by using novel chimeric U1snRNA/ribozymes. Transient expression of anti-SF/HGF and anti-c-met U1snRNA/ribozymes inhibited SF/HGF and c-met expression, c-met receptor activation, tumor cell migration, and anchorage-independent colony formation in vitro. Delivery of U1snRNA/ribozymes to established subcutaneous glioma xenografts via liposome-DNA complexes significantly inhibited tumor growth as well as tumor SF/HGF and c-met expression levels. Histologic analysis of tumors treated with U1snRNA/ribozymes showed a significant decrease in blood vessel density, an increase in activation of the pro-apoptotic enzyme caspase-3, and an increase in tumor cell apoptosis. Treatment of animals bearing intracranial glioma xenografts with anti-SF/HGF and anti-c-met U1snRNA/ribozymes by either intratumoral injections of adenoviruses expressing the transgenes or intravenous injections of U1snRNA/ribozyme-liposome complexes substantially inhibited tumor growth and promoted animal survival. We demonstrate that SF/HGF and/or c-met expression can be targeted in vivo to inhibit tumor growth. In addition, our findings represent the first in vivo application of chimeric U1snRNA/ribozymes, which have numerous potential therapeutic gene-targeting applications."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether toxin A-induced early cellular responses contribute to the permeability changes. We found that toxin A stimulated the activities of membrane and cytosolic protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and cytosolic PKCβ. A specific PKCα/β antagonist (myristoylated PKCα/β peptide) blocked toxin A-mediated RhoA glucosylation. Furthermore, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased translocation of ZO-1 from tight junction occurred within 2–3 h of toxin A exposure and were also inhibited by PKCα/β antagonist. During this time period, toxin exposure did not induce translocation of ZO-2, dephosphorylation or translocation of occludin, or cell rounding. Our data indicate that PKC signaling regulates toxin A-mediated paracellular permeability changes and ZO-1 translocation. Clostridium difficile toxin A increases paracellular permeability in colonic epithelial T84 cells by mechanisms involving RhoA glucosylation and actin depolymerization. However, we previously observed that toxin A-mediated decline in transepithelial electrical resistance preceded changes in cell morphology and tight junction ultrastructure (Hecht, G., Pothoulakis, C., LaMont, J. T., and Madara, J. L. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 82, 1516–1524).

Two large molecular weight proteins, toxins A and B, secreted by this microbe are glucosyltransferases with substrate specificity for Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) (2Just I.

Rho proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of GTPases that regulate cell morphology, gene transcription, and cell proliferation (4Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Rho glucosylation by toxins reduces the binding affinity of Rho to its downstream effectors, resulting in inhibition of Rho signaling, disassembly of actin filaments, and cell rounding (5Sehr P.

However, recent studies indicate thatC. difficile toxins induce early cellular responses including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (6Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I.

Dysfunction of paracellular permeability is a major contributor to the increased fluid secretion and diarrhea in C. difficileinfection and other inflammatory bowel diseases (9Riegler M. Sedivy R.

Tight junctions (TJs),1 localized in the uppermost basolateral surface of polarized enterocytes, serve as a barrier regulating selective passage of fluid, ions, and lipids through the paracellular pathway (12Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F31-F36Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Mitic L.L. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G250-G254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tight junction fibrils are composed of the transmembrane proteins occludin, claudins, and the junctional adhesion molecule whose cytosolic domains interact with the peripheral junctional proteins of the zonula occludens family (ZO-1, -2, and -3) (13Mitic L.L. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G250-G254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of ZOs, in turn, bind to perijunctional actomyosin filaments that support the TJ complex (14Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). TJ assembly and permeability are regulated by a network of signaling pathways including protein kinase C (PKC), heterotrimeric G proteins, Ras and Rho GTP-binding proteins, protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase, and calcium (15Karczewski J. Groot J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G660-G665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and increased paracellular flux are observed in cells exposed to the PKC agonist (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) (16Clarke H. Soler A.P. Mullin J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PKCα and -δ are implicated in the PKC-dependent regulation of TJ assembly and barrier function following activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (17Rosson D. O'Brien T.G. Kampherstein J.A.

Freeze fracture electron micrographs reveal abnormal TJ morphology in transfectants overexpressing mutant forms of the Rho family of GTPases, suggesting involvement of Rho proteins in TJ assembly (21Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In polarized intestinal epithelial cells (T84 cells) infected with a chimeric protein containing Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme that specifically inactivates RhoA, perijunctional actin rings are disrupted, leading to a decrease in TER and redistribution of ZO-1 (22Nusrat A. Giry M. Turner J.R. Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Carnes D. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The increase in TJ permeability and redistribution of TJ proteins in T84 cells exposed to C. difficile toxins has been correlated with depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (23Nusrat A. von Eichel-Streiber C. Turner J.R. Verkade P. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Hecht G. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, we previously observed a rapid drop in TER in the absence of any changes in cell morphology or TJ ultrastructure in T84 cells exposed toC. difficile toxin A (24Hecht G. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TJ permeability changes in response to toxin A preceded the disassembly of perijunctional actin filaments, suggesting that the early increase in TJ permeability may be mediated by factor(s) other than actin disassembly (24Hecht G. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1516-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the early effects of toxin A on TJ permeability and ZO-1 redistribution. Toxin A elevated the activities of membrane and cytosolic PKCα and cytosolic PKCβ. A specific PKCα/β antagonist (myristoylated PKCα/β peptide (MPKCP), residues 19–27) blocked toxin A-mediated RhoA glucosylation. Furthermore, a significant decrease in TER and increased translocation of ZO-1 from TJ occurred within 3 h of toxin A exposure and were inhibited by MPKCP. These data suggest that PKC signaling regulates the effects of toxin A on TJ function in target cells. Toxin A was purified from C. difficile growth medium by ion exchange chromatography as described (25Sullivan N.M. Pellett S. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified toxin A migrated as a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Toxin A cytotoxicity was monitored by incubating serial dilutions of toxin A with Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells for 24 h. We routinely observed that approximately 0.1 nm toxin A was required to induce rounding of Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. T84 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were propagated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Confluent T84 cultures were exposed to toxin A in time- and dose-dependent studies as indicated in the figure legends. To analyze the involvement of PKC signaling in toxin-mediated TJ permeability changes, cells were pretreated with either calphostin C or MPKCP (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for 30 min prior to toxin exposure. T84 cells were seeded onto Transwell filters (6.5-mm diameter, polycarbonate membrane, 0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Corning, NY) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/insert as described (23Nusrat A. von Eichel-Streiber C. Turner J.R. Verkade P. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). TER was measured in confluent T84 monolayer before and after apical toxin A exposure using Millicell-ERS (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Data were calculated by subtracting the value of a blank insert and normalized for growth area (ohm·cm2). Paracellular flux was determined by placing 200 μl of F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mg/ml FITC-conjugated dextran (Mr 3000) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the apical compartment with or without toxin A. The basal chamber was filled with 600 μl of F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transepithelial flux of dextran 3K from apical to basal compartments was determined by measuring fluorescence in the basal compartment with a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The concentration of FITC-dextran in the basal compartment was calculated from a standard curve, and apical to basal flux was expressed as pmol/h·cm2. Statistical significance was evaluated by paired Student's t test. Confluent T84 cells on 100-mm dishes were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were exposed to 1 nm toxin A for 1 h and collected into ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose plus protease inhibitors) followed by homogenization using Dounce homogenizer (pestle B) 50 times. The concentrations of protease inhibitors were as follows: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 45 min to separate cytosol and membrane fractions. Aliquots with equal amount of protein were incubated with either anti-PKCα or anti-PKCβ (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h. Enzymatic activities of immunoprecipitates containing different PKC isoforms were determined using the protein kinase C assay system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay utilizes a peptide derived from myelin basic protein (amino acid residues 4–14) as a phosphorylation substrate for PKC. The specificity of this PKC assay relies on inclusion of a pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide (amino acid residues 19–36 of PKC) to distinguish PKC-dependent and nonspecific substrate phosphorylation. To determine whether PKC phosphorylation was altered in cells exposed to toxin A, aliquots of PKCα or -β immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot probed with anti-phospho-PKCα/βII(threonine 638) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). To determine PLCγ activation, T84 cells grown on 35-mm wells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were exposed to toxin A and then collected in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) plus protease inhibitors. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and PLCγ was immunoprecipitated with anti-PLCγ (BD Transduction Laboratories). Samples were separated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and PLCγ, successively. Blots were then incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with Renaissance enhanced luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were collected in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The level of glucosylated RhoA in samples was analyzed indirectly using toxin A-associated inhibition of C3-mediated ADP-ribosylation (2Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). C. difficile toxins specifically transfer a glucosyl residue to threonine 37 of RhoA, which blocks further modification of RhoA byC. botulinum C3 exoenzyme that catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of RhoA on asparagine 41 (2). Highly purified C3 exoenzyme was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Following incubation, samples were separated in 12.5% SDS-PAGE and dried prior to film exposure to identify [32P]ADP-ribosyl RhoA. The corresponding gel bands were excised, and radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting. T84 cells (35-mm well) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately incubated in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 5 min with gentle shaking. The detergent-soluble fraction was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The insoluble fraction was collected in 100 μl of SDS extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and boiled for 5 min. Supernatants (cytoskeleton-associated fractions) were then obtained after centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min) and diluted with equal volume of Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer to reduce SDS concentration in the samples. ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated from detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions with ZO-1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), and the immunoprecipitates were separated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Levels of ZO-2, occludin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin in the Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions were determined using Western blot. Antibodies against ZO-2 and occludin were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Antibodies for β-catenin and E-cadherin were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Band intensity was quantified using ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Confluent T84 cultures on glass coverslips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. This was followed by a 10-min incubation with sodium borohydride (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline to remove free aldehyde. Cells were permeabilized by incubation in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) at 4 °C overnight and then probed with species-specific secondary antibodies coupled with either FITC or rhodamine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody to claudin-1 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. In some experiments, cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h to detect actin filaments. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The distribution of TJ proteins was examined with a confocal microscope (model 1024; Bio-Rad) using a ×100 oil immersion objective. A number of intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated in regulating paracellular diffusion across epithelium (15Karczewski J. Groot J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G660-G665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether any of these signaling pathways were involved in toxin-mediated changes in paracellular permeability. T84 cells were pretreated for 30 min with either calphostin C (1 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), PD98059 (100 μm), or ML-7 (20 μm), inhibitors of PKC, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, and myosin light chain kinase, respectively. Paracellular diffusion of FITC-dextran (Mr 3000) was then measured in the presence of 10 nm toxin A for 5 h (Fig. 1A). Toxin A induced a greater than 3-fold increase in paracellular diffusion compared with control (73.1 ± 3.6 versus 19.9 ± 2.1 pmol dextran/h·cm2, n = 18, p< 0.05). This toxin-associated increase in permeability was significantly blocked by pretreating cells with calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor with broad specificity, but not with the other kinase inhibitors tested. We next examined the ability of a cell-permeable MPKCP (peptide sequence derived from amino acid residues 19–27 of PKCα and -β) to block toxin-induced permeability changes. The toxin A-associated increase in dextran 3K diffusion across TJ barrier was completely blocked by MPKCP (10 μm) (Fig.1B). TER, a marker of ionic flow across the TJ, was more sensitive to toxin A then dextran permeability, as shown by a significant reduction in TER in monolayers exposed to only 1 nm toxin A. A significant drop in TER was first observed at 90 min (Fig. 1C, 1216 ± 72 versus 1012 ± 60 ohm·cm2,n = 18, p < 0.05) and continued to decline over the subsequent 2.5 h (445 ± 33 ohm·cm2). As expected from the results shown in Fig.1B, 10 μm MPKCP completely blocked the decline of TER in cells exposed to toxin A (Fig. 1C). The ability of MPKCP to block toxin A effects suggested the possibility that toxin A activated PKCα or -β signaling. Since a marked decline in TER was first observed 90 min after toxin A exposure (Fig. 1C), we measured the enzymatic activities of PKCα and -β in control and in T84 cells after a 1-h exposure to toxin A (1 nm). Significant increases in cytosolic PKCα activity (7.3 ± 0.7versus 13.0 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mg, n = 3,p < 0.05) as well as membrane PKCα activity (6.0 ± 0.1 versus 8.6 ± 0.2 pmol/min/mg,n = 3, p < 0.05) were found in T84 cells exposed to toxin A compared with control (Fig.2A). The activity of PKCβ in the cytosolic fraction was also increased significantly following toxin A exposure (0.12 ± 0.02 versus 0.29 ± 0.01 pmol/min/mg, n = 3, p < 0.05), while membrane PKCβ activity was unaltered in response to toxin A (Fig.2A). These data suggested that the effect of toxin A on TJ permeability required PKC signaling related to either increased PKC phosphorylation (26Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) or elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, known cofactors for conventional PKC isoforms (27Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of PKCα immunoprecipitates with anti-PKCα revealed a slight but significant increase in membrane PKCα level in cells exposed to toxin A (10 ± 2%, n = 3, p < 0.05), while the cytosolic PKCα level was unaltered. In addition, toxin A treatment did not alter the ratio of phosphorylated PKCα (threonine 638) versus total PKCα in either membrane or cytosolic fractions (data not shown). Consistent with a depressed level of PKCβ activity (Fig. 2A), we were unable to detect antigen in PKCβ immunoprecipitates by Western blot, suggesting a low expression level of PKCβ in T84 cells. PLCγ, a well characterized regulator of intracellular Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, is phosphorylated following agonist-stimulated activation (27Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Since increased Ca2+ influx and PLC activity have been reported in cells exposed to toxin B (8Gilbert R.J. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Yakubovich M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G487-G495PubMed Google Scholar, 28Weernink P.A. Guo Y. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we examined whether toxin A altered the phosphorylation status of PLCγ in T84 cells. PLCγ phosphorylation was increased by 42 ± 6% (n = 3,p < 0.05) over control within 30 min of toxin A exposure (Fig. 2B), suggesting that toxin A induced PKC activity via activation of PLCγ. We next examined the role of PKC in toxin A-mediated Rho A glucosylation, since inactivation of RhoA is known to increase TJ permeability in T84 cells (22Nusrat A. Giry M. Turner J.R. Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Carnes D. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The ability of toxin A to glucosylate RhoA was measured indirectly using the C3 exoenzyme assay. C3 exoenzyme specifically ADP-ribosylates native RhoA but not glucosylated RhoA (2Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, a decrease in the level of C3 ribosylation of RhoA indicates an increase in the level of glucosylated RhoA in cells exposed to toxin A. Inhibition of ADP-ribosylation in T84 cell lysates in cells exposed to toxin A (1 nm) increased progressively from 2 to 4 h (39 ± 4% of base line) (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, ADP-ribosyl RhoA level remained unchanged in cells treated with toxin A plus MPCKP (10 μm) or calphostin C (1 μm) (Fig. 3,A and B). MPKCP or calphostin C alone did not affect the level of ADP-ribosyl RhoA (Fig. 3A). To determine whether translocation of TJ proteins was involved in toxin A-mediated and PKC-dependent increase in paracellular permeability, we analyzed the time-dependent distribution of TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and occludin) between Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig.4). We observed a marked increase in the level of Nonidet P-40-soluble ZO-1 and a decrease in Nonidet P-40-insoluble ZO-1 that began at 2 h of toxin A exposure (Fig.4A). Densitometric analysis revealed an 89 ± 6% (n = 5) increase in the Nonidet P-40-soluble ZO-1 level and 38 ± 7% (n = 5) decrease in the Nonidet P-40 insoluble ZO-1 level after a 4-h exposure to toxin A (Fig.4B). MPKCP blocked the translocation of ZO-1 from the cytoskeletal to the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 4, Aand B). Exposure of T84 cells to MPKCP alone did not affect ZO-1 level in either Nonidet P-40-soluble or -insoluble fractions (Fig.4A). In contrast to the effect of toxin A on ZO-1 translocation, the level of ZO-2 in either detergent-soluble or -insoluble fraction was unchanged (Fig. 4C). We next examined phosphorylation and translocation of occludin from cytoskeletal to detergent-soluble fraction. In control T84 cells (time 0), both phosphorylated (high Mr form) and nonphosphorylated (low Mr form) occludin was detected in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction, while only the nonphosphorylated form was found in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 4C). Toxin A exposure (1–4 h) did not induce either translocation or dephosphorylation of occludin (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin in either Nonidet P-40-soluble or -insoluble fraction remained unchanged in cells exposed to toxin A (Fig. 4C). Thus, ZO-1 translocation was selectively induced by toxin A and correlated temporally with TJ permeability changes. Both ZO-1 translocation and TJ permeability changes were dependent on PKC signaling. The cytotoxicity of toxin A in fibroblasts is characterized by disassembly of actin filaments, detachment of cells from the underlying matrix, and eventually cell rounding (3Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Extensive cell rounding was observed in T84 cells exposed to 1 nmtoxin A for 8 h (data not shown). Cell rounding was first observed in scattered clusters of ∼100–200 cells (Fig.5). MPKCP completely blocked this toxin A-mediated cytotoxic effect (Fig. 5). The distribution of TJ proteins in cells surrounding these clusters was examined by immunofluorescence staining, since these neighboring cells might provide an early indication of TJ protein distribution prior to cell rounding. Confocal analyses of actin filaments, claudin-1, ZO-1, and occludin were performed in control T84 cells and in T84 cells treated with toxin A alone, MPKCP alone, or toxin A plus MPKCP (Figs.6 and 7). T84 cells treated with MPKCP alone were identical to control monolayers (data not shown). Subapical actin filaments formed ringlike structures distributed along the cell periphery in control cells (Fig. 6A) in contrast to scattered aggregates or clumps in cells exposed to 1 nmtoxin A for 4 h (Fig. 6B). Actin filaments at the base of control cells appeared as elongated microfilaments (Fig.6D), which became disaggregated after toxin A exposure (Fig.6E). Claudin-1 formed organized fibrils at the cell-cell junction in control cells (Fig. 6G) but formed aggregates with fringed extensions in cells exposed to toxin A (Fig.6H). As shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 6, MPKCP completely blocked the effects of toxin A on disruption of actin filaments and claudin-1 (Fig. 6, C, F, and I).Figure 6Effects of MPKCP on toxin A-induced reorganization of actin filaments and claudin-1. Distribution of subapical (A–C) and basal (D–F) actin filaments and claudin-1 (G–I) in the area immediately surrounding rounded cells was analyzed using a confocal microscope (×100 objective). Images of control T84 cells (A, D, and G) and cells exposed to 1 nm toxin A alone (B, E, and H) or toxin A plus 10 μm MPKCP (C, F, and I) for 4 h were shown.

Malaria research profits tremendously from the efforts in genomic data acquisition from the Plasmodium sp. parasite. More than 27 megabases of genomic nucleotide information were available by October 2000 covering the 14 chromosomes to at least 90% (1The Plasmodium Database CollaborativeNucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 66-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now, chromosomes 2, 3, and 5 are complete; the others are in the final, gap closing stage. Using genome data, Woodrow et al. (2Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) identified a high affinity hexose transporter that allows the parasite to take up its main energy source, glucose, from the host serum. Surolia and Surolia (3Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) found a key enzyme of a de novo glycerolipid synthesis pathway in the P. falciparum genome and showed its inhibition by triclosan. Until then, the parasite was thought to be fully dependent on the uptake of lipid precursors from the serum (4Holz G.G., Jr. Bull. W.H.O. 1977; 55: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). The massive synthesis of phospholipids is a hallmark in the metabolism of blood-stage parasites be it from precursors or de novo. As soon as the free parasite in its merozoite form has invaded an erythrocyte it begins a series of major transformations accompanied by rapid growth (5Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Fowler R.E. Krishna S. Mitchell G.H. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the ring stage, it starts to modulate the ionic composition of the red cell cytoplasm and a cytoadhesive protein (PfEMP1) with high affinity to blood vessel endothelia is inserted into the red cell membrane leading to sequestration (6Baruch D.I. Pasloske B.L. Singh H.B., Bi, X., Ma, X.C. Feldman M. Taraschi T.F. Howard R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The next, trophozoite stage is characterized by the highest rates of metabolism and growth (7Zolg J.W. Macleod A.J. Scaife J.G. Beaudoin R.L. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Later, as schizonts, the parasite prepares its asexual multiplication by DNA replication. Finally, the red cell bursts and releases new schizont-derived merozoites to start another cycle. This 48-h process produces up to 32 merozoites, which means that the parasite has to multiply the amount of membrane lipids enormously (8Vial H.J. Ancelin M.L. Subcell. Biochem. 1992; 18: 259-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The parasite is devoid of a pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis. All newly synthesized membrane lipids are of the glycerolipid variety,i.e. they are based on a glycerol backbone. In mammals, two aquaporins (AQP) 1The abbreviations used are:AQPaquaporinPfAQPaquaglyceroporin from P. falciparumBSAbovine serum albuminglpFE. coli glycerol facilitatorglpKE. coli glycerol kinase of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily are thought to be major players in the glycerolipid metabolism. Aquaporins are a universal family of cellular water/solute channels (9Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). They are functionally divided into water-specific channels (orthodox aquaporins) and aquaglyceroporins, which are permeated by mainly glycerol and some other solutes, whereas water transport is strongly limited. Generally, permeation is strictly passive according to the osmotic or solute gradient. Orthodox aquaporins serve vital functions in the water homeostasis of mammals (10Nielsen S. Kwon T.H. Christensen B.M. Promeneur D. Frokiaer J. Marples D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 647-663PubMed Google Scholar), whereas aquaglyceroporins are involved in metabolism. During lipolysis, the aquaglyceroporin AQP7 facilitates the release of glycerol from adipose tissue (11Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Takahashi M. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Tochino Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20896-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and AQP9 likely permits the re-uptake in the liver for gluconeogenesis (12Tsukaguchi H. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F685-F696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that a third member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily, AQP3, is present in human erythrocytes (13Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This finding is contrary to the results by Yanget al. (14Yang B., Ma, T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) who did not detect differences in the red cell glycerol permeability of AQP3 knockout mice. Despite the controversy, the same authors show that red cells are characterized by facilitated glycerol permeability, which can be inhibited by phloretin. aquaporin aquaglyceroporin from P. falciparum bovine serum albumin E. coli glycerol facilitator E. coli glycerol kinase The serum glycerol pool has not attracted much attention as a supply for the lipid biosynthesis in P. falciparum. The focus is strongly on glycolysis as a provider of the glycerolipid backbone. Here, we describe the biochemical characterization of an aquaglyceroporin from P. falciparum (PfAQP). Its bi-specific transport properties and the expression levels during the development of blood-stage parasites indicate functions in the osmo-protection of merozoites and rings; it simultaneously offers an efficient glycerol passage. We provide arguments showing that, besides the generation of glycerol 3-phosphate by reduction of glycolysis intermediates, the pathway of choice for P. falciparum lies in the uptake of glycerol directly from the host serum through PfAQP and subsequent phosphorylation by a glycerol kinase for glycerolipid synthesis. Parasites from strain Binh1 (15Binh V.Q. Luty A.J. Kremsner P.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 57: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and strain 2042 (recently isolated from a diseased traveler) were cultivated at 5% hematocrit and 3–7% parasitemia according to the method by Trager and Jensen with modifications (16Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Briefly, RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 20 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 2 mm glutamine, 200 mm hypoxanthine, and 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% O2, and 5% CO2. Synchronization of parasites was done in 5% sorbitol twice within 6 h (17Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from cultured P. falciparum was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). The coding sequence of PfAQP was amplified by PCR from P. falciparum genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GAACTATATCACAATGCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TATTACAAATCTACACCATC-3′ (antisense). AQP1 and AQP3 were amplified from cDNA prepared from the endolymphatic sac of 4-day-old rats (18Beitz E. Kumagami H. Krippeit-Drews P. Ruppersberg J.P. Schultz J.E. Hear. Res. 1999; 132: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CCCATATGGCCAGCGAAATCAAG-3′ (sense), 5′-CGAATTCATTTGGGCTTCATCTC-3′ (antisense) for AQP1 and 5′-AGCATATGAACCGTTGCGGGGAG-3′ (sense), 5′-CGAATTCAGATCTGCTCCTTGTG-3′ (antisense) for AQP3. The PCR products were blunt-ended and ligated into SmaI-digested pBluescript II SK(−) for sequencing. For cRNA synthesis, PfAQP and AQP3 were excised byXbaI/HindIII restriction digest and AQP1 was digested with XhoI/EcoRI. The fragments were subcloned into respective sites of pOG1, a vector derived from pBSTA containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the β-globin gene of Xenopus laevis. cRNA transcription was carried out with T7 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit, Ambion) after linearization with NotI. Stage V and VI X. laevis oocytes were defolliculated by Collagenase A treatment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and injected with 50 nl of water or 2.5 ng of cRNA (PfAQP), 5 ng of cRNA (AQP1 and AQP3), or combinations of these in 50 nl of water. Subsequently, the oocytes were incubated in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 15 °C for 3 days. The oocytes were transferred either into 1:3 diluted ND96 for measuring water permeability or into isosmotic ND96, in which 65 mmNaCl was substituted by a 130 mm non-ionic test solute for assaying solute permeability. 96 mm NaCl was substituted by 96 mm choline- and ethanolamine-chloride. Isosmolality in the range of ±10 mosm was confirmed with an osmometer (Semi-Micro-Osmometer, Knauer). If indicated, 0.3 mm mercuric chloride was added 5 min before the assay. The swelling assays were carried out at room temperature and were video-monitored using a ×2.5 objective. The relative volume was calculated from the area covered by the oocyte. Osmotic water permeability (P f, in microns/s) was calculated from the oocyte surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), the initial oocyte volume (V 0= 9 × 10−4 cm3), the initial slope of the relative volume increase (d(V/V 0)/dt, in s−1), the molecular water volume (V w = 18 cm3/mol), and the osmotic gradient (osmin − osmout), by the following equation: P f = V 0 ×d(V/V 0)/dt/[S× V w × (osmin − osmout)]. For the comparison of solute permeabilities the initial swelling rates (d(V/V 0)/dt, in s−1) were used. Northern blotting was done according to standard molecular biology protocols. Briefly, PfAQP total RNA was isolated (RNeasy total RNA kit, Qiagen), about 500 ng of RNA was separated on a formamide agarose gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. A [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe of 402 bp was generated with the PfAQP antisense primer shown above. Due to the high A+T content of P. falciparum genes, the hybridization was carried out at 42 °C, and washing was done three times for 30 min at 48 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal peptide CPLVDLANNEKDGVDL (see Fig. 1 C) ofP. falciparum were raised and antibodies were affinity-purified using agarose beads coupled with the immunizing peptide (SulfoLink kit, Pierce). Oocyte membranes were isolated according to Preston et al. (19Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and solubilized for 1 h at 37 °C. Equivalent amounts to 1.2 oocytes per lane were electrophoresed into 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Erythrocytes non-infected and infected withP. falciparum parasites were lysed by pipetting up and down in 5 volumes of hypotonic Na2HPO4 buffer (7.5 mm, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were pelleted at 27,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed two times with the same buffer. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and solubilized for 1 h at 37 °C. Equivalent amounts to 5 μl of parasite culture per lane were electrophoresed into 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Macherey & Nagel), incubated with affinity-purified anti-PfAQP antiserum (1:2000) or anti-c-myc antiserum (1:500, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Dianova) using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blood smears were fixed with ice-cold methanol (Fig. 7 A) or acetone (Fig. 7, Band C) for 5 min. The samples were blocked with 4% BSA in 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (TBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with PfAQP antiserum (1:500 in TBS-T with 4% BSA) or PfAQP antiserum pre-blocked with the immunizing peptide (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes with TBS-T, the slides were incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-rabbit antiserum (1:100 in TBS-T with 4% BSA) for 1 h and washed three times in TBS-T. Slides were mounted using SlowFade glycerol buffer (Molecular Probes). BLAST searches in the nearly finished P. falciparum genome and expressed sequence tag data bases (available at www.plasmoDB.org) yielded a single potential aquaporin located on chromosome 11 of the parasite. The sequence contains an open reading frame of 774 bp with an A+T content of 70.5% and has no indication of introns. Stretches with an A+T content >85%, which are typical for intergenic regions in P. falciparum, on either side and an in-frame stop codon 54 bp upstream of the predicted start-methionine mark the boundaries of the coding region. Based on these data, we designed primers in the immediate 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and were able to generate the expected PCR product from P. falciparum genomic DNA (see Fig.1 A). We refer to this sequence as “PfAQP” for “P. falciparum aquaporin.” The sequence has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data bases under accession number AJ413249. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree analyses show that PfAQP falls into the aquaglyceroporin branch (Fig. 1 B). On the protein level, PfAQP has the highest similarity to theEscherichia coli glycerol facilitator (glpF) with 50% of similar and 35% of identical residues. A topology prediction based on the crystal structure of glpF (21Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) shows that especially the membrane residing protein parts are highly conserved (60% similar, 42% identical), although both canonical Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs in loops B and E are altered to Asn-Leu-Ala (NLA) and Asn-Pro-Ser (NPS), respectively (Fig. 1 C). 17 of the 20 amino acids that make direct contact to a passing glycerol molecule in glpF are conserved in PfAQP (diamonds in Fig. 1 C). No sites for secondary modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation are apparent in the sequence. The protein encoded by the PfAQP gene has a calculated molecular mass of 28.3 kDa. However, Western blot analysis of X. laevisoocytes expressing PfAQP using an affinity-purified antiserum raised against the C terminus of PfAQP shows a protein with an apparent size of only 21 kDa (Fig. 2). To determine if the band represents the full-length PfAQP and to exclude protein degradation, a 51-bp extension coding for a c-myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL) plus a six-amino acid linker (SLIHTS) was added to the N terminus of PfAQP (myc-PfAQP), oocytes were injected with the respective cRNA, and the protein was analyzed by Western blot. The modification led to a shift in the apparent size, which is consistent with the 2.0-kDa mass of the added tag. No higher order bands indicating oligomers or glycosylated proteins, which are typical for aquaporins, were visible. The protein was detectable with both antisera, anti-c-myc and anti-PfAQP, confirming that both termini are present and that the expressed PfAQP protein is intact (Fig. 2). A similar anomaly in migration is sometimes seen with AQP1 as a second lower band 2E. Beitz, unpublished observation. and hints to a very compact tertiary structure of these aquaporins. Untagged proteins were used for the following functional characterization. The basic transport characteristics of PfAQP were analyzed by oocyte swelling assays in comparison to the water-specific AQP1 and the aquaglyceroporin AQP3. Fig. 3 A shows the initial swelling curves of oocytes expressing PfAQP, AQP1, or AQP3 after subjection to hypotonic shock in 1:3 diluted ND96 medium, which establishes an outwardly directed osmotic gradient of 140 mosm. AQP3-expressing oocytes show a low osmotic swelling rate due to limited water influx, whereas AQP1-injected oocytes swell rapidly indicating high water permeability. PfAQP appears to be a functional water channel resulting in oocyte-swelling rates close to AQP1. The P f values calculated from these curves (Fig. 3 B) reveal that PfAQP has a 5-fold higher osmotic water permeability than AQP3 and renders the oocytes 16 times more water-permeable than control oocytes. With a P fvalue similar to that of AQP1 (276 versus 304 μm s−1), PfAQP is a surprisingly efficient water channel. In the same test system, AQP2, which is responsible for the regulated water reabsorption in the kidney collecting duct (10Nielsen S. Kwon T.H. Christensen B.M. Promeneur D. Frokiaer J. Marples D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 647-663PubMed Google Scholar), accounted for aP f value of only 178 μm s−1 (not shown). The same set of aquaporins was analyzed for glycerol permeability in an isosmotic swelling assay with a 130 mm inwardly directed gradient of glycerol. Under these conditions, swelling is initiated by glycerol entering the oocyte due to the concentration gradient. The glycerol permeation changes the cytosolic osmolarity resulting in a secondary influx of water. It is therefore important that the water permeability is sufficiently high in order not to become restrictive for the swelling process. To assure this, we injected oocytes with cRNA combinations of PfAQP with AQP1 and AQP3 with AQP1 in addition to PfAQP and AQP3 alone. Fig. 3 C shows that the swelling rates are in the same order of magnitude as in the osmotic water permeability assay. In the case of AQP3, the above-described effect of low water permeability is clearly visible. The glycerol-induced swelling is substantially faster when AQP1 cRNA is co-injected with AQP3. As expected, the water permeability of PfAQP is not limiting as seen by the minimal difference in the swelling curves with and without AQP1 co-injection. Control oocytes expressing AQP1 alone do not swell under these conditions. Fig. 3 D depicts the initial swelling rates as bars for better quantification. PfAQP glycerol permeability is twice as high as that of AQP3, whereas AQP1 is not permeated by glycerol. In summary, the swelling assays demonstrate that PfAQP is highly permeable for both water and glycerol. PfAQP contains six cysteines of which two are found in intracellular domains (loop D and the C terminus), but four are part of membrane spanning helices. Although not obviously close to the pore mouth, complexion of one or more sulfhydryl groups by mercury may be possible. Hence, we carried out PfAQP swelling assays for water and glycerol in the presence of 0.3 mm mercuric chloride. Neither the water nor the glycerol permeability was changed significantly upon mercury treatment (not shown). We then applied the isosmotic solute swelling assay to determine the pore specificity of PfAQP using a variety of sugar alcohols of up to six carbon atoms and urea. Furthermore, to test for the permeability of compounds that are known to pass the erythrocyte-parasite interface and that are used in the phospholipid synthesis of P. falciparum, we subjected oocytes to swelling assays using myo-inositol, ethanolamine, and choline. It has to be noted that the latter two molecules are positively charged at physiological pH.myo-Inositol represents the group of hydroxylated compounds with a cyclo-hexane structure in this analysis. Fig.4 shows the initial swelling rates arranged in a descending manner (white bars). Control oocytes injected with AQP1 cRNA do not swell in the presence of any solute tested (black bars). PfAQP allows sugar alcohols of up to five carbons to pass the pore with decreasing permeability for increasing chain length (about two-thirds for C4- and one-third for C5-compounds). PfAQP is also permeated by urea with an efficiency similar to C5-sugar alcohols. More voluminous solutes such as the C6-sugar alcohols and myo-inositol as well as the charged ethanolamine and choline do not pass. The pore characteristics of PfAQP can fairly be summarized as bi-specific for water and glycerol. The most evident sequence features of PfAQP are the NLA/NPS motifs in the pore region. We carried out mutation analyses to test whether these are responsible for the high water permeability. Point mutations were inserted into the wild-type PfAQP to (a) invert the orientation of NLA/NPS to NPS in loop B and NLA in loop E (PfAQP-inv) and (b) generate NPA motifs in both loops (PfAQP-NPA). The expression of all constructs was confirmed by Western blotting with oocyte membranes (insets in Fig.5 A). The PfAQP-inv mutant is expressed at much lower levels hinting to structural problems and degradation. First, we measured the water and glycerol permeability using the conventional swelling assays described above. Indeed, PfAQP-inv is not functional and underscores the known structural function of the pore sequences. PfAQP-NPA in turn permits water (Fig.5 A) and glycerol permeability (Fig. 5 B). Despite the sequence changes, the swelling rates are equal within error to the wild-type PfAQP showing that the unusual pore sequences in PfAQP are not accountable for the peculiar transport properties. With respect to the NLA/NPS motifs in the pore region, PfAQP is reminiscent of the yeast aquaglyceroporin Fps1, which has the same NPA alterations but in an opposite orientation (NPS in loop B, NLA in loop E). There is indirect evidence that Fps1 facilitates glycerol permeation in an asymmetrical fashion favoring glycerol efflux from the yeast cell (23Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This led us to test whether the NLA/NPS motifs in PfAQP are responsible for asymmetrical solute flux. A direct in vitro test for pore symmetry had not been described so far. Thus, we designed an oocyte shrinking assay that generates an inverted (outwardly directed) glycerol gradient of defined concentration. We loaded oocytes expressing AQP1, AQP3, PfAQP, and PfAQP-NPA in ND96 medium with an addition of glycerol (50 and 100 mm). This medium is hypertonic to the oocyte cytosol. Hence, water following the outwardly directed osmotic gradient is replaced by glycerol entering the cells according to the inwardly directed glycerol concentration gradient. Fig. 5 C shows the relative volume changes exemplary for AQP1- and PfAQP-expressing oocytes during the first 15 min of the loading process. Note the fast volume decrease due to water efflux in the AQP1 curve followed by a slow recovery carried by the non-facilitated influx of glycerol. PfAQP-expressing oocytes show no volume change (50 mmglycerol gradient) or a steady increase up to 1% (100 mmglycerol) indicating fast equilibration. Importantly, the normal oocyte membrane tension remains basically unchanged. The equilibration was carried out for 90 min resulting in oocytes loaded with either 50 or 100 mm glycerol and an accordingly elevated internal osmolality. The loaded oocytes were then transferred into ND96 medium, which was made isotonic by the addition of 25 and 50 mmNaCl, respectively, to compensate for the internal glycerol. This resembles the conditions of the standard isosmotic solute swelling assay but in an inverted manner and with a glycerol concentration gradient of 50 or 100 mm. Higher concentrations were not feasible, because the linear phase of the resulting shrinking curves became too short for proper analysis. The measured initial shrinking rates are depicted in Fig. 5 D. Note that the absolute shrinking (Fig. 5 D) and swelling values (Fig. 3 D) cannot be compared, because the oocyte membrane behaves differently in both processes. Shrinking results in membrane infolding and ruffles leading to a less pronounced apparent volume change. Furthermore, linearity is given for a shorter period of time. Nevertheless, as in the swelling assays, the PfAQP wild-type and the PfAQP-NPA mutant show the same glycerol flux (50 mm). The shrinking rates are doubled at 100 mm glycerol confirming the linearity of the assay. The glycerol carried transport through AQP3 is more than 50% slower, which is again equal to the swelling data (see Fig. 3,C and D) and can be enhanced by offering an additional water pathway (AQP3/AQP1). Oocytes expressing AQP1 alone do not facilitate glycerol efflux. Additionally, results obtained in osmotic shrinking assays testing for inverse water flux also demonstrate symmetrical permeation (not shown). These findings imply that the NPA motifs (PfAQP-NPA and AQP3) or variations thereof (PfAQP) are not associated with pore asymmetry. During the preparation of this manuscript, the pre-release of a paper in press by Bill et al. (24Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Karlgren S. Mullins J.G.L. Rydström J. Hohmann S. J. Biol.

The above described isotonic shrinking assay can now be easily applied to directly test for asymmetry in such candidates as Fps1. Having established that PfAQP is a functional aquaglyceroporin, we tested for its expression in blood-stage parasites. First, we isolated total RNA for Northern blot analysis from non-synchronized P. falciparum parasite cultures. Using a radiolabeled 402-bp DNA probe of PfAQP we detected a single band at 1.8 kb (Fig. 6 A) showing that blood-stage parasites transcribe the PfAQP gene. Then, to gain information about the kinetics of the PfAQP expression during the development of the parasite we synchronized the cultures by sorbitol treatment and took samples in 12-h time intervals. Equal amounts of culture volume were analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 6 Bshows that the PfAQP protein is present throughout the complete transition from rings via early and mature trophozoites to schizonts. The increase in PfAQP protein levels evenly parallels the parasite growth. The apparent protein weight shows the same anomaly as the recombinant PfAQP expressed in Xenopus oocytes (first lane). The band is not visible in uninfected red cells and can be suppressed by pre-incubation of the anti-serum with the immunizing peptide (far right lane). Finally, we used the affinity-purified anti-PfAQP antiserum for immunofluorescence staining of P. falciparum parasites in blood smears (Fig.7). The parasite's pigment vacuoles are clearly visible in the bright-field images. The immunostaining covers the whole parasite with some brighter patches around the rim. No staining is visible in the erythrocyte cytosol or membrane. Although all cellular membranes have basal permeability for water and solutes, there is the need for facilitated transport when it has to occur either very rapidly or when there is only a small gradient driving the diffusion. With regard to the uptake of nutrients and biosynthetic precursors P. falciparum parasites in the host’s blood stream are exposed to the latter situation. The blood concentration of glucose in healthy humans ranges between 4 and 6 mm, whereas that of glycerol is usually lower by a factor of 100 (25Evans M.L. Matyka K. Lomas J. Pernet A. Cranston I.C.

https://openalex.org/W2121222760,"The epidermal melanin unit in human skin is composed of melanocytes and keratinocytes. Melanocytes, located in the basal layer of the epidermis, manufacture melanin-loaded organelles called melanosomes. Through their dendritic processes, melanocytes distribute melanosomes to neighboring keratinocytes, where their presence confers to the skin its characteristic color and photoprotective properties. In this study, we used murine melanocytes and keratinocytes alone and in coculture to characterize the processes involved in melanosome transfer. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced an accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes, whereas treatment with a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) induced exocytosis of melanosomes accompanied by ruffling of the melanocyte membrane. We found that keratinocytes phagocytose melanosomes and latex beads equally well and that this phagocytic process was increased by exposure of keratinocytes to UV radiation or to MSH. Coculture of melanocytes and keratinocytes resulted in an increase in MSH released to the medium. Gene array analysis of MSH-treated melanocytes showed up-regulation of many genes associated with exocytosis. In our studies, we never observed cytophagocytosis of melanosome-filled processes. This result, together with the other findings, suggests that a combination of signals that increase melanosome production and release by melanocytes and that stimulate phagocytosis by keratinocytes are the most relevant mechanisms involved in skin tanning."
https://openalex.org/W2165226803,"Cardiac sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, composed of Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits, couple the metabolic status of cells with the membrane excitability. Based on previous functional studies, we have hypothesized that creatine kinase (CK) may be a part of the sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex. The inside-out and whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology applied on guinea pig cardiomyocytes showed that substrates of CK regulate KATP channels activity. Following immunoprecipitation of guinea-pig cardiac membrane fraction with the anti-SUR2 antibody, Coomassie blue staining revealed, besides Kir6.2 and SUR2A, a polypeptide at approximately 48 kDa. Western blotting analysis confirmed the nature of putative Kir6.2 and SUR2A, whereas matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis identified p48 kDa as a muscle form of CK. In addition, the CK activity was found in the anti-SUR2A immunoprecipitate and the cross reactivity between an anti-CK antibody and the anti-SUR2A immunoprecipitate was observed as well as vice verse. Further results obtained at the level of recombinant channel subunits demonstrated that CK is directly physically associated with the SUR2A, but not the Kir6.2, subunit. All together, these results suggest that the CK is associated with SUR2A subunit in vivo, which is an integral part of the sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex."

Studies were made in mice lacking the p47phox subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase as well as in cultured mouse lung vascular endothelial cells (MLVEC) from these mice. In response to TNFα challenge, NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression were significantly attenuated in lungs of p47phox−/− mice as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The attenuated NF-κB activation in p47phox−/− mice was secondary to inhibition of NIK activity and subsequent IκBα degradation. Induction of neutropenia using anti-PMN serum prevented the initial TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in WT mice, indicating the involvement of PMN NAD(P)H oxidase in signaling these responses. Moreover, the responses were restored upon repletion with PMN obtained from WT mice but not with PMN from p47phox−/−mice. These findings were recapitulated in MLVEC co-cultured with PMN, suggesting that NF-κB activation and resultant ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells occurred secondary to oxidants generated by the PMN NAD(P)H oxidase complex. The functional relevance of the PMN NAD(P)H oxidase in mediating TNFα-induced ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity was evident by markedly reduced adhesion of p47phox−/− PMN in co-culture experiments.

The interaction of ICAM-1 with CD11/CD18 integrins enables PMN to adhere firmly to the vascular endothelium and thereby migrate across the microvascular barrier. Studies have shown that the transcription factor NF-κB is the key regulator of ICAM-1 gene expression following TNFα challenge of endothelial cells (4Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Signals mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation are initiated by the engagement of TNF receptor type I at the plasma membrane and then relayed through specific TNFR-associated proteins. TNFα-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) is an adaptor protein that interacts with TNFR type I and is required for TNFα-mediated induction of NF-κB (5Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). TRADD interacts in turn with two other adaptor proteins, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and forms a complex required for NF-κB activation (6Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 7Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), and further, it activates IκB kinases (IKKs), which in turn phosphorylate IκB proteins, a family of inhibitory proteins that sequester NF-κB as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκB triggers the rapid ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this inhibitor in proteasome complex (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The liberated NF-κB migrates to the nucleus where it binds to cognate κB enhancer elements and activates target genes such as ICAM-1 (10Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Generation of oxidants in endothelial cells serves an important signaling function in mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression and, thereby, promoting the stable ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity and firm PMN adhesion (11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 12Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Although TNFα has been shown to induce oxidative burst in PMN (16Balazovich K.J. Suchard S.J. Remick D.G. Boxer L.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 690-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the oxidants thus released can contribute to TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in the endothelium. The primary source of oxidative burst in PMN is NAD(P)H oxidase, a highly regulated membrane-bound enzyme complex, which catalyzes the production of superoxide by the one-electron reduction of oxygen using NAD(P)H as the electron donor. The core enzyme consists of five subunits: p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, p22phox, and gp91phox. In the basal state, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox exist in the cytosol as a complex, whereas p22phox and gp91phox are located in membranes of secretory vesicles and specific granules of PMN, where they occur as a heterodimeric flavohemoprotein known as cytochromeb558. Also, two low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, Rap 1A and rac1/2, are involved in the activation of the NAD(P)H oxidase. Upon stimulation, the cytosolic component p47phox is phosphorylated, and the entire cytosolic complex migrates to the membrane where it associates with cytochromeb558 to assemble the active oxidase (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the role of PMN NAD(P)H oxidase complex in mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression using mice genetically deficient in p47phox or gp91phoxsubunit of NAD(P)H oxidase and co-cultures involving mouse PMN and vascular endothelial cells (MLVEC) from these mice. We demonstrate that the functional impairment of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase and thereby of oxidant generation significantly delayed the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in both lungs and MLVEC of p47phox−/− or gp91phox−/− mice. Our data establish that the effects of NADPH oxidase inhibition were secondary to inhibition of NIK activation and the subsequent IκBα degradation.DISCUSSIONTNFα has been shown to play an important role in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells (1Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 13True A.L. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firm neutrophil adhesion requires the activation of NF-κB and the increased expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells (24Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Krunkosky T.M. Fischer B.M. Martin L.D. Jones N. Akley N.J. Adler K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Oxidant production is considered as a key event in mediating the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and initiation of NF-κB-dependent transcription of ICAM-1 (13True A.L. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rahman A. Bando M. Kefer J. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar); however, the fundamental question of whether oxidants derived from adherent neutrophils can contribute to and thus amplify TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells remains to be addressed. In the present study, we show a novel function of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase in TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling and, thereby, in the mechanism of the rapid expression of ICAM-1 and endothelial adhesivity to neutrophils.NAD(P)H oxidase complex is found in a variety of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase serves a critical function in host-defense against invading microorganisms (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase also appears to be qualitatively similar in its ability to induce oxidant signaling, although oxidant generation is markedly less in non-phagocytic cells (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using in vivoPMN depletion and repletion experiments, our results demonstrate that 1) neutrophil depletion in WT mice reduced TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression, 2) repletion with WT neutrophil of either WT or p47phox−/− mice restored ICAM-1 expression in response to TNFα challenge, and 3) repletion of WT animals with p47phox−/− neutrophils failed to restore ICAM-1 expression in response to TNFα. Thus, these data clearly demonstrate that neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase is an important determinant of the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. These findings are consistent with studies showing a role of NAD(P)H oxidase in the mechanism of NF-κB activation induced by alcohol in the liver (30Kono H. Rusyn I. Yin M. Gabele E. Yamashina S. Dikalova A. Kadiiska M.B. Connor H.D. Mason R.P. Segal B.H. Bradford B.U. Holland S.M. Thurman R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) or by surfactant D in alveolar macrophages (31Yoshida M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7514-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as the expression of monocytes chemoattractant protein and colony stimulating factor-1 in phagocytic cells in response to TNFα challenge (32Satriano J.A. Shuldiner M. Hora K. Xing Y. Shan Z. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Because lung tissue ICAM-1 assessed in the present study may be the result of ICAM-1 expression in multiple cell types (33Hubbard A.K. Rothlein R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we carried out studies using mouse MLVEC and neutrophils to address the direct role of the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase in mediating ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 5, WT neutrophils induced a rapid and augmented increase in ICAM-1 expression in both WT and p47phox−/− MLVEC, suggesting a direct interaction between neutrophils and MLVEC. Addition of the antioxidant GSH to the co-culture prevented the effect of WT neutrophil in inducing ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells, indicating that the interaction between neutrophils responsible for ICAM-1 expression in MLVEC is mediated through oxidants. Thus, the data support the concept that endothelial cells are important cellular targets for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidants and that they thereby mediate NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. This cross-talk between neutrophils and endothelial cells may contribute to the initial ICAM-1-dependent firm neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, and thus mediate the early-onset migration of neutrophils across the endothelial barrier.The endogenous NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial cells is also believed to be involved in signaling transduction (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that MLVEC from p47phox−/− mice demonstrated a lower expression of ICAM-1 in response to TNFα compared with WT MLVEC. This difference may reflect the role of endogenous NAD(P)H oxidase in signaling NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in these cells. However, when the MLVEC from p47phox−/− were co-cultured with WT neutrophils, expression of ICAM-1 in p47phox−/−MLVEC was elevated to same level as in WT MLVEC. This finding indicates that the exogenous oxidants from neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase are clearly important in inducing ICAM-1 expression.The present results indicate that the CD18 adhesive interaction between the neutrophil and endothelial cell is required for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. Although ICAM-1 is expressed constitutively in endothelial cells, its level increases in response to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli, including TNFα (34Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We also detected basal level of ICAM-1 by Western blotting. The anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody markedly reduced neutrophil-dependent NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells as compared with anti-E-selectin Ab. Thus, adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells mediated primarily by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 provides the appropriate coupling required for neutrophils to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells.NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression induced by TNFα are dependent on oxidants derived from neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase. These exogenous oxidants seem to be more important than oxidant signals generated endogenously in endothelial cells in mediating the early phase of the TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression. This is evident by the neutrophil adhesion experiments shown in Fig. 7. Within the 2-h period after TNFα challenge, addition of WT neutrophils caused an increase in neutrophil adhesion that was ICAM-1-dependent, because anti-ICAM-1 antibody prevented the response. In contrast, p47phox−/− neutrophils failed to adhere at these early time points consistent with the hypothesis that exogenously released neutrophil oxidants were critical for the early-onset ICAM-1 expression and resultant neutrophil adhesion. However, by 4 and 6 h after TNFα challenge, there was no difference in neutrophil adhesion between the WT and p47phox−/−neutrophils. Thus, it appears that the early phase of neutrophil adhesion is dependent on expression of ICAM-1 secondary to the release of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidants, whereas the latent ICAM-1-dependent neutrophil adhesion response is the result of other factors such as activation of the endothelial oxidant signaling machinery. Fig. 8 shows a model for the interaction of neutrophils and endothelial cells and the basis of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-induced transcription of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. TNFα has been reported to activate neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase through stimulation of tyrosine kinases (35Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schumann M.A. Leung C.C. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13124-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of our data, we postulate that reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase serve a signaling function in activating NF-κB in endothelial cells.Although oxidants are involved in the NF-κB signal transduction pathways, the molecular targets have not yet been defined. The contribution of redox regulation and location of potential redox-sensitive sites within the NF-κB activation pathway are the subject of controversy (37Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NF-κβ itself is a molecular target for redox regulation (38Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 39Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding activity of NF-κB can be regulated through reduction of a disulfide bond involving the cysteine residue 62 in p50 by thioredoxin (TRX) (38Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Takeuchi and associates (40Takeuchi J. Hirota K. Itoh T. Shinkura R. Kitada K. Yodoi J. Namba T. Fukuda K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that TRX inhibited TRAF2-, TRAF5-, and TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation but did not affect NIK-, IKKα-, and MEKK-induced activation, suggesting that TRX prevents NF-κB-dependent transcription downstream of TRAFs and upstream of NIK. Recently, Korn et al. (41Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide reduces NF-κB activation by inhibiting activity of IκB kinases in epithelial cells. It also appears that the ability of oxidants to induce NF-κB activity depends on the cell type being studied (37Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). In the present study, NIK activity was significantly reduced in p47phox−/− mice after TNFα stimulation, whereas there was no difference in the formation of the upstream TNFR-associated protein complex in WT and p47phox−/− animals. The present results show that the redox-regulated site is located downstream of TNFR-associated proteins. Thus, NIK is a potentially important redox-regulated kinase responsible for NF-κB activation. Redox regulation of NIK activity is further suggested by the presence of 22 cysteine residues in this molecule, which may constitute the redox-sensitive sulfhydryl switches (42Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to define the precise mechanisms responsible for redox-regulation of NIK.In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel function of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidant signaling in mediating the early-onset TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. Neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase mediates these responses through its ability to activate NIK. The results indicate that the endothelial cell is an important target for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase activity resulting in stable endothelial expression of ICAM-1. The functional relevance of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-induced endothelial ICAM-1 expression may be to induce the early-onset firm neutrophil adhesion and enable the rapid migration of neutrophils across the vessel wall to site of infection. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα,1 released during sepsis, promotes adhesion of neutrophil (PMN) to the endothelium by inducing the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a counter receptor for the leukocyte β2-integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 (CD11a/CD18 and CD 11b/CD18) (1Diamond M.S.

Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). TRADD interacts in turn with two other adaptor proteins, TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and forms a complex required for NF-κB activation (6Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 7Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) physically interacts with TRAF2 (8Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), and further, it activates IκB kinases (IKKs), which in turn phosphorylate IκB proteins, a family of inhibitory proteins that sequester NF-κB as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκB triggers the rapid ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this inhibitor in proteasome complex (9May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The liberated NF-κB migrates to the nucleus where it binds to cognate κB enhancer elements and activates target genes such as ICAM-1 (10Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of oxidants in endothelial cells serves an important signaling function in mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression and, thereby, promoting the stable ICAM-1-dependent endothelial adhesivity and firm PMN adhesion (11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 12Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Although TNFα has been shown to induce oxidative burst in PMN (16Balazovich K.J. Suchard S.J. Remick D.G. Boxer L.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 690-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether the oxidants thus released can contribute to TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in the endothelium. The primary source of oxidative burst in PMN is NAD(P)H oxidase, a highly regulated membrane-bound enzyme complex, which catalyzes the production of superoxide by the one-electron reduction of oxygen using NAD(P)H as the electron donor. The core enzyme consists of five subunits: p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, p22phox, and gp91phox. In the basal state, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox exist in the cytosol as a complex, whereas p22phox and gp91phox are located in membranes of secretory vesicles and specific granules of PMN, where they occur as a heterodimeric flavohemoprotein known as cytochromeb558. Also, two low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, Rap 1A and rac1/2, are involved in the activation of the NAD(P)H oxidase. Upon stimulation, the cytosolic component p47phox is phosphorylated, and the entire cytosolic complex migrates to the membrane where it associates with cytochromeb558 to assemble the active oxidase (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the role of PMN NAD(P)H oxidase complex in mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression using mice genetically deficient in p47phox or gp91phoxsubunit of NAD(P)H oxidase and co-cultures involving mouse PMN and vascular endothelial cells (MLVEC) from these mice. We demonstrate that the functional impairment of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase and thereby of oxidant generation significantly delayed the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in both lungs and MLVEC of p47phox−/− or gp91phox−/− mice. Our data establish that the effects of NADPH oxidase inhibition were secondary to inhibition of NIK activation and the subsequent IκBα degradation. DISCUSSIONTNFα has been shown to play an important role in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells (1Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 13True A.L. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firm neutrophil adhesion requires the activation of NF-κB and the increased expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells (24Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Krunkosky T.M. Fischer B.M. Martin L.D. Jones N. Akley N.J. Adler K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Oxidant production is considered as a key event in mediating the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and initiation of NF-κB-dependent transcription of ICAM-1 (13True A.L. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rahman A. Bando M. Kefer J. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar); however, the fundamental question of whether oxidants derived from adherent neutrophils can contribute to and thus amplify TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells remains to be addressed. In the present study, we show a novel function of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase in TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling and, thereby, in the mechanism of the rapid expression of ICAM-1 and endothelial adhesivity to neutrophils.NAD(P)H oxidase complex is found in a variety of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase serves a critical function in host-defense against invading microorganisms (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The non-phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase also appears to be qualitatively similar in its ability to induce oxidant signaling, although oxidant generation is markedly less in non-phagocytic cells (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using in vivoPMN depletion and repletion experiments, our results demonstrate that 1) neutrophil depletion in WT mice reduced TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression, 2) repletion with WT neutrophil of either WT or p47phox−/− mice restored ICAM-1 expression in response to TNFα challenge, and 3) repletion of WT animals with p47phox−/− neutrophils failed to restore ICAM-1 expression in response to TNFα. Thus, these data clearly demonstrate that neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase is an important determinant of the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. These findings are consistent with studies showing a role of NAD(P)H oxidase in the mechanism of NF-κB activation induced by alcohol in the liver (30Kono H. Rusyn I. Yin M. Gabele E. Yamashina S. Dikalova A. Kadiiska M.B. Connor H.D. Mason R.P. Segal B.H. Bradford B.U. Holland S.M. Thurman R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) or by surfactant D in alveolar macrophages (31Yoshida M. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7514-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as the expression of monocytes chemoattractant protein and colony stimulating factor-1 in phagocytic cells in response to TNFα challenge (32Satriano J.A. Shuldiner M. Hora K. Xing Y. Shan Z. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Because lung tissue ICAM-1 assessed in the present study may be the result of ICAM-1 expression in multiple cell types (33Hubbard A.K. Rothlein R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we carried out studies using mouse MLVEC and neutrophils to address the direct role of the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase in mediating ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 5, WT neutrophils induced a rapid and augmented increase in ICAM-1 expression in both WT and p47phox−/− MLVEC, suggesting a direct interaction between neutrophils and MLVEC. Addition of the antioxidant GSH to the co-culture prevented the effect of WT neutrophil in inducing ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells, indicating that the interaction between neutrophils responsible for ICAM-1 expression in MLVEC is mediated through oxidants. Thus, the data support the concept that endothelial cells are important cellular targets for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidants and that they thereby mediate NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. This cross-talk between neutrophils and endothelial cells may contribute to the initial ICAM-1-dependent firm neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, and thus mediate the early-onset migration of neutrophils across the endothelial barrier.The endogenous NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial cells is also believed to be involved in signaling transduction (17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that MLVEC from p47phox−/− mice demonstrated a lower expression of ICAM-1 in response to TNFα compared with WT MLVEC. This difference may reflect the role of endogenous NAD(P)H oxidase in signaling NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in these cells. However, when the MLVEC from p47phox−/− were co-cultured with WT neutrophils, expression of ICAM-1 in p47phox−/−MLVEC was elevated to same level as in WT MLVEC. This finding indicates that the exogenous oxidants from neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase are clearly important in inducing ICAM-1 expression.The present results indicate that the CD18 adhesive interaction between the neutrophil and endothelial cell is required for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. Although ICAM-1 is expressed constitutively in endothelial cells, its level increases in response to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli, including TNFα (34Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We also detected basal level of ICAM-1 by Western blotting. The anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody markedly reduced neutrophil-dependent NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells as compared with anti-E-selectin Ab. Thus, adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells mediated primarily by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 provides the appropriate coupling required for neutrophils to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells.NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression induced by TNFα are dependent on oxidants derived from neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase. These exogenous oxidants seem to be more important than oxidant signals generated endogenously in endothelial cells in mediating the early phase of the TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression. This is evident by the neutrophil adhesion experiments shown in Fig. 7. Within the 2-h period after TNFα challenge, addition of WT neutrophils caused an increase in neutrophil adhesion that was ICAM-1-dependent, because anti-ICAM-1 antibody prevented the response. In contrast, p47phox−/− neutrophils failed to adhere at these early time points consistent with the hypothesis that exogenously released neutrophil oxidants were critical for the early-onset ICAM-1 expression and resultant neutrophil adhesion. However, by 4 and 6 h after TNFα challenge, there was no difference in neutrophil adhesion between the WT and p47phox−/−neutrophils. Thus, it appears that the early phase of neutrophil adhesion is dependent on expression of ICAM-1 secondary to the release of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidants, whereas the latent ICAM-1-dependent neutrophil adhesion response is the result of other factors such as activation of the endothelial oxidant signaling machinery. Fig. 8 shows a model for the interaction of neutrophils and endothelial cells and the basis of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-induced transcription of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. TNFα has been reported to activate neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase through stimulation of tyrosine kinases (35Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schumann M.A. Leung C.C. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13124-13132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of our data, we postulate that reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase serve a signaling function in activating NF-κB in endothelial cells.Although oxidants are involved in the NF-κB signal transduction pathways, the molecular targets have not yet been defined. The contribution of redox regulation and location of potential redox-sensitive sites within the NF-κB activation pathway are the subject of controversy (37Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It has been reported that NF-κβ itself is a molecular target for redox regulation (38Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 39Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding activity of NF-κB can be regulated through reduction of a disulfide bond involving the cysteine residue 62 in p50 by thioredoxin (TRX) (38Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Takeuchi and associates (40Takeuchi J. Hirota K. Itoh T. Shinkura R. Kitada K. Yodoi J. Namba T. Fukuda K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that TRX inhibited TRAF2-, TRAF5-, and TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation but did not affect NIK-, IKKα-, and MEKK-induced activation, suggesting that TRX prevents NF-κB-dependent transcription downstream of TRAFs and upstream of NIK. Recently, Korn et al. (41Korn S.H. Wouters E.F. Vos N. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35693-35700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide reduces NF-κB activation by inhibiting activity of IκB kinases in epithelial cells. It also appears that the ability of oxidants to induce NF-κB activity depends on the cell type being studied (37Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). In the present study, NIK activity was significantly reduced in p47phox−/− mice after TNFα stimulation, whereas there was no difference in the formation of the upstream TNFR-associated protein complex in WT and p47phox−/− animals. The present results show that the redox-regulated site is located downstream of TNFR-associated proteins. Thus, NIK is a potentially important redox-regulated kinase responsible for NF-κB activation. Redox regulation of NIK activity is further suggested by the presence of 22 cysteine residues in this molecule, which may constitute the redox-sensitive sulfhydryl switches (42Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to define the precise mechanisms responsible for redox-regulation of NIK.In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel function of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidant signaling in mediating the early-onset TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. Neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase mediates these responses through its ability to activate NIK. The results indicate that the endothelial cell is an important target for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase activity resulting in stable endothelial expression of ICAM-1. The functional relevance of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-induced endothelial ICAM-1 expression may be to induce the early-onset firm neutrophil adhesion and enable the rapid migration of neutrophils across the vessel wall to site of infection. TNFα has been shown to play an important role in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells (1Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Firm neutrophil adhesion requires the activation of NF-κB and the increased expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells (24Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J.

The present results show that the redox-regulated site is located downstream of TNFR-associated proteins. Thus, NIK is a potentially important redox-regulated kinase responsible for NF-κB activation. Redox regulation of NIK activity is further suggested by the presence of 22 cysteine residues in this molecule, which may constitute the redox-sensitive sulfhydryl switches (42Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to define the precise mechanisms responsible for redox-regulation of NIK. In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel function of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-derived oxidant signaling in mediating the early-onset TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. Neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase mediates these responses through its ability to activate NIK. The results indicate that the endothelial cell is an important target for the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase activity resulting in stable endothelial expression of ICAM-1. The functional relevance of neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase-induced endothelial ICAM-1 expression may be to induce the early-onset firm neutrophil adhesion and enable the rapid migration of neutrophils across the vessel wall to site of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2047895017,"Type IIs restriction endonucleases recognize asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands at fixed positions, typically several base pairs away from the recognition site. These enzymes are generally monomers that transiently associate to form dimers to cleave both strands. Their reactions could involve bridging interactions between two copies of their recognition sequence. To examine this possibility, several type IIs enzymes were tested against substrates with either one or two target sites. Some of the enzymes cleaved the DNA with two target sites at the same rate as that with one site, but most cut their two-site substrate more rapidly than the one-site DNA. In some cases, the two sites were cut sequentially, at rates that were equal to each other but that exceeded the rate on the one-site DNA. In another case, the DNA with two sites was cleaved rapidly at one site, but the residual site was cleaved at a much slower rate. In a further example, the two sites were cleaved concertedly to give directly the final products cut at both sites. Many type IIs enzymes thus interact with two copies of their recognition sequence before cleaving DNA, although via several different mechanisms."

Sorger P. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 162-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in the mitotic spindle checkpoint, which censors against aneuploidy. These checkpoint proteins form complexes that regulate orderly chromosomal segregation and nuclear division (13Livingston D.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 536-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 14Orr-Weaver T.L. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Wassmann K. Benezra R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the high frequency of aneuploidy in human cancers, only rarely have genetic defects in mitotic checkpoint genes been found (16Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 17Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Albertella M. Taylor S.S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This suggests that events other than genetic changes may abrogate mitotic spindle checkpoint function and account for aneugenic alterations. We have employed HTLV-I-transformed human T-cells as a model to investigate the biology of the mitotic spindle checkpoint in cancers. Here, we report the prevalent loss of mitotic spindle checkpoint in six out of six HTLV cells. We further show that this defect in mitotic checkpoint function correlated with resistance by ATL cells to MTI agents. MT-1, MT-4, TL-Omi, TL-Su, ILT-Hod, and C8166 are human HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines (MT-1, MT-4, TL-Omi, TL-Su, and C8166 are IL-2-independent; ILT-Hod is IL-2-dependent). IL-2-independent cells and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (RPMI-FCS). ILT-Hod was cultured in RPMI-FCS with 1 nmIL-2. HeLa and SW480 were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. Primary human PBMCs from anonymous normal donors were obtained from the NIH blood bank. PBMCs were activated to proliferate by treatment with 20 units/ml of recombinant human IL-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.25 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in RPMI-FCS for 3 days prior to nocodazole assays. Nocodazole (Sigma) was added to medium at final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 μm, as indicated. Cells were harvested at 12-h time intervals up to 36 h. After harvesting, the cells were pelleted (1500 rpm, 5 min) and washed with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde. 20 μl of the cell suspension were dried onto a poly-l-lysine-coated slide, washed with PBS, and stained with PBS containing 10 μg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescent microscopy was used to visualize viable cells arrested in mitosis. To measure the mitotic index, at least 300 cells were counted in each assay. All assays were repeated two to three times. Quantitations of apoptosis by Hoechst dye staining and by TUNEL assay (not shown) were also similarly performed. Cytogenetic analyses of cells, where reported, were performed by the Cell Culture Laboratory of the Children's Hospital of Michigan. Suspension cells were incubated at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Twenty hours after the addition of nocodazole, [3H]thymidine was added (10 μCi/ml). Four hours later cells were pelleted and washed with 0.5 ml of PBS, then methanol/acetic acid (3:1) was added for 15 min to fix cells, followed by two washes with 0.5 ml of methanol/acetic acid. The cell pellet was solubilized with 0.25 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and transferred to scintillation vials. After addition of 5 ml of scintillant, incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by scintillation spectroscopy. Cells (5 × 104cells/ml) were treated with nocodazole (0.5 μm) or vincristine (0.5 μm) or 300 nm of flavopiridol and harvested at indicated intervals. Cell viability was measured by a modified MTT dye reduction assay using WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy- 4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Fraction viable cells represent the ratio of WST-8 values from cells treated with drugs relative to that from untreated cells. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm, washed in PBS, then resuspended into 0.25 mTris-HCl. After three freeze/thaws, the cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm; the supernatants were saved as the cytoplasmic fractions. The pellets were resuspended into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, sonicated to fragment DNA and were saved as the nuclear fractions. To inactivate potentially infectious HTLV particles, all fractions were adjusted to 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Anti-hsMAD2 and anti-hsMAD1 were raised in rabbit to GST-hsMAD2 and GST-hsMAD1 fusion proteins. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin (clone AC-15) was from Sigma. Chemiluminescent immunoblotting was according to manufacturer's procedures (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Visualized bands were detected by scanning and quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To understand how proliferative dysregulation of ATL cells might correlate with aneuploidy, we investigated mitotic spindle checkpoint function in HTLV-I transformed cells. The mitotic index of cells in response to MTIs (e.g. nocodazole or vincristine) reflects the status of this checkpoint. To verify our assays, we first examined two well characterized cancer cells, HeLa (a cervical epithelial cancer) and SW480 (a colon cancer), known to be spindle checkpoint-intact and spindle checkpoint-defective (16Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), respectively. In our hands, at any given time, 5% of asynchronously propagated HeLa or SW480 cells were in mitosis (M) (Fig.1 A). However, when exposed to nocodazole, the two cells responded quite differently. 24 h after treatment, ≥75% of HeLa cells arrested (i.e. mitotic index ≥75%) in M-phase (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, ≥75% of SW480 cells failed to arrest (i.e. mitotic index ≤25%) in M and exited mitosis (Fig. 1 A). These results are consistent with the reported phenotypes for HeLa and SW480. Next, we compared dose-titrated responses of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Jurkat cells (a non-HTLV-I-transformed T-cell leukemia), and two HTLV-I leukemic cell lines, MT-1 and MT-4, to treatment with nocodazole (Fig.1 B). PBMCs were first stimulated to proliferate with IL-2 + phytohemagglutinin for 3 days. Subsequently, PBMC, Jurkat, MT-1, and MT-4 cells were separately exposed to nocodazole at final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, or 1 μm, respectively. 24 h later, cells were assessed for mitotic indices. In the presence of MTI, both PBMC and Jurkat arrested in M, while MT-1 and MT-4 cells did not (Fig. 1 B). These findings support that the former, but not the latter, cells are spindle assembly checkpoint-intact. We extended the measurements of MTI-induced mitotic arrest to four additional HTLV-I-transformed T-cells (C8166, ILT-Hod, TL-Omi, and TL-Su; Fig. 2 A). In our asynchronous cultures, usually between 1.8 and 3.2% of these suspension cells were in M-phase (Fig. 2 B). Since normal PBMCs were relatively difficult to obtain frequently in large amounts for the many repetitions over which we performed these experiments, and since Jurkat cells had phenotypically intact spindle assembly checkpoint (Fig. 1 B), we employed the latter cells as positive control. When the HTLV-I and Jurkat cells were treated with 0.5 μm nocodazole and examined serially over time, we found that by 24 h of treatment >60% of Jurkat cells arrested in M (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, 80–95% of each of the six HTLV cells escaped arrest and exited mitosis (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that most, if not all, HTLV-transformed cells may be pervasively defective in the spindle assembly checkpoint. To assess the role of spindle checkpoint on MTI treatment outcome, we measured the apoptotic indices of nocodazole-treated cells. Quantitation of apoptosis based on Hoechst staining and TUNEL assays (data not shown) showed a variance in MTI sensitivity between Jurkat and HTLV cells. At early times after treatment (12 h, Fig. 3 A), all cells shared similar values. However, by 24–36 h after exposure to MTI, a high extent of apoptosis was observed for Jurkat but not for the HTLV cells (Fig. 3 A). Thus, when considered together with the data above on mitotic indices, apoptotic sensitivity to MTI correlated inversely with intactness of spindle checkpoint. Two control experiments excluded that the HTLV cells might have responded to MTI through non-apoptotic cell death or quiescence. First, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation by nocodazole-treated cells. Relative to Jurkat, each of the six HTLV cells (Fig. 3 B) incorporated significantly higher amounts of [3H]thymidine. An interpretation of these results is that nocodazole induced the arrest of Jurkat cells in mitosis (Figs.1 B and 2 A) and that prolonged arrest leads to apoptosis (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, because of their spindle checkpoint defect, the HTLV cells were not arrested by MTI and instead progressed unimpeded from M into the next S-phase (i.e. DNA synthesis and [3H]thymidine incorporation). Second, using the MTT colorimetric assay for cellular viability, we further quantitated the robustness of growth of cells treated with either nocodazole (Fig.4 A) or vincristine (Fig.4 B). The MTT findings confirmed the differential viabilities of Jurkat and HTLV cells propagated in the presence of MTIs. To better understand the reasons for spindle checkpoint loss, we inquired whether the human MAD1 or MAD2 checkpoint proteins might be mutated in the six HTLV cell lines. Full-length cDNAs for MAD1 and MAD2 from Jurkat as well as the six HTLV cells were sequenced. Surprisingly, except for sporadic polymorphic changes, MAD1 and MAD2 cDNAs from all the cells revealed intact open reading frames with no gross deletions or nonsense substitutions. 2Y. Iwanaga, unpublished data. This absence of overt mutation prompted us to consider mechanisms other than gross genetic changes for explaining spindle checkpoint loss in HTLV cells. We, then, examined the protein expression patterns of MAD1 and MAD2. Intact spindle checkpoint requires nuclear congression of MAD1 and MAD2 (18Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in surveying many different ambiently propagated animal cells, we found that in every cell type the great preponderance of MAD1 and MAD2 appeared in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Thus, nuclear migration of MAD1/MAD2 proteins potentially represents a regulatory step in checkpoint function. To ask whether this step might be defective in HTLV cells, we fractionated (by freeze-thawing) mock-treated and nocodazole-treated cells into insoluble “nuclear” (N) and soluble “cytoplasmic” (C) portions and probed for MAD1 and MAD2 proteins using specific antisera (Fig.5). Western blotting revealed that Jurkat cells, both constitutively and in a nocodazole-inducible manner, had higher amounts of nuclear MAD1 and MAD2 (Fig. 5A) when compared with each of the six HTLV-cells. Consistently, the “nuclear/cytoplasmic” (N/C) ratios for both MAD1 and MAD2 in the HTLV cells were ∼50% of that found for Jurkat cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Because physical fractionation of cells can be inexact, we sought to confirm the observation of reduced nuclear presence of MAD1 in HTLV cells by immunostaining. Fig. 6 compares the immunofluorescent images of Jurkat and HTLV-I-transformed C8166 cells using monospecific anti-MAD1 serum. In these confocal analyses, the Jurkat cells stained for MAD1 prominently in the nucleus with a punctate distribution (Fig. 6, top), while similarly stained C8166 cells showed a nuclear-excluded MAD1 pattern (Fig. 6,bottom). Nuclear sparing of MAD1 was also seen in the other five HTLV cells (data not shown). In principle, defects in cell cycle checkpoint might be exploited chemotherapeutically to the disadvantage of cancer cells. Here, spindle checkpoint-intact cells (i.e. Jurkat) when treated with MTI arrest transiently in M, while checkpoint-deficient cells (i.e. HTLV cells) do not arrest and continue into the subsequent G1. We reasoned that this difference could confer to the latter a heightened sensitivity to a combination of MTI plus a G1-specific inhibitor, while the former would be protected from G1toxicity as a result of MTI-induced M arrest. To check this reasoning, we treated in parallel Jurkat and HTLV-I-transformed MT4 cells with nocodazole alone, nocodazole followed by flavopiridol, or nocodazole simultaneous with flavopiridol (Fig.7). Cellular viabilities were assessed by MTT assay. Jurkat cells, as expected, were more sensitive than MT4 cells to nocodazole alone (Fig. 7 A). However, opposite relative susceptibility profiles were seen when a G1-potent inhibitor, flavopiridol (19Senderowicz A.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6600-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was added to nocodazole (Fig. 7,B and C). Checkpoint-defective MT4 cells exposed to either nocodazole followed by flavopiridol or nocodazole simultaneous with flavopiridol were significantly less viable than checkpoint-intact Jurkat cells. These effects relate to spindle checkpoint status and are independent of p53 activity, since both Jurkat (20Yamato K. Yamamoto M. Hirano Y. Tsuchida N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar) and HTLV-I-transformed cells lack p53 function (21Yoshida M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 475-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Cancer cells differ from normal cells at multiple genetic loci. In evolving from a normal to a cancerous state, cells lose some or many of the biological checkpoints which monitor the fidelity of DNA replication, repair, and segregation (22Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 166: 1821-1828Crossref Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). In different cancers, different losses in cell cycle control appear to be emphasized. For instance, most breast cancers have mutated p53 or pRb, leading to a defective G1/S control (23Stewart Z.A. Pietenpol J.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), while most colorectal cancers (85%) have lost the ability to censor against aneuploidy (24Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Here, we report that ATL cells are prevalently defective in the spindle assembly checkpoint that monitors for fidelity of chromosomal segregation during mitosis. What are some implications of checkpoint loss? A practical one applies to the treatment of cancers. Most current anti-cancer drugs have low therapeutic indices (25Kaelin W.G., Jr. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1503-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (i.e. toxic dose per therapeutic dose). In vivo, chemotherapy of tumors is limited by drug toxicity for normal cells. Molecular differences in checkpoint functions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues potentially permit selective drug designs that could target cancers while sparing normal counterparts. For example, initial results from model cell systems had encouraged the idea that loss of p53 (26Wahl A.F. Donaldson K.L. Fairchild C. Lee F.Y. Foster S.A. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) or p21 (27Stewart Z.A. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3831-3837PubMed Google Scholar) proteins might potentiate cellular sensitivity to MTIs such as taxol and vincristine. Unfortunately, this was subsequently called into question by difficulties in reproducing enhanced MTI susceptibility inbona fide human cancers (28Fan S. Cherney B. Reinhold W. Rucker K. O'Connor P.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1047-1054PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Further exacerbating the confusion were reports that loss of p53 increased (30Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and decreased (31Fan S., El- Deiry W.S. Bae I. Freeman J. Jondle D. Bhatia K. Fornace A.J., Jr. Magrath I. Kohn K.W. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5824-5830PubMed Google Scholar) sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. It, thus, remains unclear how p53 defects in cancers might be used to guide the chemotherapy of tumors. The spindle assembly checkpoint monitors integrity of chromosomal segregation during mitosis (12Gillet E. Sorger P. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 162-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Fan S., El- Deiry W.S. Bae I. Freeman J. Jondle D. Bhatia K. Fornace A.J., Jr. Magrath I. Kohn K.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) in a p53-independent manner. This checkpoint, activated in cells by exposure to MTIs, plays a central role in guarding against the emergence of aneuploidy. Current thinking assumes two links between the spindle checkpoint and oncogenesis: 1) defective spindle checkpoint is frequent in cancers (33Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar), and 2) defects arise from mutations in one of seven known spindle checkpoint genes (12Gillet E. Sorger P. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 162-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has questioned the presumed prevalence of spindle checkpoint loss in cancers (17Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Albertella M. Taylor S.S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and intensive searches for mutations in the spindle checkpoint genes have so far shown such changes to be exceedingly rare in human tumors (16Cahill D.P.

Hence, three questions remain to be clarified. What is the true nature of the spindle checkpoint in human cancers? How could frequent checkpoint loss be reconciled with the rarity of mutations in checkpoint genes? And if spindle checkpoint functions differ between normal and cancer cells, could this difference, in analogy to the thinking with p53, play a role in the clinical response of cancers to chemotherapeutic agents? Our findings here from HTLV-I-transformed cells begin to address the above questions. In studying six ATL cell lines, we found that 100% of the samples were defective in the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This suggests that loss of this M function is common, if not universal, in ATLs and argues that a similar defect could contribute to other tumors. Intriguingly, in HTLV-I cells, checkpoint loss does not require mutation in checkpoint genes. In these cells a not yet understood mechanism, which mislocates MAD1 and MAD2 proteins into the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 and 6), appears to explain loss-of-function. Cytoplasmic sequestration has also been reported for p53 in breast cancers (38Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This type of mechanism potentially reconciles the paradox of frequent spindle checkpoint loss in cancers unaccompanied by mutations in checkpoint genes (16Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J.

In good agreement with our findings of mitotic checkpoint loss, in a review elsewhere of 107 ATL cases, Kamada et al. (8Kamada N. Sakurai M. Miyamoto K. Sanada I. Sadamori N. Fukuhara S. Abe S. Shiraishi Y. Abe T. Kaneko Y. Shimoyama M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1481-1493PubMed Google Scholar) found all HTLV-I leukemic samples to be karyotypically abnormal. We have independently verified Kamada's conclusion of aneuploidy in ATL cells by direct cytogenetic examination of some of the HTLV-I cell lines used here (data not shown). For example, our MT-1 cell line showed a modal chromosome number of 83, and our TL-Omi cells had a modal number of 45. The TL-Su cells existed as two populations, one having a modal number of 48 chromosomes and a second having 94 chromosomes. By contrast, our particular Jurkat sample was largely tetraploid with a modal chromosome number of 92. Mechanisms for generating aneuploidy and polyploidy are not the same (39Zimmet J. Ravid K. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our cytogenetic results are consistent with HTLV-I cells being defective in the mitotic spindle checkpoint and Jurkat cells being lost in a different checkpoint, which guards against polyploidy. From a practical perspective, the prevalent M spindle checkpoint loss in ATLs is both daunting and potentially useful in structuring cancer chemotherapy. Current ATL treatments are challenging and largely ineffective (40Ohshima K. Suzumiya J. Sato K. Kanda M. Simazaki T. Kawasaki C. Haraoka S. Kikushi M. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Projected 4-year survival rates for acute- and lymphoma-type ATLs stand at 5 and 5.7%, respectively (41Shimoyama M. Lymphoma Study Group Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Our findings here offer some insight into the chemoresistance of ATL cells. Thus, we can explain for the first time why MTIs unto themselves have no apoptosis-inducing capacity and are of little therapeutic value for ATLs. Considering this mechanistic explanation and the empirically dismal treatment outcomes as well as potentially significant neuro and myeloid toxicities (42Dumontet C. Sikic B.I. J Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one may wish to re-examine the use of MTIs (e.g. vincristine) as a standard component of most ATL chemotherapy (43Matsushita K. Matsumoto T. Ohtsubo H. Fujiwara H. Imamura N. Hidaka S. Kukita T. Tei C. Matsumoto M. Arima N. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1999; 36: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our study does reveal that judicious combination of MTI with a G1 toxin could spare M-arrested normal cells while killing selectively non-arrested ATL cancer cells (Fig. 7). This aspect of spindle checkpoint loss merits further investigation and could potentially be important in the design of future cancer drugs that exploit this cellular phenotype. We thank M. Kannagi and M. Fujii for providing HTLV-cells and L. Lin for preparation of manuscript."

This activation of zeaxanthin is a key event in the regulation of light harvesting. non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching Resonance Raman energy-dependent chlorophyll fluorescence quenching Arabidopsis mutant lacking qE photosystem II CP26, CP29, minor PSII antenna complexes the S subunit of PSII, also known as CP22 When plants are exposed to high light intensities a sustained decline in the maximum photosynthetic quantum efficiency, called photoinhibition, frequently occurs. This inevitably leads to the drop in plant productivity, endangering the yield of agricultural crops (1Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis from Molecular Mechanisms to the Field. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford1994Google Scholar). However, plants have acquired a process of non-radiative dissipation of the excess light energy. This process is referred to as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ),1 and it is recognized as a central regulatory mechanism for protecting plants from the photodamage (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 65-84Crossref Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The major part of NPQ is induced as a response to the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and is referred to as qE. The xanthophyll cycle is the second factor that controls qE; under excess light conditions violaxanthin bound to the PSII light harvesting antenna undergoes de-epoxidation to zeaxanthin. The ΔpH and zeaxanthin allosterically control the proportion of light harvesting antenna that is in the dissipating state (3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. London B. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At physiological values of ΔpH, the formation of qE is mostly dependent on the presence of zeaxanthin. At present the molecular mechanism of qE has not been determined. A major obstacle has been the fact that it is a relatively complex process dependent upon features of an intact chloroplast membrane (2Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 65-84Crossref Scopus (1392) Google Scholar,3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. London B. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). New analytical approaches are required. qE has been shown to be associated with an absorbance change centered around 535 nm (ΔA 535), referred to as light scattering (4Ruban A.V. Young A.J Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,5Bilger W. Björkman O. Planta. 1994; 193: 238-246Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Many different experiments indicate that the ΔA 535 is closely associated with qE: inhibition of qE by antimycin removed ΔA 535despite ΔpH still being present (6Noctor G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 339-344Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar); the kinetics of formation and relaxation of qE and ΔA 535 are the same (Ref.4Ruban A.V. Young A.J Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, inset); close correlations between qE and ΔA 535 were found under a wide range of conditions in leaves and chloroplasts (4Ruban A.V. Young A.J Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Bilger W. Björkman O. Planta. 1994; 193: 238-246Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Noctor G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 339-344Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Particularly clear was the fact that the loss of qE in the npq4 mutant ofArabidopsis thaliana was associated with the loss of ΔA 535 (7Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Understanding the origin of ΔA 535 is therefore a key to elucidating the mechanism of qE. It has been suggested that ΔA 535 arises from selective light scattering and therefore indicates a change in membrane conformation (8Duniec J.T. Thorne S.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1977; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Theoretical analysis indicates that the selectivity could arise because of a presence of the granal structure of the chloroplast. Consequently, the close association between qE and ΔA 535 has been used to support the idea that quenching arises from large conformational transitions in the PSII antenna complexes in the grana (9Garab G. Faludi-Daniel A. Sutherland J.C. Hind G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2425-2430Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the npq4 mutant which lacks qE and ΔA 535 clearly has a normal granal structure (see Fig. 1 A). Hence, another possibility is that ΔA 535 arises not from selective scattering but from an electronic absorption change. We have shown that the qE-related absorption change has a detailed and complex structure, with absorption decreases also in the 400–500-nm region in addition to the positive change around 535 nm, suggesting an involvement of carotenoids (10Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when qE is formed in the absence of zeaxanthin, the absorption maximum of the ΔA 535 is significantly reduced and shifted to shorter wavelengths, around 522 nm (11Ruban A.V. Horton P. Young A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1993; 21: 229-234Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The suggestion was made that the ΔA 535 arose from a change associated with the presence of zeaxanthin. Recently, we have used Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy on isolated LHCII to identify the electronic transitions of the xanthophylls that contribute to the absorption spectrum in the 400–500 nm region (12Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was also possible, using RR difference spectroscopy to identify configurational features of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in whole thylakoid membranes (13Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The major principle of this approach is a very high selectivity. It relies on: (a) the fact that each xanthophyll has a specific absorption maximum position and a characteristic Resonance Raman spectrum, (b) resonance is achieved when xanthophyll absorbance bands are specifically excited by narrow laser lines, and (c) difference spectra between samples containing zeaxanthin and violaxanthin can be calculated using chlorophyll Raman bands. This approach provides a new opportunity to investigate the origin of ΔA 535. In this study we have been able to carry out RR spectroscopy on whole thylakoid membranes in the dark-adapted and dissipative states and most importantly to obtain data from leaves from wild type and the npq4 mutant ofArabidopsis. Pigment analysis and zeaxanthin purification was performed as described in Ref. 14Phillip D. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Asato A. Young A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reconstitution and purification of zeaxanthin in detergent/lipid micelles was carried out using a sucrose gradient method (15Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 339-344Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar. To induce maximum violaxanthin de-epoxidation, leaves were illuminated for 1 h, as described in Ref. 17Noctor G. Rees D. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 320-330Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar. Simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and absorption changes in leaves at 535 nm were performed using Walz fluorimeter combined with the SLM DW2000 spectrophotometer as described in Ref. 4Ruban A.V. Young A.J Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis of chloroplasts was carried out in a temperature-controlled cell with permanent stirring. Intact chloroplasts were osmotically shocked for 30 s. The reaction medium was with or without 5 mm Mg2+ to obtain thylakoids either with or without grana stacks. Leaf and chloroplast samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after induction of NPQ. Analysis of standard thin sections of Arabidopsis leaf samples was performed using CM10 Phillips electron microscope. Low temperature resonance Raman spectra were measured using a helium flow cryostat (Air Liquide, France) and a Jobin-Yvon U1000 Raman spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon, France) as described in Ref. 18Sturgis J. Robert B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. Excitation was provided by Coherent Argon (Innova 100) and Krypton (Innova 90) lasers (457.9, 476.5, 496.5, 488.0, 501.7, 514.5 nm, and 528.7 and 413.1 nm, respectively) and a Liconix helium-cadmium laser (441.6 nm). Fig. 1 B shows the spectrum of the absorption changes associated with qE (open circles). To overcome possible problems from light-induced absorption artifacts in intact systems such as leaves and thylakoids, this spectrum is the calculated difference spectrum between illuminated wild type and npq4 mutant samples (see inset). In addition to the maximum at 538 nm there are minima at 501, 468, and 438 nm. To initially test the hypothesis that all or part of this change arises from zeaxanthin, we calculated the difference spectrum that would arise from a strong red shift in its absorption spectrum. Firstly, this calculation used the recently estimated in vivo 0–0 absorption maximum position of zeaxanthin (503 nm) (13Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Secondly, the documentation of a number of absorption spectra of zeaxanthin in various solvents (ethanol, hexane, pyridine, bromobenzene, carbon disulfide) allowed to match correctly the bandwidth change with that of the 0–0 maximum (19Torii H. Tasumi M. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 3697-3702Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) during our simulation experiments. A shift of 22 nm was required to produce a difference spectrum between red-shifted zeaxanthin and that absorbing at 503 nm that reproduced the essential features of the qE spectrum (Fig. 1, solid line). If ΔA 535 originated from an electronic absorption change and belongs to a carotenoid, then it is predicted that there will be a qE-related change in the RR spectra of carotenoids. Indeed, the red-shifted zeaxanthin should resonate with the excitation lines 514.5 and, in particular, 528.7 nm of the argon laser. For such an experiment it was necessary to apply this technique to intact systems, either chloroplasts and/or leaves. The RR spectrum of carotenoids shows a number of characteristic features, an important one being the ν1 region (∼1510–1530 cm−1) assigned to the C=C stretching vibrations (19Torii H. Tasumi M. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 3697-3702Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Robert B. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1999: 189-201Google Scholar). The ν1 energy was found to be different for each of the chloroplast xanthophylls (13Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is partially due to a variation in the number of conjugated double bonds (CDB) (21Rimai L. Heyde M.E. Gill D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the 9-cis conformation of neoxanthin, which makes the corresponding ν1 energy distinctly higher than that of the all-trans violaxanthin, possessing the same number of CDB. Fig. 2 (A andB) shows the ν1 region of the RR spectrum ofArabidoposis leaves using 528.7 nm resonance frequency. Leaves were illuminated for 15 min to induce zeaxanthin synthesis and qE formation, and then allowed to relax in darkness for 10 min, to remove qE but with insufficient time to bring about any zeaxanthin de-epoxidation. The spectra recorded for illuminated (L) leaves and those subjected to subsequent dark relaxation (R) were different; there was a significant shift in the peak position from 1526 to 1523 cm−1, and the appearance of a shoulder around 1520 cm−1 (arrow). The difference spectrum, L-R, has a peak at around 1520 cm−1, the peak position of zeaxanthin When the complete RR spectrum was recorded, remarkable similarity was observed between the qE-related spectrum and that of zeaxanthin, either dissolved in pyridine or in detergent micelles. The both types of spectra had a ν1 maximum at 1520 cm−1 and also very close ν3 energy (Fig.3). Zeaxanthin dispersed in the detergent micelles appears to have an even more similar RR spectrum to that of the qE-associated change, particularly in the 1160–1280 cm−1 region, normally assigned to the C-C stretching modes, variably coupled to the xanthophyll electronic excited state.Figure 3Comparison of the Resonance Raman spectra induced by 528.7 nm excitation of zeaxanthin dissolved in pyridine (trace 1) and zeaxanthin in detergent/lipid micelles (trace 2) with the qE-associated Raman spectrum (difference spectrum of illuminated leaves minus recovered) (trace 3). Inset, enlarged ν4 region indicating pronounced structure enhancement for the qE-associated spectrum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is important to point out that the increase in RR intensity at 1520 cm−1 is not due to the synthesis of zeaxanthin. Because an excitation wavelength of 528.7 nm is being used, a shift to longer wavelength by zeaxanthin would give rise to the increased RR intensity. Indeed if a shorter excitation wavelength was used, no enhancement, or even a decrease in intensity was observed (see below). Four important control experiments were carried out to relate this RR spectral change to zeaxanthin and qE. Firstly, the experiment was repeated with the npq4 mutant of Arabidopsis. The spectrum for the illuminated and dark relaxed leaves were almost identical (Fig. 2 B and TableI), showing that when qE is absent the 1520 cm−1 RR change was also missing. Secondly, the experiment was repeated using isolated chloroplasts, prepared in such a way that they contained no zeaxanthin or were enriched in zeaxanthin (58% de-epoxidation state). For the chloroplasts containing zeaxanthin, a qE-related RR spectral shift was observed as for leaves (Fig. 2 C); in contrast, for those containing no zeaxanthin, and very little qE, there was no change in the RR spectrum (Fig.2 D, top traces). Thirdly, it is possible to inhibit qE and ΔA 535 in chloroplasts by depletion of the bound Mg2+ ions. Again, in the depleted chloroplasts light-dependent changes in the RR spectrum were almost absent. (Fig. 2 D, two lower tracesand Table I). Finally, the RR spectra were recorded for leaves ofImpatiens glandulifera, a plant, which had been found to exhibit stronger qE formation than Arabidopsis; in these leaves the amplitude of the 1520 cm−1 change was enhanced (Table I).Table INPQ-associated relative increase ν1 amplitude at 1520 cm−1 for 528.7 nm excitationdes1-aDES is the deepoxidation index defined as (Z + 0.5 A)/(Z + V + A), where Z, A, and V are the relative concentrations of zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and antheraxanthin, respectively.qE1-bNPQ is the reversible component of the photoprotected nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, calculated as (Fm/Fm′ − Fm/Fm""), where Fm, Fm′, and Fm"" are the levels of chlorophyll fluorescence before illumination, after illumination, and after subsequent dark recovery, respectively.Δν11-cΔν1 is the relative RR amplitude increase at 1520 cm−1 obtained by dividing the difference spectrum (treatment-control) by the spectrum of control.%rel.%1.A. thaliana leaves, wt20.9 ± 2.01.21 ± 0.1517.5 ± 1.02.

Using RR spectroscopy it is possible to determine the wavelength dependence for the resonance effect by recording spectra induced by various resonance lines (argon laser lines: 457.9, 476.5, 488.0, 496.5, 501.7, and 514.5 nm). Such excitation spectra are determined by the absorption spectrum of the pigment(s), giving rise to the Raman effect. Therefore, the qE-related change in intensity of the ν1region was measured (Fig. 4). For both chloroplasts and leaves, the excitation spectrum showed features consistent with the qE-associated absorption change (Fig. 1): along with the positive, 535-nm maximum, a negative region below 505 nm was clearly detectable. These data established beyond doubt that this change was due to electronic transitions rather than light scattering. The ν1 energy for each excitation wavelength in the qE-associated RR spectrum matched that of isolated zeaxanthin, clearly proving involvement of this pigment in theΔA 535. It was possible to estimate the number of zeaxanthin molecules that are responsible for the alteration in the RR spectrum. First we compared resonance Raman spectra obtained with 528.7 nm excitation for chloroplast samples containing only violaxanthin (Fig. 2 D,top black trace) to those treated to induce de-epoxidization (Fig. 2 C, black line). A maximum increase of 30% in the 1520 cm−1 amplitude took place upon formation of the estimated 15 molecules of zeaxanthin per both photosystems I and II. Although the maximum of absorption of zeaxanthin in vivois located at 503 nm (13Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the pigment is still capable of absorbing light at 528.7 nm. Calculations show that the corresponding optical density at 528 nm is ∼25% of the maximum at 503 nm. If all zeaxanthin would undergo the red shift to 525 nm after induction of qE, we should have observed at least a 16× rise in the RR signal, taking into account that the Raman intensity is proportional to the square of the oscillator strength. However, instead only a 1.7× rise was observed. This corresponds to (1.7/16)·15 = 1.6 molecules of the red-shifted zeaxanthin, contributing to the RR increase upon formation of qE. Thus only ∼11% of the zeaxanthin pool could be sufficient to account for the change in the RR spectrum associated with qE. How many molecules of zeaxanthin account for the size of the ΔA 535 associated with qE under these conditions? With an A 435 of 1.5, an ΔA 535 of ∼0.01 OD units was observed at a de-epoxidation state of 0.58 (15 molecules of zeaxanthin). If 360 chlorophylls give an OD of 1.5, 0.01 OD could arise from 2.1 zeaxanthin molecules, given the extinction coefficient ratio of chlorophyll/zeaxanthin = 1.25/1.44. Thus, the estimations made here show that just about two red-shifted molecules of zeaxanthin could explain both the RR spectrum and absorption spectrum associated with qE, thus proving that the absorption change is of an electronic nature. To shift the 0–0 absorption transition from around 503 to 525 nm would involve a large change in the local environment. For zeaxanthin dissolved in various organic solvents the energy of this transition is clearly dependent upon the refractive index of the solvent (22LeRosen A.L. Reid C.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1952; 20: 233-236Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Andersson P.O. Gillbro T. Fergusson L. Cogdell R.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 353-360Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Renge I. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 7452-7463Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In ethanol the maximum is at 482 nm shifting to 511 nm in carbon disulfide. A shift to from 503 nm to 525 nm would require a refractive index of about 1.8. Such a highly polarizing environment could also arise from a strong electric field of a dipole or charge in the zeaxanthin vicinity or binding site (25Reich R. Sewe K.-U. Photochem. Photobiol. 1977; 26: 11-17Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Gottfried D.S. Steffen M.A. Boxer S.G. Science. 1991; 251: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The signature of the specific binding of this red-shifted zeaxanthin can clearly be seen as a pronounced and characteristic enhancement of the ν4region of qE-associated RR spectrum (Fig. 3, inset). Six new transitions at 942, 949, 954, 959, 964, and 969 cm−1appear here, originating from wagging vibrations of the various C–H groups (27Saito S. Tasumi M. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1983; 14: 310-321Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Weesie R.J. Merlin J.C. Lugtenburg J. Britton G. Jansen F.J.H.M. Cornard J.P. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which became allowed due to a strong and apparently specific distortion of zeaxanthin molecule in the binding locus. Thus, the region contains a “fingerprint” of the binding site of the red-shifted zeaxanthin. We suggest that the highly hydrophobic photosystem II antenna complexes such as CP24, 26, 29, which are enriched in zeaxanthin (29Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 30Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and particularly the PsbS protein (CP22), known to be required for qE and ΔA 535(7Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) may provide such a specific protein environment. Thus the possible participation of zeaxanthin in the qE-associated conformational changes of the photosystem II antenna could be an inclusion of it into the quenching locus involving the PsbS protein. This activation red-shifts the S2 excited state of a subpopulation of zeaxanthin molecules by at least 22 nm. This suggests the possibility of a similar, albeit smaller shift (31Hashimoto H. Koyama Y. Mori Y. Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 1997; 36: 916Crossref Google Scholar, 32Andersson P.O. Bachilo S.M. Chen R.L. Gillbro T. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 16199-16209Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) of the forbidden S1level, which was first implicated as having a central role in qE (33Frank H.A. Cua A. Chynwat V. Young A. Godzola D. Wasielewski M.R. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and recently declined, because it was found to have very similar energy to that of violaxanthin (34Polivka T. Herek J.L. Zigmantas D. Åkerlund H. Sundström V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4914-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Frank H.A. Bautista J.A. Josue J.S. Young A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the S1 energy of the qE-associated red-shifted zeaxanthin may well be significantly lower than that of violaxanthin and therefore the activated zeaxanthin could indeed serve as a quencher. It should be noted, that the experiment with magnesium showed, that along with ΔpH, zeaxanthin and PsbS, an appropriate conformational state of the thylakoid membrane is required for qE. This implies a requirement for a specific arrangement of the quenching locus within the PSII antenna, which leads to the formation of an efficient dissipative state. In conclusion, we have shown that resonance Raman spectroscopy can be used to probe molecular events involved in complex regulatory phenomena in intact biological samples such as a plant leaf. It has particular potential when employed in the differential mode, comparing wild type with mutants and transgenic plants, and therefore will become an important postgenomic tool. Using this approach we have been able to explain for the first time the origin of spectral changes accompanying the photoprotective dissipation of excitation energy in plants. We have obtained direct evidence that zeaxanthin plays a specific role in qE, that only 1–2 molecules are needed and, most importantly, that qE requires activation of zeaxanthin by a dramatic change in its environment. This latter discovery provides a new primary focus for future research into the control of light harvesting in plants and will direct the search to determine the physical mechanism involved including the role of the forbidden excited singlet state and the ability of the red-shifted zeaxanthin to promote conformational changes within antenna complexes.

Here we show data to support the conclusion that the p40phox PX domain binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate specifically in vitro and localizes to endosomes in intact cells. In addition, its Y59A/L65Q mutant, which has decreased affinity for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in vitro, fails to target EGFP-p40-PX to endosomes. However, unlike published results, we find that the p47phox PX domain weakly binds to many phosphoinositides in vitro showing slightly higher affinity for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Moreover, we show for the first time that upon insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation of COS cells, the p47phox PX domain is localized to the plasma membrane, and this subcellular localization is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. Unexpectedly, its R42Q mutant that loses in vitrophosphoinositide-binding ability can still target EGFP-p47-PX to the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that the translocation of p47phox PX domain to the plasma membrane does involve 3′-phosphoinositide(s) in the process, but the phosphoinositide-binding of p47phox PX domain is not sufficient to recruit it to the plasma membrane.

It represents a widely distributed module with potential functions in regulation of vesicular trafficking, growth factor-receptor degradation in lysosomes, signal transduction mechanisms, and NADPH oxidase activity. Recently, PX domains have been shown to interact with different phosphoinositides and target the PX domain-containing proteins to specific subcellular locations (see Refs.2Cheever M.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the PX domain of CPK PI 3-kinase interacts with PI(4,5)P2 (6Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), while the p47phox PX domain has been reported to preferentially interact with PI(3,4)P2 (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Moreover, the PX domain of p47phox shows binding to its C-terminal SH3 domain (9Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase, consisting of both membrane-associated subunits and cytosolic subunits, plays a very important role in the immune defense system of neutrophils and other phagocytic cells (for a recent review, see Ref. 12Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in those subunits will result in dysfunction of the enzyme and clinically will cause chronic granulomatous disease. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease suffer severe, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. In the resting state, the subunits of NADPH oxidase are differentially localized to the membrane (gp91phox and p22phox) and to the cytoplasm (p40phox, p67phox, and p47phox). In response to invasive microorganisms, the cytosolic subunits of NADPH oxidase translocate to the membrane and fuse with the membrane-bound subunits to form an activated enzyme complex. The core part of the active enzyme consists of the cytosolic subunit p67phox, a GTPase Rac1/2, the membrane subunits gp91phox and p22phox, while p47phox is required for the assembly of the active NADPH oxidase complex acting as an adaptor for p67phox (13Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M.

(Tokyo). 2000; 128: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). p40phox has also been shown to be critical for the function of the active enzymatic complex (4Ellson C.D. Gobert-Grosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.-Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the functions of the two cytosolic PX domain-containing subunits p40phox and p47phox in the activation of NADPH oxidase, especially how they are activated and translocated to form a functional complex with the membrane-bound subunits. Recently, two reports have indicated that the PX domains in p40phox and p47phox bind to different phosphoinositides (4Ellson C.D. Gobert-Grosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.-Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, the p40phox PX domain can localize to endosomes in vivo by binding to PI(3)P. Here we report data that support the above conclusion regarding the p40phox PX domain (4Ellson C.D. Gobert-Grosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.-Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we find that the phosphoinositide-binding profile of the p47phox PX domain differs from the published data (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We also show that the p47phox PX domain can localize to the plasma membrane upon IGF-1 activation of COS cells and that the membrane targeting is sensitive to PI 3-kinase activity. However, this targeting function is not dependent on the phosphoinositide-binding ability of the p47phox PX domain. Our data suggest that the PX domains in NADPH oxidase can target subcellular membranes via direct or indirect recruitment by phosphoinositides, controlled by PI 3-kinase activity. All phospholipids used for the liposome binding assays were purchased and prepared as reported before (6Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes spotted with phospholipids from 100 to 1.56 pmol/spot (PIP-ArrayTM) were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories. DNA fragments encoding the p40phox PX domain (amino acids 9–140) and the p47phox PX domain (amino acids 2–125) were amplified from a human cDNA library (CLONTECH, from human spleen) and cloned into pXL1a vector (modified from pET15b) with the cleavage of NheI and SalI enzymes. For green fluorescent protein fusion, the coding sequence of p40phox PX domain was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) by the PCR-mediated addition ofXhoI and PstI sites to p40-PX sequence (amino acids 13–133). EGFP-p47-PX was similarly generated by the addition ofXhoI and BamHI sites to p47-PX (amino acids 2–116). The Y59A/L65Q double mutant of the p40phox PX domain and the R42Q mutant of the p47phox PX domain were made using the QuikChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The P73A/P76A double mutant and the R42Q/P73A/P76A triple mutant of p47-PX were similarly generated by using the wild type EGFP-p47-PX or EGFP-p47-PX R42Q mutant as the template. All cloned plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant pXL1a plasmids encoding the corresponding PX domains were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 0.5–0.6 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 6 h at 18 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and then cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C. After serial wash, the fusion protein was finally eluted from the beads with elution buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 125–250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) and then buffer-exchanged to liposome binding buffer. A published liposome binding assay protocol (6Song X. Xu W. Zhang A. Huang G. Liang X. Virbasius J.V. Czech M.P. Zhou G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used for the binding experiments with minor modification. The phospholipid mixture (100 μg/reaction) was dried in a SpeedVac (Savant). The dried mixture was then resuspended in 100 μl of liposome buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5); sonicated in a bath sonicator for 15 min; and spun for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The liposomes were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing 10 μg of purified protein and incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then centrifuged as before. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer. Then 25 μl of both fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The intensity of the stained bands was quantitatively determined with an LKB Ultroscan laser densitometer. Protein-lipid overlay assays were performed as previously described (19Dowler S. Currie R.A. Downes P.C. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), except that His6-tagged proteins were used in this study. Various phospholipids were dissolved in a mixture of methanol and chloroform in 1:1 ratio and then spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences) and air-dried. The membrane with various phospholipids was blocked in 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same solution with 0.2 μg/ml His-tagged protein. After wash with TBST buffer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:1,000 dilution of the anti-His monoclonal antibody (Novagen). The membrane was washed as before and then incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Finally, the membrane was washed with TBST buffer, and the His-tagged protein binding to the phospholipids was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad). Protein-lipid overlay assays with PIP-ArrayTM were performed while following the same procedure as above. COS cells were maintained and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After 16 h, cells were changed to serum-free medium for 3 h before further treatment. For transferrin labeling, cells were incubated for 15 min with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated human transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. For actin staining, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde following treatment with wortmannin (Sigma) and/or IGF-1 (Calbiochem). Cells were then permeabilized in PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 30 min with 1 unit/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in the same buffer. Cells were washed in the same buffer and mounted. We generated the p40phox PX domain as the His-tagged protein expressed in bacterial cells and investigated its binding affinity for phosphoinositides using a protein-lipid overlay assay. The purified protein was incubated with a membrane spotted with various phospholipids, and bound protein was detected with anti-His antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, p40-PX exhibited high affinity for PI(3)P, low affinity for PI(4)P, PI(5)P, and PI(3,5) P2, but no binding to other phosphoinositides. When lipid membrane spotted with serially diluted phospholipids (PIP-ArrayTM) was employed, p40-PX bound to PI(3)P at low concentrations and bound to PI(4)P and PI(5)P at relatively high concentrations, whereas binding to PI(3,5)P2 was only detected at the 100-pmol spot (Fig.1B). We further studied the phosphoinositide-binding selectivity of the p40phox PX domain using the liposome binding assay. p40-PX displayed remarkably selective binding to liposomes that contain 5% of PI(3)P (Fig. 1C). About 30% p40-PX protein was observed in the liposome pellets with PI(3)P, while less than 8% of p40-PX protein was observed in the liposome pellets with other phosphoinositides. To further characterize its binding affinity for PI(3)P, we quantified the percentage of p40-PX protein present in the supernatants and in the liposome pellets after incubation with liposomes that contain between 1 and 20% of PI(3)P (Fig. 1D). The PI(3)P binding of p40-PX was observed in liposome pellets with as little as 1% of PI(3)P and increased with increasing concentrations of PI(3)P in the liposomes until it reached saturation for liposomes containing more than 15% of PI(3)P. All of the results suggest that the p40phox PX domain selectively interacts with PI(3)P, consistent with the published reports (4Ellson C.D. Gobert-Grosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.-Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat.

Darsow T. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5308-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) caused by the loss of its ability to bind to PI(3)P (2Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Since these two amino acids are conserved in the PX domains of p40phox and Vam7p, we generated the corresponding double mutant (Y59A/L65Q) of p40-PX and examined its binding affinity for PI(3)P, using both the protein-lipid overlay assay and the liposome binding assay. In protein-lipid overlay assays, binding of the mutant to PI(3)P could be seen only at relatively high concentrations (Fig. 1B). The overall binding affinity was reduced to a level similar to PI(4)P and PI(5)P (Fig. 1, Aand B). The liposome binding assay also showed that the double mutant lost its ability to bind to liposomes containing PI(3)P. Less than 5% of total mutated protein was observed in the liposome pellets containing 15 or 20% of PI(3)P (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the double mutant of the p40phox PX domain selectively decreases its binding ability to PI(3)P. We tested the binding ability of the isolated p40phox PX domain to PI(3)P in vivo by fusing it to the C terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein and transfecting the EGFP-p40-PX expression vector into COS cells. The EGFP-p40-PX protein was found to localize to numerous cytoplasmic vesicles concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig.2A). This pattern of staining overlapped almost completely with the pattern of fluorescence obtained upon loading cells with rhodamine-conjugated transferrin (Fig. 2,B and C), indicating that the p40phox PX domain binds to endosomal membranes in vivo, where PI(3)P has been known to reside in intact mammalian cells (21Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 22Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J. Parton R.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24595-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, vesicular staining with EGFP-p40-PX was lost; instead, EGFP-p40-PX appeared as diffuse cytoplasmic staining with some localization to the nucleus (Fig.2D). Likewise, incorporation of the double mutation, which diminishes PI(3)P binding in vitro, resulted in a similar diffuse pattern in vivo (Fig. 2E). These results are consistent with the notion that the p40phox PX domain is capable of targeting to endosomes in vivo based on its ability to bind selectively and strongly to PI(3)P. We also generated the His-tagged p47phox PX domain and examined its binding affinity for different phosphoinositides by using protein-lipid overlay assays (Fig.3, A and B). When the same amounts of p40-PX and p47-PX proteins were used, p47-PX exhibited much weaker binding to all of the phosphoinositides tested, compared with that of p40-PX (Fig. 1B). Among the seven phosphoinositides, p47-PX showed relatively more affinity for PI(3)P, PI(5)P, and PI(3,4,5)P3, less affinity for PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(4)P, and no detectable binding to PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 3, A andB). We also examined the percentage of p47-PX bound to liposomes that contain from 5 to 15% of different phosphoinositides. Fig.3C shows the SDS-PAGE gels of p47-PX in the supernatants and in the liposome pellets containing different amounts of phosphoinositides, whereas Fig. 3D shows the binding percentage. In liposomes containing 5% tested phosphoinositides, about 40% of p47-PX protein was found to bind to PI(3,4)P2or PI(3,5)P2, whereas less than 25% of p47-PX protein bound to liposomes containing other phosphoinositides. However, the difference in binding affinity among all phosphoinositides tended to be less at higher phosphoinositide concentrations (Fig.3D). Both the protein-lipid overlay assay and the liposome binding assay showed that the p47phox PX domain bound to most phosphoinositides. However, they differ on the order of binding affinity. For example, the PI(3,4)P2 binding of p47-PX was not observed, and the PI(3,5)P2 binding was very weak in protein-lipid overlay assays, but it bound to both of them with a relatively high percentage in the liposome binding assays. The binding of p47-PX to the two phosphoinositides has also been reported before (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, p47-PX showed consistent binding to PI(3,4,5)P3, in both the protein-lipid overlay and the liposome binding assay. Recently, a point mutation (R42Q) in the p47phox PX domain was identified in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (24Noach D. Rae J. Cross A.R. Ellis B.A. Newburger P.E. Curnutte J.T. Heyworth P.G. Blood. 2001; 97: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of the mutation on phosphoinositide binding, we generated the R42Q mutant of the p47phox PX domain and applied it to both the protein-lipid overlay assay and the liposome binding assay. No binding was detected in the 5% liposome binding assay (Fig. 3E). Subsequently, the protein-lipid overlay assay also showed similar results. The binding to PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P was also reduced, whereas binding to PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, and PI(3,4)P2 was totally undetectable (Fig. 3, A and B). We fused the p47phox PX domain to EGFP, transfected the EGFP-p47-PX to COS cells, and then examined its localization in IGF-1-stimulated or -unstimulated cells. In basal cells, EGFP-p47-PX was found throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus with little if any association with the plasma membrane (Fig.4A). However, upon stimulation with IGF-1, EGFP-p47-PX appeared to collect at sites of membrane folding or protrusion (Fig. 4D). These are apparently sites of membrane ruffling, as indicated by the concentration of F-actin at these sites, detected by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Fig. 4E). Since growth factor-stimulated membrane-ruffling has been shown to coincide with PI 3-kinase products in several systems (25Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we tested whether the localization of EGFP-P47-PX was sensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. In the presence of wortmannin, EGFP-p47-PX failed to translocate to membrane ruffles (Fig.4G), and no substantial colocalization with F-actin could be observed (Fig. 4, H and I). Therefore, the membrane-targeting of EGFP-p47-PX is regulated by the PI 3-kinase activity. To test whether the membrane-targeting function of the p47phox PX domain is caused by the interactions between it and phosphoinositides, we generated the R42Q mutant of p47-PX, which had diminished binding to all PIPsin vitro, fused the mutant to EGFP, and examined its translocation and colocalization with F-actin on IGF-1 stimulation. Surprisingly, the mutant could still localize to the plasma membrane and colocalize with F-actin (Fig. 5,A–C). This suggests that the phosphoinositide binding ability is not sufficient to recruit the p47phox PX domain to the plasma membrane. In the p47phox subunit, the PX domain contains a PXXP motif that interacts with its C-terminal SH3 domain (9Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the membrane targeting of the p47phoxPX domain could be caused by the interaction between the polyproline motif in the PX domain and a SH3 domain-containing protein in the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we generated both the P73A/P76A double mutant and the R42Q/P73A/P76A triple mutant of EGFP-p47-PX and examined their translocation in COS cells on IGF-1 stimulation. Unexpectedly, both mutants still possessed the ability to translocate to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, D–I). These results suggest that the interactions, other than simple PX-SH3 interaction between the p47phox PX domain and some other protein(s) in the plasma membrane, might contribute to the membrane-targeting function of p47phox. The subunits of NADPH oxidase are separately located at the membrane and cytosol in the resting state. Once activated by the invading microorganisms, the cytosolic subunits will translocate to the membrane and form an active enzyme complex with the membrane-bound subunits. However, the detailed mechanism for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase is not yet understood. Recently, the PX domains in p40phox and p47phox were reported to bind to different phosphoinositides and may potentially target the cytosolic subunits to specific membrane locations (4Ellson C.D. Gobert-Grosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.-Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Our results support the published report about the p40phox PX domain. It is shown that the p40phox PX domain binds to PI(3)P specifically with high affinity, while the Y59A/L65Q double mutant almost abolishes its PI(3)P binding in vitro. We have also shown that the p40phox PX domain is able to colocalize with rhodamine-conjugated transferrin, an organelle marker for endosomal membranes in intact cells. This PI(3)P-dependent subcellular localization was lost for the Y59A/L65Q double mutant or after the transfected cells were treated with wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor. We find that the p47phox PX domain has varied phosphoinositide-binding patterns in different assays. In protein-lipid overlay assays, the p47phox PX domain showed an order of preference of PI(5)P > PI(3)P = PI(3,4,5)P3 > PI(4)P > PI(3,5)P2 = PI(4,5)P2, but it did not show binding to PI(3,4)P2. However, in liposome binding assays, the p47phox PX domain bound to most phosphoinositides, with an order of PI(3,4)P2 = PI(3,5)P2 > PI(3)P = PI(5)P = PI(3,4,5)P3 = PI(4,5)P2 > PI(4)P at low lipid concentration. In contrast, a previous report shows that the p47phox PX domain binds with high affinity to PI(3,4)P2 > PI(3,5)P2 > PI(3)P = PI(3,4,5)P3 > PI(4)P = PI(5)P = PI(4,5)P2 (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Our liposome binding data are consistent with the published data that suggest the p47phox PX domain binds to PI(3,4)P2 (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, the protein-lipid overlay assay shows no binding to PI(3,4)P2 in about 10 different experiments of our study. Unlike p40-PX, which distinctly interacts with PI(3)P, p47-PX shows conflicting evidence on its phosphoinositide binding from different binding assays. It seems that the p47phox PX domain does not have clear selectivity in binding to phosphoinositides. It has been noticed that p47-PX is a highly positively charged (28Ebisu K Nagasawa T. Watanabe K. Miyano K. Tamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24498-24505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) domain, and polyphosphorylation apparently gives phosphoinositides negative charge. The nonselectivity of p47-PX to phosphoinositides, as also seen for some PH domains, may be due to nonspecific electrostatic attraction between the positive face of the PX domain and negatively charged surfaces formed by acidic phospholipids (29Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In order to address this point, we have tested the binding of p47-PX to PI and PS, which are both negatively charged phospholipids. As in the protein-lipid overlay assay, no binding of p47-PX to PI or PS was presented (Fig. 3,A and B). We then generated liposomes in which PI or PS comprised 80% of the total lipid and contained up to 16-fold the phosphoinositides in the previous liposome binding assays for p47-PX. However, less than 15% of p47-PX protein was found to bind to PS (data not shown), still lower than the percentage in the previous studies with most phosphoinositides, while no binding to PI was present. Hence, the nonspecific electrostatic interaction seems to exist in the liposome binding assays at higher concentrations but is unlikely to account for all of the phosphoinositide-binding affinity of p47-PX. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that nonspecific binding exists in protein-lipid overlay assays, it is likely that the PX domain of p47phox possesses the ability to interact with multiple lipid ligands, since it displays preference for PI(3,4,5)P3and some affinity for PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 in this study, while its binding to PI(3,4)P2 has also been previously observed (5Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). All of these 3′-phosphoinositides are the products of PI 3-kinases. In order to examine the potential targeting function of the p47phox PX domain, we fused it with EGFP and introduced it into COS cells. In unstimulated cells, EGFP-p47-PX was not localized to endosomes, despite the PI(3)P binding ability in vitro (Fig.4A). However, when cells were treated with IGF-1, EGFP-p47-PX translocated to discrete plasma membrane sites, which corresponded to the membrane ruffles as evidenced by colocalization of EGFP-p47-PX with phalloidin-stained F-actin; pretreatment with wortmannin abolished this phenomenon (Fig. 4). Our data show for the first time that the p47phox PX domain can target the plasma membrane, and the targeting function is dependent on the PI 3-kinase activity. PI 3-kinase plays a very important role in the activation of NADPH oxidase (30Bae Y.S. Sung J. Kim O Hur K.C. Kazlauskas A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, membrane ruffling induced by insulin or growth factors is found to correlate with the production of PI(3,4,5)P3 (38Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R. Klippel A. Williams L.T.

Clodi M. Martin S.S. Imamura T. Kavanaugh W.M. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The observed colocalization of the transfected EGFP-p47-PX and membrane ruffles in COS cells on IGF-1 stimulation may suggest that translocation of the p47phox PX domain and formation of membrane ruffles are either under similar regulation or actually in the same pathway, at least for PI 3-kinase activity. Also, the phosphoinositide-binding ability of p47-PX especially to PI(3,4,5)P3 is seemingly critical for its membrane association. However, the R42A mutant of the p47phoxPX domain still possesses the ability of membrane targeting, while it completely loses phosphoinositide-binding ability in vitro. Thus, the p47phox PX domain localizes to the plasma membrane in a mechanism other than simple phosphoinositide recruitment, although it is apparently downstream of PI 3-kinase activation. Moreover, the mutations in the PXXP motif within p47-PX cannot abolish its membrane association. This suggests that some interactions, other than a simple PX-SH3 interaction between the p47phox PX domain and some other protein(s), play a role in its translocation to the plasma membrane. In summary, we have shown that the two PX domains in NADPH oxidase bind to different phosphoinositides in vitro and target different subcellular locations in COS cells via different pathways controlled by PI 3-kinase. The targeting function of the p40phox PX domain directly involves its binding to PI(3)P, while phosphoinositides are not sufficient to directly recruit the p47phox PX domain to the plasma membrane. Interactions with some proteins are more likely to contribute to the membrane translocation of p47phox PX domain. We thank Dr. Michael P. Czech for support and advice and Dr. Chuanyou Zhang and Dr. Kimmy Yuan for technical help. We also thank Dr. Zhen Y. Jiang and members in the Zhou laboratory for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1618949780,"Normally, tissue factor (TF) is not expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, but its expression can be induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. However, the signaling pathway(s) affecting this induction is unknown. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we found that inhibitors of guanine-cytosine-rich DNA binding protein and nuclear factor (NF)-kB suppressed VEGF- and TNF-a-induced expression and activity of TF. However, unexpectedly, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase inhibitor enhanced the VEGF- and TNF-a-induced expression and activity of TF. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), a strong activator of intracellular PI 3'-kinase/Akt, inhibited the induction of TF by VEGF and TNF-a, whereas Ang1 itself did not produce any significant effect on TF. Selective activation (or inactivation) of PI 3'-kinase/Akt by using adenoviral transfer reduced (or enhanced) TNF-a-induced expression of TF mRNA and protein, regardless of Ang1 treatment. From these results, we conclude that Ang1 inhibits the up-regulation of TF expression, possibly through activation of PI 3'-kinase/Akt in endothelial cells. Ang1 may be useful as an inhibitor of VEGF- and TNF-a-induced coagulation, inflammation, and cancer progression."

Whereas the association of insulin resistance with increased concentrations of intramuscular triacylglycerol is well recognized (1Phillips D.I. Caddy S. Ilic V. Fielding K.N. Borthwick A.C. Taylor R.

In ob/ob mice, the absence of leptin results in a phenotype characterized by obesity and insulin resistance, and treatment with recombinant leptin results in a rapid reduction in body adiposity and the restoration of insulin sensitivity (4Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker B.M. Hecht R. Winter D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, an essential tissue responsible for regulating whole body lipid and glucose metabolism, leptin has been shown to increase fatty acid oxidation and intramuscular triacylglycerol hydrolysis acutely (<1 h) (5Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Fiedorek F.T.J. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A.

Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The effects of chronic (>7 days) leptin treatment on skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake have not been examined. Several studies have demonstrated that chronic leptin treatment in lean and diabetic rats as well as ob/ob mice leads to reduced body mass and results in significant reductions in circulating insulin, independent of reduced food intake (8Chinookoswong N. Wang J.-L. Shi Z.-Q. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Wang J.-L. Chinookoswong N. Scully S. Qi M. Shi Z.-Q.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), suggesting an improved insulin sensitivity. Chronic hyperleptinemia has also been shown to increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (3Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chinookoswong N. Wang J.-L. Shi Z.-Q. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, this is not due to increased GLUT-4 expression, suggesting that leptin may be altering the transporter's intrinsic activity and/or translocation to the sarcolemma (9Wang J.-L. Chinookoswong N. Scully S. Qi M. Shi Z.-Q. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible mechanism for improved insulin sensitivity may be the decrease of intramuscular triacylglycerols observed in red skeletal muscle following leptin treatment (3Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since intramuscular triacylglycerol accumulation is correlated with insulin resistance (1Phillips D.I. Caddy S. Ilic V. Fielding K.N. Borthwick A.C. Taylor R. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2Pan D.A. Lillioja A.D. Kriketos M.R. Baur L.A.

Diabetes. 1991; 40: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which chronic leptin treatment alters intramuscular triacylglycerol concentrations. A possible mechanism contributing to the insulin-induced reductions in intramuscular triacylglycerols may occur at the level of fatty acid transport into the muscle cell.Fatty acids traverse the plasma membrane via passive diffusion and a protein-mediated mechanism (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins have been shown to facilitate fatty acid transport, including the fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36)1 and plasma membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm) (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) was initially thought to be a fatty acid transporter (13Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), recent studies have shown that FATP1 is a very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (14Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The cytosolic, 15-kDa fatty acid-binding protein (FABPc) is also an important feature of the fatty acid transport system, since it acts as a fatty acid sink once fatty acids have crossed the plasma membrane (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In muscle, FABPc is present in great excess and therefore does not limit fatty acid uptake (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, increasing the expression of FAT/CD36 in skeletal muscle increases fatty acid transport and oxidation (15Ibrahimi A. Bonen A. Blinn W.D. Hajr T. Li X. Zhong K. Cameron R. Abumurad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26761-26766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), whereas in FAT/CD36 null mice the uptake of fatty acids is reduced (16Febbraio M. Abumurad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms besides altered FAT/CD36 expression can also regulate fatty acid transport. In contracting muscles, FAT/CD36 is translocated, within minutes, from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, resulting in an increased rate of fatty acid transport (17Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Arumugam Y. Glatz J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14501-14508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Thus, skeletal muscle fatty acid transport can be affected in a number of ways, by altering the expression of FAT/CD36 and/or relocating this protein to the plasma membrane.A link between leptin-induced reductions in intramuscular triacylglycerol depots and improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle may be the reduced uptake of fatty acids into the muscle cell. Fatty acids are known to induce insulin resistance in muscle (18Boden G. Diabetes Care. 1996; 19: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and limiting their entry into the muscle cell may be expected to reduce fatty acids available for esterification, thereby improving insulin sensitivity. We therefore hypothesized that chronic leptin treatment can lead to a reduced rate of fatty acid transport into muscle due to reductions in skeletal muscle fatty acid transporters, FAT/CD36 and FABPpm. We have examined the effects of chronic hyperleptinemia (2 weeks) on fatty acid transport, the expression of fatty acid transporters (FAT/CD36 and FABPpm), and their localization in the plasma membrane. The present studies have shown that leptin treatment (2 weeks) repressed FAT/CD36 expression in muscle and reduced plasma membrane FAT/CD36 and FABPpm, which resulted in a reduced fatty acid transport across the sarcolemmal membrane.DISCUSSIONThe movement of fatty acids across the sarcolemma involves the fatty acid transporters FAT/CD36 (25Abumurad N.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28626-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggest that there may be hormonal regulation of fatty acid transporter expression, resulting in altered rates of plasmalemmal fatty acid transport. Leptin may be one of the endocrine signals regulating fatty acid transporter expression, and skeletal muscle may be an important target for leptin. This tissue is important for regulating fatty acid homeostasis because of its mass (40% of body weight) and highly variable metabolic rate.In isolated muscles, the acute (≤60 min) effects of leptin include an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation and a concomitantly reduced rate of esterification (5Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Fiedorek F.T.J. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged hyperleptinemia (6–14 days) reduces muscle triacylglycerol depots (30Shimabukuro M.K. Koyama G. Chen M.-Y. Wang F. Trieu Y. Lee C.B. Newgard Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), an effect that may be achieved, in part, by reducing the protein mediated uptake of fatty acids into the myocyte. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of chronically (14 days) elevated circulating leptin levels on fatty acid transporter expression and localization in red and white rat skeletal muscle as well as on fatty acid transport into giant sarcolemmal vesicles derived from these two types of muscle. Several novel findings are reported in this study. Leptin treatment reduced FAT mRNA abundance and the expression of FAT/CD36 protein, while FABPpm mRNA and protein expression were not altered; however, both of the fatty acid transport proteins, FAT/CD36 and FABPpm, located at the plasma membrane were reduced, which resulted in a reduced rate of fatty acid transport into red and white skeletal muscle giant sarcolemmal vesicles. These effects were not observed in pair-fed animals that lost the same body weight as the leptin-treated animals.Importantly, the chronic (2 weeks) effects of leptin on fatty acid uptake and transporters are not comparable with studies in which isolated muscles have been acutely (≤60 min) exposed to leptin (5Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Fiedorek F.T.J. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar). In those studies, leptin did not alter fatty acid uptake; rather, leptin repartitioned the fatty acids taken up toward oxidation and away from esterification (5Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Fiedorek F.T.J. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Muoio D.M. Dohn G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we induced moderate levels of hyperleptinemia (∼4-fold increase), a level that is similar to that obtained following 2 weeks of high fat feeding in rodents (5Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This physiologic increase in leptin reduced intramuscular triacylglycerol depots and circulating insulin and fatty acids, while not altering circulating glucose concentrations. These results parallel studies in which pharmacological levels of leptin have been administered (8Chinookoswong N. Wang J.-L. Shi Z.-Q. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30Shimabukuro M.K. Koyama G. Chen M.-Y. Wang F. Trieu Y. Lee C.B. Newgard Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metabolism. 1999; 48: 671-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Yaspelkis B.B. Davis J.R. Saberi M. Smith T.L. Jazayeri R. Singh M. Fernandez V. Trevino B. Chinookoswong N.

Physiol. 1999; 277: E291-E298PubMed Google Scholar). Since the serum insulin concentrations were already quite low in the control animals, it seems unlikely that a retarded rate of insulin-stimulated fatty acid esterification, rather than the increased leptin concentrations, accounted for the reduction in the intramuscular triacylglycerol depots. The reduction in circulating fatty acids is probably due to a selective depletion of the labile visceral adipose stores (19Barzilia N. Wang J. Massilon D. Vuguin P. Hawkins M. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the short term (a time point not measured in this study), it would be expected that serum FA levels would be elevated, but as the fat mass decreases with prolonged leptin treatment, FA levels may become normalized (9Wang J.-L. Chinookoswong N. Scully S. Qi M. Shi Z.-Q. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Barzilia N. Wang J. Massilon D. Vuguin P. Hawkins M. Rossetti L. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The repression of FAT/CD36, after 2 weeks of leptin treatment, is probably not attributable to the change in circulating glucose, insulin, or fatty acids. Glucose concentrations were not changed in the leptin-treated animals, and based on evidence from other studies in our laboratory, there is also no relationship between the expression of fatty acid transporters and the circulating levels of either insulin or fatty acids. For example, reductions in circulating insulin, induced by leptin (present study) or severe diabetes (34Pelsers M.L. Lutgerink J.T. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Tandon N.N. van der Vusse G.J. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H.R. Glatz J.F.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2J. J. F. P. Luiken, unpublished data. are associated with either a decrease (leptin) or an increase (diabetes) in fatty acid transporters. An increase in circulating insulin, such as observed in obese Zucker rats, does not alter skeletal muscle fatty acid transporter expression (35Luiken J.J.F.P. Arumugam Y. Dyck D.J. Bell R.C. Pelsers M.L. Turcotte L.P. Tandon N.N. Glatz J.F.C. Bonen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40567-40573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that increasing circulating fatty acids, 6-fold in excess of the normal physiological range, reduces total FAT/CD36 expression (36Hevener A.L. Reichart D. Janez A. Olefsky J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). But, in studies in our laboratory we do not observe a relationship between circulating fatty acids and FAT/CD36 or FABPpm expression. When circulating fatty acids are increased (severe diabetes2; obese Zucker rats (35Luiken J.J.F.P. Arumugam Y. Dyck D.J. Bell R.C. Pelsers M.L. Turcotte L.P. Tandon N.N. Glatz J.F.C. Bonen A. J.

Arumugam Y. Dyck D.J. Bell R.C. Pelsers M.L. Turcotte L.P. Tandon N.N. Glatz J.F.C. Bonen A. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 337: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 With mild diabetes, circulating fatty acids are not altered, yet fatty acid transporter expression is increased.2 Thus, the available evidence suggests that neither glucose, insulin, nor fatty acids are associated with changes in the expression of FAT/CD36. Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that the present results are attributable to leptin.The reduced serum insulin and unaltered glucose concentrations indicated that insulin sensitivity was improved, an observation that has previously been observed following chronic leptin treatment (3Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chinookoswong N. Wang J.-L. Shi Z.-Q.

This improved insulin sensitivity is probably due to the reductions in muscle triacylglycerol depots, since the relationship between elevated intramuscular triacylglycerol depots and impaired insulin sensitivity is well established in rodents (3Buettner R. Newgard C.B. Rhodes C.J. O'Doherty R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E563-E569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Pascoe W.S. Khouri S. Kraegen E.W.

Invest. 1997; 46: 983-987Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism(s) are unknown. It has been suggested that intramuscular triacylglycerol depots may reduce insulin sensitivity by impairing the insulin-signaling pathway (37Han D-H. Hansen P.A. Host H.H. Holloszy J.O. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kim J.K. Wi J.K. Young J.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since fatty acid transport in the leptin-treated animals was reduced, this may also contribute to reducing the intramuscular triacylglycerol depots and in this manner contribute to the improved insulin sensitivity observed in leptin-treated animals.The giant sarcolemmal vesicle preparation used in our studies allows for a true measurement of FA transport, independent of metabolism (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other preparations that have been used to measure FA transport, such as hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes (28Memon R.A. Fuller J. Moser A.H. Smith P.J. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D.D. Fan X. Bradbury M.W. J. Biol.

Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J.

Therefore, the giant sarcolemmal vesicle preparation used in the present study provides an appropriate model with which to examine leptin's effects on FA transport in skeletal muscle.In the present study, we observed that chronic leptin treatment reduces palmitate transport into giant sarcolemmal vesicles. This reduction was associated with concomitant reductions in plasma membrane FAT/CD36 and FABPpm proteins. Previously, we have shown that fatty acid uptake in heart and skeletal muscle is highly correlated with the fatty acid transporters, FAT/CD36 and FABPpm, but not FATP1, located at the plasma membrane (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P.

This correlation between these plasmalemmal fatty acid transporters and fatty transport was confirmed in the present studies (Fig. 7). It is believed that FABPpm and FAT/CD36 may interact with each other to facilitate fatty acid uptake across the sarcolemma (12Bonen A. Luiken J.J.F.P. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the specific role of each transporter has not been completely elucidated. It is known that both proteins are critical for mediating fatty acid transport in skeletal muscle, because blocking of either transporter results in significantly reduced rates of fatty acid uptake (39Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While chronic leptin treatment led to significant reductions in both FAT/CD36 and FABPpm protein in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle, the mechanisms by which these reductions occurred were different for the two transport proteins.The regulation of expression of FAT/CD36 and FABPpm has been examined in only a few studies. At the level of their mRNAs, one or both of these transporters are altered in some but not all models of genetic ob"

To identify Densin-180-binding proteins, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the carboxyl-terminal fragment of Densin-180 containing PDZ domain as bait, and we isolated δ-catenin/neural plakophilin-related armadillo repeat protein (NPRAP) as a Densin-180-interacting protein. δ-catenin/NPRAP, a member of the armadillo repeat family, is a nervous system-specific adherens junction protein originally discovered as an interactor with presenilin-1, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. Densin-180 PDZ domain binds the COOH terminus of δ-catenin/NPRAP containing the PDZ domain-binding sequence. Endogenous Densin-180 was co-immunoprecipitated with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin. Although Densin-180 was reported to be a transmembrane protein, Densin-180 was not accessible to surface biotinylation in dissociated hippocampal neurons; hence Densin-180 may be a cytosolic protein. Densin-180 co-localized with δ-catenin/NPRAP at synapses in dissociated hippocampal neurons. We propose that Densin-180 is associated in vivo with δ-catenin/NPRAP and may be involved in organization of the synaptic cell-cell junction through interaction with the δ-catenin/NPRAP-N-cadherin complex.

PSD has specific receptors for glutamate as well as numerous receptor-associated proteins; hence PSD can be regarded as a proteinaceus organelle specialized for postsynaptic signal transduction (4Sheng M.

Four splice variants (A–D) of the putative cytosolic tail of Densin-180 are differentially expressed during development of the rat brain (7Strack S. Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol.

It was also reported that Densin-180 forms a ternary complex with the α-subunit of CaMKII and α-actinin (6Walikonis R.S. Oguni A. Khorosheva E.M. Jeng C.-J. Asuncion F.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 423-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Densin-180 belongs to a recently identified family of PDZ domain-containing proteins. These proteins include Scribble, a Drosophila protein essential for epithelial integrity (8Bilder D. Perrimon N. Nature. 2000; 403: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) with tumor suppressive function (9Bilder D., Li, M. Perrimon N.

In addition to the PDZ domain in the COOH termini, members of this family have 16 leucine-rich repeats in the NH2 termini and have thus been named LAP (for leucine-rich repeats and PDZ) proteins (10Borg J.-P. Marchetto S., Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaíäde J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To identify proteins interacting with Densin-180, we screened a human brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid procedure and the putative intracellular domain of Densin-180 as bait. We isolated δ-catenin/neural plakophilin-related armadillo repeat protein (NPRAP) (12Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M., Ho, C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. NeuroReport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Paffenholz R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as a potential binding partner for Densin-180. δ-catenin was identified based on its ability to bind to the loop region of presenilin-1, which is encoded by the gene most commonly mutated in familial Alzheimer's disease (12Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M., Ho, C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. NeuroReport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Independently, the same gene was identified as a protein homologous to plakophilin 1 and was termed NPRAP (13Paffenholz R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). δ-catenin/NPRAP is a member of the p120 catenin subfamily, defined as proteins with 10 armadillo repeats (in contrast to the 13 armadillo repeats of β-catenin) in characteristic spacing and often with quite diverse NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences that flank the repeats (14Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). δ-catenin is reported to co-localize and interact with N-cadherin in the mouse brain (15Lu Q.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and to undergo dynamic relocalization during brain development (16Ho C. Zhou J. Medina M. Goto T. Jacobson M. Bhide P.G. Kosik K.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that δ-catenin/NPRAP binds to PDZ domains of the synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) (17Ide N. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Hirao K. Yao I. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and PAPIN (18Deguchi M. Iizuka T. Hata Y. Nishimura W. Hirao K. Yao I. Kawabe H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29875-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have now obtained evidence for the in vivo association of Densin-180 with δ-catenin/NPRAP. We propose that Densin-180 may possibly be involved in the organization of synaptic cell-cell adhesion. We carried out BLAST searches to identify cDNAs encoding human Densin-180 using the rat Densin-180 cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number U66707). KIAA1365 cDNA encoding COOH-terminal sequences of human Densin-180 cDNA was identified (kindly provided by Drs. T. Nagase and N. Kusuhara from Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). We also found a genomic DNA clone (EMBL accession number AL359412) harboring DNA sequences that are highly homologous to rat Densin-180 cDNA and thought to be a human Densin-180. An NH2-terminal half of cDNA of human Densin-180 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and PyroBest polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) with a set of primers designed according to the genomic sequence. A human cDNA insert of splice variant D reported in the putative intracellular domain of rat Densin-180 (7Strack S. Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25061-25064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was also cloned using polymerase chain reaction. These DNAs were sequenced using an ABI 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA encoding the putative intracellular domain of human Densin-180 (amino acid residues 1242–1537) (Densin-C) was cloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBD-C1), which was kindly provided by P. James (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid, pGBD-Densin-C was used in the two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library fused to the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH), following the Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH). Positive clones were screened for the potential to grow on selective medium and for the expression of β-galactosidase. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out by co-transformation of plasmids, containing the GAL4 DNA-binding (pGBD-C1) and -activation (pGAD-C1) domains intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190, as described (19Izawa I. Nishizawa M. Ohtakara K. Ohtsuka K. Inada H. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34521-34527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Full-length Densin-180 and the putative intracellular domain lacking the PDZ domain (amino acid residues 1242–1442) of Densin-180 were constructed into the pGBD-C1 and pGAD-C1 vectors by means of enzyme digestion and use of polymerase chain reaction techniques. The cDNAs encoding amino acid residues 1014–1225 (C-SWV (wild-type)) and 1014–1222 (C-ΔSWV) of human δ-catenin/NPRAP were inserted into the yeast prey vector (pGAD-C1). The C-SWA fragment, which contains a mutation of the COOH-terminal valine to alanine in C-SWV, was also cloned into the pGAD-C1 vector. A cDNA fragment of the intracellular domain of human N-cadherin was constructed into pGBD-C1 and pGAD-C1 vectors. Recombinant peptides containing amino acid residues 474–754 of human Densin-180 (Densin-Ext) were expressed as six consecutive histidine (His6)-tagged proteins, using pQE30 vectors (Qiagen K. K., Tokyo, Japan). Expression and purification of the His6-Densin-Ext protein was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The Densin-Ext and COOH-terminal fragment of Densin-180 (Densin-C) were also expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli using the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and purified, essentially as described (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5057) Google Scholar). Anti-Densin-Ext antibody was produced in rabbits injected with recombinant His6-Densin-Ext protein and affinity-purified with recombinant GST-Densin-Ext fusion protein. Lysates prepared from rat brain homogenate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). The blots were incubated with anti-Densin-Ext antibody and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence detection reagents (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To detect the Myc-tag, the membranes were incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10). Hippocampal neurons prepared from E18 rats were seeded on coverslips coated by poly-d-lysine and laminin (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) at a density of 103/mm2 and cultured in neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm glutamine, and cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 as described (21Inagaki N.

COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin in an air, 5% CO2 atmosphere with constant humidity. The pClneo-Myc-δ-catenin-8 vector, which encodes amino acid residues 434–1225 of human δ-catenin/NPRAP (17Ide N. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Hirao K. Yao I. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Drs Y. Takai and Y. Hata. COS7 cells were transfected, using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The cDNAs encoding amino acid residues 1014–1225 (C-SWV (wild-type)) and 1014–1222 (C-ΔSWV) of human δ-catenin/NPRAP were inserted into the pCMV-Tag3B (Myc) expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C-SWA fragment, which contains a mutation of the COOH-terminal valine to alanine in C-SWV, was also cloned into the pCMV-Tag3B plasmid. These pCMV-Tag3B vectors harboring various constructs of δ-catenin/NPRAP COOH termini were used for coupled in vitro transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TNT kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled δ-catenin/NPRAP C-SWV, C-SWA, and C-ΔSWV polypeptides in lysates were detected using Transcend non-radioactive translation detection systems (Promega). Crude synaptosomes were prepared as described by Hirao et al. (22Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol.

In brief, one adult rat brain was homogenized in 8 ml of 0.32 m sucrose containing 4 mm Hepes/NaOH at pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 0.32m sucrose containing 4 mm Hepes/NaOH at pH 7.4 and centrifuged 10,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet (P2; the crude synaptosomal fraction) was resuspended with 8 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used in the pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation. Equal amounts of GST or GST-Densin-C fusion protein beads (∼50 μg of protein) were incubated with in vitro-translated products, lysates from COS7 cells overexpressing Myc-δ-catenin or 1% Triton X-100 soluble lysates of crude synaptosomal fractions, for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After centrifugation, beads were washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 1% Triton X-100 soluble lysates of crude synaptosomal fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Densin-Ext polyclonal antibody, anti-δ-catenin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY), anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory), control rabbit IgG, or control mouse IgG, and immunocomplexes were immobilized on protein G-agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Densin-Ext polyclonal antibody, anti-δ-catenin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory), or anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory). To label surface proteins, rat hippocampal neurons were cultured on a 10-cm dish for 4 days, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in the same buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The labeling reaction was quenched by incubation with 100 mm glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% deoxycholate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rat hippocampal neurons dissociated at E18 were grown in culture on coverslips for 14 days and fixed by incubation 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by treatment with −20 °C methanol for 10 min. For double staining of Densin-180 and either δ-catenin or N-cadherin, cells were first incubated with anti-Densin-Ext polyclonal antibody followed by Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Next the cells were incubated with anti-δ-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory) or anti-N-cadherin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory) followed by FluoroLink Cy3-linked anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). An Olympus LSM-GB200 microscope was used to examine the coverslips. We first obtained the full-length cDNA for human Densin-180 (AF434715), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To identify proteins that bind Densin-180 we screened a human brain cDNA library, using the yeast two-hybrid technique and the putative cytosolic domain of human Densin-180 as bait. From 1.7 × 107 transformants, 30 positive clones were obtained. Among them, eight positive clones encoded human δ-catenin/NPRAP (12Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M., Ho, C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. NeuroReport. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Paffenholz R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A), and two clones were p0071 (23Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, the positive clones contained one clone of the α-subunit of CaMKII and one clone of α-actinin reported to be Densin-180-binding proteins (6Walikonis R.S. Oguni A. Khorosheva E.M. Jeng C.-J. Asuncion F.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 423-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Strack S. Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25061-25064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). δ-catenin/NPRAP has a structure similar to that of p0071 and is considered to be a neural isoform of p0071, which is expressed ubiquitously (18Deguchi M. Iizuka T. Hata Y. Nishimura W. Hirao K. Yao I. Kawabe H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29875-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because Densin-180 has been detected only in the brain, we further examined the interaction of δ-catenin/NPRAP with Densin-180. PDZ domains of mammalian LAP proteins belong to class I domains that interact with peptides containing a carboxyl-terminal (S/T)XV (in single letter amino acid code, where X is any residue) motif (24Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H., Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15256-15263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). δ-catenin/NPRAP contains a COOH-terminal SWV motif matching a canonical class I PDZ domain binding site. Therefore, the PDZ domain of Densin-180 was speculated to bind the COOH-terminal PDZ-binding motif of δ-catenin/NPRAP. We next examined interactions between several constructs of Densin-180 and δ-catenin/NPRAP, using yeast two-hybrid methods (Fig. 1, B and C). The Densin-180 intracellular domain lacking the PDZ domain (C-ΔPDZ) did not bind wild-type δ-catenin/NPRAP COOH terminus (C-SWV). Conversely, mutation of the carboxyl-terminal valine to alanine in δ-catenin/NPRAP (C-SWA) or deletion of the COOH-terminal three amino acids in δ-catenin/NPRAP (C-ΔSWV) abrogated the interaction (Fig. 1 C). These results show that Densin-180 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of δ-catenin/NPRAP via its PDZ domain. To confirm the validity of the interaction, we next examined the binding of δ-catenin/NPRAP to an immobilized GST fusion protein containing the putative intracellular domain of Densin-180 (GST-Densin-C) in three sets of GST pull-down experiments (Fig.2). GST-Densin-C binds specifically within vitro-translated δ-catenin/NPRAP COOH terminus (C-SWV), but not with δ-catenin/NPRAP C-SWA or C-ΔSWV (Fig. 2 A). We also noted the interaction of GST-Densin-C and overexpressed Myc-tagged δ-catenin/NPRAP in COS7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, endogenous δ-catenin/NPRAP in crude synaptosomal fractions of rat brain could be precipitated by GST-Densin-C (Fig.2 C). Because δ-catenin/NPRAP was reported to bind N-cadherin in the brain (15Lu Q. Paredes M. Medina M. Zhou J. Cavallo R. Peifer M. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we asked if precipitates by GST-Densin-C contained N-cadherin. Indeed, N-cadherin and δ-catenin/NPRAP were co-precipitated by GST-Densin-C (Fig. 2 C). These results show that the bacterially produced Densin-180 PDZ domain can bindin vitro-translated COOH terminus of δ-catenin/NPRAP, overexpressed Myc-tagged δ-catenin/NPRAP in COS7 cells, and endogenous δ-catenin/NPRAP in crude synaptosomal fractions of the rat brain. To explore the interaction between native Densin-180 and δ-catenin/NPRAP, polyclonal antibodies were raised against Densin-180, using as the immunogen purified His6-tagged protein containing amino acids 474–754 of human Densin-180 (Densin-Ext). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Densin-Ext antibody specifically recognized a polypeptide with a relative molecular mass of ∼180 kDa in rat brain homogenates (Fig.3 A). Preincubation of the antibody with the immunogen selectively inhibited immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 A). Using this antibody, we precipitated complexes containing Densin-180 proteins from a 1% Triton X-100 soluble fraction of crude synaptosomal fractions of the rat brain (Fig. 3 B). Densin-180 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Densin-Ext antibody but not with control rabbit IgG. δ-catenin/NPRAP co-immunoprecipitated with Densin-180 when we used the anti-Densin-Ext antibody. Immunocomplexes precipitated by anti-Densin-Ext antibody also contained N-cadherin. In addition, immunocomplexes precipitated by anti-δ-catenin antibody contained Densin-180 and N-cadherin, and complexes precipitated by anti-N-cadherin antibody included Densin-180 and δ-catenin/NPRAP. These results indicate that Densin-180 is associated with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin in vivo. Unlike other LAP proteins, which are cytosolic membrane-associated proteins, Densin-180 was originally reported to be a transmembrane glycoprotein (5Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERBIN, a LAP family protein showing high homology to Densin-180, was shown to be a cytosolic protein (determined using surface biotinylation) (26Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We biotinylated surface proteins in dissociated hippocampal neurons, which were then isolated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Fig. 3 C). As described above, Densin-180 co-immunoprecipitated with N-cadherin from a 1% Triton X-100 soluble fraction of crude synaptosomal fractions of the rat brain. To exclude the possibility that Densin-180 may be precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads through association with biotinylated N-cadherin, cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% deoxycholate, the detergent condition in which Densin-180 did not co-immunoprecipitate with N-cadherin (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 C, biotin markedly labeled N-cadherin, a protein with a transmembrane domain. In contrast, Densin-180 in the pull-down complex was barely detectable. These observations suggest that Densin-180 may be a cytosolic protein. As described above, Densin-180 forms a ternary complex with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin, possibly as a cytosolic protein. To address more precisely the nature of the interaction, we checked the interaction of Densin-180 and N-cadherin, using the two-hybrid method (Fig. 3 D). With this system, the intracellular domain of N-cadherin interacted with δ-catenin/NPRAP but not with full-length Densin-180. Our findings suggest that Densin-180 forms a complex with N-cadherin through δ-catenin/NPRAP (Fig. 3 D). To examine the intracellular distribution of Densin-180 and to determine whether Densin-180 co-localizes with δ-catenin/NPRAP, an anti-Densin-Ext antibody was used for immunocytochemical staining of dissociated rat brain hippocampal cell cultures (Fig. 4). Hippocampal neurons plated at E18 were grown in culture for 2 weeks. The staining for Densin-180 was membrane-associated and punctate along dendrites with little cytoplasmic staining, as described (5Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed co-localization of Densin-180 and PSD-95 (data not shown) as reported (5Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus indicating that Densin-180 is located at synapses. Double staining with anti-Densin-Ext antibody and anti-δ-catenin antibody revealed co-localization of Densin-180 and δ-catenin/NPRAP (Fig. 4,a–f). The staining pattern of δ-catenin/NPRAP was reported to be similar to that of N-methyld-aspartate receptor 1 in rat hippocampal culture, suggesting the localization of δ-catenin/NPRAP at synapses (17Ide N. Hata Y. Deguchi M. Hirao K. Yao I. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There was also an overlap between Densin-180 and N-cadherin (Fig. 4,g–i). In light of all of this evidence, we propose that Densin-180 is associated with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin at synapses. In the present study, we attempted to identify new Densin-180 binding partners and characterize protein complexes important for function. Using the two-hybrid system, GST pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and immunocytochemical staining of rat hippocampal neurons, we found that Densin-180 interacts with δ-catenin/NPRAP. The Densin-180 PDZ domain binds to the SWV motif present in the carboxyl terminus of δ-catenin/NPRAP. Densin-180 was immunoprecipitated not only with δ-catenin/NPRAP but also with N-cadherin. Although Densin-180 was reported to be an integral protein (5Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Densin-180 was not accessible to surface biotinylation in dissociated hippocampal neurons, which suggests that Densin-180 may be a cytosolic protein (Fig. 5). In rat hippocampal neurons, Densin-180 co-localizes with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin at synapses. These results suggest that Densin-180 may be involved in organization of the synaptic cell-cell junction through association with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin. At synapses, cadherin-catenin complexes show both presynaptic and postsynaptic locations (27Uchida N. Honjo Y. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In contrast, Densin-180 was originally reported to be enriched in PSD, although it has not yet been determined whether Densin-180 is presynaptic, postsynaptic, or both. Therefore, it is yet unclear if Densin-180 interacts with δ-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin at presynapses. By way of summary, we provide evidence that Densin-180 is associatedin vivo with an armadillo protein, δ-catenin/NPRAP, and we suggest that Densin-180 may be involved in the organization of synaptic cell-cell contacts. As other LAP proteins regulate cell polarity in epithelial cells, it may be that brain-specific Densin-180 can affect cell polarity in neurons through interactions with an armadillo protein. Identification of proteins binding to other domains (e.g. leucine-rich repeats) of Densin-180 will be necessary to unravel the entire function of Densin-180. We thank Y.

https://openalex.org/W2074148319,"Neutrophil apoptosis is essential for resolution of inflammatory reactions. Here, we studied the role of two apoptosis/survival-associated protein kinases in this process. We discovered a previously undetected early and transient inhibition of the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) during both spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme augmented the activation of caspases and the apoptotic response, which suggests that the p38 MAPK signals survival in neutrophils. Our finding that caspase-3 activity was initiated during the transient inhibition of p38 MAPK suggests that apoptosis is initiated during this inhibition. Furthermore, such transient inhibition was counteracted by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which elicits survival. We also found that neither this inhibition of p38 MAPK nor the spontaneous apoptotic response depended on Fas. Instead, the early inhibition of p38 MAPK concurred with a Fas-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibition of which reduced apoptosis. Thus, the Fas-induced augmentation of spontaneous apoptosis can be explained by its activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We conclude that p38 MAPK activity represents a survival signal that is inactivated transiently during both spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis, whereas Fas-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is a proapoptotic signal in isolated human neutrophils."

We replaced these ribosomal proteins in vitro with the rat counterparts P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12, and tested them for ribosomal activities. The core 50 S subunit lacking the proteins on the 1070 RNA domain was prepared under gentle conditions from a mutant deficient in ribosomal protein L11. The rat proteins bound to the core 50 S subunit through their interactions with the 1070 RNA domain. The resultant hybrid ribosome was insensitive to thiostrepton and showed poly(U)-programmed polyphenylalanine synthesis dependent on the actions of both eukaryotic elongation factors 1α (eEF-1α) and 2 (eEF-2) but not of the prokaryotic equivalent factors EF-Tu and EF-G. The results from replacement of either the L10·L7/L12 complex or L11 with rat protein showed that the P0·P1/P2 complex, and not RL12, was responsible for the specificity of the eukaryotic ribosomes to eukaryotic elongation factors and for the accompanying GTPase activity. The presence of either E. coli L11 or rat RL12 considerably stimulated the polyphenylalanine synthesis by the hybrid ribosome, suggesting that L11/RL12 proteins play an important role in post-GTPase events of translation elongation.

Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 586-604Google Scholar), and post-GTPase events including tRNA movements on the ribosome (2Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W.

Translation elongation is markedly stimulated by the interaction of this region with two elongation factors in a GTP-dependent manner. The GTPase center includes two essential RNA regions around positions 1070 and 2660 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23 S/28 S rRNA (4Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which appear to bind to the elongation factors (5Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F.

Despite the highly conserved structure of the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions, ribosomes show a kingdom-dependent accessibility for translation factors,i.e., prokaryotic ribosomes do not engage in translation elongation with the eukaryotic factors instead of the prokaryotic factors (7Nathans D.

Furthermore, there are differences in the rate of GTPase turnover between the two systems; in vitroeukaryotic eEF-21/80 S ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis is 10-fold slower than the prokaryotic EF-G/70 S ribosome system (10Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This may reflect, in part, the elaborate regulation of eukaryotic translation. The other important component of the GTPase center is the acidic stalk protein, termed L7/L12 in prokaryotes (11Hamel E.

We previously tried replacement of the acidic stalk protein complex L10·L7/L12 in theE. coli ribosome with rat P0·P1/P2 in vitro and showed, by this replacement, that the ribosome acquired GTPase activity dependent on the eukaryotic translocase eEF-2 instead of prokaryotic EF-G (10Uchiumi T.

This activity was comparable with that of the rat 80 S ribosome. Meanwhile, other groups exchanged the 1070 RNA region within 23 S/26 S rRNA, with which the acidic stalk protein complex interacts between E. coli and yeast, and this showed no major functional effect (27Musters W. Gonçalves P.M. Boon K. Raué H.A. van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1469-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Thompson J. Musters W. Cundliffe E.

These studies suggest that P0·P1/P2 protein complex on the 1070 RNA domain, but not the RNA itself, are important for the kingdom-specific function. The E. coli ribosome in which L10·L7/L12 was replaced with rat P0·P1/P2, however, showed no significant activity of eEF-1α/eEF-2-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis in our previous study. 2T. Uchiumi, S. Honma, and A. Hachimori, unpublished results. This may be due to damage caused during preparation of the core ribosome lacking both L10 and L7/L12, using 50% ethanol, 0.5 mNH4Cl at 30 °C. To prepare the core ribosome employing milder conditions, we use here an L11-lacking ribosomal mutant from which L10·L7/L12 complex is easily removed at 0 °C. Both rat P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12 (rat counterpart of E. coli L11) are incorporated into the core ribosome. This hybrid ribosome has appreciable activity in polyphenylalanine synthesis dependent on the two eukaryotic elongation factors. The present results clearly show that the eukaryotic ribosomal proteins bound to the 1070 RNA domain play crucial roles in translation elongation regulated by the eukaryotic factors.

The prokaryotic EF-Tu/EF-G-dependent reaction was performed under the same conditions, except that the reaction mixture contained 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NH4Cl, 5 pmol of EF-G, and 40 pmol of EF-Tu. The polymerized radioactivity was counted as described by Möller et al. (12Möller W. Schrier P.I. Maassen J.A. Zantema A. Schop E. Reinalda H. Cremers A.F. Mellema J.E. J. Mol.

For eEF-1α-dependent activity, the reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 10 pmol of hybrid 50 S subunits, 30 pmol of 30 S subunits, 300 pmol of [γ-32P]GTP (400–500 cpm/pmol), 10 μg of poly(U), 20 pmol of Phe-tRNA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmNH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 40 pmol of eEF-1α and was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The eEF-2-dependent GTPase activity was assayed using 2.5 pmol of hybrid 50 S subunits, 7.5 pmol of 30 S subunits, 3 nmol of [γ-32P]GTP (40–50 cpm/pmol), and 5 pmol of eEF-2 as described previously (10Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Formation of the hybrid 50 S subunits was confirmed by agarose-acrylamide composite gels as described by Tokimatsu et al. (34Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Our gel was composed of 3% acrylamide, 0.5% agarose (SeaKem LE, BMA), 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and running buffer contained 1 mmMgCl2 and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. We have characterized rat ribosomal proteins P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12, counterparts of the E. coliacidic stalk protein complex L10·L7/L12 and L11, respectively (24Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,30Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional significance of these rat proteins in eukaryotic translational mechanism, here we attempted to substitute the proteins for L10·L7/L12 and L11 in E. coli 50 S ribosomal subunits. The E. coli core particle lacking L10·L7/L12 and L11 assembled on the domain around 1070 of 23 S rRNA was prepared with the 50 S subunit of the L11-deficient AM68 strain (Fig. 1A, lane 2). L10·L7/L12 was easily and selectively removed from the mutant 50 S subunit (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) in 50% ethanol, 0.5 m NH4Cl at 0 °C. Binding of the rat proteins to the E. coli core particle was examined by native agarose-acrylamide composite gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). The mobility of the core particle (lane 2) was much higher than the intact 50 S subunit (lane 1). The addition of the rat proteins changed the gel mobility of the core particle (lane 3). This mobility shift by rat proteins was prevented by adding an excess amount of an RNA fragment containing residues 1029–1127 of E. coli 23 S rRNA to which rat P0·P1/P2 complex (10Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and RL12 (30Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) cross-bind (lane 4), suggesting that the rat proteins bind to the 1070 RNA domain within the E. coli 50 S core particle. The binding of rat proteins to the 1070 RNA region was also confirmed by chemical footprinting. 3T. Uchiumi, S. Honma, Y. Endo, and A. Hachimori, manuscript in preparation. The region of the gel with the shifted ribosomal band (lane 3) was cut out and tested by immunoblotting for reactivity with autoimmune serum that recognizes rat ribosomal proteins P0, P1, P2, and RL12 (35Sato T. Uchiumi T. Kominami R. Arakawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1681-1684Google Scholar) (Fig.1C). Fig. 1C, lane 2, clearly shows that all of the added rat proteins comigrated with the E. coli core particle. From these results, we concluded that E. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11 are replaced with rat protein counterparts on the 1070 RNA domain of 23 S rRNA in the 50 S subunit, as illustrated in Fig. 1D. The hybrid ribosomes were tested for activity in poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis. Unlike intact E. coli ribosomes, hybrid ribosomes showed activity to be dependent on eukaryotic eEF-1α and eEF-2 (Fig.2A) but not on prokaryotic EF-Tu and EF-G (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the ribosomal specificity for elongation factors was changed by replacing E. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11 on the 50 S subunit with rat counterparts. This eEF-1α/eEF-2-dependent activity was suppressed by the addition of the RNA competitor (data not shown), which prevented the hybrid formation (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The polyphenylalanine synthetic activity of the hybrid ribosome was not as high as that of the rat intact ribosome (Fig.2C); the initial rate of polymerization by the hybrid ribosome was about one-third that of the rat 80 S ribosome. To confirm whether the polymerization activity of the hybrid ribosome depends on the actions of both eEF-1α and eEF-2, the activity was assayed without either eEF-1α or eEF-2. As shown in Fig. 2D, the polymerization activity of the hybrid ribosome was detected only when both eEF-1α and eEF-2 were present, indicating that the hybrid ribosome allow functional access to both the eukaryotic elongation factors. To investigate individual contributions of P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12 to translation elongation by the hybrid ribosome, we performed partial replacement of either L10·L7/L12 or L11 in E. coli 50 S subunit with the respective rat counterparts. The core ribosome lacking L10·L7/L12 and L11 (Fig. 1A) was incubated with L10·L7/L12-like proteins (E. coli L10·L7/L12 or rat P0·P1/P2) and of L11-like proteins (E. coli L11 or rat RL12), and we tested the ribosomal functions dependent on eukaryotic elongation factors (Fig. 3). The GTPase activities dependent on eEF-2 (Fig. 3A) and eEF-1α (Fig.3B) were markedly stimulated by addition of rat P0·P1/P2 to the core ribosome. The addition of E. coli L11 or rat RL12, together with P0·P1/P2, slightly enhanced eEF-2-dependent GTPase (Fig. 3A) but had no effect on eEF-1α-dependent GTPase (Fig. 3B). In contrast to GTPase, polyphenylalanine synthetic activity with eEF-1α and eEF-2 was stimulated to only a small extent by the addition of P0·P1/P2 complex alone to the core ribosome (Fig.3C). This activity was, however, enhanced 3-fold by the further addition of E. coli L11 and more than 4-fold by the addition of rat RL12. Replacement of E. coli L11 alone with RL12 gave no appreciable effect on the polyphenylalanine synthesis as well as GTPase. The hybrid ribosomes were tested for sensitivity to the antibiotic thiostrepton, which recognizes the E. coli 1070 RNA domain associated with L11 (1Cundliffe E. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 586-604Google Scholar). The E. coli ribosomes in which L10·L7/L12 alone was replaced with rat P0·P1/P2 retained thiostrepton sensitivity, as described previously (10Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Replacement of both L10·L7/L12 and L11 with P0·P1/P2 and RL12 resulted in ribosomes insensitive to the drug (Fig.4), suggesting that rat RL12 is responsible for the thiostrepton insensitivity of the hybrid ribosome. The ribosomal proteins L10·L7/L12 and L11 bind to the 1070 RNA region in domain II of 23 S rRNA, forming a mobile region that constitutes a part of the GTPase-related functional center of theE. coli ribosome. We here performed in vitroreplacement of L10·L7/L12 complex and L11 in the 50 S subunit with rat counterparts P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12, respectively. By this replacement, ribosomal specificity for elongation factors is changed; the hybrid ribosome is engaged in polypeptide synthesis by the actions of two eukaryotic elongation factors, eEF-1α and eEF-2, but not of prokaryotic EF-Tu and EF-G. It has been shown since the earliest work that prokaryotic 70 S ribosomes do not engage in protein synthesis with the eukaryotic translation factors and that eukaryotic 80 S ribosomes are inactive with the prokaryotic factors (7Nathans D. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Randi R. Ochoa S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1967; 28: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present results strongly suggest that a limited number of ribosomal proteins assembled on the 1070 RNA domain are major components responsible for the kingdom-dependent specificity between ribosomes and GTP-bound translation factors. Functional contributions of rat P0·P1/P2 and RL12 in the hybrid ribosome were clarified by their individual substitutions for E. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11, respectively (Fig. 3). P0·P1/P2 complex, but not RL12, contributes substantially to the specificity for the eukaryotic factors and GTPase. Not only rat RL12 but also E. coli L11, however, stimulates polyphenylalanine synthetic activity dependent on eEF-1α and eEF-2, although the stimulation level by RL12 is higher than that of E. coliL11. The availability of mutants deficient in L11-type proteins in bacteria (29Dabbs E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 734-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stark M.J. Cundliffe E. Dijk J. Stöffler G.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and yeast (38Briones E. Briones C. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31956-31961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicates that L11-like proteins are not essential for cell viability. However, the growth rate ofE. coli mutant AM68 lacking L11 was very slow; its doubling time was five times longer than strain Q13, which does have L11 (data not shown). This finding suggests that the efficiency of protein synthesis by ribosomes lacking L11 is quite low within cell, in line with the present in vitro data on poly(Phe) synthesis. RL12/L11 appears to participate in improving the efficiency of a step in post-GTPase events such as translocation of tRNAs. There is a clear difference between E. coli L11 and rat RL12. L11 but not RL12 binding to the 1070 RNA domain makes the ribosome sensitive to the antibiotic thiostrepton (Fig. 4). This is consistent with our previous binding experiment, i.e., thiostrepton stabilizes a complex between L11 and the E. coli 1070 RNA domain but not the RL12-RNA complex (30Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The difference in thiostrepton sensitivity may be due to N-terminal differences in amino acid sequences between L11 and RL12 around residue 22, which is important for thiostrepton binding (39Porse B.T. Leviev I. Mankin A.S. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Despite the divergence of the sequences, a conformation important for function appears to be conserved between the two proteins. The present results clearly show that P0·P1/P2 complex plays a crucial role in the functions of the two eukaryotic elongation factors. The involvement of P1/P2 proteins in translation elongation has been suggested previously by immunochemical inhibition assays (40Van Agthoven A.J. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and partial reconstitution studies with rat and yeast ribosomes (23Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Briones E. Zambrano R.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5359-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An essential role of P0 for cell viability has been demonstrated in yeast (23Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Briones E.

Cryoelectron microscopic studies of the complex containingE. coli ribosome EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA (42Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), as well as the ribosome·EF-G complex (43Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 44Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), have demonstrated direct contacts of these factors (GTP-binding domain) with the L7/L12 stalk and also with its base region. Considering these previous data and the present results together, eukaryotic P1/P2 stalk and P0/RL12 constituting its base region seem to bind directly to eEF1α and eEF-2. This view is also supported by chemical cross-linking of eEF-2 with P2, P0 (LA33), and RL12 (45Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and of eEF1α with RL12 (46Uchiumi T. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9663-9667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the ribosome factor specificity may be explained by the direct interaction between the ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. In addition to interactions with the translation factors, P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12 have another important function, which is rRNA binding. Because rRNAs appear to play essential roles in translational mechanism (47Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), it is important to know the effect of the protein binding on rRNA. P0·P1/P2 complex and RL12 bind to overlapping regions of the 1070 (E. coli numbering) domain of 28 S rRNA and affect the RNA conformation (24Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the 1070 RNA region, there is also a site for eEF-2 binding as detected by footprinting (48Uchiumi T. Kominami R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3389-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is likely that adjustment of the 1070 RNA region by protein binding may be important for the functional interaction of eEF-2 with the RNA. This is also the case in the hybrid ribosome. Because rat P0·P1/P2 and RL12 cross-bind to the E. coli 1070 RNA domain (10Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and stimulate the ribosome function dependent on eEF1α and eEF-2 (present study), these rat proteins appear to affect the structure and function of the 1070 RNA region within the E. coli ribosome. An important and interesting point yet to be addressed is the effect of protein binding on the 2660 RNA region (sarcin/ricin loop), another important RNA region to which elongation factors bind. Because the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions are neighbors in the 50 S subunit (4Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), it is also likely that bindings of rat proteins to the 1070 region may affect the interactions of elongation factors with the 2660 region. The activity of our hybrid ribosomes in translational elongation implies that tRNA movement as well as its binding occur properly in this artificial construction. It has been shown that translocation of the A-site tRNA to the P-site is stimulated by GTP hydrolysis on EF-G (2Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and possibly by the interaction of EF-G with several sites including the decoding region of the E. coli ribosome (43Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 44Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W.

Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate from a functional aspect that ribosomal compartments engaging in translational elongation, except for the acidic stalk protein complexes, are highly conserved betweenE. coli and rat. This is in agreement with structural evidence from crystallographic studies, i.e., the ribosomal intersubunit space, including peptidyltransferase and decoding sites, is constructed mainly with conserved rRNA moieties (50Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar, 51Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cryoelectronmicroscopic studies showed structural resemblance in the interface surfaces of both large and small subunits between rat and E. coli (52Dube P. Wieske M. Stark H. Schatz M. Stahl J. Zemlin F. Lutsch G. van Heel M. Structure. 1998; 6: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it is highly likely that there is strong similarity in domains 3, 4, and 5 of the translocases that appear to mimic the structure of tRNA (reviewed in Refs. 3Wilson K.S. Noller H. Cell. 1998; 92: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar and 53Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 293-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between EF-G and eEF-2, although amino acid identity between them is low (26.4% between E. coliEF-G and rat eEF-2). We infer that the basic mechanism of the factor-dependent translocation of tRNAs, which occurs in the RNA-rich intersubunit space of ribosomes, is identical between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The acidic stalk protein complex located at the outer side of the ribosome appears to participate in the kingdom-specific regulation with its mobile property. This protein complex may regulate the action of translocase not only by its direct binding to translocase and triggering GTP hydrolysis but also through interaction with functional regions of rRNA. Further detailed knowledge on the characteristic features of P0·P1/P2 complex could provide insights into eukaryote-specific regulation of translational elongation. It has been difficult to determine the precise functional roles of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins in vitro. The present replacement studies, “molecular plantation,” as it were, of mammalian proteins into the E. coli ribosome, provide a novel methodology for the researches of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins."

Similar observations were made in H295, a human adrenocortical cell line which expresses physiologically the AT1 receptor. This phenomenon, which was not dependent on protein synthesis and the pharmacology and kinetics of which were similar to the recycling of the wild-type receptor, was called “externalization”. After externalization and losartan removal, the L305Q CAM underwent rapid ligand-independent endocytocis, with the same kinetics and temperature sensitivity as the angiotensin II-induced internalization of the wild-type AT1A. Moreover, the addition of a second mutation known to block internalization (Δ329 truncation) prevented intracellular localization of the CAM.

Despite the wide variety of ligands and physiological roles, these receptors are all structurally characterized by seven-transmembrane domains and most of them are thought to share common activation and desensitization mechanisms. GPCRs are supposed to isomerize spontaneously between an inactive (R) and an active state (R*), the latter being responsible for G protein coupling and subsequent intracellular signaling. This two-state model is probably oversimplified but is helpful for the interpretation of mutagenesis and pharmacological data. It is supported by the existence of constitutively active mutants (CAMs) in the GPCR family. These mutants mimic the active state and therefore present permanent ligand-independent signaling. Ligands able to block this constitutive activity are called inverse agonists. In the two-state model, the inverse agonists have preferential affinity for the inactive state (R). Conversely, “regular” agonists preferentially bind the active state (R*). G protein-coupled receptor angiotensin II angiotensin II type 1 receptor inositol phosphate enhanced green fluorescent protein wild-type fluorescence-activated cell sorting endoglycosidase H adrenergic receptor fetal calf serum constitutive active mutant Many GPCRs are desensitized after G protein activation, i.e.they become insensitive to agonists. The binding of arrestins to the receptor is known to play a major role in this process and is favored by the phosphorylation of the receptor by specific GPCR kinases. The arrestins prevent further interaction with the G proteins. They also promote internalization via clathrin-coated pit-dependent endocytosis, which results in the disappearance of the receptor from the plasma membrane (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, they participate in the recycling of the receptor, which can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the type of GPCR. In some cases, some of the receptors can also be down-regulated, leading to long-term desensitization. Activation is thus a physiological prerequisite for receptor internalization and these two processes are probably highly dependent on each other. As CAMs mimic the active conformation of the receptor, they should help to elucidate the link between activation and internalization. In this study, we used the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1) as a model to address this question. The AT1 receptor regulates the contraction and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and the secretion of aldosterone. Thus it plays a critical role in the control of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis. This pivotal physiological role makes the AT1 receptor an important therapeutic target and numerous antihypertensive and cardioprotector agents have been developed. As a consequence, it is also one of the most studied GPCRs. Its cDNA was first cloned in 1991 (3Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The AT1 receptor (AT1A and AT1B in rodents) leads to the Gαq/11-mediated activation of phospholipase C-β, which generates diacylglycerol and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate. Following the phosphorylation of the intracellular sequences (4Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol.

We were able to directly visualize the internalization process of an EGFP-tagged AT1 receptor using confocal microscopy (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar). Only one CAM was identified by site-directed mutagenesis (N111A) (14Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J.

The ligand-independent activation of the AT1 signaling pathway induced by these mutants is abolished by the inverse agonists, losartan (14Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C.

To study the link between activation and internalization/recycling, we analyzed the cellular trafficking of three EGFP-tagged CAMs of the AT1A receptor (N111A, I245T, and L305Q). The EGFP-AT1A receptor was constructed in three steps: 1) the nucleotide sequence of the insulin receptor signal peptide (sp) was amplified from the pET vector (17Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) with the following primers: 5′ (ACCGGTCGCCACCATGGGCACCGGGGG) and 3′ (ACCGGTAGGTGGCCCGCGGCGC), which inserted an AgeI site at both ends of the sp. The PCR fragment was digested with AgeI and inserted into the AgeI site of pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH), this construct was called ps-EGFP. 2) A linker, consisting of six copies of the myc epitope with the following amino acid sequence: Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu-Gly-Arg-Phe (Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu)5, was inserted into the EagI site of pEAT1AΣ (18Conchon S. Monnot C. Sirieix M.E. Bihoreau C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This construct was called 6mycs-AT1A. 3) The 6mycs-AT1A vector was digested withHindIII and XmaI and inserted into theHindIII and XmaI site of ps-EGFP. The construct was called ps-EGFP-6mycs-AT1A and the corresponding receptor was called EGFP-AT1A. The EGFP-tagged CAMs were constructed as follows: the BamHI fragment (corresponding to the fragment from amino acid 15 to the stop codon) of ps-EGFP-6mycs-AT1A cDNA was replaced with the corresponding BamHI fragment of pTREC-N111A, pTREC-I245T, or pTREC-L305Q (16Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7615-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The corresponding receptors were called: EGFP-N111A, EGFP-I245T, and EGFP-L305Q, respectively. The L305Q-EGFP mutant was constructed as follows: after aBstBI digestion, pTREC-L305Q was blunt ended using the large kleenow fragment and then digested by HindIII. This fragment was inserted into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The truncated mutants were constructed as follows: for the EGFP-Δ329, the BamHI fragment from ps-EGFP-6mycs-AT1A cDNA was replaced with the corresponding BamHI fragment from pEΔ329 (19Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E336-E345PubMed Google Scholar); for EGFP-L305Q-Δ329, the SpeI-XbaI fragment of ps-EGFP-6mycs-AT1AΔ329 (EGFP-Δ329) was replaced with the correspondingSpeI-XbaI fragment of pTREC-L305Q containing the L305Q mutation. HEK-293 cells were obtained from the ATCC (F-14742, 1573-CRL) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). H295 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 2% Utroser G, 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium (Sigma). For stable expression, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 1 μg/500,000 cells of the plasmid of interest, by use of a liposomal transfection reagent (Dosper, Roche Molecular Diagnosis). Cell lines stably expressing the EGFP-AT1A, EGFP-N111A, EGFP-I245T, EGFP-L305Q, EGFP-Δ329, and EGFP-L305Q-Δ329 receptors were selected for resistance to 750 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and cloned by limiting dilution. For transient aequorin transfection, the day before transfection, HEK-EGFP-AT1A or HEK-EGFP-L305Q cells were plated in polyallylamine (Sigma-Aldrich)-treated white opaque 96-well plates (Culturplate, Packard) at a density of 50,000 cells/well. Cells were then transfected with 0.1 μg/50,000 cells of the aequorin plasmid (gift from R. Rizzuto, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, (20Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar)), using a liposomal transfection reagent (Dosper). For transient H295 cell transfection, cells were plated in polyallylamine-treated 6- or 24-well plates at 50–70% confluence the day before transfection. Cells were then transfected with 0.35 μg/well for 24-well plates or 0.7 μg/well for 6-well plates of AT1A-EGFP or L305Q-EGFP plasmids, using a liposomal transfection reagent (LipofectAMINE Plus, Invitrogen). FACS analysis indicated that ∼15% of the cells were transfected. 1) Binding experiments with [125I]labeled Ang II were performed on intact cells, as previously described (21Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that the incubations with [125I]AngII were performed for 3 h at 4 °C. Binding data were analyzed by linear regression using the Microsoft Excel 5 program. 2) To measure inositol phosphate (IP) production, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/200,000 cells of Gαq cDNA (a gift from B. Conklin, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The cells were metabolically labeled with myo-[3H]inositol as previously described (21Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and then the IP content was determined by methanol extraction and separation on a Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) column. To determine the functional consequences of losartan-induced externalization, cells were pretreated with LiCl at 16 °C instead of 37 °C. 3) The aequorin assay was performed as previously described (16Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7615-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) on stable HEK-EGFP-AT1A or HEK-EGFP-L305Q cell lines, transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding the bioluminescent calcium-sensitive protein, aequorin, in 96-well plates. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μm losartan in medium supplemented with 0.5 μm cœlenterazine and 1% FCS. The cells were subsequently washed twice with aequorin buffer and incubated for 30 min at 16 °C in 50 μl of aequorin buffer (16Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7615-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated by adding 50 μl of increasing concentrations of AngII and the luminescence was measured 30 s later in a TopCount counter (Packard). Cells expressing EGFP-tagged receptors were prepared and analyzed by FACS as previously described (22Lenkei Z. Beaudet A. Chartrel N., De Mota N. Irinopoulou T. Braun B. Vaudry H. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stable HEK-EGFP-AT1A or HEK-EGFP-L305Q cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen). The starved cells were labeled for 5 min with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]Redivue Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same medium. Cells were then rinsed twice in PBS and incubated for various time in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% FCS at 37 °C. Cells were then processed for immunoprecipitation as previously described (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1 μg of a monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10) was used for the immunoprecipitation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Some immunoprecipitated samples were treated with Endo H and PNGase F enzymes (both from Biolabs) according to the manufacturers recommendations. Cells were either pretreated with 10 μmmonensin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C or left untreated. These cells were incubated with 100 nm AngII for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow internalization. At this point an acid wash (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl in binding buffer, 5 min at 4 °C) was performed to remove surface bound AngII. For the recycling studies, cells were additionally incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FCS in the presence or absence of 10 μm monensin for various periods of time at 37 °C. To determine the rates of internalization and recycling, binding experiments with [125I]labeled AngII were carried out on intact cells for 3 h at 4 °C as previously described (21Conchon S. Barrault M.B. Miserey S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25566-25572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was also used to analyze receptor trafficking as described previously (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (50,000 cells/well) were seeded on polyallylamine-treated chambered coverglass 8 wells (Nunc) and treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 70 μm cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with various ligands in Earle's buffer (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization was promoted by incubating the cells in Earle's complete buffer (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 or at 16 °C for various periods of time: 30 min with 100 nm (or 10 nm in Fig.5 C) AngII, 100 nm[Sar1-Ile8]AngII, 10 μmL162,313, or for 2 h with 1 μm losartan and 10 μm irbesartan. For the re-internalization study, after losartan treatment, cells were washed for 30 min at 4 °C in Earle's complete buffer and then incubated at 37 °C or 16 °C. When required cells were treated with 10 μm monensin for the entire assay. After the incubation periods, the cells were rinsed in ice-cold Earle's buffer and fixed by incubating them for 10 min in 100% methanol at 4 °C. Cells were examined with a Leica TCS NT confocal laser scanning microscope configured with a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with an argon/helium/neon laser. EGFP fluorescence was detected following 100% excitation at 488 nm by use of a spectrophotometer set with a window between 530 and 600 nm. Images of individual cells (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained by use of a ×63 oil-immersion objective. Each image was done on a cross-section through the cells. Digital image analysis using a specific macro software (10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lenkei Z. Beaudet A. Chartrel N., De Mota N. Irinopoulou T. Braun B. Vaudry H. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) derived from the public domain NIH Image software (developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) was used to measure the subcellular distribution of the EGFP-tagged receptors. This software allowed to measure the S, C, and N values, which correspond to the mean density of the surface, cytoplasm, and nucleus fluorescence. The background fluorescence (N) was subtracted from the S and C values to give the S′ and C′ values. The S′/C′ ratio provides reliable information about the level of cell surface expression and the internalization state of the fluorescent receptor. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's ttest. The CAM N111A, I245T, L305Q, and the wild-type (WT) AT1A receptors were tagged at the N terminus with EGFP to determine their subcellular localization and trafficking. A signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of EGFP to allow the correct exportation of the chimeric protein to the plasma membrane. A spacer, consisting of a tandem repeat of the myc epitope (63 amino acids), was inserted between EGFP and the AT1Areceptor to prevent steric encumbrance of the AngII-binding site. The EGFP-tagged CAM and WT receptors were stably transfected in HEK-293 cells and their functional properties were analyzed (TableI). The K d of [125I]AngII for the EGFP-AT1A and the EGFP-L305Q were both similar to the known K d of the non-tagged WT receptor (K d = 0.61 nm for the AT1A receptor (19Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E336-E345PubMed Google Scholar)). As evaluated by binding of labeled AngII, the EGFP-L305Q receptor presents a lower plasma membrane expression compared with the WT EGFP-AT1A receptor (TableI). We checked the constitutive activity of the EGFP-L305Q receptor by measuring the agonist-independent production of IP in the stable cell line, after transient transfection of the Gαq cDNA to increase the sensitivity of the assay (16Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7615-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brauner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results were normalized with respect to the expression levels of the receptor to allow accurate comparison (Table I). The basal activity of the cell line expressing the EGFP-L305Q receptor was three times as high as that of the cells expressing the WT EGFP-AT1A, showing that the mutant fused to EGFP retained its constitutive activity. Moreover, the production of IP was increased by AngII treatment (Table I). The EGFP-N111A and EGFP-I245T receptors have similar K d (0.76 ± 0.13 and 0.95 ± 0.19 nm, respectively) to that of the WT receptor and the same basal constitutive activity as the EGFP-L305Q receptor (EGFP-N111A, 770 ± 107; EGFP-I245T, 203 ± 16). Thus the EGFP-tagged receptors were fully functional in terms of ligand binding and second messenger production.Table IFunctional characterization of the WT EGFP-AT1A and EGFP-L305Q receptorsKdB maxBasal IPAngII-induced IP productionS′/C′ ratioTotal fluorescence (FACS)nMsites/cell × 103normalized to 105sites/cell× stimulation over basalEGFP-AT1A0.76 ± 0.13363 ± 64100 ± 98.80 ± 0.401.81 ± 0.376.22EGFP-L305Q0.57 ± 0.05140 ± 25283 ± 131-ap < 0.05 versusEGFP-AT1A.1.88 ± 0.261-bp < 0.001 versusEGFP-AT1A.0.66 ± 0.041-ap < 0.05 versusEGFP-AT1A.6.06Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments.1-a p < 0.05 versusEGFP-AT1A.1-b p < 0.001 versusEGFP-AT1A. Open table in a new tab Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. The EGFP tag enabled the cellular localization of the WT and CAM receptors to be determined by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, whereas the WT EGFP-AT1Areceptors were localized at the cell surface, the CAM receptors (N111A, L305Q, and I245T) were mainly located in intracellular vesicles in the cytoplasm and some cells expressed low amount on their plasma membrane (Fig. 1 A). This constitutive intracellular localization of the CAM receptors was quantified by calculating the ratio of surface and cytoplasmic fluorescence densities, denoted here as S′/C′ (see “Materials and Methods”). For the WT EGFP-AT1Areceptor, the S′/C′ ratio was typically 1.5–2.0 in the absence of the ligand and decreased to 0.5 after AngII-induced internalization (TableI, Fig. 2 C and Ref. 10Miserey-Lenkei S. Lenkei Z. Parnot C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 294-307PubMed Google Scholar). The S′/C′ ratios of the CAM receptors were dramatically lower than those of the WT receptor (EGFP-N111A, 0.60 ± 0.06; EGFP-I245T, 0.80 ± 0.09; EGFP-L305Q, 0.66 ± 0.04) (Table I and Fig. 2 B). The S′/C′ ratios for the WT and L305Q receptors were further reduced by incubation with AngII, showing that a non-negligible fraction of the receptors was still at the plasma membrane and was internalized in the presence of AngII (Fig. 2 C). The presence of the EGFP-L305Q receptor at the cell surface was confirmed by binding experiments (Table I). We assessed whether these differences in basal S′/C′ ratios of WT and CAM receptors were due to differences in the total number of receptors. We used FACS to quantify the total fluorescence per cell on 10,000 cells stably expressing the EGFP-L305Q and the WT receptors (Table I). The two other CAMs presented comparable total fluorescence (data not shown). We also excluded the possibility that plasma membrane targeting was altered due to the presence of EGFP at the N terminus, because the WT or L305Q receptors with a C-terminal EGFP tag presented the same cellular distribution as their N-terminal-tagged counterparts (data not shown). Metabolic labeling experiments were performed to identify differences in the maturation of the WT and L305Q receptors. The WT EGFP-AT1A and the EGFP-L305Q receptors both corresponded to ∼80-kDa bands and the maximal intensity was reached after a 5-min pulse and progressively decreasing after a 60-min chase (Fig.1 B). The maturation of the proteins was studied by their sensitivity to Endo H and PNGase F (Fig. 1 C). After a 5-min pulse without chase, both of the receptor types were sensitive to both enzymes, as indicated by the increase in their electrophoretic mobility. Surprisingly, after a 60-min chase both receptors were sensitive to Endo H. This migration profile, i.e.sensitivity to both enzymes, was also observed on a total cell extract after deglycosylation. In addition to the ∼80-kDa band, the WT EGFP-AT1A receptor was also represented by a 65-kDa band, which is not the consequence of EGFP-tag cleavage (data not shown). In conclusion, the WT EGFP-AT1A and the EGFP-L305Q receptors present similar maturation/degradation and glycosylation profiles and the intracellular localization of the CAMs is therefore an intrinsic property of the constitutive activity and not due to the intracellular accumulation of the receptor during biosynthesis. These results provide strong evidence for the constitutive intracellular localization of three different ATA CAMs (N111A, I245T, and L305Q). The CAM receptors remaining at the plasma membrane were fully functional, displaying AngII binding, as well as AngII-induced signaling and internalization comparable to the WT receptor. The inverse agonist, losartan, is known to inhibit the constitutive signaling activity of the AT1A CAMs (14Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2131025307,"The γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) has been reported to mediate the interaction between the GABAAreceptor and microtubules. We present the three-dimensional structure of GABARAP obtained by x-ray diffraction at 1.75 Å resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the homologous protein GATE-16. NMR spectroscopy of isotope-labeled GABARAP showed the structure in solution to be compatible with the overall fold but showed evidence of conformation heterogeneity that is not apparent in the crystal structure. We assessed the binding of GABARAP to peptides derived from reported binding partner proteins, including the M3-M4 loop of the γ2 subunit of the GABAAreceptor and the acidic carboxyl-terminal tails of human α- and β-tubulin. There is a small area of concentrated positive charge on one surface of GABARAP, which we found interacts weakly with all peptides tested, but we found no evidence for specific binding to the proposed physiological target peptides. These results are compatible with a more general role in membrane targeting and transportation for the GABARAP family of proteins. The γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) has been reported to mediate the interaction between the GABAAreceptor and microtubules. We present the three-dimensional structure of GABARAP obtained by x-ray diffraction at 1.75 Å resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the homologous protein GATE-16. NMR spectroscopy of isotope-labeled GABARAP showed the structure in solution to be compatible with the overall fold but showed evidence of conformation heterogeneity that is not apparent in the crystal structure. We assessed the binding of GABARAP to peptides derived from reported binding partner proteins, including the M3-M4 loop of the γ2 subunit of the GABAAreceptor and the acidic carboxyl-terminal tails of human α- and β-tubulin.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). The γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A-associated protein (GABARAP) was identified as interacting with the M3-M4 loop of the γ2 subunit of the GABAA receptor by yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The initial two-hybrid clone identified consisted of the carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 36–117) of the complete 117-residue GABARAP protein. A distant homology to microtubule-associated protein 1A and microtubule-associated protein 1A and 1B light chain 3 (MAP-LC3) (3Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified GABARAP as a possible tubulin-binding protein. GABARAP was found to be associated with microtubules (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 4Wang H. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the highly basic amino-terminal region of the GABARAP protein was putatively identified as the tubulin binding region. Thus, it has been suggested that GABARAP serves to link the GABAA receptor (through interactions with the carboxyl-terminal 35–117 region) to the cytoskeleton (via the amino-terminal region) and is involved in organizing GABAAreceptors at the synapse (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 5Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Other experiments have not supported location of GABARAP at the synapse (6Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H.

In addition to MAP-LC3, these included yeast autophagy protein Aut7p (sequences from three species exist) and a protein involved in intra-Golgi transport (GATE-16), also known as ganglioside expression factor 2. More recently, an additional homologue has been identified as an early estrogen-regulated gene, gec1 (8Vernier-Magnin S. Muller S. Sallot M. Radom J. Musard J.-F. Adami P. Dulieu P. Rémy-Martin J.-P. Fraichard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Three GABARAP homologues have been identified from cDNA data base searching (9Xin Y., Yu, L. Chen Z. Zheng L., Fu, Q. Jiang J. Zhang P. Gong R. Zhao S. Genomics. 2001; 74: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); two are identical to ganglioside expression factor 2 and Gec1, and the third is very similar to Gec1. Yeast Aut7p (also known as Apg8) has recently been shown to undergo lipidation by a phosphatidylethanolamine on the carboxyl-terminal glycine carboxyl group of the mature protein (10Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Shsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). The terminal arginine is removed during the maturation of the protein by a protease and the lipid transferred by proteins related in sequence to the ubiquitin ligase enzyme families E1 and E2. The lipidation is essential for membrane dynamics during autophagy. GABARAP, GATE-16, and MAP-LC3 all covalently attach to the human homologue of the E1 enzyme Apg7p (11Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The recently determined crystal structure of GATE-16 (12Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) shows a ubiquitin-like fold with a unique amino-terminal helical extension. Both GABARAP and GATE-16 bind to ULK1, an unk51-like kinase involved in neurite extension, via a proline-serine-rich region (13Okazaki N. Yan J. Yuasa S. Ueno T. Kominami E. Masuho Y. Koga H. Muramatsu M. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of GABARAP and use NMR to assess the reported interactions with partner proteins using short peptides derived from GABAA γ2L and tubulin. The three-dimensional structure of GABARAP closely resembles that of GATE-16. Through peptide titrations monitored by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, we identify an apparently general low-affinity peptide-binding surface on GABARAP. However, under the conditions of these experiments, GABARAP fails to display significant specificity for peptides from either the carboxyl terminus of tubulin or the GABAA γ2L M3-M4 loop sequence that was used as bait in the original yeast two-hybrid screen. We discuss the implications of these results for the definition of the functional role of the GABARAP protein. For crystallography and later NMR samples, the GABARAP coding region was directionally cloned into a nonfusion derivative of expression vector pET28a (Novagen Inc., Stamford, CT), and the resulting construct was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the cell culture reached an optical density of A 600 = 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 16 h. The protein was purified at 4 °C by anion exchange (fast flow S-Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) on a NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0) eluting at about 0.4 m NaCl and gel filtration in 10 mmTris, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.0) (S200 Sephadex; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The experimental relative molecular mass for GABARAP determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was 13,914.6 daltons. Earlier NMR samples were made using a pET-15b His-Tag construct. This was grown under essentially the same conditions but with ampicillin (100 mg/liter) replacing the kanamycin. The protein was purified on Ni-NTA resin and eluted with 0.5 mimidazole, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration (S200 Sephadex; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Recombinant GABARAP was crystallized at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 2 μl of protein at a concentration of 36 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.0), and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), 20% (w/v) polyethylane glycol monomethylether 2000, and 10 mm nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate. Before flash-cooling, crystals were gradually equilibrated against reservoir solution containing, in addition, 20% polyethylene glycol 400. The final data were collected at 100K on station 14.1 at Council for the Cinwal Laboratory of the Research Councils Daresbury Laboratory using 1.488 Å monochromatic x-rays. Data were processed with MOSFLM/SCALA software (14Leslie A. Sawyer L. Issac N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, January 29-30, 1993.

These parameters predicted one molecule of GABARAP in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 30%. The coordinates of the GATE-16 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1EO6; chain A) (12Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) and yielded a solution with an initial R crys of 0.512 (against a previously obtained lower resolution dataset). Refinement against 1.75 Å data was performed using CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Final refinement was performed using Refmac5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A,. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) with TLS (21Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1998; 54: 507-514Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) parameters for GABARAP as a single body. Due to the wavelength used being close to the absorption edge of the nickel atom in the crystal, anomalous refinement was used in CNS with calculated anomalous scattering factors. In Refmac5, this phenomenon was approximated by altering the constant term of the Ni2+ scattering factor to −7.00. With either program, the greatest effect was on the B factor of the nickel atom, which was reduced to a value similar to the surrounding atoms; the effect on the R-factor was small. A nearly complete set of backbone resonance assignments for double 15N,13C isotope-labeled GABARAP has been obtained using triple resonance spectroscopy and is reported elsewhere by us (22Harris R. McAlister M.S.B. Sankar A. Phelan J.P. Moss S.J. Keep N.H. Driscoll P.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and independently (23Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Titrations of candidate peptide ligands with GABARAP were performed in the following manner. 1–5-μl aliquots of up to 50 μl of an approximately 20 mm solution of the peptide were added to 0.5 ml of a 0.3 mm solution of uniformly15N-labeled GABARAP at 20 °C. A two-dimensional15N,1H HSQC spectrum was recorded at each titration point, utilizing pulse field gradient sensitivity enhancement with water flip-back pulses to minimize cross-saturation (24Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Foman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The sample pH was verified after each addition of the peptide, and control pH titration experiments were performed to check the specificity of any cross-peak perturbations. Peptides were synthesized by commercial suppliers, and the composition and purity (>95%) of each were verified by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The crystal structure of GABARAP was solved at 1.75 Å resolution using molecular replacement with chain A of GATE-16 (56% sequence identity; Protein Data Bank accession code 1EO6) (12Paz Y. Elazar Z. Fass D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25445-25450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) as the starting model (Fig.1 a). The final refined GABARAP structure has an R-factor of 0.203 and a freeR-factor of 0.230 (TableI). All 117 amino acids are fully modeled along with a nickel cation, which forms a crystal contact, and 100 water molecules. The nickel atom is octahedrally coordinated by four clearly resolved water molecules and the side chain Nε atoms of His69 in one GABARAP molecule and His99 in a symmetry-related molecule.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsAll dataHighest resolution shellData collection Resolution (Å)22–1.751.84–1.75 Observations82,56011,020 Reflections11,0071,540 Completeness (%)97.695.1 Redundancy7.67.2 I/ς5.32.2 R-merge0.0650.247Refinement Resolution (Å)22–1.751.80–1.75 Refined observations10,450746 Free observations (5%)53333 R-factor (%)20.137.5 R-free (%)23.029.8Model No. of atoms998 protein, 100 water, 1 Ni RMS bond length (Å) 0.0251-aRMS, root mean square.RMS bond angle (°) 2.1 Average B (Å2)31.0 Main chain B (Å2)27.2 Side chain and water B (Å2)33.8 Wilson B (Å2) from TRUNCATE27.11-a RMS, root mean square. Open table in a new tab The GABARAP structure consists of a four-stranded β-sheet, with two α-helices adjacent to each face (Fig. 1 b). The major portion of the structure, from residue 28 onward comprising the four β strands and the last two α-helices, closely resembles the ubiquitin fold found in a large number of proteins. These include not only ubiquitin and homologues, but the ras binding domain family, the first subdomain of the FERM fold, and 2Fe-S ferrodoxin related domain. Against this similarity, the two α-helices at the amino terminus of GABARAP and GATE-16 are a unique feature of the protein fold. There are few differences between the GABARAP structure and that of GATE-16 (Fig. 1 a). The conformations of the carboxyl terminus (residue 111 onward) are different in the three structures (GABARAP and two GATE-16 conformers), possibly reflecting plasticity in this region that is affected by different crystal contacts in each case. Excluding the carboxyl terminus, the root mean square deviation for the GABARAP Cα atoms is 0.97 Å and 0.84 Å from chain A and chain B of GATE-16, respectively: the root mean square deviation between residues 1–111 (Cα atoms) of the two chains of GATE-16 is 0.50 Å. The regions of greatest divergence occur at the end of the second helix (residues 18–25), the loop (residues 37–40) between the first and the second β-strands, and the loops at the beginning and end of the third β-strand (residues 69–74 and 81–87). The conformation of the first loop differs due to the presence of a proline-lysine dipeptide at residue positions 37–38 in the GABARAP sequence, where there is serine-glycine in GATE-16. Glycine 42 in the GABARAP sequence allows the subsequent strand to adopt the same conformation as GATE-16. Similarly, the difference in the 69–74 region is most marked at residue 71, where there is an arginine residue in GABARAP and a proline in GATE-16. In the other two regions, the variation in the two GATE-16 structures is nearly as great as the variation of GABARAP from GATE-16. To evaluate the conservation patterns in the GABARAP family, a BLAST search of the human GABARAP sequence was run against the SwissProt data base including the translated EMBL data base (June 2001). SwissProt contains a large number of GABARAP-related proteins from Arabidopsis(8Vernier-Magnin S. Muller S. Sallot M. Radom J. Musard J.-F. Adami P. Dulieu P. Rémy-Martin J.-P. Fraichard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as from Caenorhabditis elegans (3Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andDrosophila (3Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These homologous proteins are in addition to the sequences discussed in the introduction. 11 loci encoding intact sequences of GABARAP/MAP-LC3-like proteins are found in the Ensembl annotation (www.ensembl.org) of the human data base. These loci correspond to GABARAP and the three homologues reported in Ref. 9Xin Y., Yu, L. Chen Z. Zheng L., Fu, Q. Jiang J. Zhang P. Gong R. Zhao S. Genomics. 2001; 74: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, a new sequence most closely related to GABARAP (GABARAPRL4) on chromosome 1q32 (although this lacks the conserved glycine that is reportedly lipidated in some family members), genes encoding the MAP-LC3 found on chromosome 12 and 16, two genes corresponding to deposited cDNA homologues of MAP-LC3, and two additional MAP-LC3-like sequences on chromosomes 9 and 12. These sequences are shown as a sequence alignment in Fig. 2. The residues totally conserved across all sequences in this family fall into several groups (Fig. 1 c). There are charged residues that form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between secondary structure elements (Lys6 to Asp/Glu100, Arg14 to Asp102, Glu34 to main chain N of residues 4 and 5, Asp/Asn45 to Arg67, Asn/Asp81 to Asp/Glu100, and Asp102 to Tyr106). The waters with the lowest B factors are also found in the region of these salt bridges, where they mediate extra hydrogen bonding (Z12, 86, 89, 90, 93 and 94 are shown in Fig. 1 c). There are conserved hydrophobic core residues (Pro30, Leu50, Val51, Ile64, Leu70, Val80, Tyr95, Phe104, and Tyr106). Tyr106 is particularly important to this family because it forms a hydrogen bond to Asp102 and provides an aromatic ring for one of the aromatic side chains near the amino terminus to pack onto (Phe3 in GABARAP and Trp3 in GATE-16). There are a series of residues important for turns and initiating secondary structure: Pro26 (loop that joins amino-terminal helices to the core ubiquitin fold), Pro52(end of β-strand), Ala75 (small side chains prevent clashes with residue 111 at the start of the β-strand), and Ser88 (turn leading into the carboxyl terminal α-helix). We have also examined the structural and dynamic properties of GABARAP using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. A nearly complete set of backbone resonance assignments for double 15N,13C isotope-labeled GABARAP has been obtained using triple resonance spectroscopy and is reported elsewhere by us (22Harris R. McAlister M.S.B. Sankar A. Phelan J.P. Moss S.J. Keep N.H. Driscoll P.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and by others (23Stangler T. Mayr L.M. Dingley A.J. Luge C. Willbold D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 183-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In summary, the patterns of chemical shifts, interproton nuclear Overhauser effects, and backbone scalar coupling constants are consistent with the secondary structure elements revealed by the x-ray structure of GABARAP. An interesting aspect of the NMR spectrum of GABARAP is that it contains features that indicate conformational heterogeneity of the amino-terminal region. Namely, we observed two amide NH cross-peaks in two-dimensional 15N,1H-correlated spectra for residues Glu17, Glu19, Lys20, and Leu105 (and two others that could not be assigned), indicating two-state conformational exchange on a slow timescale. In addition, it has proved impossible to unambiguously locate a number of resonances from neighboring regions of the structure (corresponding to Met1-His9, Phe11-Arg15, Arg22, Lys47, Glu100, Phe103, and Phe104). It is possible that, for these signals, the conformational exchange is occurring on a timescale that leads to strong line-broadening and low-intensity NMR cross-peaks. For GABARAP, the residues that exhibit evidence of conformational exchange cluster together around the amino-terminal helices (helices-1 and -2) and the internal salt bridges connecting Arg14 and Lys6 with Asp102 and Glu100, respectively. The precise nature of the conformational exchange that gives rise to these spectral characteristics is unclear at present. The GABARAP crystal structure exhibits no clear-cut evidence for conformational heterogeneity and therefore does not assist in rationalizing the solution NMR observations. It is worth noting that the NMR characteristics indicating conformational exchange in GABARAP persist for different values of the sample temperature (10 °C to 30 °C) and protein concentration (0.3–2.0 mm) and remain in samples containing up to 4 m urea denaturant (at pH 7.0). Nitrogen-15 relaxation analysis (26Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Palmer A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) of GABARAP yields a typical pattern of amide NH bond generalized order parameters (S2), with high values (>0.7) in the secondary structure elements and lower values in the loop regions (data not shown). The Lipari-Szabo formalism-derived rotational correlation time (28Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar) is rather high for a protein of this nominal molecular mass (∼16,000 daltons; τc ∼ 9.7 ns at 30 °C). However, we have detected no evidence, either by NMR or other methods, that GABARAP has any tendency to form transient oligomers. The dynamic properties of GABARAP are being further investigated in our laboratory. The interaction of GABARAP with short peptides derived from the GABAA receptor γ2L subunit (the predicted interaction site) and with the acidic carboxyl-terminal tails of α- and β-tubulin, which are regarded as likely microtubule interaction sites for GABARAP, has been probed using two-dimensional 15N, 1H HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The peptides used in the NMR ligand titrations are detailed in TableII, along with a summary of the spectral perturbations observed in each case.Table IISummary of peptide-induced GABARAP HSQC cross-peak perturbationsPeptideSequence and source2-aThe peptide sequences are listed using the one-letter amino acid code.

Peptide I is a truncated form of peptide II that corresponds to a 13-residue segment of γ2L that fails to interact with GABARAP-(36–117) in a similar assay (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Peptides III and IV correspond to the carboxyl-terminal tails of the α- and β-subunits of tubulin, regions that are thought to be exposed to solvent in intact microtubules (29Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 76-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Peptides V and VI, which were used as controls, are derived from two proteins with no reported involvement in binding to GABARAP and were randomly selected from a number of “irrelevant” peptides available in our laboratory. Fig. 3 shows the results of the GABARAP-peptide III titration in the form of superposition of a region of the NMR spectra obtained for a number of additions of peptide. For each titration performed, the peptide effected selective perturbations of a number of GABARAP cross-peaks, indicating structurally localized interaction of the peptide with the GABARAP protein. Control experiments were performed to check that the chemical shift changes are not attributable to small changes in the buffer conditions (e.g. pH, protein concentration) arising from addition of the peptide solution. The fact that the cross-peaks shift in a linear fashion across the spectrum, without diminution in intensity, indicates single-site peptide binding with fast exchange kinetics. Peptides I-VI were titrated to ∼3∼5-fold excess over the GABARAP protein (concentration, ∼0.5 mm). Qualitatively, the magnitude of the chemical shift perturbations over the whole titration is in the following order: peptide III ∼ peptide IV ∼ peptide V > peptide II > peptide I ∼ peptide VI. Only in the case of peptides III and IV was there evidence that the chemical shift perturbation was tailing off, indicating approach to saturation. Quantitative analysis of the change in chemical shift with peptide concentration yielded an estimate of the dissociation constant for peptides III and IV in the region of 0.1–0.2 mm. Dissociation constants for the other peptides were too high to be analyzed accurately. The data suggest that peptides I, II, and VI bind extremely weakly to GABARAP. The pattern of residues that exhibited peptide-dependent chemical shift changes is remarkably consistent across the whole series of peptides. Fig. 4, A−E,shows a three-dimensional representation of the GABARAP structure, highlighting the positions of the atoms with peptide-perturbed chemical shifts. In each case, there appears to be a bias of the larger chemical shift effects that is toward the surface of the protein opposite to the extreme amino and carboxyl termini, with clustering that appears to align with the exposed edge of β-strand 2 (e.g. residues Tyr49, Phe50, and Val51) and helix-3 (e.g. Phe60 and Ile64). Notably, none of the peptides alters the peak-doubled characteristic of those resonances from the amino terminus that indicate conformational heterogeneity. It seems the binding of peptides is not so strong as to perturb the global conformation of GABARAP in even a minor way. The NMR peptide titration experiments, designed to probe the interaction of putative protein ligands with GABARAP, yielded results that were consistent with relatively weak interactions (K d > ∼0.1 mm). Whereas structurally specific cross-peak perturbations were observed for peptides with sequences derived from both the GABAA receptor γ2L subunit and the carboxyl-terminal tails of α- and β-tubulin, similar effects were also observed for a randomly selected peptide from an irrelevant context (phosphopeptide V). A notable feature of these results is that both peptide II, which is overall positively charged, and peptides III and IV, which are strongly negatively charged, effected chemical shift changes in the GABARAP spectrum consistent with a similar binding site location (Fig. 4, B−D). The protein surface electrostatic properties of GABARAP indicate that the binding is to a positively charged area with a surface pit in the vicinity of β-strand 2 (Fig. 4 F). There is a single notable uncharged surface region focused around residues Pro84 and Pro85, but this does not appear to be a component of the ligand binding site. Overall, the NMR experiments have revealed that full-length GABARAP protein has a weak and nonspecific affinity for peptides that appears rather insensitive to the chemical composition. Apart from the apparent promiscuity of GABARAP for weak interactions with peptides of different composition, rationalization of these observations with the reported ability of GABARAP to bind the GABAA receptor γ2L subunit directly with sufficient strength to be detectable by in vitro pull-down assay (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) is not facile. GABARAP was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for molecules that interact with the M3-M4 loop of the γ2L subunit of GABAAreceptors. Notably, only a partial cDNA corresponding to GABARAP residues 36–117 was originally isolated from the library screen. Full-length GABARAP was ineffective at γ2L binding in the yeast two-hybrid assay, but it was shown that all of GST-GABARAP-(36–117), GST-GABARAP-(1–68), and GST-GABARAP-(1–117) were able to bind γ2Lin vitro. These results implicate GABARAP residues 36–68 in γ2L binding, and this observation could be considered broadly in line with our NMR observations of γ2L peptide binding (albeit with very low affinity) in the region of residues 49–51 (β-strand 2). However, given the compact three-dimensional structure of GABARAP, it is difficult to conceive of the GABARAP-(37–117) and GABARAP-(1–68) deletion constructs possessing a stable globular fold (Fig.1 b). Scission at residue 35 would remove the amino-terminal helices-1 and -2 and the second β-strand of the four-stranded β-sheet. Cleavage at residue 68 splits the molecule in two halves and deletes two β-strands and helices-3 and -4. The yeast two-hybrid screen results suggest that an 18-residue fragment of γ2L (which is too small to be structurally ordered) can interact with the GABARAP-(36–117) deletion mutant, a fragment that we must anticipate is not folded in the manner detected for the intact protein. These considerations suggest that due care should be adopted in interpreting the structure-function relationships underlying the results of experiments performed with GABARAP-(36–117) deletion constructs, particularly if invoking the folded form of the intact protein as part of the rationalization for biochemical interactions. GABARAP has also been reported to bind microtubules, and there has been speculation that the basic amino-terminal segment of the protein (corresponding to helices-1 and -2 in the x-ray structure) represents a site of interaction for acidic sites on α- and β-tubulin (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For example, omission of the first 35 amino acids of GABARAP ablates microtubule binding (2Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition, a peptide corresponding to the first 22 amino acids of GABARAP promotes microtubule assembly; a scrambled sequence peptide with the same amino acid composition lacks this activity (4Wang H. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However in NMR titration experiments with peptides corresponding to the flexible tails of both α- and β-tubulin proteins, we find that they do interact (albeit weakly), but with an interaction site on a part of the surface that is on the opposite side of the GABARAP molecule, away from the amino-terminal helices. The electrostatic properties of GABARAP (Fig. 4 F) demonstrate that the density of basic residues in the primary sequence of the amino-terminal region does not translate into a particularly positively charged surface in this region of the three-dimensional structure. Presumably, this effect occurs as a result of the neutralization of some of these residues in (partially) buried salt bridge interactions (e.g. Lys6 to Glu100 and Arg14 to Asp102). Confocal microscopy experiments have also shown that GABARAP does not co-localize exclusively with either the GABAA receptor or gephyrin (a second protein thought to be involved in organizing GABAA receptor at the postsynaptic membrane) and tends to be associated with endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes (6Kneussel M. Haverkamp S. Fuhrmann J.C. Wang H. Wässle H. Olsen R.W. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8594-8599Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GATE-16 binds to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, a protein that uses ATP to disassociate protein complexes that ensure correct membrane fusion. GABARAP has been shown to bind toN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor also (30Kittler J.T. Rostaing P. Schiavo G. Fitschy J.-M. Olsen R. Triller A. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It now seems likely that the GABARAP/GATE-16 family and probably the microtubule-associated protein 1A LC3 family as well are involved in the process of protein transport through the Golgi. The 10 different human gene sequences identified in this family of proteins give an opportunity for there to be specificity in interactions between GABARAP family members and the proteins they assist in transport. Alternatively, different GABARAP family members may act on different membranes as proposed for the rab family of G proteins (31Segev S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, there is also likely to be some redundancy in the function of these proteins, which will make identification of the specific roles of GABARAP family members a challenge.

Several studies have implicated the VT motif in the intracellular signaling functions of the receptor. In Xenopus, the Thr of the VT motif of the FGFR1 VT+ isoform is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). The biological activity of VT+ FGFR1 was reduced by phosphorylation by PKC, suggesting that PKC could negatively regulate FGFR1 VT+ activity (22Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Studies in transfected mammalian cells have shown that the VT+, but not the VT− form, could activate the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade, as measured by phosphorylation of Erk2 (23Twigg S.R. Burns H.D. Oldridge M. Heath J.K. Wilkie A.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that a major downstream channel of FGFR signaling is controlled by alternative splicing of the VT motif and that this splicing mechanism could therefore have important implications for FGFR function. Two adaptor proteins, FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2, FRS2α, or SNT1) and FGF receptor substrate 3 (FRS3, FRS2β, or SNT2), have been implicated in downstream signaling from activated FGFRs by means of direct interaction with the receptor (24Kouhara H.

These proteins share 49% sequence identity and are composed of an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) motif containing an N-terminal myristoylation site and an effector domain, which contains multiple potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation by activated FGFRs. FRS2 and FRS3 exhibit distinct spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression in vivo (27McDougall K. Kubu C. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Disruption of murine FRS2 is embryonic lethal at stage E7–E7.5 indicating that FRS2 plays an essential role in early development (28Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl.

Shp2 activation and binding to FRS2 are essential for FGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (30Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, protein kinase Cλ (PKCλ) and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), members of the atypical PKCs, have been shown to interact with FRS2 following FGF stimulation (31Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Activation of PKCλ is necessary and sufficient for its association with FRS2, although FRS2 was not a substrate for the PKCs. Activity of the atypical PKCs has been shown to be necessary for mitogenic signaling via the MAPK cascade (32Berra E. Diaz Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J.

An active mutant of PKCζ activated MAPK and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, and a dominant negative PKC impaired their activation. Therefore, FRS2 may activate MAPK by two pathways, through recruitment of Grb2 (28Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FRS2 also mediates recruitment of phosphoinositol 3-kinase to FGFRs via interaction of an adaptor protein, Gab1, with FRS2-associated Grb2 (28Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

Taken together, this evidence indicates that the interaction of FRS2 with FGFRs and the concomitant formation of a multiprotein signaling complex is a central element in multiple cellular responses to FGFR signaling. The juxtamembrane region of FGFR1 and the PTB domain of FRS2 are required and sufficient for interaction and phosphorylation of FRS2 (26Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

Alanine-scanned mutagenesis of residues Lys419, Ile421, Phe422, Leu423, Arg425, Val427, and Val429 of FGFR1 significantly diminished the binding of FRS2 to FGFR1 and had an inhibitory effect on MAPK activation. The structure of FRS2 PTB domain in a 1:1 complex with a peptide from the juxtamembrane region of human FGFR1 (amino acids 409–430) has been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance methods (38Dhalluin C.

In combination with site-directed mutagenesis, residues Leu423 and Val429 of FGFR1 were found to be most important for the FRS2/FGFR1 interaction followed by Val414, Leu417, Arg425, and Val427, supporting Ong et al.

Taken together, this evidence suggests that the functional significance of the VT+ and VT− alternatively spliced isoforms of FGFRs might be to control the formation of the FRS2-dependant signaling complex, thereby regulating the signaling processes that are activated by ligand engagement. Here we test this hypothesis by analysis of the interaction of FRS2 with different forms of the juxtamembrane domain of murine Fgfr1. We show that inclusion of the VT motif is required for binding of FRS2 to Fgfr1 in a kinase-independent manner. We also show that VT+/VT− splicing is regulated independently of splicing in the extracellular domain and that both VT isoforms are co-expressed in the same organs in vivo.

Mountford) with the Topaz (Packard) (primers: Tpz1, TGACTCGAGCGGCCAATTCGCCC; Tpz2, GCTCACCATGGTTGTGGCAAGCTTATC; Tpz3, GCCACAACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG; Tpz4, GGCTCTAGAATTCTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA). The cloned ires topaz fragment was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using XhoI andXbaI sites, excised from pcDNA3 using BamHI and XbaI, and inserted into pEF-BOS (39Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 185322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Splice overlap PCR was used to fuse the human FGFR2 signal sequence with human IgG1Fc (primers: HB11 (CGCGGATCCGAGCTCACCATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGTTTC), ss3′ (GATTTGGGCTCGGCCAGGGACAAGGTTGCC), Fc5′ (CCTGGCCGAGCCCAAATCTTGTGACAAAACTC), and Fc3′ (GCGGATATCCATATGTTTACCCGGAGACAGGGA)). The DNA fragment was inserted into the pEF-BOS-ires-Topaz vector using BamHI andEcoRV restriction sites. The region of murine Fgfr1IIIc (VT+) was amplified (primers: mflg5′ (ATGCGCGCATATGTGCTTGGCGGGTAACTCT) and using mflg3′ (GCCTGAGAGCGGCCGCTCAGCGCCGTTTGAGTCCA)) and using NdeI and NotI sites was inserted between the Fc and ires of the above plasmid. Kinase-dead FcFgfr1 (D623A), FcFgfr1 TT, and FcFgfr1 Y766F used megaprimer PCR to create mutations in FcFgfr1 VT+. FcFgfr1 VT− and FcFgfr1 VA used splice overlap PCR to create mutations in FcFgfr1 VT+. Primers were as follows: kinase-dead FcFgfr1 (mflg3′, ATPase (AGTGTATACACCGAGCCCTGGCTGCTATGGCTGCTAGGAAC) and mflg5′); FcFgfr1 TT (mflg5′, TT3′ (CAGCTGACACTGTTGTCTGTCTGCG), and mflg3′); FcFgfr1 Y766F (Y766F (TCCAACCAGGAGTTTCTGGACCTGTCCATACC), mflg3′, and mflg5′); FcFgfr1 VT- (mflg5′, VT-1 (AGCTGACACCTGTCTGCGCAGAGGGAT), VT-2 (CGCAGACAGGTGTCAGCTGACTCCAGTGCAT), and mflg3′); and FcFgfr1 VA (mflg5′, VT (AGCTGACACTGCTACCTGTCTGCGCAGAGC), VA splice overlap (CAGGTAGCAGTGTCAGCTGACTAA), and mflg3′). The PCR products were inserted into the FcFgfr1 VT+ construct using NdeI andNotI sites, replacing the FcFgfr1 VT+ with the mutated form. Using the FcFgfr1 VT+ as a template, the truncated receptor was amplified by PCR (primers: HB11 (CGCGGATCCGAGCTCACCATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGTTTC) and negative control (CGTAGATCGCGGCCGCTCAGCTCTTCTTGGTGCCGCT)). The PCR product was inserted into the FcFgfr1 construct using BamHI and NotI sites, replacing FcFgfr1 VT+ with the truncated version. Rat PC12 RNA was used in RT-PCR. Qiagen Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with a poly(dT) primer. Rat FRS2 cDNAs were amplified from the cDNA pool (primers: FRS2 5′KpnI (GCCGGTACCATGGGTAGCTGTTGTAGCTGT) and FRS2 (3′XhoI CGGCCTCGAGACATGGGCAGATCAGTACTATTGTG)). UsingKpnI and XhoI sites, the cDNA was inserted into the vectors pSECTAG 2B (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The 3′-end of FRS2 linked to Myc and poly(His) tags was amplified by PCR from the FRS2 pSECTAG 2B (primers: FRS2 5′middle (TAGGGCCAACCCCTGTTC) and XbaI FRS2 3′ (GGTTCTAGATCAATGATGATGATGATGATG)). The PCR product was inserted into FRS2 pcDNA3 using HpaI and XbaI sites. The final construct had FRS2 tagged at the 3′-end with Myc and poly(His) in pcDNA3. Cloned truncated FRS2 containing only the myristoylation and PTB domains using FRS2 as a template (primers: FRS2 5′KpnI (GCCGGTACCATGGGTAGCTGTTGTAGCTGT) and FRS2 PTB 3′ (CCGCTCGAGAGTCTCCGAACGAGGGGTATC)) was inserted into the plasmid usingKpnI and XhoI sites, replacing FRS2 with the truncated form. FRS2 amplified by PCR (primers: GST-FRS2 5′ (CGGGATCCATGGGTAGCTGTT) and GST-FRS2 3′ (CTGAATTCTACATGGGCAGATCAGTA)) was inserted into pGEX3C (2×) hOSM196 mod3 (from Marcos Vilchez) usingBamHI and EcoRI sites, replacing hOSM 196 mod3 with FRS2. The juxtamembrane regions of VT+ and VT− forms of murine Fgfr1 were amplified from the templates FcFgfr1 VT+ and VT− (primers: GST-juxt 5′ (TGGGATCCTCTGTCATCATCTATAAGAT) and GST-juxt 3′ (CGGAATTCTACTCAGGGAGCTCATATTCG)). The fragments were inserted into GST-FRS2 using BamHI and EcoRI sites, replacing FRS2 with the juxtamembrane regions. Human 293T kidney epithelial cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 units/ml penicillin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum (Labtech International). 293T cells were transiently transfected using CaPO4precipitation. Cells were grown to 70% confluency in 162-cm2 flasks in 25 ml of media. To 155 μl of 2m CaCl2, 60 μg of Qiagen prepared DNA were added. Water was added to a final volume of 1.5 ml, and the DNA/CaCl2 mixture was added dropwise to 1.5 ml of 2× HBS (1.6% NaCl (w/v), 1.2% Hepes (w/v), 0.04% Na2HPO4 (w/v), pH 7.12). The DNA/CaPO4 precipitate was incubated on the cells overnight and washed the following morning in media without serum. This was replaced with 25 ml of Ultracho media (Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.2 units/ml of penicillin. Recombinant proteins were expressed for 48 h. Transiently transfected 293T cells were washed twice in 25 ml of cold PBS and then lysed at 4 °C using 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of buffer) per 162-cm2flask of cells. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. To 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) 1 ml of 293T cell lysate was added and incubated for 1 h, at 4 °C, with mixing. The protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. Washed protein A-Sepharose resuspended in 500 μl of PBS was put down a sucrose column (400 μl of 20% sucrose, 300 μl of 10% sucrose) to remove precipitated proteins. After a final 1-ml wash in PBS, bound protein was eluted by boiling for 5 min in 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol (w/v), 4% SDS (w/v), 0.1% bromphenol blue (w/v), 10% β-mercaptoethanol (w/v)) for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Each 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) was calibrated with 3 μl of high molecular weight rainbow markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) at 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% azide (w/v) in TBS-T (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v)). Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in TBS-T and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times for 15 min in TBS-T and probed with the conjugated antibody for 30 min at room temperature, diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in TBS-T. The filter was washed five times in TBS-T, followed by a final wash in TBS (no Tween 20). Enzyme chemiluminescence (Pierce) was used for visualization and exposed to hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped for reprobing with 0.1 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.5, for 5 min at room temperature. A 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells transformed with the appropriate pGEX construct was grown in Lennox Broth (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.6–0.7. Protein was expressed at 25 °C for 4 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of MT-PBS (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were added to a 1 mm final concentration. Cells were sonicated four times for 15 s on ice and incubated on ice for 5 min in 1% Triton X-100. Cell debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins were purified on 0.8 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was prewashed with 5 ml of MT-PBS and MT-PBS, 1% Triton. The cell supernatant was applied, and the column was washed with 2.5 ml of MT-PBS, 0.1% Triton, 2.5 ml of MT-PBS and twice with 3 ml of wash buffer, pH 8.0 (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl). The GST fusion was eluted with 0.5-ml aliquots of 20 mm glutathione in wash buffer, pH 8.0. To cleave the protein, the column was washed twice in 3 ml of TNED (50 mmTris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with 10 μg of 3C protease overnight at room temperature with rotation. The cleaved protein was collected and washed from the column with 0.5-ml aliquots of TNED. Purity of the GST fusion and cleaved protein was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels and was assessed to be ∼50%. Purified, cleaved VT+ or VT− Fgfr1 juxtamembrane region was coated onto Nunc ImmunoTM plates at 5 μg/well in a 100-μl volume. Wells were washed three times each with PBS, 0.1% Tween and blocked with 150 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. A doubling dilution series of purified GST-FRS2 (0.25 μg/μl to 2.44 × 10−4 μg/μl diluted in PBS) was incubated overnight at room temperature (100 μl/well). A blank (PBS only) was also included. The following morning the wash step was repeated, and 100 μl of anti-GST diluted 1:1000 in PBS was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wash step was repeated, and 100 μl of anti-mouse IgG HRP diluted 1:5000 in PBS was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed again before applying the OPD substrate (Dako) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped after 5 min with 100 μl of 0.5 mH2SO4. Absorbance atA490 was measured. Triplicate samples were used. Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using Trizol® Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-step RT-PCR was performed on 2 μg of total RNA (primers: fgfr.22L, GGC TCA CTG CAC CAG ACC TG; fgfr.27R, GAG CTC ATA TTC GGA GAC TCC AGC) using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. The reverse transcription was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. The PCR was performed in 30 cycles: 92 °C, 20 s; touch-down 60 to 50 °C, 15 s; 72 °C, 20 s. The PCR product was digested withPshAI (New England Biolabs) and run on an agarose gel with a 1-kb ladder (Invitrogen). A constitutively active form of Fgfr1 (FcFgfr1) was generated by replacing the extracellular region of murine Fgfr1 with the Fc region of a human antibody molecule, IgG1. Part of the extracellular domain (last 24 bp) and the whole of the transmembrane and intracellular regions of Fgfr1 were fused to the Fc (Fig. 1). In this configuration, Fgfr1 kinase is activated constitutively via disulfide-mediated dimerization of the Fc extracellular domain. Functional studies were used to test for constitutive activation by assessing receptor dimerization and intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation. The receptor was transiently expressed in 293T cells, the cells were lysed, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated by direct interaction of the Fc of the receptor with protein A-Sepharose. Expression of the receptor was observed using an anti-Fc HRP antibody by Western blot (Fig.2a). Reprobing the same blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that the receptor had tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 2b). Under reducing conditions, the receptor ran as a monomer of ∼100 kDa. Under nonreducing conditions, disulfide bonds remained intact, and oligomeric complexes of the receptor were detected (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the Fc fusion receptor was constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Interaction of the receptor with known signaling proteins (PLCγ and Grb2) was confirmed, and the receptor was shown to correctly localize to the plasma membrane of transfected cells (results not shown).Figure 2Functional analysis of FcFgfr1. a, expression of FcFgfr1.

We subjected this domain to a combination of deletion and alanine/glycine scanning mutagenesis to detect mutations that would inhibit either responsiveness to Gq or Gq GAP activity. Most mutations that altered either response or GAP activity diminished both in parallel. Many of these mutations map at the interface at which the carboxyl-terminal domain was recently shown to form a dimer (Singer, A. U., et al. (2001) Nat. Struct. Biol., 9, 32–36). Most others clustered in an area that is a plausible Gαq binding site. In addition, one mutation that differentially inhibited GAP activity relative to responsiveness to Gαq mapped in this region at a location modeled to be in close contact with the switch II region of Gαq. This is the site at which RGS proteins are thought to exert their GAP activity. Last, a deletion mutation differentially inhibited the response of phospholipase C-β1 to Gαqwithout blocking GAP activity. Its location in the molecule suggests that moving the attachment point of the catalytic domain can disrupt its ability to be activated by Gαq.

They are structurally distinguished from the G protein-unresponsive PLCs γ, δ, and ε by a distinctive sequence amino-terminal to the catalytic domain and by a ∼40-kDa carboxyl-terminal extension (1Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Raven Press Ltd., New York1992: 35-61Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

PLC-β enzymes are stimulated both by GTP-bound Gα subunits of the Gq family (Gαq, Gα11, Gα14/15, and Gα16) and by Gβγ subunits, although relative sensitivity to Gαq and Gβγ varies among the four mammalian members of the PLC-β family (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Rebecchi M. Pentyala S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Stimulation of phospholipase activity by G proteins can exceed 100-fold in vitro, although both activity and relative stimulation are strongly influenced by the lipid interface at which the PIP2 substrate is found (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).In addition to their role as Gq-regulated effector enzymes, PLC-βs are also GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) specific for members of the Gαq family (4Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). PLC-β1 can increase the rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to Gq over 1000-fold (5Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The GAP activity of PLC-βs is thought to provide enhanced temporal responsiveness to signaling processes mediated by Gq and PLC-β and to minimize spontaneous activation (noise) in these pathways (6Ross E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar).The carboxyl-terminal domain of PLC-β, excluding the last ∼20 amino acid residues, is required for the enzyme to respond to activated Gαq (8Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments of this domain, some as small as 15 kDa, display Gq GAP activity independent of the PLC-β catalytic and amino-terminal domains (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and several mutations in this region inhibit response to Gαq (11Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-β constitutes all or part of the Gαq binding site. This idea is supported by the observation that the carboxyl-terminal domain can inhibit stimulation of PLC-β by Gq either using purified proteins in solution (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or in cells (12Beekman A. Helfrich B. Bunn Jr., P.A. Heasley L.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 910-913PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by binding and sequestering Gαq. In addition to displaying intrinsic GAP activity, the tails can potentiate and inhibit the GAP activity of PLC-β1 in a biphasic process and display biphasic stimulation/inhibition by themselves (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complex and biphasic regulatory behavior of the tails, both alone and in combination with full-length PLC-β1, led us to suggest that the tails can oligomerize both with themselves and with full-length PLC-β1. The idea that PLC-β may function as a dimer also agrees with the concentration-dependent activity described for PLC-β2 (13Paterson A. Boyer J.L. Watts V.J. Morris A.J. Price E.M. Harden T.K. Cell. Signaling. 1995; 7: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and with the observation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between differently fluorophore-labeled PLC-β2 molecules. 2L. Runnels and S. Scarlata, personal communication.2L. Runnels and S. Scarlata, personal communication.The structure of the carboxyl-terminal tail of turkey PLC-β2 was recently solved at the atomic level by Singer et al. (14Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The tail is a long, three-stranded coiled coil. Two tails bind to form an antiparallel dimer with its interface along the long axis of the coiled coils. The validity of the dimeric structure of the tails found in the protein crystal is supported by the functional data cited above.Prior to the solution of the tertiary structure of the PLC-β tail, we attempted to locate sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-β1 that, when mutated, would block its Gq GAP activity. We report here the location of one mutation that selectively inhibits GAP activity relative to responsiveness to stimulation by Gqand another that inhibits responsiveness with minimal loss of GAP activity. Most inactivating mutations, however, diminish both effects in parallel. Many of these mutations lie at the dimer interface. Others, along with the mutation that disproportionately inhibits GAP activity, point to a likely site of interaction with Gαq.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of the cDNA that encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain of rat PLC-β1 was performed on a 1130-bp AvaI cDNA fragment in pUC19. Most mutagenesis was performed using PCR, usually by the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). After the sequences of the mutants were verified, the AvaI fragment was returned to the full-length cDNA in bacterial expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen), which was modified to encode a His6 tag and include aNotI site in the multiple cloning site. For expression in Sf9 cells, the cDNA was transferred as aNotI-BamHI fragment to pVL1392 (15Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant baculoviruses were prepared as described previously (16Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion mutant Δ1123–38 was prepared in the Tail32 construct (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and that fragment was inserted into the full-length cDNA in pVL1392.Some PLC-β1 constructs were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Gαq, Gβ1γ2, and m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles that contain Gq and muscarinic 1 acetylcholine receptor were reconstituted as described previously (17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).PLC-β1 was routinely expressed in Escherichia coliSG13009/pREP4 as described previously (18Meij J.T.A. Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For evaluation of the activities of mutant PLC-β1s, the protein was partially purified by one-step affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The high-salt membrane extract from 1 liter of cells (18Meij J.T.A. Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was poured into a column and washed with 5 ml of buffer Y (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), 5 ml of 0.3 m NaCl in buffer Y, and 10 ml of buffer Y plus 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. PLC-β1 was eluted in 1 ml of 0.1m NaCl plus 150 mm imidazole in buffer Y.PLC-β1 that has been partially purified from E. coli is only 2–4% pure. To normalize multiple preparations to a fixed concentration of active enzyme, we assayed PLC activity in the presence of 5 μm Ca2+, as described below. The specific activity of rat PLC-β1 in this assay is identical for highly purified preparations of enzyme from Sf9 cells or E. coli (18Meij J.T.A. Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and total activity in an assay is proportional to the amount of enzyme added over the range of concentrations used here (data not shown). To determine the concentration of active PLC-β1, we divided its activity by the specific activity of the purified enzyme. This concentration was consistent with the total amount of immunoreactive PLC-β1 determined by Western blotting.PLC activity was determined by the method of Blank et al.(19Blank J.L. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18206-18216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which measures hydrolysis of [3H]PIP2added as mixed phospholipid vesicles. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min. Ca2+-stimulated activity was determined in the presence of 5 μm Ca2+, which was maintained with an EGTA buffer. Gαq-stimulated activity was measured in the presence of both 0.2 μm Ca2+ and Gαq that had been previously been activated by incubation with GTPγS (17Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Routine Gαq-stimulated assays used for screening mutants contained 2 nm Gαq, which is approximately equal to the EC50 (median effective concentration) (20Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V.

Assays were performed as described previously (4Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M.

Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This construct contains a designed deletion between residues 960 and 1001 (PLC-β1 residue numbers). The corresponding amino acid residues display 33% sequence identity and 52% similarity, with a 2-residue deletion and a 1-residue insertion (both in loops). The insertion, residues 947–950 in PLC-β1, is in a region that is poorly conserved among the PLC-βs. The deletion, 2 residues between PLC-β1 residues 1084 and 1085, is characteristic of PLC-β1; the sequence in this region is distinctive for each of the four PLC-β isoforms. Residues in the following groups were counted as similar: (A, S, T, C), (Y, F, I, L, V, M), (K, R), (E, D, Q, N), and (H, Y, F). To create the model, the turkey PLC-β2 side chains were replaced with the corresponding rat side chains using the Biopolymer module of the Insight II graphics package. Overlapping side chains were adjusted by manual rotamer, and energy was minimized using the Discover module of the same graphics package. Structural images of the resulting model were produced with the program Bobscript (22Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Modl. 1997; 15 (132–134): 112-113Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C (PLC)1-βs are metazoan PIP2-selective PLCs whose activity is stimulated by heterotrimeric G proteins. They are structurally distinguished from the G protein-unresponsive PLCs γ, δ, and ε by a distinctive sequence amino-terminal to the catalytic domain and by a ∼40-kDa carboxyl-terminal extension (1Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Raven Press Ltd., New York1992: 35-61Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

PLC-β enzymes are stimulated both by GTP-bound Gα subunits of the Gq family (Gαq, Gα11, Gα14/15, and Gα16) and by Gβγ subunits, although relative sensitivity to Gαq and Gβγ varies among the four mammalian members of the PLC-β family (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Rebecchi M. Pentyala S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Stimulation of phospholipase activity by G proteins can exceed 100-fold in vitro, although both activity and relative stimulation are strongly influenced by the lipid interface at which the PIP2 substrate is found (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In addition to their role as Gq-regulated effector enzymes, PLC-βs are also GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) specific for members of the Gαq family (4Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). PLC-β1 can increase the rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to Gq over 1000-fold (5Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The GAP activity of PLC-βs is thought to provide enhanced temporal responsiveness to signaling processes mediated by Gq and PLC-β and to minimize spontaneous activation (noise) in these pathways (6Ross E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of PLC-β, excluding the last ∼20 amino acid residues, is required for the enzyme to respond to activated Gαq (8Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments of this domain, some as small as 15 kDa, display Gq GAP activity independent of the PLC-β catalytic and amino-terminal domains (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and several mutations in this region inhibit response to Gαq (11Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-β constitutes all or part of the Gαq binding site. This idea is supported by the observation that the carboxyl-terminal domain can inhibit stimulation of PLC-β by Gq either using purified proteins in solution (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or in cells (12Beekman A. Helfrich B. Bunn Jr., P.A. Heasley L.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 910-913PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by binding and sequestering Gαq. In addition to displaying intrinsic GAP activity, the tails can potentiate and inhibit the GAP activity of PLC-β1 in a biphasic process and display biphasic stimulation/inhibition by themselves (10Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complex and biphasic regulatory behavior of the tails, both alone and in combination with full-length PLC-β1, led us to suggest that the tails can oligomerize both with themselves and with full-length PLC-β1. The idea that PLC-β may function as a dimer also agrees with the concentration-dependent activity described for PLC-β2 (13Paterson A. Boyer J.L. Watts V.J. Morris A.J. Price E.M. Harden T.K. Cell. Signaling. 1995; 7: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and with the observation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between differently fluorophore-labeled PLC-β2 molecules. 2L. Runnels and S. Scarlata, personal communication.2L. Runnels and S. Scarlata, personal communication. The structure of the carboxyl-terminal tail of turkey PLC-β2 was recently solved at the atomic level by Singer et al. (14Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The tail is a long, three-stranded coiled coil. Two tails bind to form an antiparallel dimer with its interface along the long axis of the coiled coils. The validity of the dimeric structure of the tails found in the protein crystal is supported by the functional data cited above. Prior to the solution of the tertiary structure of the PLC-β tail, we attempted to locate sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of PLC-β1 that, when mutated, would block its Gq GAP activity. We report here the location of one mutation that selectively inhibits GAP activity relative to responsiveness to stimulation by Gqand another that inhibits responsiveness with minimal loss of GAP activity. Most inactivating mutations, however, diminish both effects in parallel. Many of these mutations lie at the dimer interface. Others, along with the mutation that disproportionately inhibits GAP activity, point to a likely site of interaction with Gαq. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of the cDNA that encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain of rat PLC-β1 was performed on a 1130-bp AvaI cDNA fragment in pUC19. Most mutagenesis was performed using PCR, usually by the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). After the sequences of the mutants were verified, the AvaI fragment was returned to the full-length cDNA in bacterial expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen), which was modified to encode a His6 tag and include aNotI site in the multiple cloning site. For expression in Sf9 cells, the cDNA was transferred as aNotI-BamHI fragment to pVL1392 (15Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant baculoviruses were prepared as described previously (16Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For evaluation of the activities of mutant PLC-β1s, the protein was partially purified by one-step affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The high-salt membrane extract from 1 liter of cells (18Meij J.T.A. Ross E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was poured into a column and washed with 5 ml of buffer Y (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), 5 ml of 0.3 m NaCl in buffer Y, and 10 ml of buffer Y plus 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. PLC-β1 was eluted in 1 ml of 0.1m NaCl plus 150 mm imidazole in buffer Y.PLC-β1 that has been partially purified from E. coli is only 2–4% pure.

https://openalex.org/W2030117227,"As with most G-protein-coupled receptors, repeated agonist stimulation of the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) results in its desensitization, sequestration, and internalization. In this report, we show that agonist-induced PAFR internalization is independent of G-protein activation but is dependent on arrestins and involves the interaction of arrestins with a limited region of the PAFR C terminus. In cotransfected COS-7 cells, both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 could be coimmunoprecipitated with PAFR, and agonist stimulation of PAFR induced the translocation of both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. Furthermore, coexpression of arrestin-2 with PAFR potentiated receptor internalization, whereas agonist-induced PAFR internalization was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of arrestin-2. The coexpression of a minigene encoding the C-terminal segment of the receptor abolished PAF-induced arrestin translocation and inhibited PAFR internalization. Using C terminus deletion mutants, we determined that the association of arrestin-2 with the receptor was dependent on the region between threonine 305 and valine 330 because arrestin-2 could be immunoprecipitated with the mutant PAFRstop330 but not PAFRstop305. Consistently, stop330 could mediate agonist-induced arrestin-2 translocation, whereas stop305 could not. Two other deletion mutants with slightly longer regions of the C terminus, PAFRstop311 and PAFRstop317, also failed to induce arrestin-2 translocation. Finally, the PAFR mutant Y293A, containing a single substitution in the putative internalization motif DPXXY in the seventh transmembrane domain (which we had shown to be able to internalize but not to couple to G-proteins) could efficiently induce arrestin translocation. Taken together, our results indicate that ligand-induced PAFR internalization is dependent on arrestins, that PAFR can associate with both arrestin-2 and -3, and that their translocation involves interaction with the region of residues 318–330 in the PAFR C terminus but is independent of G-protein activation. As with most G-protein-coupled receptors, repeated agonist stimulation of the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) results in its desensitization, sequestration, and internalization. In this report, we show that agonist-induced PAFR internalization is independent of G-protein activation but is dependent on arrestins and involves the interaction of arrestins with a limited region of the PAFR C terminus. In cotransfected COS-7 cells, both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 could be coimmunoprecipitated with PAFR, and agonist stimulation of PAFR induced the translocation of both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. Furthermore, coexpression of arrestin-2 with PAFR potentiated receptor internalization, whereas agonist-induced PAFR internalization was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of arrestin-2. The coexpression of a minigene encoding the C-terminal segment of the receptor abolished PAF-induced arrestin translocation and inhibited PAFR internalization. Using C terminus deletion mutants, we determined that the association of arrestin-2 with the receptor was dependent on the region between threonine 305 and valine 330 because arrestin-2 could be immunoprecipitated with the mutant PAFRstop330 but not PAFRstop305. Consistently, stop330 could mediate agonist-induced arrestin-2 translocation, whereas stop305 could not. Two other deletion mutants with slightly longer regions of the C terminus, PAFRstop311 and PAFRstop317, also failed to induce arrestin-2 translocation. Finally, the PAFR mutant Y293A, containing a single substitution in the putative internalization motif DPXXY in the seventh transmembrane domain (which we had shown to be able to internalize but not to couple to G-proteins) could efficiently induce arrestin translocation. Taken together, our results indicate that ligand-induced PAFR internalization is dependent on arrestins, that PAFR can associate with both arrestin-2 and -3, and that their translocation involves interaction with the region of residues 318–330 in the PAFR C terminus but is independent of G-protein activation.

By using the techniques of ligand binding, immunostaining, inositol phosphate (IP) production, and intracellular calcium concentration measurement, we and others have demonstrated that PAFR is also subject to desensitization, internalization, and resensitization (9Ishii I.

The molecular mechanism through which PAFR is desensitized, internalized, and resensitized has not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of the current study is to demonstrate whether nonvisual arrestins interact with PAFR and participate in receptor internalization after agonist stimulation. Our results indicated that PAFR internalization was regulated by arrestin-2 and -3 and that the C terminus of PAFR contained arrestin-2 or -3 binding sites and contributed to arrestin translocation after PAF stimulation. In addition, the DPXXY motif in the seventh transmembrane domain of PAFR may be involved in maintaining the proper receptor conformation responsible for arrestin translocation and colocalization with PAFR. Finally, agonist-induced PAFR internalization and arrestin recruitment were independent of G-protein signaling. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: oligonucleotides were synthesized at Invitrogen,Pwo polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, restriction endonucleases and modifier enzymes were from Promega and Amersham Biosciences, bovine serum albumin and protein A-Sepharose from Sigma-Aldrich, FuGENE6 Transfection reagent from Roche, platelet-activating factor from Calbiochem, anti-GFP antibody from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), anti-β-arrestin-1 from Transduction Laboratory (San Diego, CA), anti-c-Myc from ATCC (Manassas, VA), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Bio Can Scientific (Mississauga, ON), and ECL Western blotting detection reagent kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Arrestin-2-GFP and arrestin-3-GFP expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. J. Benovic (Jefferson University, Philadelphia). The PAFR-GFP construct was made by amplifying PAFR cDNA without a stop codon by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TCAAGCTTATGGAGCCACATGACTCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGGGCCCAATTTTTGAGGGAATTGCCA-3′, digesting the PCR product withHind-III and Apa-I, and replacing the entire sequence of arrestin-3 from the arrestin-3-GFP expression vector digested with the same restriction endonucleases. The PAFR stop mutants were generated as already described (39Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for Stop305 were 5′-CCACATGACTCCTCCCACATG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATTCCTCAGAGGTGCTTGCGGAACTTC-3′. Stop311 was constructed by digestion with SphI. Constructs were sequenced at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. COS-7, CHO, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (DMEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12, and minimum essential medium (MEM), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml garamycin. For confocal microscopy, cells were seeded in 6-well plates containing a coverslip at a density of 1 × 105COS-7/well, 2 × 105 CHO/well, or 3 × 105 HEK293/well. Cells were transfected following manufacturer's instructions using FuGENE6 transfection reagent kits. 1–1.5 μg of DNA per well was used. For each 100-mm Petri dish (for coimmunoprecipitation), the total amount of DNA was 6 μg. RBL-2H3 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg of garamycin transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Competition binding curves were done on COS-7 cells expressing the wild type (WT) and mutant PAFR. Cells were harvested and washed twice in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.37 mmNaH2PO4,and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Binding reactions were carried out on 5 × 104 cells in a total volume of 0.25 ml in the same buffer with 10 nm[3H]WEB2086 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive WEB2086 or PAF for 90 min at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described with some modifications (36Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on coverslips (22 mm), 40 h post-transfection, treated with PAF 10−7m at 37 °C for different times, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min at room temperature). The coverslips were placed in 0.1% saponin in PBS for 20 min and then sequentially incubated with 5% dry milk and 0.01m glycine at room temperature for 20 min each. The cells were next incubated with an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody, followed with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. For live cell visualization, the cells grown on 22-mm coverslips were pretreated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min, and the coverslip was placed in a tissue culture chamber. The medium with cycloheximide, without fetal bovine serum, was added, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C. 10−7m PAF was added after the first image was taken. The cells were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Multi-Probe 2001 confocal argon laser scanning system equipped with a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence inverted microscope. Scanned images were transferred onto a Silicon Graphics Indy 4000 work station equipped with Molecular Dynamics Imagespace analysis software. 48 h after transfection, cells grown on 100-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS, treated with 10−7m PAF at 37 °C for the indicated time, and then lysed with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml AESBF, and 40 μg/ml TLCK). The lysate was solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The concentration of soluble protein was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were used for all subsequent immunoprecipitations. The precleared lysate was incubated with anti-c-Myc for 4 h, and then 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 3 h. After extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from beads with 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis. COS-7 cells transfected with correspondent plasmids were harvested 40 h post-transfection and subjected to flow cytometry analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON), as described previously (40Parent J.L. Gouill C.L. Escher E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23298-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). COS-7 cells transfected with indicated cDNAs were labeled for 18–24 h with [3H]myo-inositol (Amersham Biosciences) at 3 μCi/ml in DMEM (high glucose, without inositol, from Invitrogen). After labeling, cells were washed and preincubated for 5 min in PBS at 37 °C. The PBS was removed, and cells were incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm LiCl for 5 min, then stimulated for 10 min with the 10−6m PAF. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid. Inositol phosphates were extracted and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then counted by liquid scintillation. The mutants of PAFR used in this report are illustrated in Fig.1. The PAFR-GFP fusion protein was constructed in order to follow PAFR internalization in real time, and the C terminus deletion mutants were constructed in order to define the region of arrestin and GRK binding. The stop317, Asp-289, and Tyr-293 mutants have been described previously (39Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol.

The binding characteristics of PAFR-GFP and stop311 were examined in transiently transfected COS-7 cells using WEB2086, a PAFR receptor antagonist, (Fig. 2) and showed that both mutant receptors had an affinity comparable with that of wild-type PAFR. Response to PAF as measured by inositol phosphate production was similar to WT in both PAFR-GFP and stop311 (results not illustrated). Stop305, on the other hand, showed significantly reduced binding and IP production, ∼10% of WT (results not illustrated). In this study, we used four different cell types (COS-7, CHO, HEK293, and RBL-2H3) to assure ourselves of the universality of the studied mechanisms. Experiments were done with all the cell types, but only one is illustrated for each experiment.Figure 2Competition binding isotherms of [3H]WEB2086 by WEB2086 in COS-7 cells.[3H]WEB2086 binding was measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” on cells transiently expressing the WT, stop311, and PAFR-GFP receptors. The results are representative of three independent experiments, each done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We had shown that the human PAFR is internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles (39Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have now investigated whether internalization was associated with arrestins. Fig. 3 A shows that in COS-7 cells transfected with PAFR-GFP cDNA coexpression of arrestin-2 potentiated internalization after PAF stimulation, whereas a dominant negative mutant of arrestin-2 inhibited internalization. When cells were observed in real time using a temperature-controlled chamber, the overexpression of arrestin-2 in HEK293 cells also potentiated internalization. Fig. 3 B shows that in cells transfected with PAFR-GFP the receptor was partially internalized within 30 min, but when arrestin-2 was coexpressed the receptor was completely internalized within this time frame. In addition, the receptor was internalized in much larger vesicles than without arrestin coexpression. The same phenomena were observed when the cells were cotransfected with arrestin-3 (results not illustrated). We coexpressed WT PAFR and arrestin-2-GFP or arrestin-3-GFP in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated the receptor, and showed that both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 could coimmunoprecipitate with the WT receptor (Fig.4 A). In CHO cells cotransfected with PAFR and arrestin-2-GFP cDNAs, PAF induced a redistribution of arrestin-2 from the cytosol to the cellular membrane within 5 min; by 30 min, both the receptor and arrestin colocalized to discrete intracytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 4 B). This contrasted with much more discrete internalization of the PAFR when cotransfected with only the GFP protein (Fig. 4 B,lower left panel). Similar results were seen with arrestin-3-GFP cotransfection (results not illustrated). Because our results indicated that arrestins were necessary for PAFR internalization, we used certain mutants of PAFR that showed different internalization properties to verify whether they could coimmunoprecipitate arrestin-2. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with arrestin-2 and either WT or mutant PAFR or pcDNA3. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-arrestin-2 antibodies, followed by anti-PAFR polyclonal antibodies to verify the levels of PAFR. The total cell lysates were blotted with anti-arrestin-2 antibodies to verify equivalent arrestin expression in all samples. The results indicate that the 25 amino acids between residues 305 and 330 of the receptor are essential for arrestin association (Fig.5). Because we had shown that this region was also, at least in part, involved in the internalization of the receptor, we used a mutant receptor which does not internalize but has a mutation that is not in the C terminus. The mutant D289A, which is impaired in its internalization potential, failed to coimmunoprecipitate arrestin-2, whereas the mutant D289N (39Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which internalizes normally, coimmunoprecipitated with arrestin-2 comparably to WT (Fig. 5). We next examined whether mutant PAFRs that did not internalize and/or were not coupled to G-proteins could induce the translocation of arrestins. Both mutants D289A and Y293A are not coupled to G-proteins but, unlike D289A, Y293A internalizes comparably to WT (39Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conservative substitutions of these residues D289N and Y293F produce receptors that are both coupled to G-proteins and internalize. Fig. 6 shows that after PAF stimulation all mutants induced arrestin-2-GFP translocation to the membrane with the exception of D289A. These results support the hypothesis that arrestins are necessary for PAFR internalization but that G-protein coupling is not necessary for arrestin translocation. The role of the C terminus of PAFR in the redistribution of arrestins was examined with C terminus deletion mutants. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with arrestin-2-GFP and PAFR WT or stop mutant cDNAs, and redistribut"

Mammalian MTHFRs are inhibited by AdoMet in vitro, and it has been proposed that methyl group biogenesis is regulated in vivoby this feedback loop. In this work, we used metabolic engineering in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test this hypothesis. Like mammalian MTHFRs, the yeast MTHFR encoded by the MET13gene is NADPH-dependent and is inhibited by AdoMet in vitro. This contrasts with plant MTHFRs, which are NADH-dependent and AdoMet-insensitive. To manipulate flux through the MTHFR reaction in yeast, the chromosomal copy ofMET13 was replaced by an Arabidopsis MTHFR cDNA (AtMTHFR-1) or by a chimeric sequence (Chimera-1) comprising the yeast N-terminal domain and the AtMTHFR-1 C-terminal domain. Chimera-1 used both NADH and NADPH and was insensitive to AdoMet, supporting the view that the C-terminal domain is responsible for AdoMet inhibition. Engineered yeast expressing Chimera-1 accumulated 140-fold more AdoMet and 7-fold more methionine than did the wild-type and grew normally. Yeast expressing AtMTHFR-1 accumulated 8-fold more AdoMet. This is the first in vivo evidence that the AdoMet sensitivity and pyridine nucleotide preference of MTHFR control methylneogenesis. 13C labeling data indicated that glycine cleavage becomes a more prominent source of one-carbon units when Chimera-1 is expressed. Possibly related to this shift in one-carbon fluxes, total folate levels are doubled in yeast cells expressing Chimera-1.

Methionine gives rise toS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is used for numerous methylation reactions. Because the MTHFR reaction commits the methyl group carried by THF to methyl group biogenesis, the regulation of MTHFR is crucial for one-carbon (C1) metabolism in all organisms (1Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 2Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13217-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The MTHFR reaction in mammalian liver is NADPH-dependent and is consequently physiologically irreversible due to the high cytosolic NADPH/NADP ratio and the large standard free energy change for the reduction of CH2-THF (3Vanoni M.A. Matthews R.G.

Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 155: 378-381Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This reaction therefore has the potential to deplete the cytosolic CH2-THF pool (1Appling D.R.

Mammalian MTHFRs have been shown to be inhibited by AdoMet (6Jencks D.A. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2485-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R.

However, there is no direct evidence for the existence of this regulation in vivo. Plant MTHFRs are NADH-dependent and are thought to be cytosolic. Due to the high cytosolic NAD/NADH ratio (8Heineke D. Riens B. Grosse H. Hoferichter P. Peter U. Flugge U.-I. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. 1990; 95: 1131-1137Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the MTHFR reaction in planta is likely to be reversible, obviating a need for regulation by AdoMet (9Roje S. Wang H.

Consistent with this, plant MTHFRs are AdoMet-insensitive (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Schizosaccharomyces pombe have two divergent copies of the MTHFR gene. The MTHFR genes of S. cerevisiae(MET12 and MET13) have been cloned and shown to encode functional enzymes (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but neither their pyridine nucleotide requirement nor their AdoMet sensitivity has been investigated. Strains in which MET13 is disrupted require methionine for growth. However, met12 disruptants have no methionine requirement, and overexpressing Met12p does not eliminate the methionine requirement of met13 disruptants. These data indicate that the Met13p isozyme provides most of the MTHFR activity in yeast cells (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All known eukaryotic MTHFRs comprise an N-terminal domain that contains the catalytic site and a C-terminal domain that is implicated in the regulation of enzymatic activity (11Matthews R.G.

The C-terminal domain of mammalian MTHFRs contains the AdoMet-binding site and is therefore considered responsible for the enzyme's sensitivity to this effector (11Matthews R.G.

The NADH-dependent, AdoMet-insensitive MTHFR ofEscherichia coli (MetF) lacks the C-terminal domain (15Katzen H.M. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol.

In this study, we first showed that S. cerevisiae Met13p is NADPH-dependent and inhibited by AdoMet, like mammalian MTHFRs. We then constructed a chimeric yeast-plant MTHFR (Chimera-1) and characterized its pyridine nucleotide dependence and AdoMet sensitivity. Finally, we used metabolically engineered yeast strains expressing AdoMet-insensitive MTHFRs (AtMTHFR-1 or Chimera-1) to establish the importance of the AdoMet feedback loop in vivo. [14C]Formaldehyde (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and (6R,6S)-[methyl-14C]CH3-THF (56 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.; specific radioactivities were adjusted to the desired values with unlabeled compound. THF and (6R,6S)-CH3-THF were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). [13C]Formic acid (99% 13C) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (recombinant Leuconostoc mesenteroides enzyme) and all other biochemicals were from Sigma. Glass beads were acid-etched. CHIMERA-1 was constructed using gene splicing by overlap extension (18Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were amplified by high-fidelity PCR using recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The Met13p N-terminal domain (residues 1–333) was amplified from theMET13-pVT101-U plasmid using primers 5′-CATGAAGATCACAGAAAAATTAGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTTTGCCCAGAAGATAGGTCTGACTTCC-3′ (reverse). The AtMTHFR-1 C-terminal domain (residues 327–592) was amplified from the AtMTHFR1-pVT103-U plasmid using primers 5′-CCTATCTTCTGGGCAAACCGTCCAAAGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCACTGCAGTCAAGCAAAGACAGAGAAG-3′ (reverse). The two amplified fragments were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and joined by PCR usingMET13 forward and AtMTHFR-1 reverse primers to generate theCHIMERA-1 DNA. The CHIMERA-1 DNA was inserted into yeast expression vector pVT103-U. The resulting construct was introduced by electroporation into E. coli DH10B cells. After verification by sequencing, the construct was introduced as described previously (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) into yeast strain RRY3 (Δmet12Δmet13) for enzyme studies and into strain SCY1 (MET12 Δmet13) for complementation. Synthetic minimal medium (YMD medium) contained 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (DIFCO Bacto®), 2% glucose, and the following supplements when indicated:l-serine (375 mg/liter), l-leucine (30 mg/liter), l-histidine (20 mg/liter),l-tryptophan (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), glycine (20 mg/liter), formate (250 mg/liter), and l-methionine (20 mg/liter). Cultures were grown at 30 °C in a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Pre-sporulation medium contained 0.8% Bacto-yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto-peptone, 10% glucose, and 2% Bacto-agar. Minimal sporulation medium contained 1% potassium acetate and 2% Bacto-agar. The S. cerevisiae strains used were DAY4 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4), RRY1 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4Δmet13), and RRY3 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4Δmet12 Δmet13) (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D.

The plasmids were pVT101-U and pVT103-U (19Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), pVT101-U containing the yeastMET13 gene (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem.

The CHIMERA-1-pVT103-U plasmid was used as template to construct strain RRY5 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4 Δmet12 Δmet13::CHIMERA-1) by gene replacement. The CHIMERA-1 open reading frame was amplified with primers 5′-CAACAGGTTCATGCCACTGG-3′ and 5′-ACAATGGAAAAGGAAGGAGCAAAATCTGGTAAAAATTCTCGGAGATCAAGCA-3′. The 1.4-kbpCHIMERA-1 fragment was gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and used to transform the methionine-requiring strain RRY3. Transformants were selected by methionine prototrophy indicating successful integration of the CHIMERA-1 fragment. Correct integration at the disrupted met13 locus was confirmed by PCR. SCY1 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4 Δmet13) and SCY4 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4 Δmet13::CHIMERA-1) were constructed by crossing RRY1 and RRY5. The resulting diploids were sporulated by incubation on pre-sporulation medium at 30 °C for 2 days, followed by transfer to minimal sporulation medium supplemented with serine, uracil, tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and incubation for 5–7 days at 25 °C. Tetrads were dissected as described previously (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SCY6 (ser1 ura3–52 trp1 leu2 his4 Δmet13::AtMTHFR-1) was constructed by gene replacement. The AtMTHFR-1 open reading frame was amplified with primers 5′-AACAGAACCACCACAGTTACTACTACAACCACATCGCAATATGAAGGTGGTTGATAAGAT-3′ and 5′-TGACAATTCTGTTAAAGAACTGTTATCGTTGTCTGTGTTATCAAGCAAAGACAGAGAAGA-3′. The amplified 1.9-kbp DNA fragment was used to transform the methionine-requiring strain RRY1; transformants were selected by methionine prototrophy and confirmed by PCR as described above. Yeast cells were grown, washed, and extracted as described previously (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

MTHFR activity was assayed in the reductive direction using the NAD(P)H-CH2-THF oxidoreductase radioassay described previously (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y.

Unless otherwise noted, substrates were saturating, and product formation was proportional to enzyme concentration and time. Yeast cells were grown in YMD medium supplemented with glycine, formate, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil. Cells were harvested in mid-log growth and washed with water. To measure AdoMet, the cell pellet (300 mg wet weight) was resuspended in 500 μl of water and lysed by vortexing with glass beads for 5 × 30 s. Protein from clarified lysates was precipitated with ethanol (final concentration, 70%) at −20 °C for 15 min and removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness in vacuo, dissolved in water, and analyzed by isocratic HPLC (20Wise C.K. Cooney C.A. Ali S.F. Poirier L.A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 696: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using a Waters Spherisorb ODS2 column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a Beckman Coulter System Gold 126 Solvent Module and 168 Detector and a Rheodyne 7725i Injector. The mobile phase was 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm 1-heptanesulfonic acid, and 20% methanol, pH 4.4; column temperature was 22 °C, flow rate was 0.8 ml min−1, and run time was 30 min. To determine methionine, 200-mg samples of wet cells were suspended in 180 μl of water and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling on ice, cells were extracted essentially as described above, except that protein was precipitated with 5-sulfosalicylic acid (final concentration, 3.5%). The deproteinized samples were submitted to Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX) for amino acid analysis using a Beckman 7300 analyzer. Yeast cells were grown in 500-ml cultures supplemented with [13C]formate (250 mg/liter) and unlabeled glycine, harvested at anA600 of 3–5, and washed with water. Extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet from the whole culture in 500 μl of water and lysing with glass beads by continuous vortexing at 4 °C for 20–30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and proteins were precipitated with ethanol as described above. The deproteinized supernatant was dried in vacuo and redissolved in 1 ml of D2O. NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity-Inova Spectrometer with a 1H frequency of 500 MHz and a 13C frequency of 125 MHz. 13C data were collected with an acquisition time of 1.3 s with a 3-s delay and 90° pulse angle. Two-level composite pulse was used for proton decoupling with a power level of 48 dB during acquisition and 40 dB during delay. A total of 200–2000 scans of 64,000 data points were acquired over a sweep width of 25 kHz. Data processing included exponential line broadening of 1 Hz. [methyl-13C]AdoMet was quantified by comparing NMR peak heights with a standard sample of known concentration. Yeast strains were grown, harvested, and washed as described for AdoMet and methionine determination. Pelleted cells were suspended in twice their wet weight of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid, 0.2 m2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, pH 7.9). Glass beads were added at 1.5 times the wet weight of the pellet. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and lysed by vortexing for 4 min. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min), supernatants were decanted, their volumes were measured, and they were stored at −70 °C until analysis. Folate species were separated by HPLC and quantified using the Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay (21Wilson S.D. Horne D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recombinant Met13p was overexpressed in RRY3, amet12 met13 double disruptant that totally lacks MTHFR activity and is a methionine auxotroph (10Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pyridine nucleotide preference and AdoMet sensitivity of recombinant Met13p were tested by measuring enzyme activity radiometrically in the forward (reductive) direction in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Met13p was found to be strictly NADPH-dependent and to be inhibited by AdoMet (Fig. 1A). Activity with NADH as reductant was below the detection limit of the assay (<2% of activity with NADPH). A chimeric MTHFR (Chimera-1) was constructed by fusing the N-terminal (catalytic) domain of Met13p to the C-terminal domain of a plant MTHFR (AtMTHFR-1 fromArabidopsis thaliana; Ref. 9Roje S. Wang H.

Fig.2A shows the domain structure of the chimeric enzyme and its parents schematically; Fig.2B shows the sequence of the Chimera-1 polypeptide. TheCHIMERA-1 DNA was cloned into the yeast expression vector pVT103-U and introduced into strain SCY1 (MET12Δmet13). A MET12+ strain was used to avoid any possible growth effects of a met12 mutation. The transformation yielded methionine-independent colonies whose growth was comparable with that of the wild-type strain DAY4, or SCY1 transformed with MET13-pVT101-U (Fig.3). No complementation was observed with the vector alone, and retransformation of SCY1 with rescued plasmid containing CHIMERA-1 restored methionine prototrophy, confirming that the complementation is due to the plasmid-encoded chimeric enzyme (data not shown). Arabidopsis MTHFR (AtMTHFR-1), expressed from pVT103-U, was previously shown to complement the methionine requirement of a yeast met13mutation (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R.

Recombinant Chimera-1 overexpressed in yeast strain RRY3 was tested for pyridine nucleotide preference and AdoMet sensitivity as described above for Met13p. Chimera-1 was found to use both NADH and NADPH (Fig. 1B), which was unexpected because its yeast and plant parents use either one or the other (Fig. 1,A and C). However, as anticipated, Chimera-1 was totally insensitive to AdoMet (Fig. 1B), like the plant enzyme that contributes its C-terminal region (Fig. 1C). Velocity versus [S] plots for both Met13p and AtMTHFR-1 showed substrate inhibition by CH2-THF that was especially marked in the case of Met13p (Fig.4). The Km andKi values of these two enzymes for CH2-THF were accordingly calculated as described by Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 2. Academic Press, New York and London1971: 35-43Google Scholar). Chimera-1 showed no inhibition by CH2-THF within the range tested (Fig. 4). Its Km values for CH2-THF were therefore estimated from Hanes plots; these values were similar whether NADH or NADPH was the reductant and fell midway between those of the parent enzymes (TableI). Because the activities of Met13p and AtMTHFR-1 were inhibited by CH2-THF, apparentKm values of these enzymes for NADPH and NADH were compared with those of Chimera-1 using a nonsaturating CH2-THF concentration of 50 μm (Table I). The apparent Km values of Chimera-1 for both NADPH and NADH were closer to that of AtMTHFR than to that of Met13p.Table IApparent Km and Ki values of MTHFRs for NADPH, NADH, and CH2-THFRecombinant enzymeMet13pAtMTHFR-1Chimera-1Km(μm) CH2-THF (NADH)1-aPyridine nucleotide used.287106 CH2-THF (NADPH)1-aPyridine nucleotide used.11152 NADH2.72.8 NADPH217.3Ki (μm) CH2-THF (NADH)1-aPyridine nucleotide used.873nd1-bnd, not determined.

To study how AdoMet sensitivity and pyridine nucleotide specificity impact the function of MTHFR in vivo, we engineered strains in which the coding sequence of AtMTHFR-1 or Chimera-1 replaced that of the chromosomal MET13 gene. The introduced sequences were thus present as single chromosomal copies under the control of the native promoter, ensuring an expression level comparable to that of MET13. Replacement of theMET13 open reading frame with Chimera-1 and AtMTHFR-1 gave strains SCY4 and SCY6, respectively. The growth rates of these strains in YMD medium supplemented with serine, histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and uracil were similar to that of the wild-type (doubling times, 2.5 ± 0.2 h). Thus, both the chimeric enzyme and the plant enzyme complemented the methionine requirement when expressed from the chromosomal MET13 promoter. AdoMet and free methionine were determined by HPLC. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, strain SCY6 expressing the AdoMet-insensitive, NADH-dependent AtMTHFR-1 accumulated 8-fold more AdoMet than the DAY4 strain expressing the native Met13p enzyme. Strain SCY4 expressing the AdoMet-insensitive, NADH- or NADPH-dependent enzyme Chimera-1 accumulated even more AdoMet (140-fold more AdoMet than DAY4) (Fig. 5A). Along with the greatly elevated AdoMet level, strain SCY4 accumulated 7-fold more methionine than DAY4 (Fig.5B). AdoMet hyperaccumulation was seen in SCY4 cultures harvested at a range of cell densities; its magnitude varied from 75-fold to 254-fold above wild-type in four independent experiments (data not shown). The yeast strains used in this study are all ser1 strains that are blocked at phosphoserine aminotransferase and thus require serine for growth; glycine (or glycine plus formate) can substitute for serine. Use of ser1− strains allows controlled introduction of C1 units via the cytosolic C1-THF synthase by providing formate or via the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system by providing glycine (24Appling D.R. Kastanos E. Pasternack L.B. Woldman Y.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To identify the source(s) of C1 units for production of AdoMet, we determined the methyl-13C enrichment of AdoMet in cultures supplemented with [13C]formate and unlabeled glycine. The methyl-13C enrichment under these conditions measures the relative contributions to methyl group synthesis of C1 units originating from cytosol and mitochondria (25Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Pasternack L.B. Littlepage L.E. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The methyl-13C enrichment values were 0.92 for the wild-type expressing Met13p and 0.54 for a strain expressing Chimera-1. These data show that with wild-type Met13p, >90% of AdoMet comes from [13C]formate, whereas only 54% comes from [13C]formate when Chimera-1 replaces Met13p. Thus, AdoMet hyperaccumulation is associated with a far greater contribution from mitochondrial glycine cleavage to the C1unit pool. The pools of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 5-CH3-THF, and THF were determined by HPLC combined with microbiological assay (21Wilson S.D. Horne D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Horne D.W. Patterson D. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2357-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The most abundant folate in all strains was 5-CH3-THF, constituting ≥68% of the total folate pool. The other folates (10-formyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and THF) each represented <15% of the total in all strains (TableII). The most striking difference between the strains was that SCY4 expressing Chimera-1 had more than twice the total folate content of the wild-type strain DAY4 (156versus 66 nmol g−1 wet weight), although the relative amounts of the individual folates were essentially unchanged. Another difference was that strain SCY6 expressing AtMTHFR-1 showed only a slight increase in total folate relative to the wild-type DAY4, but its 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and THF pools were doubled.Table IIFolate levels in DAY4, SCY4, and SCY6 yeast strainsStrain10-CHO-THF2-a10-CHO-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; 5-CHO-THF, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate.THF5-CHO- THF5-CH3- THF(nmol g−1wet weight)DAY4 (MET13)6.54.36.249.2SCY4 (Δmet13 CHIMERA-1)19.914.113.5108.4SCY6 (Δmet13 AtMTHFR-1)12.09.25.455.4Yeast were grown in minimal medium supplemented with glycine, formate, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil.

Open table in a new tab Yeast were grown in minimal medium supplemented with glycine, formate, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil. Folate species were determined by HPLC; data are means of duplicates. Characterization of yeast Met13p shows that its properties are very much like those of mammalian MTHFRs: Met13p is AdoMet-sensitive, NADPH-dependent, and susceptible to substrate inhibition by CH2-THF. Photoaffinity labeling evidence indicates that the AdoMet-binding site of porcine and human MTHFRs lies in the C-terminal domain, within a stretch of about 30 residues starting 30 residues after the junction between the domains (12Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Sumner J. Jencks D.A. Khani S. Matthews R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7697-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of Met13p in this region is far closer to that of human MTHFR (41% identity and 66% similarity) than to that of the AdoMet-insensitive plant enzyme AtMTHFR-1 (20% identity and 44% similarity). Outside this region, all three MTHFRs share about ∼40% identity. The primary structure of Met13p is thus consistent with the AdoMet-binding site being in the proximal part of the C-terminal domain. The effects of allosteric inhibition by AdoMet and pyridine nucleotide preference on the in vivo control of MTHFR activity were assessed in metabolically engineered yeast strains SCY6 and SCY4. Strain SCY6 expresses an AdoMet-insensitive, NADH-dependent plant enzyme, AtMTHFR-1. Strain SCY4 expresses the chimeric enzyme Chimera-1, comprising the Met13p N-terminal domain and the AtMTHFR-1 C-terminal domain. Chimera-1 is an active, AdoMet-insensitive enzyme that uses both NADPH and NADH. The AdoMet insensitivity of Chimera-1 is consistent with the C-terminal domain of MTHFR being responsible for sensitivity to AdoMet. Because the determinants for pyridine nucleotide binding are located in the N-terminal domain (27Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G Ludwig M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), the loss of selectivity for NADPH in Chimera-1 could reflect distortion in the tertiary structure of its Met13p N-terminal domain caused by fusion to a foreign C terminus. Another possibility is that interaction between the catalytic and C-terminal domains guides the specificity of the enzyme for its pyridine nucleotide substrate. In either case, it is noteworthy that porcine MTHFR can use NADH as a substrate if the assay is carried out in the presence of phosphate, for this shows that the enzyme's pyridine nucleotide specificity can be readily altered (28Matthews R.G. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6014-6017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent lack of substrate inhibition of Chimera-1 by CH2-THF may likewise be explained by distorted tertiary structure or by modified domain interaction. The overaccumulation of methionine and AdoMet in yeast strains engineered with the AdoMet-insensitive AtMTHFR-1 or Chimera-1 (8- and 140-fold more AdoMet, respectively) provides the first in vivo evidence that allosteric inhibition of MTHFR by AdoMet controls the commitment of C1 units to methylneogenesis. The more dramatic effect of Chimera-1 may be explained by its ability to utilize NADPH as well as NADH (Fig.6). The redox state of the NAD(P) pool is known to affect the reversibility of the MTHFR reaction. In mammals, the almost completely reduced NADP pool (NADPH/NADP ratio of ∼107) ensures that the MTHFR reaction is practically irreversible (3Vanoni M.A. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5272-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Green J.M. Ballou D.P. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 155: 378-381Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In plants, the NAD pool is highly oxidized (NADH/NAD ratio of ∼10−3) and is thought to make the MTHFR reaction freely reversible (9Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reliable measurements of cytosolic NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios in yeast are lacking. However, studies with yeast cytosolic CH2-THF dehydrogenase show that the NADP-dependent reaction is reversible in vivo, whereas the NAD-dependent reaction runs only in the oxidative direction (29West M.G. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This indirect evidence suggests that the yeast cytosolic NADP pool is far more reduced than the NAD pool. An AdoMet-insensitive MTHFR that is driven by the aggregate cytosolic NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratio might therefore be expected to direct more C1 units to CH3-THF, and thence to AdoMet, than one driven solely by the NADH/NAD ratio. The finding that expressing an NADH-dependent, AdoMet-insensitive plant MTHFR in yeast causes methionine and AdoMet overaccumulation raises the question of what prevents this from occurring in plants. Plants have the S-methylmethionine cycle, an auxiliary feature exclusive to plant C1metabolism (30Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Ranocha P. McNeil S.D. Ziemak M.J. Li C. Tarczynski M.C. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 2001; 25: 575-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this apparently futile cycle, AdoMet donates a methyl group to methionine, giving S-methylmethionine.S-Methylmethionine then donates a methyl group to homocysteine, yielding two molecules of methionine. The net effect of the cycle is thus to convert AdoMet back to methionine. In vivo radiolabeling data and metabolic modeling have recently indicated that the S-methylmethionine cycle serves to stop accumulation of unutilized AdoMet and that it may be the main mechanism whereby plants achieve short-term control of AdoMet levels (31Ranocha P. McNeil S.D. Ziemak M.J. Li C. Tarczynski M.C. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 2001; 25: 575-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because S. cerevisiae does not have this cycle, AdoMet might be expected to accumulate in yeast expressing the plant enzyme, as in fact occurs. The 140-fold hyperaccumulation of AdoMet has no apparent ill-effect on yeast growth, at least under our culture conditions. A likely reason is that most of the excess AdoMet is sequestered in the vacuole and hence excluded from the metabolically active pool, as occurs when AdoMet is overproduced in yeast cultured with a high level of methionine in the medium (32Schlenk F. Shapiro S.K Schlenk F. Transmethylation and Methionine Biosynthesis. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London1965: 48-65Google Scholar). It should be noted that although AdoMet hyperaccumulation was a robust phenomenon in strain SCY4 grown as we describe in medium containing formate and glycine, it did not occur when these supplements were replaced by serine. The basis for this effect is now being investigated. In wild-type yeast, the dominant methylated products are phosphatidylcholine head groups in membranes (∼12 μmol methyl units g−1 wet weight) and protein-bound methionine (∼14 μmol g−1 wet weight, assuming 100 mg protein g−1wet weight and a methionine content of 2 mol %) (33Murakami Y. Yokoigawa K. Kawai F. Kawai H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1874-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Proteome Analysis at EBI, 2001, www.ebi.ac.uk/proteome). The total level of methyl end products is therefore at least 26 μmol g−1wet weight. In relation to this, the AdoMet pool in the wild-type strain DAY4 (31 nmol g−1 wet weight) is very small (<0.2%). However, in the AdoMet-hyperaccumulating strain, the AdoMet pool expands to ∼4 μmol g−1 wet weight, which adds ∼15% to the methyl budget. To investigate the source of the extra methyl groups, we compared the 13C-enrichment of the AdoMet methyl group in these two strains supplied with [13C]formate and unlabeled glycine. In the wild-type, DAY4, formate was the principal source of the AdoMet methyl group, consistent with the previous data on the origin of choline methyl groups in this strain (29West M.G. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, even though the production of methyl groups in the AdoMet-hyperaccumulating strain changed by only ∼15%, the formate contribution to the AdoMet methyl group dropped dramatically from >90% to 54%, with the remainder presumably coming from glycine cleavage in the mitochondria. If we make the reasonable assumption that AdoMet methyl-13C enrichment faithfully reflects that of methionine, this finding shows that AdoMet hyperaccumulation is associated with a profound change in the relative importance of cytosolic and mitochondrial C1 fluxes. Consistent with the above inference, and equally surprising, strain SCY4 expressing Chimera-1 showed a doubling of total cellular folate content compared with the wild-type. This folate pool expansion could be a response to the shift in C1 fluxes occasioned by unregulated AdoMet synthesis. Whatever the mechanism, the data imply that cross-talk between C1 metabolism and folate synthesis or degradation is an important factor in control of intracellular folate levels."

Many type IIs enzymes, including BspMI, cleave substrates with two sites more rapidly than those with one site. They usually act sequentially on DNA with two sites, but BspMI converted such a substrate directly to the final products cut at both sites. The BspMI endonuclease was found to be a tetramer, in contrast to the monomeric structures for many type IIs enzymes. No change in subunit association occurred during the BspMI reaction. Plasmids with two BspMI sites were cleavedin cis, in reactions spanning sites in the same DNA, even when the sites were separated by just 38 bp. Plasmids with oneBspMI site were cleaved in trans, with the enzyme bridging sites in separate DNA molecules: these slow reactions could be accelerated by adding a second DNA with the recognition sequence. Thus, whereas many type IIs enzymes dimerize before cleaving DNA, a process facilitated by two recognition sites in cis, the BspMI tetramer binds two copies of its recognition sequence before cleaving the DNA in both strands at both sites.

Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). Their recognition sites are often palindromic sequences that are contacted symmetrically by a dimeric protein, with the result that both strands are cleaved at equivalent positions (2Halford S.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the endonucleases from the type IIs systems (3Szybalski W. Kim S.C. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) recognize asymmetric sequences and cleave the DNA in both strands several bp downstream of the site, but not at equivalent positions (4Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An asymmetric sequence cannot be recognized symmetrically by a homodimeric protein, and the type IIs endonucleases are generally monomers with separate domains for DNA recognition and catalysis, at least in the case of the best-known type IIs enzyme,FokI (5Li L. Wu L.P. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Wah D.A. Hirsh J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of FokI has the functions for cleaving one DNA strand; to cut both strands at one site, two monomers associate to form a dimer (7Wah D.A. Bitinaite J. Schildkraut I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), FokI and several other type IIs enzymes were found to cleave DNA substrates with two recognition sites more rapidly than those with one site, in a manner indicative of DNA looping (2Halford S.E.

The formation of an active dimer at one DNA site thus seems to be facilitated by a second site in cis, in the same molecule of DNA, presumably because of the effect that such a site must have on the equilibrium constant for the monomer-dimer association (12Hochschild A. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 107-138Google Scholar). The reaction profiles of these type IIs enzymes on two-site substrates are similar to those of the type IIe endonucleases, such as EcoRII and NaeI, that are activated to cleave one recognition site by a second copy of the same sequence (13Embleton M.L. Siksnys V. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the preceding study (10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) also identified one type IIs endonuclease, BspMI, that acts in a radically different manner from FokI. As with many other type IIs systems (14Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2539-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the BspMI restriction-modification system consists of three proteins: a single endonuclease of 492 amino acids, and two methyltransferases that each modify one strand of the asymmetric recognition site. 1R. Morgan and H. Kong, personal communication.1R. Morgan and H. Kong, personal communication. Its recognition sequence is ACCTGC, and the restriction enzyme cuts both strands of the DNA downstream of this site, between the fourth and fifth bases in the strand shown and between the eight and ninth bases in the complementary strand (4Roberts R.J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It had been noted previously that the BspMI endonuclease is recalcitrant to cleave its single recognition site in pBR322 but is activated to cleave this site by DNA molecules with multiple BspMI sites (15Oller A.R. Vanden Broek W. Conrad M. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When tested on plasmids with one or two BspMI sites, it cleaved the two-site substrate more rapidly than that with one site (10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, during its reaction on the two-site plasmid, only a small fraction of the DNA was liberated from the enzyme after cutting just one site. Instead, BspMI cleaved almost all of the two-site substrate directly to the final products cut at four phosphodiester bonds, two at each site.BspMI thus seems to act like the tetrameric type IIf endonucleases, such as SfiI, Cfr10I, andNgoMIV, that interact concurrently with two DNA sites and cut both strands at both sites before dissociating from the DNA (13Embleton M.L.

The column was developed with a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl in Buffer P, and the fractions were assayed for BspMI activity and by SDS-PAGE. The BspMI endonuclease eluted at ∼230 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were mixed with a slurry of hydroxylapatite (BioGel HTP; Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in Buffer P with 230 mm NaCl. After gentle agitation for 1 h, the hydroxylapatite resin was allowed to settle, and the supernatant was recovered by low-speed centrifugation. The supernatant contained the majority of the BspMI that had been added to the slurry, whereas most of the impurities were removed, presumably by adsorption onto the hydroxylapatite. This left preparations in which ≥95% of the protein was BspMI endonuclease, as judged by SDS-PAGE. The preparations were stored at −20 °C. BspMI concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 76,810 m−1cm−1 (per subunit) calculated from its amino acid composition, and are cited in terms of the tetrameric form of the protein. All other enzymes used for manipulating DNA were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as recommended by the supplier. Samples (110 μl) of BspMI were examined by centrifugation to equilibrium at 20 °C in 3-mm columns in a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation for the requisite times, typically 16 h and 20 h at 8000 rpm followed by the same time intervals at 11,000 rpm, the radial distribution of the protein was measured by absorption at 230 nm (for samples of ≤0.2 mg/ml) or 280 nm (for samples of >0.1 mg/ml). The distributions recorded 4 h apart duplicated each other, thus confirming that the sedimentation was at equilibrium. Another absorption record was taken after extending the centrifugation for 6 h at 40,000 rpm. The absorption at the meniscus in the latter record was used as a fixed offset in the subsequent analysis with the ORIGIN software from Beckman (21McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar).

Partial specific volumes and buffer densities were calculated with SEDNTERP (Ref. 22Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Further derivatives of pNAG1 with insertions or deletions of nonspecific sequences between the two BspMI recognition sites were generated by standard procedures (19Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar): each derivative retained from pNAG1 the head-to-tail orientation of the two sites. The plasmids were 3H-labeled and purified as recorded previously (11Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The preparations contained largely the supercoiled form of the monomeric plasmid, with typically 10% dimeric plasmid and/or nicked open-circle DNA. Complementary pairs of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech Ltd. (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom) and annealed to form duplexes by heating to 95 °C before slow cooling overnight. The reactions were generally carried out in 200-μl volumes at 37 °C. An aliquot (typically 20 μl) of theBspMI endonuclease, diluted to the requisite concentration in the appropriate dilution buffer (10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was added to the3H-labeled plasmid (usually 5 or 10 nm) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2 and the concentration of NaCl as specified for each experiment (usually 40 or 80 mm). At various times after adding the enzyme, 15-μl samples were removed from the reaction, mixed immediately with 10 μl of stop-mix, and analyzed as described previously (10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the gene for the BspMI endonuclease predicts a molecular weight (Mr) of 55,435 for the monomer.1 Several type IIs endonucleases have been shown by gel filtration to exist in solution as monomers (3Szybalski W. Kim S.C. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but the elution volume of protein from size-exclusion columns depends not only on the mass of the protein but also on its shape (23Cole J.L. Hansen J.C. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, to determine the oligomerization state of BspMI in solution, theMr of the enzyme was evaluated by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 1), a procedure that is unaffected by the shape of the protein (23Cole J.L. Hansen J.C. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). In the low-ionic-strength buffers used for the DNA cleavage reactions described below, theBspMI protein was insufficiently soluble to permit its sedimentation to be monitored by uv absorption: even at the minimal concentrations needed in the analytical ultracentrifuge, some of the protein precipitated from solution. However, the enzyme remained in solution in the buffer from the final stage of the enzyme preparation, and this buffer, of relatively high ionic strength, was used for the sedimentation studies. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out with a range of concentrations of BspMI (0.02–0.5 mg/ml) and at various rotor speeds (8000–12,000 rpm). In each individual experiment at a particular protein concentration and rotor speed, the radial distribution of the protein at sedimentation equilibrium matched that expected for a single monodisperse species: the fits to this model (Eq.1) yielded random variations in the residuals between the experimental data and the theoretical curves (Fig. 1, top panel). TheMr values from the individual experiments all fell within the range of 196,000–225,000. No systematic variation in the Mr values was observed at different protein concentrations, nor was any significant improvement obtained by fitting the data to a model for a self-associating system. When the data at each protein concentration were simultaneously fitted to Eq. 1, the global fit yielded a Mr of 215,000 (Fig. 1). This value lies close to that expected for four subunits of theBspMI protein, 221,740. Thus, in contrast to the monomeric structures of other type IIs enzymes, BspMI is a tetramer. The reactions of BspMI on one-site and two-site substrates were analyzed by steady-state kinetics (Fig. 2). The substrates were the plasmids pAT153, which has a single site for BspMI, and pNAG1, a derivative of pAT153 with a second site for BspMI in directly repeated orientation 700-bp distant from the original site (10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The second site in pNAG1 ought to be equivalent to the site in pAT153 because it is flanked by the same sequences for 15 bp downstream of the recognition sequence, so as to encompass the sites of cleavage 4 and 8 bp away from the recognition site, and also for 9 bp upstream of the sequence. The progress of the reactions was monitored by using3H-labeled DNA: samples withdrawn from the reactions at various times were analyzed by electrophoresis through agarose to separate the supercoiled substrate and the cleaved products, and the concentrations of each form of the DNA were measured by scintillation counting (11Bilcock D.T. Daniels L.E. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36379-36386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reaction velocities were determined from the initial linear decline in the concentration of supercoiled substrate with time rather than from the appearance of the reaction products because the latter include both the DNA cut at one site and the DNA cut at two sites. In one set of experiments, the concentrations of the substrates were varied from 2.5 to 20 nm while the enzyme concentration was held constant at a level below the lowest substrate concentration (Fig.2a). The objective of these experiments was to determine theVmax and the K½ values of the one-site and two-site substrates for BspMI (whereK½ denotes the substrate concentration that yields half the Vmax value, regardless of whether the reaction velocities vary with substrate concentrations in hyperbolic or sigmoidal fashions). The reaction velocities on pNAG1 were invariant across this range of substrate concentrations (Fig. 2a). TheK½ for the two-site substrate must therefore be < 2.5 nm, the lowest concentration that could be tested, and the uniform reaction velocity observed across this range of concentrations corresponds to the Vmax value, ∼0.5 nm DNA consumed/nm enzyme tetramer/min. In contrast, the reaction velocities on pAT153 increased more or less linearly with increasing concentrations of this substrate (Fig.2a). The K½ for the one-site substrate must therefore be > 20 nm, the highest concentration tested, and the reaction velocity observed at 20 nm pAT153, 0.1 nm DNA consumed/nm enzyme tetramer/min, must be well below its Vmaxvalue. (If BspMI cleaves a one-site DNA only after interacting with two molecules of the DNA, as indicated below, its reaction velocities on the one-site DNA should show a sigmoidal dependence on the substrate concentration (24Embleton M.L. Williams S.A. Watson M.A. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the characteristic S shape of a sigmoidal plot becomes apparent only at substrate concentrations approaching the K½value.) With another type IIs enzyme, FokI, the steady-state velocities on DNA substrates with either one or two FokI sites increase disproportionately with the enzyme concentration; a 2-fold increase in the FokI concentration causes a >2-fold increase in reaction rate (8Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Bath A.J. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4024-4033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To examine whether this is a general property of the type IIs enzymes, an additional set of steady-state experiments was conducted with varied concentrations ofBspMI and fixed concentrations of either the one-site or the two-site substrate (Fig. 2b). With both the one- and two-site plasmids, the reaction velocities increased in direct proportion to the increases in the concentrations of BspMI. Thus, in contrast to FokI (8Bitinaite J. Wah D.A. Aggarwal A.K. Schildkraut I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10570-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 9Vanamee E.S. Santagata S. Aggarwal A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that the reaction mechanism of BspMI on either one- or two-site substrates involves an association of protein subunits during the catalytic cycle. Many enzymes exhibit a pre-steady-state “burst” phase of product formation, with an amplitude proportional to the enzyme concentration, due to the rapid formation of an enzyme-product complex followed by the slow dissociation of the product from the enzyme (25Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1995: 138-196Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the turnover of many restriction enzymes is product dissociation (26Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. Chirikjian J.G. Gene Amplification and Analysis. 5. Elsevier, New York1987: 103-118Google Scholar, 27Erskine S.G. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7567-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Sasnauskas G. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, if product dissociation is rate-limiting for BspMI, the higher BspMI concentrations used for the reactions in Fig. 2b should have given a burst phase: for example, at 4 nmBspMI and 10 nm DNA, 40% of the DNA could have been consumed in a rapid exponential phase and 60% of the DNA could have been consumed in the zero-order steady-state phase. However, a burst phase of product formation was not detected in any of the reactions described above (Fig. 2). Instead, the amount of product formed during these reactions increased with time as a linear zero-order process from the start of the reaction, which could be extrapolated back to zero product at zero time (data not shown). The individual DNA cleavage steps during the catalytic cycle of a restriction enzyme can be monitored in single-turnover reactions, with the enzyme in excess of the DNA. For example, single turnovers of theSfiI endonuclease on a plasmid with two SfiI sites revealed a sequential series of transient intermediates due to the cleavage of the enzyme-bound DNA in 1 → 4 phosphodiester bonds, all at the same intrinsic rate, before the release of the DNA cut in both strands at both sites (28Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Single-turnover reactions ofBspMI were conducted with a 2-fold molar excess of enzyme over pNAG1: higher enzyme concentrations resulted in diminished rates (data not show), presumably due to the binding of BspMI molecules to each site rather than the binding of one molecule to both sites (30Szczelkun M.D. Halford S.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1460-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Milsom S.E. Halford S.E. Embleton M.L. Szczelkun M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas single turnovers of most restriction enzymes can be monitored only with rapid reaction instrumentation (26Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. Chirikjian J.G. Gene Amplification and Analysis. 5. Elsevier, New York1987: 103-118Google Scholar, 27Erskine S.G. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E.

Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Sasnauskas G. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), those with BspMI were sufficiently slow to monitor by hand-mixing the reagents (Fig. 3). The reactions were initiated by either adding the enzyme to a solution containing pNAG1 and MgCl2 (Fig. 3) or adding MgCl2 to a mixture of the enzyme and pNAG1. No significant difference was observed between the two procedures (data not shown). During these reactions, all of the supercoiled DNA was utilized in a single-exponential process (Fig. 3), with a first-order rate constant of 0.47 min−1. This rate constant is similar to the steady-state turnover rate of ∼0.5 nm DNA consumed/nm enzyme tetramer/min for BspMI on pNAG1 under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 2). Hence, both the rate of substrate utilization in the single-turnover reactions and the absence of a pre-steady-state burst phase indicate that the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of BspMI occurs at or before the cleavage of the first phosphodiester bond in the substrate. Furthermore, the rate-limiting step is unlikely to be the initial binding of the enzyme to the DNA: if this had been the case, the single turnovers initiated by adding MgCl2 to the enzyme-DNA mixture would have given faster rates of substrate utilization than those initiated by adding the enzyme. During the single turnover, the concentration of the open-circle DNA present in the plasmid preparation declined in parallel with the supercoiled DNA. Thus, virtually none of the intermediate containing the DNA cleaved in one phosphodiester bond accumulated during the course of the reaction. The rate constant for forming this intermediate must therefore be smaller than that for its progression to the intermediate with the DNA cut in two bonds. Some accumulation of the intermediate carrying the DNA cleaved in both strands at one recognition site was observed, but, after a short lag phase, the majority of the DNA in this intermediate was cleaved at the second site to give the final products. (A fraction of the DNA in the intermediate with the DNA cut at one site failed to progress to that cut at both sites. This is probably due to the dissociation of this DNA from the enzyme before the next cleavage step (28Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), so as to liberate the DNA cut at one site; the latter cannot readily be re-utilized as a substrate for BspMI (Fig. 2).) The kinetics of DNA cleavage by BspMI on a substrate with two BspMI sites are consistent with a scheme in which the enzyme binds to both sites and then proceeds to cleave the four scissile phosphodiester bonds in the substrate in sequential steps, but the rates of the successive reactions are limited by a step at or before the cleavage of the first phosphodiester bond. To examine the ability of the BspMI endonuclease to interact with two sites in cis, a series of derivatives of pNAG1 were generated by either deleting DNA from the 700-bp segment separating its twoBspMI sites or inserting additional DNA into this region. The new plasmids differed from each other only in the length of the DNA in one of the two arcs between the BspMI sites (the lengths cited below are for the shorter arc). Steady-state reactions were carried out with each derivative: the rates at which BspMI cleaved each plasmid, and also that with a single BspMI site, were measured from the decline in the concentration of the supercoiled substrate with time (Fig. 4). No change in reaction rate was observed as the inter-site spacing was increased from 700 bp (the separation in pNAG1) to either 1605 bp (Fig.4) or 2644 bp (data not shown). On the other hand, the plasmids with the short inter-site spacings (94 or 38 bp) were cleaved more slowly than that with the 700-bp spacing, particularly in the case of the 38-bp separation (Fig. 4) This behavior is largely as expected for a looping interaction across two sites in the same molecule of DNA. The probability for the juxtaposition of two sites in a supercoiled circle of DNA varies little as the length of DNA between the sites is increased from one-fifth to one-half of its overall length (31Milsom S.E.

In addition, MAGUKs recruit molecules into localized multimolecular complexes and cluster these complexes at the plasma membrane, such as cell junctions or the apicolateral or basolateral surface, and pre- or post-synaptic sites (1Anderson J.M.

All MAGUK proteins share a similar multidomain structural organization that includes (from the N to C termini) one or three copies of PDZ (PSD-95/SAP-90-Dlg-Zo1) domains, followed by one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, then followed by a guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain (3Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain functions as a protein-protein interaction module and is typically involved in the assembly of supramolecular complexes that perform localized signaling functions at particular subcellular locations (7Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Although their specific functions in MAGUKs are not very clear, SH3 domains are found in many other proteins and are recognized as modular protein-protein interaction domains with an affinity for certain proline-rich motifs (8Guruprasad L. Dhanaraj V. Timm D. Blundell T.L. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 856-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The GK domain in MAGUKs shares high sequence similarity with yeast guanylate kinase (yGMPK), a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that converts GMP to GDP using ATP as a phosphate donor. However, no enzymatic activity is present in MAGUK GK domains. Moreover, several protein binding partners of GK domains were found by yeast two-hybrid screens or pull-down assays (see Table III below), and this suggested that the GK domain functions as a protein-binding module. Although the GK domain cannot catalyze phosphoryl transfer, it can bind nucleotides. Binding studies have shown that the GK domain of SAP-90 binds GMP in the micromolar range and ATP in the millimolar range (9Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although a GK domain is present in all MAGUKs, there is remarkable divergence in nucleotide-binding sites among the four MAGUK subfamilies (see Fig. 1below): Lin2/CASK- and p55-like MAGUKs have nearly intact GMP- and ATP-binding sites; Dlg/SAP-90- and SAP-97-like MAGUKs have conserved GMP-binding sites but lack some residues in their ATP-binding site; the ZO1-like MAGUKs lack some residues in both sites (3Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The role of nucleotide binding to the GK domain is unclear in the absence of any enzymatic activity. Based on known nucleotide-dependent conformational changes that were observed in several nucleoside monophosphate kinases, we hypothesized that nucleotides could play a regulatory role in GK function by inducing different conformations between the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound formsTable IIIBinding partners of GK domain of different MAGUKsBinding partnerMAGUKReferencesRabphilin3aHCASK(42Zhang Y.

Here we report the 1.3-Å crystal structure of the GK domain of human CASK (hCASK-GK). Comparison of this structure, which is the first MAGUK GK domain elucidated to our knowledge, with the structures of yGMPK with and without GMP reveals important differences in the conformation of the GMP-binding region and the LID region. The structure reveals the reasons hCASK-GK is not able to catalyze phosphoryl transfer. Modeling of GMP into hCASK-GK strongly supports the binding of GMP to hCASK-GK. The hCASK-GK crystal structure and the hCASK-GK-GMP model here reveal how an enzyme has been converted into a protein-binding module and suggest how binding to GMP could regulate the conformational state of this module within multidomain proteins. A cDNA encoding the GK domain from human CASK protein (hCASK-GK; Arg-734 to Cys-909) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from a pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen Corp.), containing a full-length cDNA of hCASK (10Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and cloned into a modified pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)E. coli expression vector, which allowed insertion ofNdeI/BamHI-restricted fragments into its multiple cloning site (11Brundiers R.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid that contains the gene encoding the hCASK-GK-GST fusion protein were induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 25 °C in 2YT media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with lysozyme, and the supernatant after ultracentrifugation was applied to a glutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After washing, the fusion protein was cleaved on the column with thrombin for about 24 h. The flow-through was collected and further purified to homogeneity by using an ion exchange column (WP-QUAT) and gel filtration (Superdex-75). The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 25 mg/ml. Because of the construction of a thrombin cleavage site at the N-terminal of hCASK-GK, the resultant protein after cleavage has four additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-His-Met-) at the N terminus. For seleno-methionine-containing protein, the plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotrophE. coli strain B834(DE3), and the cells were grown and induced as described previously (12Doubie, S. (1997) 276, 523–557Google Scholar). Purification was conducted as with the non-labeled protein. Incorporation of seleno-methionine at all four positions was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop method at 20 °C. One microliter of 4 m sodium formate (the reservoir solution) was mixed with an equal volume of 15 mg/ml of the protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Initial crystals were found after 2 weeks. Further crystals were obtained with microseeding. Trigonal crystals appeared overnight and grew to a maximum size of 350 × 350 × 400 μm3 in 1 week. The Matthews coefficient of 2.73 (55% solvent content) suggested a monomer as the asymmetric unit (13Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). Seleno-methionine crystals were grown from seleno-methionine containing hCASK-GK protein using the microseeding technique. Initial native diffraction data to 1.6-Å resolution were collected on a RAXIS IIc image plate detector using copper radiation from a RAXIS RU-200 rotation anode x-ray generator at 100 K. The cryoprotectant was mineral oil. Molecular replacement with the yGMPK model failed, a fact explained by our structure of the CASK-GK domain that reveals large differences and movement of the GMP-binding region and LID region. MIR was tried but also failed due to lack of isomorphism. Therefore, a MAD dataset was collected from a crystal grown from seleno-methionine-labeled protein at three different wavelengths (inflection, maximum, and high energy) at the BIOCars beamline BM-D in the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory using a Quantum-4 charge-coupled device detector at 100 K. This seleno-methionine crystal was grown with continuous microseeding, and it diffracted to 1.7 Å. In addition, a native dataset at 1.31 Å was also collected. The data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of hCASK-GK was solved using the MAD dataset collected from a seleno-methionine crystal. At this stage the space group ambiguity between p3121 and p3221 was solved, the latter being the correct space group. All of the four selenium sites in one hCASK-GK monomer were located by the program SOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The resulting phases were improved with DM (16Cowtan, K. (1994) 31, 34–38Google Scholar). Automatic model building was done with ARP (17Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Manuel model adjustment was carried out with the graphics package O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The structure was initially refined with CNS (19Brunger A. Rice L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) against the MAD data in the resolution range 12.0–1.7 Å. 10% data were used for Rfreecalculations. The model was then refined against the higher resolution native data set. Following rigid-body, minimization, annealing, andB-factor refinement, the model was checked with 2Fo − Fc andFo − Fc maps. After several iterations of refinement with CNS, anisotropic B-factor refinement was done with REFMAC5.0 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors were being deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDBID1KGD). We modeled GMP into the structure of hCASK-GK guided by the structure of yGMPK with GMP (GMPKGMP). Based on the high similarity of the CORE and GMP-binding regions between our hCASK-GK structure and the GMPKGMP structure, we could align the two structures once based on atoms only from the CORE region and once from atoms only from the GMP-binding region. We then made a chimera coordinate file from two hCASK-GK pdb files generated by these two operations, i.e. the CORE (and LID) regions from the pdb file after using the CORE regions for the superposition operation, and the GMP-binding region from the pdb file generated by using only atoms from the GMP-binding region for the superposition calculation. The location of the GMP molecule is exactly where it was in the GMPKGMP structure. Interactions between GMP and hCASK-GK side chains were optimized by rotating the side chains around their torsion angles. Human CASK-GK (Fig.1) crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P3221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure (Fig. 2) was solved using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method (MAD) (21Hendrickson W. Ogata C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 494-523Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Data collection and phasing statistics can be found in TableI. The experimental electron density map was of very high quality, and the program ARP was successful in automatically building most of the hCASK-GK model (Fig.3A). After manual rebuilding with the 1.7-Å MAD dataset, the resolution was extended by using the native 1.31-Å dataset. The final structure of hCASK-GK consists of 175 residues, 5 formate ions, and 218 water molecules. The N-terminal residues 730 and 731 (Gly-Ser) and residues 774–776 (Lys-Lys-Asp) did not have good electron density so were not modeled. The final crystallographic R-factor is 18.6% (Rfree = 21.2%) for all the reflections within the resolution range 12.0–1.31 Å.

The superposition matrices were calculated using only the Cα atoms of the CORE region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fold of hCASK-GK is similar to that of the yeast guanylate kinase (yGMPK) and, in a similar manner to the latter, can be divided into three dynamic regions (Fig. 2). The CORE region is built by five parallel β-strands and four α-helices. This region is flanked by the GMP-binding region (red) and the LID region (blue). The former is composed of a four-stranded β-sheet and a single α-helix, whereas the LID is seven residues shorter than in yGMPK and is composed of a long loop and one α-helix. The division of hCASK-GK into these three regions was guided by comparing our structure to known structures of yGMPK such that each region can move as a rigid body relative to the other regions. Therefore, our choice of regions is slightly different than those previously chosen for yGMPK, especially for the LID region (22Blaszczyk J. Li Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have chosen helix α-5 to be a part of the LID region and not the CORE region, because it adopts a quite different conformation and position in hCASK from that in yGMPK. Comparison of the hCASK-GK structure with the yeast guanylate kinase was performed against the ligand-free yGMPK (GMPKapo) and the GMP-bound yGMPK structures (GMPKGMP). For the structural alignment of the three structures, we only used atoms in the CORE region for the calculation of the transformation matrices. The result of these operations is shown in Fig. 3B. The CORE region of hCASK-GK shows high similarity to that of GMPKapo and GMPKGMP (Fig.4A). For the 91 Cα atoms used for alignment, the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) is 2.368 and 2.462 Å between hCASK-GK and GMPKapo and GMPKGMP, respectively. However, the deviations between the other regions are pronounced. These deviations are due to conformational changes by which the GMP-binding region and the LID region move as rigid bodies relative to the CORE region. Using atoms only from the CORE domain for the superposition calculation shows that the GMP-binding region of hCASK-GK is positioned between the conformation it adopts in the open GMPKapostructure and the closed conformation in the GMPKGMPstructure (Fig. 3B). However, if one performs the alignment using only the atoms from the GMP-binding region (Fig. 4B), the resulting structural overlay reveals that the basic structure of the GMP-binding region is nearly identical between all three structures (r.m.s.d. is 0.719 Å between hCASK-GK and GMPKapo and 0.802 Å between hCASK-GK and GMPKGMP for the 45 Cα atoms). This was previously demonstrated for the two yGMPK structures (22Blaszczyk J. Li Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and our result shows that the GK domain of hCASK maintains a nearly identical GMP-binding region to that of yGMPK, albeit it is in a different conformation relative to the CORE region from those previously observed for GMPKapo or GMPKGMP. Because in our structure of hCASK-GK the nucleotide GMP is absent, our result suggests an attractive mechanism in which the function of MAGUKs may be regulated. The above operation for the superposition of the GMP-binding regions can be repeated for the LID regions, but the result is very different. Not surprisingly, the LID of yeast guanylate kinase in the apo- and GMP-bound structures overlay with a very low r.m.s.d. However, the shorter LID region of hCASK adopts a very different conformation from that of the enzyme guanylate kinase (Fig. 4C). The LID region of GMPKapo and GMPKGMP is composed of two helices connected by a loop, whereas the LID region of hCASK-GK is composed of only a single helix and a long loop. The overlay done by using the CORE region to align the structures shows that the LID region of hCASK-GK cannot be superimposed on the LID regions of GMPKapo or GMPKGMP (Fig. 3B). Moreover, even if the calculation of the superposition matrix is performed using the most similar feature between the LID regions, the α-helix, no good superposition is obtained (Fig. 4C). Thus, unlike the difference in structure between the GMP-binding region of hCASK-GK and yGMPK, which can be explained by a rigid-body conformational change, the LID region of hCASK is structurally distinct from that of yGMPK. This fact serves to explain the apparent inability of hCASK-GK to catalyze phosphoryl transfer (see “Discussion”) and of the MAGUK SAP-97 even after reconstituting the P-loop region (23Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our structure of hCASK-GK does not contain the nucleotide GMP. In vitro binding studies of SAP-90 and SAP-97 have shown that GMP can bind to the GK domain (9Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Modeling of GMP binding to hCASK-GK was guided by the hypothesis that upon GMP binding the conformation of hCASK-GK would change to a more closed one, as was seen upon binding of GMP to yGMPK. Using the GMPKGMP structure as a guide, we were able to model the expected closed conformation of hCASK-GK (Fig. 5A). In our model of GMP-bound hCASK-GK, the main difference with the yGMPK GMP-bound structure is the position and fold of the LID region. Both the CORE region and the GMP-binding region overlay well. Except for residues Ser-34 and Arg-41, all other residues observed to interact with GMP in the GMPKGMP structure are found almost at the same position in the hCASK-GK-GMP model. The apparent lack of a residue that would correspond to Arg-41 of yGMPK can be explained by the fact that we could not observe traceable electron density for residues 774–776 of hCASK-GK. Lysine 774, which is not present in our model, would correspond to Arg-41 of yGMPK. Our inability to model the above loop is consistent with the expectation that this loop would become more ordered once GMP binds to hCASK-GK. Fig. 5B shows the superposition of the residues responsible for GMP binding in GMPKGMP and in our hCASK-GK-GMP model. The expected interactions between GMP and hCASK-GK are listed in TableII.Table IIInteractions between GMP and hCASK (modeled) and yGMPKNucleotide part of GMP making the interactionResidue in GMPKGMPCorresponding residue in the hCASK-GK-GMP modelGuanine ringGlu69Glu802Tyr782-aThese residues made a stacking interaction (3.9 Å) with the adenine ring.Tyr8112-aThese residues made a stacking interaction (3.9 Å) with the adenine ring.Ser80Thr813Ile992-aThese residues made a stacking interaction (3.9 Å) with the adenine ring.Val8322-aThese residues made a stacking interaction (3.9 Å) with the adenine ring.Asp100Glu833Ser34None (a proline instead)PhosphateTyr50Tyr783Tyr78Tyr811Arg38Arg771Arg41No electron density for Lys774Indirect interactionsGlu44 with Arg38Glu777 with Arg771Interactions are between GMP and side-chain atoms and were considered to take place if atoms were between 3.5 and 2.4 A˙ apart.2-a These residues made a stacking interaction (3.9 Å) with the adenine ring.

An impressive amount of information on the structural and functional networks that underlie neuronal activity has recently accumulated through proteomic approaches to the analysis of the molecular basis of synaptic signaling pathways (24Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar,25Husi H. Grant S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 259-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins identified in signaling complexes, neuromuscular junctions, and cell-cell contact sites contain characteristic regions such as SH3 and PDZ domains. These domains mediate specific protein-protein interactions and form scaffolds for protein networks at specialized regions of the cell membranes. The MAGUK family constitutes a major group of conserved cytoskeletal proteins that consist of arrayed modular domains: one to three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and, as a signature motif, a C-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain. Whereas SH3 domains have a well-known role as protein interaction modules in other systems (26Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), and PDZ domains were recognized as adapters for clustering of transmembrane or membrane-associated proteins at high local concentrations (7Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 27Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), the role of the GK domain has until recently been mysterious, given the fact that it has no enzymatic activity. Several protein binding partners of GK domains were found by yeast two-hybrid screens or pull-down assays (TableIII), and this suggested that the GK domain functions as a protein binding module. Remarkably, several MAGUKs and interacting proteins have additional, recently discovered biological functions: GAKIN is a member of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins, and its interaction with the GK domain seems to play a vital role in the intracellular trafficking of hDlg (28Hanada T. Lin L. Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28774-28784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). CASK, a member of the Lin2-like MAGUKs, has a transcription regulation function through interaction of its GK domain with Tbr-1, a T-box transcription factor that is involved in forebrain development (29Hsueh Y.P. Wang T.F. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The GK domain is also involved in inter- and intramolecular interaction with MAGUK's SH3 domain, and this intramolecular interaction regulates SAP-97 binding to GKAP and PSD-95/SAP-90 clustering of ion channels (30McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Nix S.L. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Walther Z. J. Biol.

In addition, it is known that the Drosophila Dlg protein, the prototype member of the MAGUK family, is required in the maintenance of septate junctions and epithelial structure; mutations in the SH3 and GK domains of the protein are oncogenic in larval development, and deletions in the GK domain cause loss of normal growth without affecting epithelial structure (34Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 35Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1108-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, the GK domains of murine Dlg/SAP-97 and of CASK are essential to craniofacial and palatal morphogenesis in mice (37Caruana G. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because these interactions and functions were shown to be restricted to the GK domains of the respective MAGUK subfamilies, it can be assumed that their specificity is determined by subtle differences in GK domain structures. The high resolution structure of the CASK GK domain we present in this study will allow to gain insights into the molecular basis of the distinct mechanisms for the interactions between the GK domains and their binding partners. Despite having only 27% sequence identity with yGMPK, the structure of hCASK-GK shows that the CORE and GMP-binding regions are markedly similar. The most apparent difference between the two proteins is the LID region, a region that in the enzyme yGMPK contains essential residues for catalysis. Similarly, the essential role of particular arginine residues from the LID region was highlighted in our previous work on thymidylate kinase (11Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Ostermann N. Goody R.S. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35289-35292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Lavie A. Ostermann N. Brundiers R. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Konrad M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14045-14050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LID region yGMPK arginines play a role in ATP binding (Arg-131) and in stabilizing the phosphate groups of ATP in the catalytic transition state (Arg-135 and Arg-146). None of the MAGUKs retain all of these three arginines (Fig. 1). The LID region of hCASK-GK has only a single arginine (Arg-869), which the structure-based sequence alignment suggests could correspond to the catalytic Arg-146 of yGMPK. However, the structure of hCASK-GK reveals that this arginine extends toward a totally different direction from that of Arg-146 observed in the structures of yGMPK. This is unlikely due to the lack of nucleotide in our hCASK-GK structure because this residue adopts a similar orientation in both the apo- and GMP-bound yGMPK structures. This shows that the LID region of hCASK-GK is deficient in residues essential for catalyzing phosphoryl transfer. Importantly, our structures show no other residues from other parts of the molecule that could compensate for the lack of these arginine residues. Therefore, our structural analyses yield an explanation for the lack of guanylate kinase activity of the GK domain of MAGUKs. Although it is now understood why the GK domain cannot catalyze phosphoryl transfer, the question remains: Can it bind ATP or GMP? Our equilibrium binding assays show that hCASK-GK binds GMP with a dissociation constant of 0.3 μm but binds ATP with a dissociation constant greater than 10 mm. 2O. Spangenberg, I. Paarmann, and M. Konrad, unpublished results. These results are consistent with our structure analyses that explain the low affinity for ATP. Although hCASK-GK has a nearly complete conserved P-loop motif, several facts suggest that the P-loop is not competent to bind ATP. First, the strictly conserved lysine of the P-loop motif is absent. In hCASK, this residue is an arginine. Alignment of all known guanylate kinase sequences reveals strict conservation of the P-loop lysine. Second, the serine/threonine that follows the lysine in the P-loop motif is replaced by an arginine residue in hCASK. The role of a serine or threonine residue of the P-loop sequence is to participate in ATP binding by donating its hydroxyl side chain as a ligand to the magnesium ion that invariably accompanies ATP. The replacement of such a residue with an arginine in hCASK precludes the ability of coordinating the magnesium ion. But perhaps more importantly, modeling of ATP in the hCASK-GK model (data not shown) reveals that the presence of the larger arginine side chain is not compatible with ATP binding. Third, hCASK-GK does not possess the arginine that would correspond to Arg-131 of yGMPK in the LID region. The function of this residue in yGMPK (and many other ATP-binding proteins) is to bind and position ATP by stacking against the adenine ring. Lastly, main-chain residues 891 and 892 from the CORE region of hCASK-GK, which correspond to residues 169 and 170 in yGMPK and participate in ATP binding, are not at the appropriate position to contribute to ATP binding. Although a conformational change of these residues to a more productive position for ATP interactions cannot be ruled out, this is unlikely because these residues are in the CORE region, which is rather rigid as exemplified by our comparison to yGMPK (see “Results”). Collectively, the above analysis presents a strong case against the ability of the P-loop like sequence of hCASK to act as a true P-loop and bind ATP. Thus, the low affinity binding of ATP to hCASK-GK can only be explained by ATP binding to the GMP-binding site. Because hCASK-GK has an almost conserved GMP-binding site and it does bind GMP in equilibrium binding assays, we modeled GMP into the structure of hCASK-GK after a movement of the GMP-binding region based on the structure alignment between hCASK-GK and GMPKGMP. After minor adjustment of side chains of some residues, most of the interactions observed between GMP and yGMPK in the GMPKGMPstructure could be duplicated (Table II). The replacement of Ser-34 of yGMPK by a proline residue in hCASK-GK does not preclude GMP binding. Consistent with the absence of GMP bound to hCASK in our structure is the apparent disorder of residues 774–776, which are predicted to participate in GMP binding. Such binding usually leads to stabilization of relevant residues. Thus, our structure supports the results ofin vitro binding studies. Extensive attempts at obtaining crystals that contain the complex between hCASK-GK and GMP failed. This observation is consistent with a GMP-induced conformational change in the GK domain that resulted in a species that unfortunately was not amenable for crystallization. In conclusion, the structure of hCASK-GK reveals the similarities and differences between what has evolved to become a protein-binding module and its enzymatic predecessor. The lack of enzymatic activity, the weak ATP binding, and the high affinity to GMP is rationalized. The binding of GMP to hCASK-GK can be of high functional relevance by inducing conformational changes that serve to regulate MAGUKs, i.e.to influence the intermolecular interaction between GKAP and SAP-97 GK domain, between Tbr-1 and the CASK GK domain, or to influence the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 domain and the GK domain of SAP-97 and PSD95/SAP-90. If binding of GMP serves to regulate this inter- or intramolecular interaction, a possible mechanism would exist to regulate association of MAGUKs with various binding partners. This first structure of a MAGUK GK domain provides us with an example of a protein that has lost its enzymatic activity but maintained its ability to adjust its conformation upon ligand binding. The structural features shown by hCASK-GK may be common among other MAGUKs and are probably required for their function and regulation. We thank J.

Unfortunately, acivicin also causes many undesirable gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. The neurotoxic effects at low concentrations of acivicin include lethargy, depression, insomnia, headaches, confusion, mood swings, vivid dreams, and “large thoughts” (6Weiss G.R. McGovren J.P.

All of the glutamine amidotransferases possess an essential cysteine residue that initiates an attack on the amide carbonyl of glutamine to form a covalent γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate. Acivicin contains a 4,5-dihydroisoxazole ring substituted with a chloride that is readily displaced (21Vyas D.M. Chiang Y. Doyle T.W.

The ammonia-dependent activities are unaffected by the covalent modification with acivicin, and the rate of inactivation is facilitated by the presence of co-substrates. For example, the addition of ATP and xanthosine monophosphate greatly accelerates the rate of inactivation of GMP synthetase by acivicin (25Nakamura J. Straub K. Wu J. Lou L. J. Biol.

CPS of Escherichia coli is a heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, glutamine, and two molecules of ATP. The synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate is accomplished via four separate reactions occurring at three physically distinct active sites connected by a tunnel that is ∼100 Å in length and through which intermediates are translocated (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 30Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1, the tunnel begins at the glutamine-binding site within the small subunit and runs through the interior of the large subunit where it connects with the two binding sites for ATP. Cys-269 of the small subunit has been shown to function as the nucleophile that attacks the amide carbonyl of glutamine to form the γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate. The ammonia is subsequently channeled to the large subunit (31Pinkus L.M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Anderson P.M. Carlson J.D.

The binding site for glutamine is largely hydrophilic with numerous electrostatic interactions between the bound substrate and the protein matrix. Acivicin is an extraordinarily potent inactivator of glutamine amidotransferases. To further understand the high affinity and selectivity of acivicin for the active sites of these enzymes, the molecular interactions between the enzyme and inhibitor must be delineated in greater detail. A theoretical model for the binding of acivicin to the amidotransferase domain of GMP synthetase has been published (24Chittur S.V. Klem T.J. Shafer C.M. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this paper, a detailed kinetic analysis of acivicin inactivation of CPS and the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the covalently modified enzyme are presented. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase was isolated fromE. coli as described previously (34Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Acivicin was purchased from Sigma, and all other reagents and coupling enzymes were obtained from commercial sources. A continuous spectrophotometric assay was used to monitor the production of glutamate following the enzymatic hydrolysis of glutamine. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (6–14 nmol) was added to an assay solution composed of 0.1 mHepes (pH 7.6, 25 °C), 100 mm KCl, 10 units of glutamate dehydrogenase, and 1.0 mm 3-acetylpyrimidine adenine nucleoside and varying amounts of glutamine. The glutamate concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient for the reduced form of 3-acetylpyrimidine adenine nucleoside of 8.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 363 nm. The rate of glutamate formation when ATP and bicarbonate were present was determined using the same assay solution but supplemented with the addition of 5.0 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ornithine, and 40 mmbicarbonate. The rate of ADP formation was assayed using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay by following the loss of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (35Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The assay solution consisted of 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.6, 25 °C), 1.0 mmphosphoenol pyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.1 mKCl, 20 mm ornithine, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 33 μg of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. For the glutamine-dependent utilization of ATP, 10 mm glutamine was added to the assay solutions. The rate of inactivation of the glutaminase and glutamine-dependent ATPase activities of CPS by acivicin was determined by incubating the enzyme (20 μm) in 0.1 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.6, 25 °C) with varying amounts of the inhibitor. At various time intervals, the aliquots were removed and diluted at least 100-fold into the appropriate assay solution. The time course for the fraction of the initial catalytic activity remaining (f) was a pseudo-first-order decay, and the rate constant k was obtained by a fit of the data to Equation 1. The plots of the pseudo-first-order rate constants versus the initial acivicin concentration yielded second-order rate constants for the inactivation of CPS. f=e−ktEquation 1 The rate of inactivation of the glutamine-dependent ATPase activity of CPS by acivicin and the rate of activation of the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity of CPS in the presence of 10 mm ATP and 40 mm bicarbonate were investigated. For the inactivation of the glutamine-dependent ATPase activity, the time courses for the fraction activity remaining were pseudo-first-order and were analyzed as described previously. The time course for acivicin activation of the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity was also pseudo-first-order, and the rate constant k was obtained by a fit of the data to Equation 2. In this equationv is the observed velocity, A is the amplitude factor, k is the rate constant of activation, andvo is the velocity observed when no acivicin is added. A plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constants as a function of the acivicin concentration yielded the second-order rate constant for activation. v=A(1−e−kt)+voEquation 2 The partition ratio for the inactivation of CPS with acivicin was determined. In these experiments CPS (20 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with various concentrations of acivicin in 0.1m Hepes buffer (pH 7.6). After 6 h of incubation, the aliquots were removed, and the catalytic activity remaining was determined. For crystallization trials, the protein was concentrated to 4 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KCl and incubated overnight with 20 mmacivicin. Large single crystals were grown at 4 °C using a precipitant solution containing 0.65 m tetraethylammonium chloride, 8% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm ornithine, 1.25 mm ADP, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The resulting crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 152.4 Å, b = 164.4 Å, andc = 333.2 Å and one α/β-heterotetramer/asymmetric unit. An x-ray data set to a nominal resolution of 2.1 Å was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beam-line 7-1 with the MAR300 image plate system. Prior to x-ray data collection, the crystals were flash frozen according to previously published procedures (29Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All x-ray data frames were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The diminution in the ability of CPS to hydrolyze glutamine after the addition of acivicin is presented in Fig. 2. At a concentration of 5.0 mm acivicin, the loss in catalytic activity was first-order, and the data were fitted to Equation 1 with a rate constant of 0.8 min−1. The time courses for the inactivation of the glutamine-dependent ATPase activity of CPS by acivicin were also first-order (data not shown). Glutamine was shown to protect the enzyme from inactivation, thus demonstrating that the inactivation event was due to modification of an active site residue within the binding site for glutamine (Fig. 2). The first-order rate constants for inactivation of the glutaminase and glutamine-dependent hydrolysis of ATP were plotted as a function of the initial acivicin concentration (Fig.3A). In both of these plots there was no evidence to indicate saturation of the enzyme by acivicin at concentrations up to 45 mm. The apparent second-order rate constant for the inactivation of the glutamine-dependent ATPase activity of CPS was found to be 204 ± 10 m−1 min−1. The second-order rate constant for inactivation of the glutaminase activity of CPS by acivicin was 168 ± 6 m−1min−1. The rate of inactivation of CPS by acivicin was greatly enhanced in the presence of added ATP and bicarbonate (Fig.3B). The rate of inactivation of the glutamine-dependent ATPase activity was 4.0 ± 0.4 × 104m−1min−1 in the presence of 10 mm ATP and 40 mm HCO3−. This is a ∼200-fold enhancement over the second-order rate constant determined in the absence of these substrates. There was no indication of saturation by acivicin in this plot.Figure 3Determination of the second-order rate constants for the modification of CPS by acivicin.

The effect of acivicin on the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity of CPS as a function of time is shown in Fig.4. The rate of activation of the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity in the presence of 10 mm ATP and 40 mm bicarbonate at various acivicin concentrations was determined, and the apparent second-order rate constant was equal to 1.6 ± 0.1 × 104m−1 min−1 (Fig.3B). The efficiency for the inactivation of CPS by acivicin was determined by incubating a fixed concentration of enzyme with stoichiometric amounts of the inactivator. A plot of the fractional activity remaining after 6 h of incubation is presented in Fig.5. Extrapolation of the data collected at substoichiometric amounts of acivicin indicated that ∼1.7 molecules of acivicin were required to inactivate one molecule of CPS. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase was inactivated by acivicin, and the kinetic constants (Km andkcat) for the modified enzyme were determined for the bicarbonate-, glutamine-, and ammonia-dependent ATPase activities of CPS.

However, the ability of these modified enzymes to utilize free ammonia is relatively unchanged. In this study, acivicin was also shown to irreversibly inactivate the glutamine-dependent activities of CPS from E. coli but with the ammonia-dependent activities left unaffected. As with other amidotransferases, glutamine protected the enzyme from inactivation (Fig. 2). Previous studies have demonstrated that the hydrolysis of glutamine by CPS involves the formation of a γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate (39Chaparian M.G. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3387-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lusty C.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 134-138Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP and bicarbonate, the second-order rate constant for the formation of the γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate is 3,400 m−1 min−1. The rate of hydrolysis of this intermediate is 0.17 min−1, which is rate-determining (35Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The additions of ATP and bicarbonate increase the rate of glutamine hydrolysis 700-fold with a change in the rate determining step toward the rate of formation of the thioester intermediate (35Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pseudo-first-order kinetics were observed for the inhibition of CPS by acivicin. The apparent second-order rate constant for acivicin inactivation of the glutamine-dependent activities of CPS in the absence of ATP and bicarbonate is ∼200m−1 min−1. When ATP and bicarbonate are added, the apparent second-order rate constant is increased to ∼4.0 × 104m−1 min−1. The binding of ATP and subsequent reaction with bicarbonate within the large subunit of CPS must therefore induce conformational changes in the glutamine amidotransferase site. These alterations in protein structure promote a 700-fold increase in the rate of glutamine hydrolysis and a 200-fold increase in the rate of covalent modification by acivicin. Acivicin did not exhibit saturation kinetics, suggesting that this inhibitor is initially rather loosely bound within the active site (Fig. 3). Similarly, for inactivation of GMP synthetase by acivicin, saturation kinetics were not observed (25Nakamura J. Straub K. Wu J. Lou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23450-23455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, acivicin inactivation of IGP synthetase did exhibit saturation kinetics (24Chittur S.V. Klem T.J. Shafer C.M. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

Acivicin modification of CPS produces a 3-fold increase in the value ofkcat/Km for the bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity. These results indicate that occupancy of the glutamine-binding site can enhance the reactivity of the carboxy phosphate intermediate bound within the large subunit of CPS. This rate enhancement must be promoted through an induced conformational change. A stereo view of the electron density corresponding to the bound inhibitor in the small subunit of CPS is given in Fig.6A. As can be seen, the electron density is well ordered and indicates, as expected, that the dihydroisoxazole ring is covalently attached to the thiolate of Cys-269. A cartoon of the hydrogen bonding pattern formed between the inhibitor and the protein is presented in Fig. 6B. The α-carboxylate group of acivicin is anchored to the protein via the backbone NH peptidic groups of Gly-313 and Phe-314. A bound water molecule and Nε2 of Gln-273 provide additional hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate moiety of the inhibitor. The α-amino group of the ligand is positioned within 2.6 Å of the carbonyl group of Gly-241. Ser-47 lies at ∼3.9 Å from the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the dihydroisoxazole ring. It has been postulated that during the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate in CPS, Oγ of Ser-47 serves both to position the carbonyl carbon of the glutamine side chain for nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of Cys-269 and to stabilize the developing oxyanion (30Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For comparison purposes, a cartoon of the hydrogen bonding pattern observed between CPS (C269S mutant) and glutamine is also presented in Fig.6C. As can be seen, there are eight direct interactions within 3.2 Å between the protein and glutamine in contrast to the four observed in the acivicin-bound enzyme. The replacement of the carboxamide group of glutamine with the dihydroisoxazole ring in acivicin results in the loss of three key interactions with two backbone peptidic NH groups (Gly-241 and Leu-270) and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn-311. Additionally, the hydrogen bond between the α-amino group of glutamine and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-243 is lost upon complexation with acivicin. The less extensive hydrogen bonding network between the protein and acivicin may, in part, explain the lower affinity of the protein for the inhibitor. Other than these changes, however, the polypeptide chains for the small subunits complexed with either acivicin or glutamine are remarkably similar and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.23 Å for all atoms. 2Since the submission of this manuscript, Davisson and co-workers (46Chaudhuri B.N. Lange S.C. Myers R.S. Chittur S.V. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Structure. 2001; 9: 987-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have reported the crystal structure of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase with acivicin covalently attached to the active site cysteine in the glutamine binding site. This structure nicely illustrates the use of the interior of a TIM barrel domain as an integral part of a molecular tunnel for the delivery of ammonia. Previous biochemical studies of CPS have suggested that the hydrolysis of γ-glutamine to glutamate and ammonia proceeds through two tetrahedral adducts and a glutamyl-thioester intermediate. By the judicious use of substrate analogs and site-directed mutant proteins, it has been possible to define, by high resolution x-ray analyses, the structures of these proposed intermediates (30Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 45Thoden J.B. Huang X. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16158-16166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine the geometry of the Michaelis complex, Cys-269 was replaced with a serine residue and crystallized. To mimic the tetrahedral intermediate, a complex between native CPS and glutamate γ-semialdehyde was prepared. Finally, to address the geometry of the small subunit active site during the formation of the γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate, His-353 was changed to an asparagine residue. A superposition of these three structures onto the model of the acivicin-inactivated CPS present here is given in Fig. 7. Acivicin adopts a similar conformation in the active site to that observed for both the tetrahedral and γ-glutamyl thioester intermediates. The α-carboxylate and α-amino groups of all of the ligands occupy nearly identical positions. The potency of acivicin as an inhibitor is, indeed, not surprising in light of these structural similarities. A mechanism for the inactivation of CPS by acivicin that is consistent with the x-ray structure of the inactivated enzyme is presented in Scheme FS1.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)"

Analysis of the amide II band upon2H2O exposure discloses a significant sugar protection of the protein against aqueous solvent, resulting in an 8% less exchange of the corresponding H+·melibiose·MelB complex compared with the protein in the absence of sugar. Investigation of the amide I exchange reveals clear substrate effects on β-sheet accessibility, with the complex H+·melibiose·MelB being the most protected state against exchange, followed by Na+·melibiose·MelB. Although of smaller magnitude, similar changes in α-helices plus non-ordered structures are detected. Finally, no differences are observed when analyzing reverse turn structures. The results suggest that sugar binding induces a remarkable compactness of the carrier's structure, affecting mainly β-sheet domains of the transporter, which, according to secondary structure predictions, may include cytoplasmic loops 4–5 and 10–11. A possible catalytic role of these two loops in the functioning of MelB is hypothesized."

M.HhaI is anS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) dependent DNA methyltransferase that catalyzes the covalent attachment of a methyl group at the C-5 position of the aromatic ring of the first cytosine in the specific sequence 5′-GCGC-3′. Its ability to perform the methyl transfer within the B-DNA helix was rationalized by a localized ”DNA backbone rotation“ by nearly 180° (base flipping) without significantly bending or kinking of the rest of the duplex (8Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 9Garcia R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Base flipping serves to deliver the base into a concave catalytic site in the enzyme (8Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The Gln287 side chain fills up the gap generated concomitantly in the DNA bound with M.HhaI, leading to a stable and specific interruption of the aromatic π-stacked base pairs, a feature recently utilized to evaluate long range electron migration through DNA (12Rajski S.R. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Barton J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5615-5616Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). M.HhaI methylates all of the cytosines in poly(dG-dC) DNA (3Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with hemimethylated DNA being the preferred substrate (13O'Gara M. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both the reaction product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) (14Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wuthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and, by implication, the cofactor AdoMet (7Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S. Weinhold E. Klimasauskas S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20924-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), appear to share the ability to drive M.HhaI to trap the target cytosine in the catalytic site to form a productive complex. These results portray AdoMet and AdoHcy as important modulators of the multiple binding modes of the DNA-bound enzyme. Despite a wealth of information on the structural, dynamic, and kinetic aspects of the M.HhaI mechanism, little attention has been paid to the energetics of AdoMet and AdoHcy recognition reactions. No molecule other than ATP serves as a cofactor in more diverse reactions than does AdoMet (15Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to understand the thermodynamic basis of recognition of the ubiquitous cofactor AdoMet by methyltransferases, a feature shared among structurally related enzymes that catalyze reactions with diverse substrate specificities (16Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol.

For example, a snapshot of a step that follows methyl transfer has been elucidated by crystallographic analyses of the DNA intermediate covalently bound to M.HhaI (8Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and M.HaeIII (19Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Despite its absence in the original crystallization mix of the ternary complex, it was AdoHcy that was found, fortuitously, to reside within the cofactor binding pocket (8Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) shared by AdoMet (16Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This illustrates that the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to the target cytosine results in the formation not only of the modified (i.e. methylated) DNA but also the transformation of AdoMet into AdoHcy. On the other hand, the same experiment with M.HaeIII failed to reveal any electron density for either AdoMet or AdoHcy (19Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) yet resulted in the formation of the DNA intermediate covalently bound to the M.HaeIII, indicating that AdoHcy had formed but diffused out of the crystal. Together, these observations point to the existence of subtle differences in free energies of AdoMet and AdoHcy binding that determine their complexation status with different methyltransferases. AdoHcy competitively inhibits subsequent AdoMet binding. There have been suggestions that steps after methyl transfer are rate-limiting (7Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S. Weinhold E. Klimasauskas S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20924-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and that the M.HhaI molecule in the absence of DNA does not have the capacity to bind either AdoMet or AdoHcy (3Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, results to the contrary have been reported recently (7Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S.

Cell. 1993; 74: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the energetic basis of the recognition of AdoMet and AdoHcy by M.HhaI, we have pursued a thorough characterization of the thermodynamics of the interaction including the changes in the solvation. Results presented herein demonstrate that M.HhaI binds to AdoHcy with greater affinity than to AdoMet. Both recognition processes reveal an unusual, hitherto unobserved, dual mode of recognition wherein a primary dominant exothermic reaction is followed by a weaker endothermic one. These results provide a new perspective on the mechanism of one of the best characterized methyltransferases and have implications for the driving force responsible for low turnover of M.HhaI. The results provide information not only on the energetics of the intermolecular binding reaction between AdoMet and M.HhaI as well as AdoHcy and M.HhaI but also allow one to glean further insight into the role of water molecules involved in the recognition process. All reagents were of analytical or ultrapure grade. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine andS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine were procured from Sigma. Both of these cofactors were further purified on a cation exchange (SP-Sepharose) chromatography. [3H-methyl]AdoMet was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (74 Ci/mmol). Glycerol and ethylene glycol were of ultrapure grade from Sigma. Deionized Milli-Q water was used for all of the studies. M.HhaI was prepared according to a method described previously (20Kumar S. Cheng X. Pflugrath J.A. Roberts R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized (New England Biolabs) and used as substrates in the methylation reactions: 5′-GACTGGTACAGTATCAGGCGCTGACCCACAACATCCG-3′ and 5′-TCGGATGTTGTGGGTCAGCGCCTGATACTGTACCAGT-3′. TheHhaI recognition sequence is in boldface type. These complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form duplexes by heating to 80 °C and gradually cooled to room temperature. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace tryptophan at position 41 by isoleucine and tyrosine using the oligonucleotides 5′-TTCTAATGAAATCGATAAATATG-3′, and 5′-TTCTAATGAATACGATAAATATG-3′, respectively. A single-stranded DNA template containing uracil residues was made from Escherichia coli strain ER2880 that harbored the plasmid pGEM3Zf(−)M.HhaI. Primers were hybridized to this single-stranded DNA, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed essentially according to the method of Kunkel (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The W41I mutant was screened by the creation of a restriction siteClaI, whereas W41Y was screened by a loss of the same site. The resultant plasmids containing the mutations were sequenced on both strands to confirm that no undesired codon changes had occurred. Mutant M.HhaI genes were subcloned into the overexpression vector pUHE25, and the mutant methyltransferases were purified according to the protocol followed for the wild type enzyme (20Kumar S. Cheng X. Pflugrath J.A. Roberts R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both of the mutant methyltransferases, W41I and W41Y, were as active as the wild type M.HhaI with no significant changes in their kinetic parameters (data not shown). M.HhaI solution was prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 ± 0.01, dialyzed overnight in a large volume of the same buffer, and centrifuged to remove any insoluble M.HhaI. The AdoMet and AdoHcy solutions were prepared by weight in the dialysate to minimize differences between the protein buffer solution and ligand buffer solution in the ITC measurements. For osmotic stress studies, the M.HhaI solution was dialyzed extensively against glycerol and ethylene glycol solutions in the above buffer. AdoMet and AdoHcy solutions were then prepared with the final dialysate. Care was taken that the neutral solute osmolalities used were not significantly different from their ordinary molal concentrations (22Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.61st Ed.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31272-31278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The titration calorimetric measurements were performed with a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). Briefly, the titration calorimeter consists of a 1.347-ml cell containing the protein solution and a matched reference cell in an adiabatic enclosure. Aliquots of AdoMet and AdoHcy solutions at 15−40 times the M.HhaI concentration were added via a 250-μl rotating stirrer microsyringe operated with a plunger driven by a stepper motor under computer control. Samples were carefully scrutinized for precipitate after the titration. No precipitate was observed after the titration either in the presence or in the absence of the osmolytes. The unitless quantity c, defined as the product of the initial macromolecule concentration ([M.HhaI]0) and the equilibrium association constant (Kb) (i.e. c =Kb[M.HhaI]0), was in the range of 2 < c < 200, as required for ITC studies (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). This corresponds to a binding regime that is best suited for the most precise measurements of the stoichiometry (n),Kb, and ΔH0bsimultaneously in a single ITC experiment. The total concentration of the M.HhaI, [M.HhaI]t, was from 0.02 to 0.04 mm, whereas the total concentrations of either AdoMet or AdoHcy ligands, [L]t, were from 0.8 to 1.2 mm. The titration of ligand solution in this concentration range with the buffer solution alone gave negligible values for the heat of dilution both in the presence and absence of osmolytes at 293.2 K. Nonetheless, for every experiment, the heat of dilution of the ligand was measured and subtracted from the runs conducted with the M.HhaI. The time duration between the injections was at least 3 min to allow the peak to return to base line. The number of additions of AdoMet as well as AdoHcy titrant was fixed such that the area below the peak was reduced by at least an order of magnitude or until M.HhaI binding sites were saturated >95%. All measurements were made at a constant stirrer speed of 395 rpm. In the first tandem ITC experiment, a low concentration ligand regime (1–2 mm), injected in small volume aliquots, was utilized. The goal was to measure thermodynamic parameters for the high affinity mode in a single experiment, at the end of which only an insignificant fraction of the secondary binding mode was occupied. Having saturated the primary mode fully, the system was poised for characterizing the weaker binding mode, with a substantially high concentration of AdoMet or AdoHcy (10 mm) injected in higher volume aliquots. Thus, in the second experiment the detected heat changes emerge almost entirely from the interaction of the ligand with M.HhaI in the secondary binding mode. The contributions from one mode to the other are negligible in these tandem ITC experiments, despite the fact that they were performed under two separate ligand concentration regimes. To achieve c values in the correct range for an ideal titration of the secondary weak mode, an unrealistically high concentration of M.HhaI in the millimolar range is required, which would necessitate prohibitively high concentrations of the 1–2m of AdoMet and AdoHcy to be injected. However, at these concentration ranges, the c values for the primary high affinity mode would overshoot the upper limit of the ideal range. The first titration experiment was performed at an optimum cvalue for fully characterizing the primary binding mode, which was followed by a second one with suboptimal c value for characterizing the secondary binding mode. Consequently, the thermodynamic parameters obtained for the secondary weak binding mode should be viewed as approximate. The titration data were analyzed using a single site fitting model. The identical site model was fitted to the data utilizing a monomeric M.HhaI concentration. The heat content of a solution,Qt, has been shown to be related to the total concentrations of the methyltransferase (M.HhaI) and either AdoMet or AdoHcy ligand (L) through the equation (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar),Qt=n[M.HhaI]tΔHb0V(1+[L]t/n[M.HhaI]t+1/nKb[M.HhaI]t−Equation 1 [(1+[L]t/n[M.HhaI]t+1/nKb[M.HhaI]t)2−4[L]t/n[M.HhaI]t]1/2)/2where n is the stoichiometry, Kbis an intrinsic binding constant, ΔH0bis an intrinsic heat of binding, [M.HhaI]t is the total M.HhaI concentration, and V is the cell volume. The expression for the heat released per ith injection, ΔQi, is then the following,ΔQi=Qi+dVi/2V(Qi+Qi−1)−Qi−1Equation 2 where dVi is the volume of titrant added to the solution. A least squares fit of ΔQi to Equation 2, obtained by each run of titration calorimetry, gives values for stoichiometry (n), ΔH0band Kb. Since M.HhaI at pH 7.4 exists as a monomeric protein, an identical site model utilizing a concentration of the protein monomer was the simplest binding model found to provide the best fit to the ITC data. Values for ΔS0b were obtained from the basic equation of thermodynamics,ΔGb0=ΔHb0−TΔSb0Equation 3 whereΔGb0=−nRTlnKbEquation 4 and n represents the number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, and R = 8.315 J mol−1 K−1. Coupled osmotic-ITC experiments were performed essentially as described in Ref.24Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar. The magnitude of the effect of osmotic stress depends both on the solute osmolal concentration, which is equivalent to the bulk water chemical potential, and on the difference in the number of solute-excluding water molecules associated with the ligand-M.HhaI complex and the number associated with the free M.HhaI and ligand molecules. This osmotic effect, when quantitated analogously to the conventional analysis of the effect of salt activity on protein binding, yields information on the effect of change in activity of water molecules upon ligand binding free energy (23Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The slope of log Kb, versus lnaw, where aw is the water activity, is 2.303 Δnw. This value Δnw gives the change in number of solute-excluding water molecules coupled to the binding process. Since ln aw = −[solute]osmolal/55.56, where −[solute]osmolal is the solute osmolal concentration and 55.56 is the number of moles of water in 1 kg, the slope of the plot of log Kb as a function of solute osmolality is given by the following,dlogKb/d[solute]osmolal=−2.303Δnw/55.56Equation 5 In a true osmotic effect, an increase in osmotic strength of the medium manifests as a decrease in water activity in the vicinity of the respective binding sites and vice versa by the relationship shown in Equation 5. Linearity of the plots of logarithm of binding constantsversus neutral solutes' osmolality for the binding of AdoMet and AdoHcy to M.HhaI indicates a linkage to a well defined and constant difference in the number of water molecules involved in ligand binding (24Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3987-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Control experiments in which aliquots of glycerol or ethylene glycol were injected into M.HhaI, AdoMet, or AdoHcy solutions did not result in any measurable heats of binding. This rules out the possibility of specific interactions between the stressing solute and either M.HhaI, AdoMet, or AdoHcy, confirming the neutrality of the chosen osmolytes. DSC measurements were performed with a VP-DSC scanning calorimeter from Microcal™ Inc., consisting of two fixed 0.5-ml cells, a reference cell and a sample cell. The measurements were usually made at a scan rate of 60 K h−1. To determine any dependence of the parameters on the scan rate, scans were also performed between 2 and 90 K h−1. From each sample versus buffer experiment, the corresponding buffer versus buffer base-line run was subtracted. The data were analyzed by Origin™ program supplied by the manufacturer. The raw data were normalized for concentration and scan rate. The pre- and post-transition base lines were connected by a progress base line, and the resultant processed data were used for nonlinear least-squares curve fitting analyses based on Levenberg-Marquardt methods. A two-state transition model with direct measurement of heat capacity ΔCp was found to be the simplest one capable of fitting all the DSC data. The thermal transition was irreversible at all scan rates examined. This was attributable to a step after the reversible two-state transition, according to the model, N↔U→Dwherein the native protein (N) undergoes a reversible transition to an unfolded (U) state, which, subsequently, undergoes an irreversible transition leading to the oligomerization of the denatured polypeptides (D). The DSC scans were found to be essentially independent of protein concentration as well as scan rate, thus validating the two-state assumption (24Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Methylation assays for M.HhaI was carried out in methylase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) using [3H-methyl]AdoMet (20Kumar S. Cheng X. Pflugrath J.A. Roberts R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was spotted onto a DE81 filter (anion exchange). The filter was washed three times with cold 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and once with ethanol. The filter was dried, and the radioactivity was measured in 3 ml of liquid scintillation fluid. To analyze isotope partitioning by M.HhaI, 400 nmHhaI was preincubated with 400 nm[methyl-3H]AdoMet at 37 °C. 10 μl of this preincubated mix was brought to a final volume of 200 μl with methylase buffer containing 400 nm[methyl-3H]AdoMet and 100 nm DNA. Aliquots of 30 μl each were removed at 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-s time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by snap chilling the samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then analyzed for radiolabeled product formation using a DE81 filter binding assay (as mentioned above). In a parallel reaction, the above preincubated mix was brought to 200 μl with methylase buffer containing 400 nmunlabeled AdoMet and DNA. This corresponds to a 20-fold dilution of the label. In another set of reactions, 100 nmHhaI was preincubated with 400 nm of labeled AdoMet at 37 °C. 40 μl of this preincubated mix was brought to 200 μl with methylase buffer containing either 400 nm labeled AdoMet or unlabeled AdoMet and DNA (a 5-fold dilution of the label). Aliquots of 30 μl were removed at 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-s time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by snap chilling the samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then analyzed for radiolabeled product formation using a DE81 filter binding assay (as mentioned above). The final concentrations of HhaI, DNA, and AdoMet in both sets were 20, 95, and 400 nm, respectively. Preincubation experiments were carried out by incubating 20 nm M.HhaI with either 500 nm [methyl-3H]AdoMet or 220 nm of DNA at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding DNA or [methyl-3H]AdoMet, respectively. At 10-, 20-, 40-, 60-, and 120-s time intervals or 15-, 25-, 35-, 40-, 60-, and 125-s time intervals, 30-μl aliquots were removed and analyzed for product formation, using the DE81 filter binding assay. The calorimetric titrations detected directly the heat change upon binding of the ligands AdoMet as well as AdoHcy to M.HhaI (Fig.1). The results reveal an initial phase of rapid decrease in the exothermic heat of binding with successive injections, followed by a heat sign reversal that culminates in a phase involving a monotonic decrease in the endothermic heat of binding. The results suggest the existence of a primary high affinity binding mode predominantly exothermic in nature, followed by a secondary low affinity one of endothermic origin. Qualitatively similar ITC profiles were obtained for AdoHcy binding to M.HhaI. The existence of a large difference in the net heat change as a function of the added ligand emanating during the primary vis-à-vis the secondary regimes of this dual binding mode, together with their widely disparate affinities, precluded the extraction of thermodynamic data reliably in a single titration experiment. This difficulty was overcome by performing sequential ITC experiments aimed at determining the parameters for both modes independently (Fig.2). Despite their greater precision, the results of the latter ITC experiments appear qualitatively similar to those obtained from the ITC experiments in which both the binding modes are observed simultaneously in a single experiment. The temperature dependence of the changes in binding enthalpy (ΔH0b), entropy (ΔS0b), and free energy (ΔG0b) is shown in TablesI and II. The heat capacity change at constant pressure (ΔCp), measured for both AdoMet−M.HhaI and AdoHcy−M.HhaI interactions are small and independent of temperature. Hence, large conformational changes in these interactions are ruled out. The"
