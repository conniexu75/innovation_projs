https://openalex.org/W2037973947,"The formation of novel organometallic compounds by the reaction of organic substrates with finely divided metal powders represents a powerful tool for the synthetic chemist. The direct reaction with a zerovalent metal is the only viable method of synthesis for many of these compounds. Accordingly, chemists have been actively developing new methods for increasing the reactivity of metal powders toward organic substrates. Three principal approaches have been developed in recent years: the metal vaporization method, sonochemistry, and the preparation of finely divided metal powders by the reduction of metal salts. A number of new methods of synthesis have resulted from these studies."

Long-term, left-lateral strike-slip offsets of stream channels, alluvial terrace edges, and glacial moraines along the fault cluster between 100 and 400 meters. The high elevation of the sites, mostly above 4000 meters in the periglacial zone, suggests that most offsets resulted from slip on the fault since the beginning of the Holocene. These data imply that slip rates are 2 to 3 centimeters per year along much of the fault length and support the hypothesis that the continuing penetration of India into Asia forces Tibet rapidly toward the east."
https://openalex.org/W1999854245,"A method of remotely measuring near-surface ocean currents with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is described. The apparatus consists of a single SAR transmitter and two receiving antennas. The phase difference between SAR image scenes obtained from the antennas forms an interferogram that is directly proportional to the surface current. The first field test of this technique against conventional measurements gives estimates of mean currents accurate to order 20 percent, that is, root-mean-square errors of 5 to 10 centimeters per second in mean flows of 27 to 56 centimeters per second. If the full potential of the method could be realized with spacecraft, then it might be possible to routinely monitor the surface currents of the world's oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2066984307,"New high pressure forms of the sesquioxides of holminum, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, and yttrium have been obtained by exposure of the C-type sesquioxides to pressures between 25 and 40 kilobars and temperatures between 900 degrees and 1020 degrees C. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that these new high-pressure phases are of the monoclinic B-type which is known for several of the lighter rare-earth sesquioxides (samarium through dysprosium)."
https://openalex.org/W1995630572,"The synthesis, single-crystal x-ray structural characterization, and sorption properties of a microporous molybdenum phosphate, (Me(4)N)(1.3)(H(3)O)(0.7)[Mo(4)O(8)(PO(4))(2)] . 2H(2)O (Me, methyl), are presented. The three-dimensional framework is built up from Mo(4)O(8)(4+) cubes and PO(4)(3-) tetrahedra that are connected in such a way that large, cation-filled voids are generated; these voids constitute 25% of the volume of the solid. Absorption isotherms for water show the completely reversible uptake of 4 to 5 percent by weight water into the micropores of this compound, which corresponds to 10 to 12 percent by volume."
https://openalex.org/W2013214193,"An extract of the radial nerves of the starfish, Asterias amurensis, acts on the ovary in two ways: it induces meiosis and brings on spawning. Contraction of the gonadal wall, the, driving force for spawning, does not happen until this gamete-shedding substance acts to liberate the eggs that adhere to each other or to the inner surface of the gonadal wall."
https://openalex.org/W2043663881,"The defeat of the Aztecs of Mexico by Hernán Cortés in 1521 was but the beginning of a long and torturous conquest of Central America that did not always result in the mastery of people and production for which the Spanish had hoped. The Maya of the resource-poor Yucatán peninsula were spared the heavy colonial hand that held fast to central Mexico and its riches. In addition, the dense forests of the peninsula served as a haven for refugees fleeing oppressive conditions in colonial towns. Despite the paucity of documentary information on Maya communities of the frontier, knowledge of Maya-Spanish relations in the 16th and 17th centuries has advanced in recent years through archeological and ethnohistorical research. Work in one region of the Maya lowlands has brought us closer to an understanding of the early interaction of the rulers and the ruled."
https://openalex.org/W2748618978,"One stone of the Orgueil meteorite shower contains an assortment of biogenic materials: coal fragments, seed capsules of the reed Juncus conglomeratus, other plant fragments, and an optically active, water-soluble protein material resembling collagen-derived glues. This sample seems to have been accidentally or deliberately contaminated shortly after the fall of the meteorite in 1864."

The presence of these pollution-sensitive forms indicates, however, that the river is more river-like than sewer-like in a given area."
https://openalex.org/W2063534301,"In maize endosperm there are two electrophoretic variants of catalase. The variations are under genetic control, and the heterozygote shows three hybrid enzymes with mobilities intermediate between the parental enzymes. Thus, maize catalase may exist as a tetramer, and the hybrid enzymes may be formed by random association of two different catalase monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1985716172,"Atmospheric diffusion is accomplished by the wind movement of pollutants, but the character of the source of pollution requires that this action of the wind be taken into account in different ways. These sources can be grouped into three classes: point sources, line sources, and area sources. Both vertical and horizontal turbulent diffusion are described in detail. Atmospheric transport is discussed with emphasis on topographical barriers and semipermanent subsidence inversions. Air pollution meteorology is discussed in relation to urban air pollution. As more is learned about the meteorology of cities and the distribution of pollutant emissions, it may be possible to predict expected concentrations routinely and to take into account the changes in the patterns that would occur if the emissions were changed."
https://openalex.org/W1993418787,Three Perodicticus potto have been observed in captivity for about 1 year. The social custom of visiting was established when one isolated himself from the others by living in a hollow tree trunk. The existence of such very marked social ceremonial in the Lorisoidea is of considerable evoluctionary interest.

https://openalex.org/W1995698394,"A nuclear magnetic resonance technique was used to determine the hydrocarbon content of a porous material during its displacement by an oil-miscible but hydrogen-free liquid (CCl(4)). After displacement of heptane by an amount of carbon tetrachloride equal to 1.5 times the pore volume, about 10 percent of the heptane remained, presumably in ""dead-end"" pores."
https://openalex.org/W2005064947,"Experiments were undertaken to determine the applicability of a computer program for automatic syntactic analysis to the systematic discovery of ambiguities in textual material. Specific application of this program was made to portions of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Results, though promising, indicate that such applications are not now economically feasible for large volumes of text."
