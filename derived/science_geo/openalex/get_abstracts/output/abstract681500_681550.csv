https://openalex.org/W3203249973,"Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response."
https://openalex.org/W3203631316,"<h2>Summary</h2> Single-cell gene expression technologies are powerful tools to study cell types in the human brain, but efforts have largely focused on cortical brain regions. We therefore created a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing resource of 70,615 high-quality nuclei to generate a molecular taxonomy of cell types across five human brain regions that serve as key nodes of the human brain reward circuitry: nucleus accumbens, amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We first identified novel subpopulations of interneurons and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens and further characterized robust GABAergic inhibitory cell populations in the amygdala. Joint analyses across the 107 reported cell classes revealed cell-type substructure and unique patterns of transcriptomic dynamics. We identified discrete subpopulations of D1- and D2-expressing MSNs in the nucleus accumbens to which we mapped cell-type-specific enrichment for genetic risk associated with both psychiatric disease and addiction."
https://openalex.org/W3201959246,"Optoelectronic systems can exert precise control over targeted neurons and pathways throughout the brain in untethered animals, but similar technologies for the spinal cord are not well established. In the present study, we describe a system for ultrafast, wireless, closed-loop manipulation of targeted neurons and pathways across the entire dorsoventral spinal cord in untethered mice. We developed a soft stretchable carrier, integrating microscale light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs), that conforms to the dura mater of the spinal cord. A coating of silicone-phosphor matrix over the micro-LEDs provides mechanical protection and light conversion for compatibility with a large library of opsins. A lightweight, head-mounted, wireless platform powers the micro-LEDs and performs low-latency, on-chip processing of sensed physiological signals to control photostimulation in a closed loop. We use the device to reveal the role of various neuronal subtypes, sensory pathways and supraspinal projections in the control of locomotion in healthy and spinal-cord injured mice."
https://openalex.org/W3203805144,"Drug repurposing has the potential to bring existing de-risked drugs for effective intervention in an ongoing pandemic-COVID-19 that has infected over 131 million, with 2.8 million people succumbing to the illness globally (as of April 04, 2021). We have used a novel `gene signature'-based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, these drug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms, which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existing drugs. Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could be valuable not only as anti-COVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarker development."
https://openalex.org/W3202126351,"In recent years, much effort has been devoted to understanding the response of plants to various light sources, largely due to advances in industry light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this study, the effect of different light modes on rocket ( Eruca sativa . Mill.) photosynthetic performance and other physiological traits was evaluated using an orthogonal design based on a combination between light intensity, quality, and photoperiod factors. Some morphological and biochemical parameters and photosynthetic efficiency of the plants were analyzed. Plants grew in a closed chamber where three light intensities (160, 190, and 220 μmol m -2 s -1 ) provided by LEDs with a combination of different ratios of red, green, and blue (R:G:B- 7:0:3, 3:0:7, and 5:2:3) and three different photoperiods (light/dark -10/14 h, 12/12 h, and 14/10 h) were used and compared with white fluorescent light (control). This experimental setup allowed us to study the effect of 9 light modes (LM) compared to white light. The analyzes performed showed that the highest levels of chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and carotenoids occurred under LM4, LM3, and LM1, respectively. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurement showed that the best effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry Y(II), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and electron transport ratio (ETR) were obtained under LM2. The data showed that the application of R7:G0:B3 light mode with a shorter photoperiod than 14/10 h (light/dark), regardless of the light intensity used, resulted in a significant increase in growth as well as higher photosynthetic capacity of rocket plants. Since, a clear correlation between the studied traits under the applied light modes was not found, more features should be studied in future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3204671558,"Expectation-based theories of language processing, such as Surprisal theory, are supported by evidence of anticipation effects in both behavioural and neurophysiological measures. Online measures of language processing, however, are known to be influenced by factors such as lexical association that are distinct from—but often confounded with—expectancy. An open question therefore is whether a specific locus of expectancy related effects can be established in neural and behavioral processing correlates. We address this question in an event-related potential experiment and a self-paced reading experiment that independently cross expectancy and lexical association in a context manipulation design. We find that event-related potentials reveal that the N400 is sensitive to both expectancy and lexical association, while the P600 is modulated only by expectancy. Reading times, in turn, reveal effects of both association and expectancy in the first spillover region, followed by effects of expectancy alone in the second spillover region. These findings are consistent with the Retrieval-Integration account of language comprehension, according to which lexical retrieval (N400) is facilitated for words that are both expected and associated, whereas integration difficulty (P600) will be greater for unexpected words alone. Further, an exploratory analysis suggests that the P600 is not merely sensitive to expectancy violations, but rather, that there is a continuous relation. Taken together, these results suggest that the P600, like reading times, may reflect a meaning-centric notion of Surprisal in language comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W3204256482,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents a major public health problem and it is key to find a treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events.A total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% ± 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108±17 min-1) and tachypneic (32 ±10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.No beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3204752253,"Background Timely utilization of antenatal care and delivery services supports the health of mothers and babies. Few studies exist on the utilization and determinants of timely ANC and use of different types of health facilities at the community level in Bangladesh. This study aims to assess the utilization, timeliness of, and socio-demographic determinants of antenatal and delivery care services in two sub-districts in Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional study used data collected through a structured questionnaire in the eRegMat cluster-randomized controlled trial, which enrolled pregnant women between October 2018-June 2020. We undertook univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the associations of socio-demographic variables with timely first ANC, four timely ANC visits, and facility delivery. We considered the associations in the multivariate logistic regression as statistically significant if the p-value was found to be &lt;0.05. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Data were available on 3293 pregnant women. Attendance at a timely first antenatal care visit was 59%. Uptake of four timely antenatal care visits was 4.2%. About three-fourths of the women delivered in a health facility. Women from all socio-economic groups gradually shifted from using public health facilities to private hospitals as the pregnancy advanced. Timely first antenatal care visit was associated with: women over 30 years of age (AOR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.05–2.19); nulliparity (AOR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04–1.62); husbands with &gt;10 years of education (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.09–1.81) and being in the highest wealth quintile (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.18–1.89). Facility deliveries were associated with woman’s age; parity; education; the husband’s education, and wealth index. None of the available socio-demographic factors were associated with four timely antenatal care visits. Conclusions The study observed socio-demographic inequalities associated with increased utilization of timely first antenatal care visit and facility delivery. The pregnant women, irrespective of wealth shifted from public to private facilities for their antenatal care visits and delivery. To increase the health service utilization and promote good health, maternal health care programs should pay particular attention to young, multiparous women, of low socio-economic status, or with poorly educated husbands.

https://openalex.org/W3201792028,"A few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.Blood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a follow-up SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to confirm which antibodies were influenced on LFA- and ECLIA- false-negative result in crew-member samples.Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. All antibody titers measured using ELISA were significantly lower in blood samples with negative results than in those with positive results in both LFA and ECLIA. In the patients with negative results from the follow-up genetic testing, IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively.These findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has lower performance in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients than required in the guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3204589622,"The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra indicate that anthracenyl chalcones (ACs) have high maximum wavelengths and good transparency windows for optical applications and are suitable for optoelectronic applications owing to their HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (2.93 and 2.76 eV). Different donor substituents on the AC affect their dipole moments and nonlinear optical (NLO) responses. The positive, negative, and neutral electrostatic potential regions of the molecules were identified using molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). The stability of the molecule on account of hyperconjugative interactions and accompanying charge delocalization was analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Open and closed aperture Z-scans were performed using a continuous-wave frequency-doubled diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser to measure the nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refractive index coefficients, respectively. The valley-to-peak profile of AC indicated a negative nonlinear refractive index coefficient. The obtained single crystals possess reverse saturation absorption due to excited-state absorption. The structural and nonlinear optical properties of the molecules have been discussed, along with the role of anthracene substitution for enhancing the nonlinear optical properties. The calculated third-order susceptibility value was 1.10 x10 -4 esu at an intensity of 4.1 kW/cm 2 , higher than the reported values for related chalcone derivatives. The NLO response for both ACs offers excellent potential in optical switching and limiting applications."
https://openalex.org/W3202333405,"Breastmilk miRNAs may act as epigenetic regulators of metabolism and energy homeostasis in offspring. Here, we aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of miR-26a on adipose tissue development. First, the 3T3-L1 cell model was used to identify putative target genes for miR-26a. Then, target genes were analysed in adipose tissue of offspring from dams that supplied lower levels of breastmilk miR-26a to determine whether miR-26a milk concentration might have a long-lasting impact on adipose tissue in the progeny. In the in vitro model, both over- and under-expression of miR-26a were induced by transfecting into 3T3-L1 with miR-26a mimic and inhibitor. Array analysis was performed after induction of miR-26a to ascertain the impact on mRNA target genes and influence of differentiation status. Focusing on genes related to adipose tissue development, transfection with miR-26a mimic reduced the expression of Pten, Hmga1, Stk11, Rb1, and Adam17 in both pre- and mature adipocytes. Data mostly confirmed the results found in the animal model. After weaning, descendants of cafeteria-fed dams breastfed with lower levels of miR-26a displayed greater expression of Hmag1, Rb1, and Adam17 in retroperitoneal white adipose tissue in comparison with controls. Hence, alterations in the amount of miR-26a supplied through milk during lactation is able to alter the expression of target genes in the descendants and may affect adipose tissue development. Thus, milk miR-26a may act as an epigenetic regulator influencing early metabolic program in the progeny, which emerges as a relevant component of an optimal milk composition for correct development."
https://openalex.org/W3203201215,"Sepsis is a syndromic response to infections and is becoming an emerging threat to the public health sector, particularly in developing countries. Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the cause of typhoid fever, is one primary cause of pediatric sepsis in typhoid endemic areas. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. Typhi is more common among pediatric patients, which is responsible for over 90% of the reported XDR typhoid cases, but the majority of antibiotic resistance studies available have been carried out using S. Typhi isolates from adult patients. Here, we characterized antibiotic-resistance profiles of XDR S. Typhi isolates from a medium size cohort of pediatric typhoid patients (n = 45, 68.89% male and 31.11% female) and determined antibiotic-resistance-related gene signatures associated with common treatment options to typhoid fever patients of 18 XDR S. Typhi representing all 45 isolates. Their ages were 1-13 years old: toddlers aging 1-2 years old (n = 9, 20%), pre-schoolers aging 3-5 years old (n = 17, 37.78%), school-age children aging 6-12 years old (n = 17, 37.78%), and adolescents aging 13-18 years old (n = 2, 4.44%). Through analyzing blaTEM1, dhfR7, sul1, and catA1genes for multidrug-resistance, qnrS, gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE for fluoroquinolone-resistance, blaCTX-M-15 for XDR, and macAB and acrAB efflux pump system-associated genes, we showed the phenotype of the XDR S. Typhi isolates matches with their genotypes featured by the acquisitions of the genes blaTEM1, dhfR7, sul1, catA1, qnrS, and blaCTX-M-15 and a point mutation on gyrA. This study informs the molecular basis of antibiotic-resistance among recent S. Typhi isolates from pediatric septicemia patients, therefore providing insights into the development of molecular detection methods and treatment strategies for XDR S. Typhi."
https://openalex.org/W3203754993,"There is growing interest in how exposure to videogames is associated with young children’s development. While videogames may displace time from developmentally important activities and have been related to lower reading skills, work in older children and adolescents has suggested that experience with attention-demanding/fast-reaction games positively associates with attention and visuomotor skills. In the current study, we assessed 154 children aged 4–7 years (77 male; mean age 5.38) whose parents reported average daily weekday recreational videogame time, including information about which videogames were played. We investigated associations between videogame exposure and children’s sustained, selective, and executive attention skills. We found that videogame time was significantly positively associated only with selective attention. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the directional association between time spent playing recreational videogames and attention skills."
https://openalex.org/W3204093872,"The giant Mimivirus is a member of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), a group of diverse viruses that contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes that replicate primarily in eukaryotic hosts. Two members of the NCLDV, Vaccinia Virus (VACV) and African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), both synthesize Nudix enzymes that have been shown to decap mRNA, a process thought to accelerate viral and host mRNA turnover and promote the shutoff of host protein synthesis. Mimivirus encodes two Nudix enzymes in its genome, denoted as L375 and L534. Importantly, L375 exhibits sequence similarity to ASFV-DP and eukaryotic Dcp2, two Nudix enzymes shown to possess mRNA decapping activity. In this work, we demonstrate that recombinant Mimivirus L375 cleaves the 5' m7GpppN mRNA cap, releasing m7GDP as a product. L375 did not significantly cleave mRNAs containing an unmethylated 5'GpppN cap, indicating that this enzyme specifically hydrolyzes methylated-capped transcripts. A point mutation in the L375 Nudix motif completely eliminated cap hydrolysis, showing that decapping activity is dependent on this motif. Addition of uncapped RNA significantly reduced L375 decapping activity, suggesting that L375 may recognize its substrate through interaction with the RNA body."
https://openalex.org/W3203518055,"The health workforce (HWF) is critical in developing responsive health systems to address population health needs and respond to health emergencies, but defective planning have arguably resulted in underinvestment in health professions education and decent employment. Primary Health Care (PHC) has been the anchor of Ghana's health system. As Ghana's population increases and the disease burden doubles, it is imperative to estimate the potential supply and need for health professionals; and the level of investment in health professions education and employment that will be necessary to avert any mismatches.Using a need-based health workforce planning framework, we triangulated data from multiple sources and systematically applied a previously published Microsoft® Excel-based model to conduct a fifteen-year projection of the HWF supply, needs, gaps and training requirements in the context of primary health care in Ghana.The projections show that based on the population (size and demographics), disease burden, the package of health services and the professional standards for delivering those services, Ghana needed about 221,593 health professionals across eleven categories in primary health care in 2020. At a rate of change between 3.2% and 10.7% (average: 5.5%) per annum, the aggregate need for health professionals is likely to reach 495,273 by 2035. By comparison, the current (2020) stock is estimated to grow from 148,390 to about 333,770 by 2035 at an average growth rate of 5.6%. The health professional's stock is projected to meet 67% of the need but with huge supply imbalances. Specifically, the supply of six out of the 11 health professionals (~54.5%) cannot meet even 50% of the needs by 2035, but Midwives could potentially be overproduced by 32% in 2030.Future health workforce strategy should endeavour to increase the intake of Pharmacy Technicians by more than seven-fold; General Practitioners by 110%; Registered general Nurses by 55% whilst Midwives scaled down by 15%. About US$ 480.39 million investment is required in health professions education to correct the need versus supply mismatches. By 2035, US$ 2.374 billion must be planned for the employment of those that would have to be trained to fill the need-based shortages and for sustaining the employment of those currently available."
https://openalex.org/W3203713456,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for an invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make the RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in a reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human receptor protein compared to SARS-CoV. The phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study adds more insight into the critical dynamics of the key residues at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and potentially aids the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W3204895723,"It is well established that sex differences exist in the manifestation of vascular diseases. Arterial stiffness (AS) has been associated with changes in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cognitive decline in aging. Specifically, older adults with increased AS show a decline on executive function (EF) tasks. Interestingly, the relationship between AS and CVR is more complex, where some studies show decreased CVR with increased AS, and others demonstrate preserved CVR despite higher AS. Here, we investigated the possible role of sex on these hemodynamic relationships. Acquisitions were completed in 48 older adults. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) data were collected during a hypercapnia challenge. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) data was acquired using cine phase contrast velocity series. Cognitive function was assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, and a composite score for EF was calculated using four cognitive tests from the neuropsychological battery. A moderation model test revealed that sex moderated the relationship between PWV and CVR and PWV and EF, but not between CVR and EF. Together, our results indicate that the relationships between central stiffness, cerebral hemodynamics and cognition are in part mediated by sex."
https://openalex.org/W3202268645,"The current challenges at the forefront of data-enabled science and engineering require interdisciplinary solutions. Yet most traditional doctoral programs are not structured to support successful interdisciplinary research. Here we describe the design of and students’ experiences in the COMBINE (Computation and Mathematics for Biological Networks) interdisciplinary graduate program at the University of Maryland. COMBINE focuses on the development and application of network science methods to biological systems for students from three primary domains: life sciences, computational/engineering sciences, and mathematical/physical sciences. The program integrates three established models (T-shaped, pi-shaped and shield-shaped) for interdisciplinary training. The program components largely fall into three categories: (1) core coursework that provides content expertise, communication, and technical skills, (2) discipline-bridging elective courses in the two COMBINE domains that complement the student’s home domain, (3) broadening activities such as workshops, symposiums, and formal peer-mentoring groups. Beyond these components, the program builds community through both formal and informal networking and social events. In addition to the interactions with other program participants, students engage with faculty in several ways beyond the conventional adviser framework, such as the requirement to select a second out-of-field advisor, listening to guest speakers, and networking with faculty through workshops. We collected data through post-program surveys, interviews and focus groups with students, alumni and faculty advisors. Overall, COMBINE students and alumni reported feeling that the program components supported their growth in the three program objectives of Network Science &amp; Interdisciplinarity, Communication, and Career Preparation, but also recommended ways to improve the program. The value of the program can be seen not only through the student reports, but also through the students’ research products in network science which include multiple publications and presentations. We believe that COMBINE offers an effective model for integrated interdisciplinary training that can be readily applied in other fields."
https://openalex.org/W3202495287,"Objectives Most COVID-19 related infections and deaths may occur in healthcare outside hospitals. Here we explored SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) in this setting. Design All healthcare providers in Stockholm, Sweden were asked to recruit HCWs at work for a study of past or present SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs. Study participants This study reports the results from 839 HCWs, mostly employees of primary care centers, sampled in June 2020. Results SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was found among 12% (100/839) of HCWs, ranging from 0% to 29% between care units. Seropositivity decreased by age and was highest among HCWs &lt;40 years of age. Within this age group there was 19% (23/120) seropositivity among women and 11% (15/138) among men (p&lt;0.02). Current infection, as measured using PCR, was found in only 1% and the typical testing pattern of pre-symptomatic potential “superspreaders” found in only 2/839 subjects. Conclusions Previous SARS-CoV-2 infections were common among younger HCWs in this setting. Pre-symptomatic infection was uncommon, in line with the strong variability in SARS-CoV-2 exposure between units. Prioritizing infection prevention and control including sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and vaccination for all HCWs are important to prevent nosocomial infections and infections as occupational injuries during an ongoing pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3203914903,"Front-of-package labeling (FOPL) is a policy tool that helps consumers to make informed food choices. South Africa has not yet implemented this labeling system. The aim of this study was therefore to explore adult South African consumers’ perceptions of front-of-package warning labels on foods and non-alcoholic beverages (referred to as drinks in this paper) and their insights into features that could influence the effectiveness of the warning label. Using a qualitative approach, the study purposively selected consumers diversified by urbanization, gender, socioeconomic status, and literacy. We collected data from a total of 113 participants through 12 focus group discussions. Data were systematically coded and divided into five themes namely, positive attitudes toward warning labels, perceived benefits of warning labels, perceived behavior modification, perceived beneficiaries of warning labels, and effective attributes of warning labels. Almost all participants from all socio-economic backgrounds were positive about warning labels, reporting that warning labels concisely and understandably educated them about the nutritional composition of foods. Other perceived advantages were that warning labels warn of health implications, are easily understandable and could benefit child health. Some participants anticipated that warning labels would reduce their purchases of unhealthy foods, while others thought the labels would have no effect on their purchasing habits. Participants found the warning labels attention grabbing and stated that they preferred a black triangle placed on a white background (referred to as a holding strap henceforth), the words “high in” and “warning” in bold and uppercase text, an exclamation mark, and an icon depicting the excessive nutrient. In South Africa warning labels may improve consumer understanding of nutrition information and assist consumers in determining the nutritional quality of packaged foods and drinks."
https://openalex.org/W3204280573,"The universally conserved P-loop ATPase Ola1 is implicated in various cellular stress response pathways, as well as in cancer and tumor progression. However, Ola1p functions are divergent between species, and the involved mechanisms are only poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of Ola1p in the heat shock response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of quantitative and pulse labeling-based proteomics approaches, in vitro studies, and cell-based assays. Our data show that when heat stress is applied to cells lacking Ola1p, the expression of stress-protective proteins is enhanced. During heat stress Ola1p associates with detergent-resistant protein aggregates and rapidly forms assemblies that localize to stress granules. The assembly of Ola1p was also observed in vitro using purified protein and conditions, which resembled those in living cells. We show that loss of Ola1p results in increased protein ubiquitination of detergent-insoluble aggregates recovered from heat-shocked cells. When cells lacking Ola1p were subsequently relieved from heat stress, reinitiation of translation was delayed, whereas, at the same time, de novo synthesis of central factors required for protein refolding and the clearance of aggregates was enhanced when compared with wild-type cells. The combined data suggest that upon acute heat stress, Ola1p is involved in the stabilization of misfolded proteins, which become sequestered in cytoplasmic stress granules. This function of Ola1p enables cells to resume translation in a timely manner as soon as heat stress is relieved."

To our knowledge, limited studies reported in literature expressing the EGFR vIII in meningioma tumors. Hence, Opinions regarding the role that EGFR vIII in tumorigenesis and tumor progression are clearly conflicting and, therefore, it is crucial not only to find out its mechanism of action, but also to definitely identify its role in meningioma."
https://openalex.org/W3131778616,"In this paper, a new innovative type-2 fuzzy-based for microgrid (MG) islanding detection is proposed in the condition of uncertainties. Load and generation uncertainties are two main sources of uncertainties in microgrids (MGs). Regardless of the uncertainties, the results cannot be confirmed. The proposed controller detects islanding in the fastest time under different conditions, and the uncertainties in the system will not considerably affect the controller's performance. The proposed method is simulated on the sample system and examined in different scenarios. Then, a comparison is made in different conditions and scenarios between the suggested method and some common methods that have been presented so far to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for islanding detection."
https://openalex.org/W3201816168,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type XIV is a rare recessive bone disorder characterized by variable degree of severity associated to osteopenia. It is caused by mutations in TMEM38B encoding for the trimeric intracellular cation channel TRIC-B, specific for potassium and ubiquitously present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. OI type XIV molecular basis is largely unknown and, due to the rarity of the disease, the availability of patients' osteoblasts is challenging. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knock out (KO) TMEM38B in the human Foetal Osteoblast hFOB 1.19 to obtain an OI type XIV model. CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful technology to generate in vitro and in vivo models for heritable disorders. Its limited cost and ease of use make this technique widely applicable in most laboratories. Nevertheless, to fully take advantage of this approach, it is important to be aware of its strengths and limitations. Three gRNAs were used and several KO clones lacking the expression of TRIC-B were obtained. Few clones were validated as good models for the disease since they reproduce the altered ER calcium flux, collagen I structure and impaired secretion and osteoblastic markers expression detected in patients' cells. Impaired proliferation and mineralization in KO clones unveiled the relevance of TRIC-B in osteoblasts functionality."
https://openalex.org/W3202505150,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the lacunae in the preparedness of healthcare systems across the globe. This preparedness also includes the safety of healthcare providers (HCPs) at various levels. Sudden spread of COVID-19 infection has created threatening and vulnerable conditions for the HCPs. The current pandemic situation has not only affected physical health of HCPs but also their mental health. Objective This study aims to understand the prevalence and severity of secondary traumatic stress, optimism parameters, along with states of mood experienced by the HCPs, viz ., doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (including Physiotherapist, Lab technicians, Phlebotomist, dieticians, administrative staff and clinical pharmacist), during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Methodology The assessment of level of secondary traumatic stress (STS), optimism/pessimism (via Life Orientation Test-Revised) and current mood states experienced by Indian HCPs in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation was done using a primary data of 2,008 HCPs from India during the first lockdown during April-May 2020. Data was collected through snow-ball sampling technique, reaching out to various medical health care professionals through social media platforms. Result Amongst the study sample 88.2% of doctors, 79.2 of nurses and 58.6% of allied HCPs were found to have STS in varying severity. There was a female preponderance in the category of Severe STS. Higher optimism on the LOTR scale was observed among doctors at 39.3% followed by nurses at 26.7% and allied health care professionals 22.8%. The mood visual analogue scale which measures the “mood” during the survey indicated moderate mood states without any gender bias in the study sample. Conclusion The current investigation sheds light on the magnitude of the STSS experienced by the HCPs in the Indian Subcontinent during the pandemic. This hitherto undiagnosed and unaddressed issue, calls for a dire need of creating better and accessible mental health programmes and facilities for the health care providers in India."
https://openalex.org/W3203439468,"Copper is prevalent in coastal ecosystems due to its use as an algaecide and as an anti-fouling agent on ship hulls. Alteromonas spp. have previously been shown to be some of the early colonizers of copper-based anti-fouling paint but little is known about the mechanisms they use to overcome this initial copper challenge. The main models of copper resistance include the Escherichia coli chromosome-based Cue and Cus systems; the plasmid-based E. coli Pco system; and the plasmid-based Pseudomonas syringae Cop system. These were all elucidated from strains isolated from copper-rich environments of agricultural and/or enteric origin. In this work, copper resistance assays demonstrated the ability of Alteromonas macleodii strains CUKW and KCC02 to grow at levels lethal to other marine bacterial species. A custom database of Hidden Markov Models was designed based on proteins from the Cue, Cus, and Cop/Pco systems and used to identify potential copper resistance genes in CUKW and KCC02. Comparative genomic analyses with marine bacterial species and bacterial species isolated from copper-rich environments demonstrated that CUKW and KCC02 possess genetic elements of all systems, oftentimes with multiple copies, distributed throughout the chromosome and mega-plasmids. In particular, two copies of copA (the key player in cytoplasmic detoxification), each with its own apparent MerR-like transcriptional regulator, occur on a mega-plasmid, along with multiple copies of Pco homologs. Genes from both systems were induced upon exposure to elevated copper levels (100 μM- 3 mM). Genomic analysis identified one of the merR-copA clusters occurs on a genomic island (GI) within the plasmid, and comparative genomic analysis found that either of the merR-copA clusters, which also includes genes coding for a cupredoxin domain-containing protein and an isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase, occurs on a GI across diverse bacterial species. These genomic findings combined with the ability of CUKW and KCC02 to grow in copper-challenged conditions are couched within the context of the genome flexibility of the Alteromonas genus."
https://openalex.org/W3203445074,"Background An intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by a deficit in the functional, cognitive, and adaptive skills required for independent living. Due to the low cognitive capabilities of individuals with IDs, they have become victims of marginalization, exclusion, and denial of their fundamental rights to basic necessities in societies around the world. While efforts are being made to improve service provision to and acceptance of individuals with disabilities, the extent of communal acceptance and recognition of these individuals as equal members of society remains underexplored in sub-Saharan African countries such as Cameroon and Ghana. Objective As attitudes toward individuals with IDs are pivotal in shaping national policies, this cross-national study examined communal attitudes toward persons with IDs in Cameroon and Ghana. Method The Community Living Attitude Scale for Intellectual Disabilities (CLAS-ID) was used to collect data from a total of 741 university students in the two countries. The validity of the scale was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis and principal component analysis. The association between the background variables and attitudes was examined using t-tests, analysis of variance, linear regression, and two-way factor analysis. Results The results showed the validity of the CLAS-ID as a valid tool for measuring communal attitudes toward individuals with IDs in sub-Saharan Africa. The participants appeared ambivalent about attitude towards individuals with ID and other findings showed no association between attitudes and variables such as gender, relation, and contact with individuals with IDs. Conclusion We discuss the need for innovative approaches aimed at changing attitudes toward individuals with IDs in sub-Saharan Africa as well as other study implications."
https://openalex.org/W3201717923,"Inflammation, oxidative stress, and protease/protease inhibitor imbalance with excessive production of proteases are factors associated with pathogenesis of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we report that kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) is a crucial protease involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and bronchial epithelial repair after injury. First, we showed that KLK5 degrades the basal layer formed by culture of primary bronchial epithelial cells from COPD or non-COPD patients. Also, exogenous KLK5 acted differently on BEAS-2B cells already engaged in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or on 16HBE 14o- cells harboring epithelial characteristics. Indeed, by inducing EMT, KLK5 reduced BEAS-2B cell adherence to the ECM. This effect, neutralized by tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, a kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, was due to a direct proteolytic activity of KLK5 on E-cadherin, β-catenin, fibronectin, and α5β1 integrin. Thus, KLK5 may strengthen EMT mechanisms and promote the migration of cells by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway required for this function. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous KLK5 in 16HBE14o- cells, accelerated wound healing repair after injury, and exogenous KLK5 addition delayed the closure repair. These data suggest that among proteases, KLK5 could play a critical role in airway remodeling events associated with COPD during exposure of the pulmonary epithelium to inhaled irritants or smoking and the inflammation process."
https://openalex.org/W3202113459,"Neural cells are continuously subjected to oxidative stress arising from electrochemical activity, and cellular protection systems can turn on the oxidative stress response to detect and alleviate adverse conditions. However, the function and mechanism of the protective systems are complicated and remain largely elusive. We report that PTENα, an isoform of the PTEN family, mediates defense signaling in response to oxidative stress during brain aging. We show that genetic ablation of Ptenα in mice increases oxidative stress and results in neuronal cell death, culminating in accelerated decline of cognition and motor coordination as age increases. PTENα maintains COX activity and promotes energy metabolism through abrogating NEDD4L-mediated degradation of COX4 in response to oxidative stress. In the presence of Parkinson's disease-associated mutation, PTENα loses the capability to protect COX4 and ameliorate defects caused by Ptenα deletion. Our study reveals an important role of PTENα in response to oxidative stress. We propose that dysregulation of PTENα signaling may accelerate the rate of brain aging and promote the development of neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3202284939,"Most authors have identified two rapid increases in relative brain size (encephalization quotient, EQ) in cetacean evolution: first at the origin of the modern suborders (odontocetes and mysticetes) around the Eocene-Oligocene transition, and a second at the origin of the delphinoid odontocetes during the middle Miocene. We explore how methods used to estimate brain and body mass alter this perceived timing and rate of cetacean EQ evolution. We provide new data on modern mammals (mysticetes, odontocetes, and terrestrial artiodactyls) and show that brain mass and endocranial volume scale allometrically, and that endocranial volume is not a direct proxy for brain mass. We demonstrate that inconsistencies in the methods used to estimate body size across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary have caused a spurious pattern in earlier relative brain size studies. Instead, we employ a single method, using occipital condyle width as a skeletal proxy for body mass using a new dataset of extant cetaceans, to clarify this pattern. We suggest that cetacean relative brain size is most accurately portrayed using EQs based on the scaling coefficients as observed in the closely related terrestrial artiodactyls. Finally, we include additional data for an Eocene whale, raising the sample size of Eocene archaeocetes to seven. Our analysis of fossil cetacean EQ is different from previous works which had shown that a sudden increase in EQ coincided with the origin of odontocetes at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Instead, our data show that brain size increased at the origin of basilosaurids, 5 million years before the Eocene-Oligocene transition, and we do not observe a significant increase in relative brain size at the origin of odontocetes."
https://openalex.org/W3203472933,"Background Snail has been linked to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We plan to investigate the regulation of Snail in response to TNF-α, histone acetylation, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK)-3 inhibition in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). Methods FLSs from rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were collected and treated with TNF-α alone or a combination with trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor and lithium chloride (LiCl), a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK)-3 inhibitor. Results We demonstrated for the first time that nuclear expression of Snail in FLSs from rats with CIA was correlated with the levels of extracellular TNF-α and acetylation status. Cell proliferation and viability of CIA FLSs were reduced in response to TSA treatment and short-hairpin RNA specific to Snail. LiCl treatment increased Snail and cadherin-11 (Cad-11) expression in CIA FLSs. Conclusion We suggested from this study that targeting TNF-α-histone deacetylase-Snail signaling axis or the Wnt signaling pathway in FLSs might provide therapeutic interventions for the treatment of RA in the future."

Platelet biomarkers are involved in inflammation in RA patients. Increased circulating platelet counts in RA patients may contribute to platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis. In this pilot study we evaluated platelet mitochondrial bioenergy function, CoQ10 levels and oxidative stress in RA patients.Twenty-one RA patients and 19 healthy volunteers participated in the study. High resolution respirometry (HRR) was used for analysis of platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics. CoQ10 was determined by HPLC method; TBARS were detected spectrophotometrically.Slight dysfunction in platelet mitochondrial respiration and reduced platelet CoQ10 levels were observed in RA patients compared with normal controls.The observed decrease in platelet CoQ10 levels may lead to platelet mitochondrial dysfunction in RA diseases. Determination of platelet mitochondrial function and platelet CoQ10 levels could be used as new diagnostic strategies for mitochondrial bioenergetics in rheumatoid diseases."

However, the effective substances and possible mechanisms of DO are still unclear. In this study, network pharmacology and molecular docking were used toelucidate the effective substances and active mechanisms of DO in treating ischemic stroke (IS). 544 DO-related targets from 29 bioactive components and 344 IS-related targets were collected, among them, 71 overlapping common targets were got. Enrichment analysis showed that 12 components were the possible bioactive components in DO, which regulating 9 important signaling pathways in 3 biological processes including 'oxidative stress' (KEGG:04151, KEGG:04068, KEGG:04915), 'inflammatory response'(KEGG:04668, KEGG:04064) and 'vascular endothelial function regulation'(KEGG:04066, KEGG:04370). Among these, 5 bioactive components with degree≥20 among the 12 potential bioactive components were selected to be docked with the top5 core targets using AutodockVina software. According to the results of molecular docking, the binding sites of core target protein AKT1 and MOL002974, MOL002975, and MOL002914 were 9, 8, and 6, respectively, and they contained 2, 1, and 0 threonine residues, respectively. And some binding sites were consistent, which may be the reason for the similarities and differences between the docking results of the 3 core bioactive components. The results of in vitro experiments showed that OGD/R could inhibit cell survival and AKT phosphorylation which were reversed by the 3 core bioactive components. Among them, MOL002974 (butein) had a slightly better effect. Therefore, the protective effect of MOL002974 (butein) against cerebral ischemia was further evaluated in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by detecting neurological score, cerebral infarction volume and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. The results indicated that MOL002974 (butein) could significantly improve the neurological score of rats, decrease cerebral infarction volume, and inhibit the level of LDH in the cerebral tissue and serum in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, network pharmacology and molecular docking predicate the possible effective substances and mechanisms of DO in treating IS. And the results are verified by the in vitro and in vivo experiments. This research reveals the possible effective substances from DO and its active mechanisms for treating IS and provides a new direction for the secondary development of DO for treating IS."
https://openalex.org/W3204422153,"The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC 656 is a potential host strain for industrial protein production. Heterologous proteins are often retained intracellularly in yeast resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and poor secretion, and despite efforts to engineer protein secretory pathways, heterologous protein production is often lower than expected. We hypothesized that activation of genes involved in the secretory pathway could mitigate ER stress. In this study, we created mutants defective in protein secretory-related functions using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) tools. Secretion of the model protein xylanase was significantly decreased in loss of function mutants for oxidative stress ( sod1 Δ) and vacuolar and protein sorting ( vps1 Δ and ypt7 Δ) genes. However, xylanase secretion was unaffected in an autophagy related atg12 Δ mutant. Then, we developed a system for sequence-specific activation of target gene expression (CRISPRa) in O . thermomethanolica and used it to activate SOD1 , VPS1 and YPT7 genes. Production of both non-glycosylated xylanase and glycosylated phytase was enhanced in the gene activated mutants, demonstrating that CRISPR-Cas9 systems can be used as tools for understanding O . thermomethanolica genes involved in protein secretion, which could be applied for increasing heterologous protein secretion in this yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2497271165,"Movement of the visual environment presented through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to invoke postural adjustments measured by increased body sway. The effect of auditory information on body sway seems to be dependent on context with sounds such as white noise, tones, and music being used to amplify or suppress sway. This study aims to show that music manipulated to match VR motion further increases body sway. Twenty-eight subjects stood on a force plate and experienced combinations of 3 visual conditions (VR translation in the AP direction at 0.1 Hz, no translation, and eyes closed) and 4 music conditions (Mozart’s Jupiter Symphony modified to scale volume at 0.1 Hz and 0.25 Hz, unmodified music, and no music) Body sway was assessed by measuring center of pressure (COP) velocities and RMS. Cross-coherence between the body sway and the 0.1 Hz and 0.25 Hz stimuli was also determined. VR translations at 0.1 Hz matched with 0.1Hz shifts in music volume did not lead to more body sway than observed in the no music and unmodified music conditions. Researchers and clinicians may consider manipulating sound to enhance VR induced body sway, but findings from this study would not suggest using volume to do so."

The single and periodic peakons are investigated by studying the stability analysis of the gDP equation. The novel compacton solutions to the equations under consideration are derived in the form of Weierstrass elliptic function. Also, the periodicity of these solutions is obtained. The cnoidal wave solutions are obtained in the form of Jacobi elliptic functions. Moreover, both soliton and trigonometric solutions are covered as a special case for the cnoidal wave solutions.

The attitude of nurses toward the end of life can affect EOL care, but there are few SDM-related clinical learning programs focused on EOL. In this study, therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of an EOL-simulation education program on attitudes toward SDM among nurses, using an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Methods We used a quasi-experimental study design to evaluate nurses working at a medical center in Taiwan. We recruited 100 nurses and assigned them to an experimental group (n = 50) and a control group (n = 50). The experimental group received the SDM attitude (SDMA) cultivation program, and the control group did not. After the intervention, all participants were examined in an OSCE to assess the efficacy of their learning. A p value of.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The average score of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group in the dimensions “empathic communication” and “mastery learning”, but these differences were not significant. SDMA score is significantly and positively correlated with SDMA global score, standardized patient survey (SPS) score, and SPS global score (r = .92, .56, and .50, respectively; p &lt; .01). Conclusions Simulations concerning EOL care that incorporate SDM components would be effective for training clinical nurses. This study can serve as a reference for nursing-administration managers who may consider designing SDM-related education programs to improve the quality of clinical nursing care."
https://openalex.org/W3202528411,"Introduction The global effort to eradicate malaria requires a drastic measure to terminate relapse from hypnozoites as well as transmission via gametocytes in malaria-endemic areas. Primaquine has been recommended for the treatment of P . falciparum gametocytes and P . vivax hypnozoites, however, its implementation is challenged by the high prevalence of G6PD deficient (G6PDd) genotypes in malaria endemic countries. The objective of this study was to profile G6PDd genotypic variants and correlate them with malaria prevalence in Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional survey of G6PDd genotypic variants was conducted amongst suspected malaria patients attending health care facilities across the entire country. Malaria was diagnosed using microscopy whilst G6PD deficiency was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphisms at position 376 and 202 of the G6PD gene. The results were analysed using GraphPad prism. Results A total of 6108 subjects were enrolled in the study with females representing 65.59% of the population. The overall prevalence of malaria was 36.31%, with malaria prevalence among G6PDd genotypic variants were 0.07% for A-A- homozygous deficient females, 1.31% and 3.03% for AA- and BA- heterozygous deficient females respectively and 2.03% for A- hemizygous deficient males. The odd ratio (OR) for detecting P . falciparum malaria infection in the A-A- genotypic variant was 0.0784 (95% CI: 0.0265–0.2319, p&lt;0.0001). Also, P . malariae and P . ovale parasites frequently were observed in G6PD B variants relative to G6PD A- variants. Conclusion G6PDd genotypic variants, A-A-, AA- and A- protect against P . falciparum , P . ovale and P . malariae infection in Ghana."

In cancer cell lines and in stimulated thymocytes, phosphorylation of Nur77 induces exit from the nucleus and transfer to the mitochondria, where it promotes apoptosis by associating with Bcl-2 (15Thompson J. Winoto A. During negative selection, Nur77 family proteins translocate to mitochondria where they associate with Bcl-2 and expose its proapoptotic BH3 domain.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nur77 has been associated with mixed roles in oncogenesis. In blood-derived tumors (i.e., leukemia and in lymphoma), Nur77 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor influencing key cellular processes such as inflammation and apoptosis (16Woronicz J.D.

In addition, murine deletion of the genes encoding for Nur77 and its homolog NR4A3 led to acute myeloid leukemia development (18Mullican S.E. Zhang S. Konopleva M. Ruvolo V. Andreeff M. Milbrandt J.

Conversely, in several solid tumors (i.e., breast, colon, kidney, melanoma, and pancreas), it is overexpressed, and it acts as pro-oncogene promoting cell proliferation, survival, and migration/invasion while its inactivation by antagonists binding has shown to reduce tumor growth and survival (19Wu H.

The molecular mechanisms that modulate Nur77 transcriptional activity remain poorly defined. In the present study, we aimed to define the in vivo distribution of active versus inactive Nur77. Surprisingly, we find that Nur77 is transcriptionally inactive in reporter assays in vivo in hematopoietic cells under basal conditions, but that transcriptional activation is induced by G-CSF. We show that cytokine-dependent transcriptional activation of Nur77 requires JAK and mTor signaling, and we identify a series of serine residues required for this activation in primary mouse hematopoietic cells, suggesting that intracellular signaling networks may modify Nur77 activity via posttranslational modification. We evaluated the expression of nuclear receptors in human AML bone marrow samples and noted that NUR77 is one of the highest expressed nuclear receptors (Fig. S1A) (23Ley T.J. Miller C. Ding L. Raphael B.J. Mungall A.J. Robertson A. Hoadley K. Triche Jr., T.J. Laird P.W. Baty J.D. Fulton L.L. Fulton R. Heath S.E.

Med. 2013; 368: 2059-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar). In addition, during human hematopoietic maturation, NUR77 undergoes differential expression, with high expression in CD34+ stem/progenitor cells and low expression in promyelocytes, neutrophils, T-cells, and B-cells, but retained expression in monocytes (Fig. S1B). Similar patterns of expression could be observed in mouse hematopoietic cells, with expression in stem cells, reduced expression in progenitor cells, and the re-expression during neutrophil and monocyte maturation (Fig. S1, C–E) (24Wartman L.D.

These patterns of differential expression across different hematopoietic cell types suggest that NUR77 may contribute to hematopoietic function and phenotypes in different hematopoietic cell types. To determine whether Nur77 activity might be transcriptionally active versus inactive in different cell types in vivo, we used a previously characterized in vivo nuclear receptor reporter assay using UAS-GFP transgenic mice (3Niu H. Fujiwara H. di Martino O. Hadwiger G. Frederick T.E. Menendez-Gutierrez M.P. Ricote M. Bowman G.R. Welch J.S. Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells.Sci. Signal. 2017; 10eaan1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Niu H. Chacko J. Hadwiger G. Welch J.S. Absence of natural intracellular retinoids in mouse bone marrow cells and implications for PML-RARA transformation.Blood Cancer J. 2015; 5e284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, UAS promoter sequences are recognized by the yeast Gal4 transcription factor and are not activated by mammalian proteins. We generated a retrovirus expressing the recombinant protein Gal4-Nur77 where the modular Gal4 DBD (Gal4-DBD) is fused to the Nur77 LBD (Nur77-LBD) (MSCV-Flag-Gal4 DBD-Nur77 LBD-IRES-mCherry). UAS-GFP bone marrow Kit+ cells were transduced with Gal4-Nur77 and then transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice (Schema Fig. 1A). Using this system, the reporter specifically responds when intracellular ligands or other stimuli are present that enable transactivation by Nur77-LBD. Six weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were sacrificed and bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen, thymus, and peritoneal macrophages were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. We did not observe GFP+mCherry+ cells in any of these five tissue types, suggesting that under basal conditions, Nur77 may be transcriptionally inactive (or potentially repressive) in hematopoietic cells in vivo (Fig. 1B with summary data in Fig. 1G). We evaluated the effect of hematopoietic stress on Nur77 transcriptional activity in vivo. We treated transplanted mice (UAS-GFP x Gal4-Nur77) with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce granulopoiesis, phenylhydrazine (PHZ) to induce hemolytic anemia, and subsequent erythropoiesis or 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to induce myeloablation and subsequent stem/progenitor expansion. We further evaluated a myeloid malignant stressor, the engraftment of MLL-AF9 leukemia cells (27Di Martino O. Niu H. Hadwiger G. Kuusanmaki H. Ferris M.A. Vu A. Beales J. Wagner C. Menendez-Gutierrez M.P. Ricote M. Heckman C. Welch J.S. Endogenous and combination retinoids are active in myelomonocytic leukemias.Haematologica. 2021; 106: 1008-1021PubMed Google Scholar). Following these stressors, the mice were sacrificed and reporter activity compared with the mice engrafted under basal conditions. We observed an increase in the proportion of GFP+mCherry+ cells in total bone marrow cells following G-CSF treatment, but not following treatment with other stressors (Fig. 1, C–F and H). Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity was not uniform across all cell types following G-CSF treatment, and GFP+mCherry+ cells were enriched in Gr1+CD11b+, CD71+Ter119+, and CD71+Ter119-cells (Fig. 1I). Thus, Gal4-Nur77 appears to be broadly transcriptionally inactive in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells under basal conditions, but it becomes transcriptionally active during G-CSF-induced granulopoiesis. We assessed the effect of G-CSF on Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity in vitro using UAS-GFP BM Kit+ cells transduced with Gal4-Nur77. UAS-GFP BM Kit+ cells were grown in two different cytokine cocktails: a minimal media containing only stem cell factor (SCF) and in a supplemented transplant media (TM) containing SCF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), thrombopoietin (TPO), and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3). We observed that Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity was augmented by G-CSF under both conditions and that basal reporter activity was greater in the cytokines-enriched TM compared with minimal media (Fig. 2A). To determine whether a particular cytokine was responsible for reporter transactivation by Gal4-Nur77, UAS-GFP BM Kit+ cells were transduced with Gal4-Nur77, cultured in minimal media, and exposed to individual cytokines (IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand-RANKL, erythropoietin-EPO, FLT3L and TPO). Complete TM and G-CSF were used as positive controls. In addition to G-CSF, we found that IL-3 augmented Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity (Fig. 2B). Both G-CSF and IL-3 are activators of the Janus Kinase (JAK)-Signal Transducers and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and regulate hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation (28Furumoto Y. Gadina M. The arrival of JAK inhibitors: Advancing the treatment of immune and hematologic disorders.BioDrugs. 2013; 27: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The JAK family is composed of four members (JAK1, 2, 3, and TYK2) with differential association with specific cytokine receptors (29Babon J.J. Lucet I.S. Murphy J.M. Nicola N.A. Varghese L.N. The molecular regulation of Janus kinase (JAK) activation.Biochem. J. 2014; 462: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To assess whether G-CSF and IL-3 regulation of Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity involve overlapping JAK signaling, JAK inhibitors were administrated to UAS-GFP BM Kit+ cells. Ruxolitinib (iJAK1/2), baricitinib (iJAK1/2), and INCB039110 (iJAK1) inhibited IL-3 and G-CSF mediated reporter transactivation by Gal4-Nur77 (Fig. 2C), whereas CP690550 (iJAK3) was not effective. Thus, in hematopoietic cells, Gal4-Nur77 transcriptional activity is regulated via IL-3, in addition to G-CSF, and depends on signaling through JAK1 and/or JAK2. We evaluated whether specific posttranslational modification sites were necessary for Gal4-Nur77 transcriptional activity. We generated a series of mutations in the Nur77 LBD at sites previously implicated in Nur77 posttranslational modification. These included: S351, which can be phosphorylated by Akt and is crucial for Nur77 tumor suppression activity (30Davis I.J. Hazel T.G. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Lau L.F.

Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and K577A, which alters a canonical SUMOylation consensus motif within the LBD (34Volakakis N. Malewicz M. Kadkhodai B. Perlmann T. Benoit G. Characterization of the Nurr1 ligand-binding domain co-activator interaction surface.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 37: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, we generated the phosphorylation mutant S495A based on its strategic position within the structure of Nur77 LBD, and two deletion mutants of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) domain (S550∗ and D589∗). The protein expression of the mutants was verified on Western blot (Fig. S2A). UAS-GFP BM Kit+ cells were again transduced with Gal4-Nur77, and transcriptional activation was evaluated after culture in TM for 24 h with and without G-CSF treatment by the percentage of mCherry+GFP+ cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, UAS-GFP bone marrow cells transformed with MLL-AF9 (which maintain a monocytic morphology) retrovirus can be cultured ex vivo in media containing IL-3. These cells are highly dependent on IL-3 for growth and survival and exhibited consistent reporter transactivation by Gal4-Nur77 under ex vivo conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). In both cellular contexts, S495A augmented Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity, and both AF2 deletions abrogated Nur77 reporter activity. S533A was hyperactive, and S351A, L449W, S553A, and K577A did not result in significant differences compared with wild-type Gal4-Nur77 in either cell context. We assessed the effect of JAK inhibitors on the activity of Gal4-Nur77 LBD WT, S351A, S495A, K577A, and D589∗ mutations in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. Ruxolitinib and baricitinib were again effective at reducing the reporter activity, with greater effect on the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of GFP than the proportion of GFP+ cells, as might be expected in a system with high basal GFP expression (Fig. S2, B–F). This inhibition was observed with S351A, S495A, and K577A mutations (Fig. S2, C–E), and activity was again absent with D589∗ (Fig. S2F). Thus, the AF2 domain appears necessary for Gal4-Nur77 transactivation, and S495 and S533 both augment Gal4-Nur77 activity, but it retains sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. In addition, we performed a nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation in MLL-AF9 cells expressing Gal4-Nur77 to determine if JAK inhibitors sensitivity could be caused by a shift in Gal4-Nur77 reporter cellular localization. We observed that Gal4-Nur77 47 kDa band was present in both the nucleus and cytosol, while the presence of additional Gal4-Nur77 33 kDa and 20 kDa truncated bands were nuclear exclusive. JAK inhibitors administration did not alter the baseline patterns of cytosolic and nuclear localization (Fig. S2G). We examined variant distribution within the human population as represented in the gnomAD database (gnomad.broadinstitute.org). Within Nur77 (P22736), there are 69 serines, 18 of which are found in the LBD. However, of the 346 reported variants involving serine residues, only 12 occur within the LBD (p < 0.001) (S380P: 1; S454L: 3; S498G: 6; S546T: 2). Likewise, of 27 total lysine residues, 11 are found in the LBD but only 32 of 414 variant lysine alleles are found in LBD lysines (p < 0.001). This suggests that additional LBD serine and lysine positions may be biologically relevant and preferentially conserved. We examined the structure of the Nur77 LBD (PDB 2QW4) and defined three clusters of external-facing possible posttranslational modification sites: cluster 1 (S367, S375, S378, S385, and S466), cluster 2 (K381, K386, K397, K456, and K361), and cluster 3 (S485, S492, S495, S550, and S553) (Fig. 4A, clusters 1 and 3 represent serine residues along two different shared surfaces, and cluster 2 was a combination of externally facing lysines). Expected expression and retained nuclear/cytoplasmic localization patterns of each cluster mutant were verified on Western blot (Fig. S3, A and B). The cluster mutants were transduced in UAS-GFP MLL-AF9 cells and the transcriptional activation was evaluated at 24 h by the percentage of mCherry+GFP+ cells. Cluster 1 and 3 mutants abrogated transactivation by the Gal4-Nur77 reporter in both MLL-AF9 cells and in Kit+ bone marrow cells, whereas cluster 2 retained some activity (Figs. 4B and S3C). To define which specific residues within clusters 1 and 3 were responsible for Gal4-Nur77 transcriptional activity, we generated a series of single and combination mutants, and protein expression of these mutants was verified on Western blot (Fig. S3, D and E). These mutants were transduced in UAS-GFP BM Kit+ and UAS-GFP MLL-AF9 cells, and the transcriptional activation was evaluated at 24 h by the percentage of mCherry+GFP+ cells. Cluster 1 was fractionated into seven different vectors (S367A, S375A, S378A, S385A, S466A, S385A/S466A, and S378A/S385A/S466A). Although S367A and S375A inhibited transactivation in Kit+ cells, they had little effect in MLL-AF9 cells. In both contexts, S378A, S385A, S466A, and S378A/S385A/S466A decreased reporter transactivation, and S385A/S466A abrogated activity, suggesting a role for these two phosphorylation sites within the Nur77-LBD (Fig. 4, C and D). Cluster 3 was deconvoluted using five different vectors (S492A/S495A, S550A/S553A, S550A, S492A, and S485A). All the mutants from cluster 3 displayed reduced reporter transactivation in both cell types, and no single mutation completely abrogated Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity (Fig. 4, E and F). To determine whether and which specific kinases might be involved in cytokine signal transduction that regulate Gal4-Nur77 activity, we performed a screening assay using a library of 436 kinase inhibitors. Compounds were organized by principle pathways. We again noted effects by broad JAK inhibitors, with limited effects observed among compounds with weak JAK2 activity and no effects in JAK3 specific inhibitors (Fig. 5A). The MLL-AF9 leukemia cells are highly dependent on IL-3, and it is not surprising that viability declined to some extent among compounds in this class. However, in this assay, reduced cell viability was not synonymous with reduced reporter activity, as diverse inhibitors of Aurora, polo-like, Rho, and ROCK kinases lead to reduced cell viability without reduced GFP output (Fig. 5B). Multiple inhibitors of the mTor pathway inhibited reporter activity (Fig. 5C). PI3K and ATR inhibitors also were active, although generally, these were compounds with cross-inhibitory effects on mTor and not compounds with ATR specificity (Fig. 5D). The multikinase inhibitor R406 and its prodrug fostamatinib were both active, whereas ERK, JNK, and MEK inhibition showed minimal effects (Fig. 5, E and F). Inhibition of other pathways did not inhibit Gal4-Nur77 reporter activity (ABL, ALK, ATM, BTK, CDK, EGFR/HER2, FAK, IGFR/PDGFR, Kit/Mek, NFkB, TGFb, VEGFR, Figs. S4, A–F and S5, A–F). Thus, multiple kinases and pathways of kinases appear to intersect with cytokine-induced signal transactivation of Gal4-Nur77. To identify proteins that bind to and might modify Nur77 to induce cytokine-dependent Nur77 activity, we used proximity labeling. A promiscuous biotin ligase (TurboID) was fused to Gal4-Nur77 to enable biotinylation of proximal proteins (∼10 nm, schema Fig. 6A) (35Branon T.C. Bosch J.A. Sanchez A.D. Udeshi N.D. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Feldman J.L. Perrimon N. Ting A.Y. Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The TurboID-Gal4-Nur77 fusion was transduced into UGN x MLL-AF9 leukemia cells and GFP+ cells were sorted and expanded. These cells were then treated with ruxolitinib versus control and excess biotin was added. After 16 h of incubation, biotinylated proteins were captured by streptavidin-based affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (Fig. 6A). An aliquot of biotinylated proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting to confirm their usability for subsequent MS analysis (Fig. S6A). Cells expressing TurboID-IRES-mCherry were compared to identify nonspecific biotinylation, and the peptide counts from these samples were subtracted as background from the TurboID-Gal4-Nur77 samples. We examined the reproducibility of the data and found h"

However, their genetic diversity and population structure have been less studied, especially at the genome-wide level. In the present study, we employed the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing for identifying genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among five breeds of sheep distributed in Sichuan, including three local pure breeds, one composite breed, and one exotic breed of White Suffolk. From 494 million clean paired-end reads, we obtained a total of 327,845 high-quality SNPs that were evenly distributed among all 27 chromosomes, with a transition/transversion ratio of 2.56. Based on this SNP panel, we found that the overall nucleotide diversity was 0.2284 for all five breeds, with the highest and lowest diversity observed in Mage sheep (0.2125) and Butuo Black (0.1963) sheep, respectively. Both Wright’s fixation index and Identity-by-State distance revealed that all individuals of Liangshan Semifine-wool, White Suffolk, and Butuo Black sheep were respectively clustered together, and the breeds could be separated from each other, whereas Jialuo and Mage sheep had the closest genetic relationship and could not be distinguished from each other. In conclusion, we provide a reference panel of genome-wide and high-quality SNPs in five sheep breeds in Sichuan, by which their genetic diversity and population structures were investigated."

This study aimed to explore the physical preparation practices of senior elite (SEB) and senior development (SDB) amateur boxers, and to determine whether these practices were discriminated by competitor level. One hundred and one amateur boxers (SEB n = 59, SDB n = 42) were surveyed on their understanding, perceptions and application of physical training, monitoring, and testing practices. SEB were associated with strength/power training (SEB 78%, SDB 50%, P = 0.005), monitor of training intensities (SEB 68%, SDB 40%, P = 0.006), and performing regular fitness testing (SEB 76%, SDB 50%, P = 0.006), compared to SDB. Likewise, SEB were twice as likely (56%) to have their physical preparation managed by a strength and conditioning (S&amp;C) coach or sport scientist, compared to SDB (26%; P = 0.005). For the first time, these data demonstrate the extent to which competitor level is associated with preparatory practices in amateur boxing. Cost was identified as the main barrier in implementing several forms of scientific support in SDB. These data serve as a framework to enhance preparatory practices across different competitor levels in amateur boxing. This might include boxer and coach education on the benefits to a more scientific approach, and the use of cost-effective methods to develop, monitor and assess amateur boxers physical performance. This may be of particular importance where boxers are not funded, such as the SDB in the current study. However, this work may also be used to emphasise the importance of strength/power training, physical fitness testing and monitoring at the elite level of amateur boxing."
https://openalex.org/W3203168241,"In his seminal work, Mark Granovetter (1973) challenged sociologists to test sociometric hypotheses regarding collective action in communitarian settings. In this article, we tested the two main hypotheses which consider social cohesion in communitarian urban settings–these being firstly cohesion by weak ties and secondly cohesion by multiplex ties. We studied the elite leaders of two slum communities of Belo Horizonte (Brazil). Three social processes were examined as multiplex interactions: recognized status, exchange of useful information and collaboration. Our findings reveal, on the one hand, that multiplexity is associated with the frequency of ties and, on the other, that reciprocity and shared domains of performance fuel such strong multiplexity. If we assume that elite connections conform to a high order structure, our findings, in contrast to previously well-established hypotheses, reveal a segmented social order in which multiplexity does not mean the overlapping of social circles. On the contrary, multiplexed social exchanges are restricted to specialized domains."

The multitasking competency includes ability to appropriately prioritize and implement tasks for different patients who present simultaneously. Methods We designed three single task stations with different levels of difficulty and priority. These skill stations were then combined to create a multitasking simulation scenario. Skill checklists and the global rating scale were utilized to assess the participants’ performance. A multitasking score, multitasking index, and priority score were developed to measure the multitasking ability of participants. Results Thirty-three first-year postgraduate physicians were recruited for this prospective study. The total performance scores were significantly higher for the single-tasking stations than for the multitasking scenario. In terms of the time needed to complete the tasks, the participants spent more time on the multitasking scenario than on the single-tasking scenario. There were significant correlations between the global rating scale and the multitasking score (rho = 0.693, p &lt; 0.001) and between the global rating scale and the multitasking index (rho = 0.515, p &lt; 0.001). The multitasking score, multitasking index, and priority score did not have any significant correlations with the total single-tasking score. Conclusion We demonstrated that the use of a simulated multitasking scenario could be an effective method of assessing multitasking ability and allow assessors to offer better quality feedback."

They are considered Class II medical devices by the US FDA and are cleared but not approved before marketing. While compatibility tests are conducted by CSTD manufacturers, the procuring institution needs to consider performing its own studies before buying these devices. Herein we tested the compatibility of the components of the Needleless ® DualGuard CSTD system (vial access clips, vial access spikes, and administration adaptors) with 10 antineoplastic drugs, under simulated clinical conditions, including compounding and administration, and examined drug potency maintenance, plasticizer migration, and device functionality. All drugs maintained potency within 5%. Diisononyl phthalate leakage was observed from the administration adaptors for paclitaxel and concentrated etoposide solution. In addition, white particles were discovered in CSTDs storing busulfan solution and small cracks were observed on devices which stored melphalan. Thus, it was concluded that even in simulated clinical conditions, instead of extreme conditions, there are still concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of CSTD components. The methodology may be used to implement and detect possible interactions between antineoplastic agents and CSTD components before procurement."

We investigated how water quality could be improved by utilizing water boiling, activated carbon and sodium bicarbonate additives, as well as electrolysis methods. The results show that heating is effective at lower temperatures rather than long boils, as none of the boiling tests were lower than the original value. Activated carbon is unable to lower TDS, because it is unable to bind to any impurities present in the water. This resulted in an overall TDS increase of 3.5%. However, adding small amounts of sodium bicarbonate(NaHCO 3 ) will further eliminate water hardness by reacting with magnesium ions and improve taste, while increasing the pH. When added to room temperature tap water, there is a continuous increase in TDS of 24.8% at the 30 mg/L mark. The new findings presented in this study showed that electrolysis was the most successful method in eliminating TDS, showing an inverse proportion where an increasing electrical current and duration of electrical lowers more amounts of solids. This method created a maximum decrease in TDS by a maximum of 22.7%, with 3 tests resulting in 15.3–16.6% decreases. Furthermore, when water is heated to a temperature around 50°C (122°F), a decrease in TDS of around 16% was also shown. The reduction of these solids will help lower water hardness and improve the taste of tap water. These results will help direct residents to drink more tap water rather than bottled water with similar taste and health benefits for a cheaper price as well as a reduction on plastic usage."
https://openalex.org/W3203830408,"Genes from the Grainyhead-like ( GRHL ) family code for transcription factors necessary for the development and maintenance of various epithelia. These genes are also very important in the development of many types of cancer. However, little is known about the regulation of expression of GRHL genes. Previously, there were no systematic analyses of the promoters of GRHL genes or transcription factors that bind to these promoters. Here we report that the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and the paired box 5 factor (PAX5) bind to the regulatory regions of the GRHL genes and regulate their expression. Ectopic expression of KLF4 or PAX5 alters the expression of GRHL genes. In KLF4-overexpressing HEK293 cells, the expression of GRHL1 and GRHL3 genes was upregulated by 32% and 60%, respectively, whereas the mRNA level of GRHL2 gene was lowered by 28% when compared to the respective controls. The levels of GRHL1 and GRHL3 expression were decreased by 30% or 33% in PAX5-overexpressing HEK293 cells. The presence of minor frequency allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs115898376 in the promoter of the GRHL1 gene affected the binding of KLF4 to this site. The evidence presented here suggests an important role of KLF4 and PAX5 in the regulation of expression of GRHL1-3 genes."
https://openalex.org/W3204724180,"Debate persists over whether animals develop innovative solutions primarily in response to needs or conversely whether they innovate more when basic needs are covered and opportunity to develop novel behaviour is offered. We sourced 746 cases of “unusual” behaviour in equids by contacting equid owners and caretakers directly and via a website ( https://innovative-behaviour.org ), and by searching the internet platforms YouTube and Facebook for videos. The study investigated whether differences in need or opportunity for innovation were reflected in the numbers of different types of innovations and in the frequencies of repeating a once-innovative behaviour (i) with respect to the equids’ sex, age, and breed type, (ii) across behavioural categories, and whether (iii) they were affected by the equids’ management (single vs group housing, access to roughage feed, access to pasture, and social contact). We found that the numbers of different types of innovation and the frequency of displaying specific innovations were not affected by individual characteristics (sex, age, breed or equid species). Few types of innovation in escape and foraging contexts were observed, whilst the comfort, play, and social contexts elicited the greatest variety of innovations. We also found higher numbers of different types of innovations in horses kept in groups rather than in individual housing, and with unlimited rather than with restricted access to pasture and roughage. Equids in permanent social contact performed high rates of once-innovative behaviour. We suggest that equids produce goal-directed innovations and repeat the behaviour at high frequency in response to urgent needs for food and free movement or when kept in conditions with social conflict. However, equids devise the greatest variety of innovations when opportunity to play and to develop comfort behaviour arises and when kept in good conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3202101707,"Individuals increasingly participate in online platforms where they copy, share and form they opinions. Social interactions in these platforms are mediated by digital institutions, which dictate algorithms that in turn affect how users form and evolve their opinions. In this work, we examine the conditions under which convergence on shared opinions can be obtained in a social network where connected agents repeatedly update their normalised cardinal preferences (i.e. value systems) under the influence of a non-constant reflexive signal (i.e. institution) that aggregates populations’ information using a proportional representation rule. We analyse the impact of institutions that aggregate (i) expressed opinions (i.e. opinion-aggregation institutions), and (ii) cardinal preferences (i.e. value-aggregation institutions). We find that, in certain regions of the parameter space, moderate institutional influence can lead to moderate consensus and strong institutional influence can lead to polarisation. In our randomised network, local coordination alone in the total absence of institutions does not lead to convergence on shared opinions, but very low levels of institutional influence are sufficient to generate a feedback loop that favours global conventions. We also show that opinion-aggregation may act as a catalyst for value change and convergence. When applied to digital institutions, we show that the best mechanism to avoid extremism is to increase the initial diversity of the value systems in the population."
https://openalex.org/W3204488250,"Introduction The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey measures patients’ satisfaction of their hospital experience. A minority of discharged patients return the survey. Underlying bias among who ultimately returns the survey (non-response bias) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may affect results of the survey. Thus, the objective of the current study is to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes on HCAHPS survey nonresponse. Methods All adult patients at a single institution undergoing inpatient, elective, primary TKA between February 2013 and May 2020 were selected for analysis. Following discharge, all patients had been mailed the HCAHPS survey. The primary outcome analyzed in the current study is survey return. Patient characteristics, surgical variables, and 30-day postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with return of the HCAHPS survey. Results Of 4,804 TKA patients identified, 1,498 (31.22%) returned HCAHPS surveys. On multivariate regression analyses controlling for patient factors, patients who did not return the survey were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesia score (ASA score of 4 or higher, OR = 2.37; P&lt;0.001), and be partially or totally dependent (OR = 2.37; P = 0.037). Similarly, patients who did not return the survey were more likely to have had a readmission (OR = 1.94; P&lt;0.001), be discharged to a place other than home (OR = 1.52; P&lt;0.001), or stay in the hospital for longer than 3 days (OR = 1.43; P = 0.004). Discussion Following TKA, HCAHPS survey response rate was only 31.22% and completion of the survey was associated with several demographic and postoperative variables. These findings suggest that HCAHPS survey results capture a non-representative fraction of the true TKA patient population. This bias is necessary to consider when using HCAHPS survey results as a metric for quality of healthcare and federal reimbursement rates."

To compare these measurable short-time outcomes of open and laparoscopic resections in Hungary, data of colorectal surgeries were collected and analysed. The study focused on identifying patients’ characteristics that can influence the decision on laparoscopic colorectal resections and on comparing efficiency of Hungarian colorectal operations with international data. Methods Using patients’ data of laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery performed in 2015 and 2016 from the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary, a countrywide retrospective comparative analysis was done. Logistic regression was used to explore main influencing factors for laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Results A total of 17,876 colorectal surgical cases, including 14,876 open and 3,000 laparoscopic resections were selected and analysed. Laparoscopy was used only in 16.78% of all cases. Comparison of age groups showed that odds ratio (OR) of laparoscopic colorectal resections was significantly lower in over 40 years than in younger patients (18–39 years). In university institutes patients had higher odds (OR: 2.23 p&lt;0.0001) for laparoscopic colorectal resections. Presence of comorbidity codes and preoperative treatment in internal medicine department decreased odds for laparoscopic colorectal operations. Conclusions Patients’ age, comorbidities and hospital type influenced the likelihood of decision on laparoscopic colorectal resection. Selection of patients contributed to improved laparoscopic outcomes."
