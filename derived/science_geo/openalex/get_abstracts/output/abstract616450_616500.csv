https://openalex.org/W2886376221,"Microvascular inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). We investigated whether the inflammation biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with clinical characteristics, disease severity or PH in HFpEF.Patients in the Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart failure (RELAX) trial had baseline high-sensitivity CRP levels measured (n = 214). Clinical characteristics, exercise performance, echocardiographic variables and biomarkers of neurohumoral activation, fibrosis and myocardial necrosis were assessed. Patients with normal (≤3mg/L) versus high (>3mg/L) CRP levels were compared.The median CRP level was 3.69mg/L. CRP was elevated in 57% of patients. High CRP levels were associated with younger age, higher body mass index (BMI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower peak oxygen consumption and higher endothelin-1 and aldosterone levels. CRP increased progressively with the number of comorbidities (0.7mg/L per increment in comorbidity number, P = 0.02). Adjusting for age, BMI and statin use, high CRP levels were additionally associated with atrial fibrillation, right ventricular dysfunction, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P<0.05 for all). CRP was not associated with PH or left ventricular function. CRP did not identify responders to sildenafil(P-value for interaction 0.13).In HFpEF, high CRP is associated with greater comorbidity burden and some markers of disease severity but CRP was normal in 40% of patients. These findings support the presence of comorbidity-driven systemic inflammation in HFpEF but also the need to study other biomarkers which may better reflect the presence of systemic inflammation."

Although W LEDs are sometimes used in horticultural lighting fixtures, little research has been published using them for sole-source lighting. We grew seedlings of begonia (Begonia ×semperflorens), geranium (Pelargonium ×horturum), petunia (Petunia ×hybrida), and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) at 20°C under six sole-source LED lighting treatments with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 160 μmol∙m–2∙s–1 using B (peak = 447 nm), green (G, peak = 531 nm), R (peak = 660 nm), and/or mint W (MW, peak = 558 nm) LEDs that emitted 15% B, 59% G, and 26% R plus 6 μmol∙m−2∙s−1 of far-red radiation. The lighting treatments (with percentage from each LED in subscript) were MW100, MW75R25, MW45R55, MW25R75, B15R85, and B20G40R40. At the transplant stage, total leaf area, and fresh and dry weight were similar among treatments in all species. Surprisingly, when petunia seedlings were grown longer (beyond the transplant stage) under sole-source lighting treatments, the primary stem elongated and had flower buds earlier under MW100 and MW75R25 compared to under B15R85. The color rendering index of MW75R25 and MW45R55 were 72, and 77, respectively, which was higher than those of other treatments, which were ≤64. While photosynthetic photon efficacy of B15R85 (2.25 μmol∙J–1) was higher than the W light treatments (1.51−2.13 μmol∙J–1), the dry weight gain per unit electric energy consumption (in g∙kWh–1) of B15R85 was similar to those of MW25R75, MW45R55, and MW75R25 in three species. We conclude that compared to B+R radiation, W radiation had generally similar effects on seedling growth at the same PPFD with similar electric energy consumption, and improved the visual color quality of sole-source lighting."
https://openalex.org/W2886008099,"The transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l2) induces expression of numerous detoxifying and antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress. The cytoplasmic protein Keap1 interacts with and represses Nrf2 function. Computational approaches were developed to identify factors that modulate Nrf2 in a mouse liver gene expression compendium. Forty-eight Nrf2 biomarker genes were identified using profiles from the livers of mice in which Nrf2 was activated genetically in Keap1-null mice or chemically by a potent activator of Nrf2 signaling. The rank-based Running Fisher statistical test was used to determine the correlation between the Nrf2 biomarker genes and a test set of 81 profiles with known Nrf2 activation status demonstrating a balanced accuracy of 96%. For a large number of factors examined in the compendium, we found consistent relationships between activation of Nrf2 and feminization of the liver transcriptome through suppression of the male-specific growth hormone (GH)-regulated transcription factor STAT5b. The livers of female mice exhibited higher Nrf2 activation than male mice in untreated or chemical-treated conditions. In male mice, Nrf2 was activated by treatment with ethinyl estradiol, whereas in female mice, Nrf2 was suppressed by treatment with testosterone. Nrf2 was activated in 5 models of disrupted GH signaling containing mutations in Pit1, Prop1, Ghrh, Ghrhr, and Ghr. Out of 59 chemical treatments that activated Nrf2, 36 exhibited STAT5b suppression in the male liver. The Nrf2-STAT5b coupling was absent in in vitro comparisons of chemical treatments. Treatment of male and female mice with 11 chemicals that induce oxidative stress led to activation of Nrf2 to greater extents in females than males. The enhanced basal and inducible levels of Nrf2 activation in females relative to males provides a molecular explanation for the greater resistance often seen in females vs. males to age-dependent diseases and chemical-induced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2885538325,"Citizen Science (CS) strengthens the relationship between society and science through education and engagement, with win-win benefits. Marine Citizen Science (MCS) is increasingly popular, thanks to society’s growing interest in marine environments and marine issues. Scuba diving significantly increases the potential of MCS, thanks to the skills and behavioural properties of people who participate in the sport. To be able to exploit this potential, however, MCS needs to face challenges related to CS, to scuba diving activities and to the broader scuba diving industry. In particular, engagement and recruitment of potential volunteers, as well as retention of active participants, represent key milestones. In order to reach these milestones, information is required on current participation levels of scuba divers in MCS, as well as the motivations behind participation, and the opinions held by potential participants in MCS. This study explored different case studies and methods of data collection to provide an overview of actual and potential participation in MCS by the scuba diving community. The results show that scuba divers, whether active or potential marine citizen scientists, are well disposed towards MCS. Some barriers, however, prevent the full participation of scuba divers as marine citizen scientists. Certain barriers extend beyond the control of both divers and MCS projects, while others, such as limited access to MCS projects and poor feedback after participation, can and should be addressed. The recommendations of this research provide strategic direction to MCS, so that the broad scuba diving community can be successfully integrated into MCS. These recommendations acknowledge the important role played by stakeholders in the scuba diving industry, as well as professional intermediaries and hired experts."
https://openalex.org/W2887143830,"In many fish species, sperm cryopreservation has deleterious effects and leads to a significant decrease in spermatozoa viability. However, the effect of cryopreservation on sperm cells that survive this process and are still viable is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to compare the viability and proteomes of fresh and cryopreserved sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) sperm samples before and after live-dead cell separation using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Both fresh and cryopreserved sperm samples were divided into two groups (with or without application of Percoll separation). At each step of the experiment, sperm quality was evaluated by video microscopy combined with integrated computer-assisted sperm analysis software and flow cytometry for live-dead sperm viability analysis. Sperm motility and the percentage of live cells were reduced in the cryopreserved group compared to the fresh group from 89% to 33% for percentage of motility and from 96% to 70% for live cells. Straight line velocity and linearity of track were significantly lower in cryopreserved samples than in those separated by Percoll before and after cryopreservation. However, the percentages of motile and live spermatozoa were higher than 90% in samples subjected to Percoll separation. Proteomic analysis of spermatozoa by two-dimensional differences in-gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that 20 protein spot abundances underwent significant changes in cryopreserved samples compared to fresh ones. However, only one protein spot was significantly altered when samples before and after cryopreservation followed by Percoll separation were compared. Thus, the results of this study show that cryopreservation leads to minimal proteomic changes in the spermatozoa population, retaining high motility and viability parameters. The results also suggest that global differences in protein profiles between unselected fresh and cryopreserved samples are mainly due to protein loss or changes in the lethal and sublethal damaged cell subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2885505620,"Hyperurecemia is usually associated with gout and various metabolic arthritis disorders. Limited medications are available to manage such conditions. This study aimed to isolate the triterpenes constituent of the plant and to assess xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory and antihyperuricemic activities of Tribulus arabicus ethanolic extract, its fractions and the isolated compound using in vitro and in vivo approaches.The ethanolic extract, fractions; n-hexane, chloroform and n-butanol and the isolated compound (ursolic acid) were evaluated in vitro for their XO inhibitory activity. Those that demonstrated significant activity were further evaluated for their antihyperuricemic activity on potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemia in mice.The ethanolic extract was found to be safe up to 5000 mg/kg. The extract and its n-hexane fraction exhibited significant inhibitory activity on XO, whilst only a modest reduction in the enzymatic activity was noticed with n-butanol and chloroform fractions. Furthermore, administration of the ethanolic extract at low and high doses significantly reduced serum urate levels in mice by 31.1 and 64.6% respectively. The isolated active constituent, ursolic acid, showed potent XO inhibition activity (Half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 10.3 μg/mL), and significantly reduced uric acid level in vivo by 79.9%. Virtually, the binding mode of ursolic acid with XO was determined using molecular docking simulations.The activity of the ethanolic extract of T. arabicus and its n-hexane fraction can be attributed to the isolated compound, ursolic acid. Ursolic acid has good hypouricemic activity and therefore has high potential to be used for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2887446625,"Functional connectivity (FC) characterizes brain activity from a multivariate set of N brain signals by means of an NxN matrix A, whose elements estimate the dependence within each possible pair of signals. Such matrix can be used as a feature vector for (un)supervised subject classification. Yet if N is large, A is highly dimensional. Little is known on the effect that different strategies to reduce its dimensionality may have on its classification ability. Here, we apply different machine learning algorithms to classify 33 children (age [6-14 years]) into two groups (healthy controls and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder patients) using EEG FC patterns obtained from two phase synchronisation indices. We found that the classification is highly successful (around 95%) if the whole matrix A is taken into account, and the relevant features are selected using machine learning methods. However, if FC algorithms are applied instead to transform A into a lower dimensionality matrix, the classification rate drops to less than 80%. We conclude that, for the purpose of pattern classification, the relevant features should be selected among the elements of A by using appropriate machine learning algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2886243160,"Bone’s resistance to fracture depends on several factors, such as bone mass, microarchitecture, and tissue material properties. The clinical assessment of bone strength is generally performed by Dual-X Ray Photon Absorptiometry (DXA), measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS). Although it is considered the major predictor of bone strength, BMD only accounts for about 70% of fragility fractures, while the remaining 30% could be described by bone “quality” impairment parameters, mainly related to tissue microarchitecture. The assessment of bone microarchitecture generally requires more invasive techniques, which are not applicable in routine clinical practice, or X-Ray based imaging techniques, requiring a longer post-processing. Another important aspect is the presence of local damage in the bony tissue that may also affect the prediction of bone strength and fracture risk. To provide a more comprehensive analysis of bone quality and quantity, and to assess the effect of damage, here we adopt a framework that includes clinical, morphological, and mechanical analyses, carried out by means of DXA, μCT and mechanical compressive testing, respectively. This study has been carried out on trabecular bones, taken from porcine trabecular vertebrae, for the similarity with human lumbar spine. This study confirms that no single method can provide a complete characterization of bone tissue, and the combination of complementary characterization techniques is required for an accurate and exhaustive description of bone status. BMD and TBS have shown to be complementary parameters to assess bone strength, the former assessing the bone quantity and resistance to damage, and the latter the bone quality and the presence of damage accumulation without being able to predict the risk of fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2886973937,"Objective Metabolic syndrome (MetS) or prediabetes is a complex disorder that is defined by a clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors, including obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Among cardiometabolic risk factors, central obesity plays a key role in the development of MetS through alterations in the secretion of adipokines and interacts with other MetS risk factors to unfavorably influence overall cardiometabolic risk. Obesity has grasped epidemic proportions in Asia, which has the highest number of people with diabetes in the world. But, the importance of central obesity in the clustering of all four MetS risk factors or vice versa in predicting severity of MetS has not yet been investigated in Asian population. Therefore, the present study examined the influence of central obesity on circulating levels of adipokines through its interaction with the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors of MetS including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Subjects Blood samples from 83 Hong Kong Chinese adults, who were previously screened for MetS according to the guideline of the United States National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were selected. Insulin and adipokines, including visfatin, chemerin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), resistin, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), leptin and adiponectin were assessed. Results The interacting effect of central obesity with all of the other four MetS risk factors increased the proinflammatory status of adipokines (TNF-α, leptin) and decreased the anti-inflammatory status of adipokine (adiponectin). Conclusion Our results indicate that the inflammatory status of MetS may be more severe in the presence of central obesity. Adipokines, as biomarkers for pathophysiological changes, may help to improve early patient identification and to predict MetS-associated morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2887944641,"High protein intake and reduced levels of the essential pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) have both been independently associated with promotion of the ageing phenotype. However, it has not yet been shown whether these two independent observations are biochemically linked. To investigate this possibility, we used a cross-sectional study design of 100 apparently healthy middle-aged males (n = 48) and females, in which we assessed average dietary intakes of multiple components using a validated questionnaire. We also analysed fasting blood levels of urea, NAD+ and its metabolites, and inflammation-linked biomarkers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), Kynurenine (Kyn), and Tryptophan (Trp). One-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were then performed for statistical analysis. Our results have shown for the first time that plasma levels of NAD+ and Total NAD(H) were lower with increasing protein intake (F (2, 92) = 4.61, P = 0.012; F (2, 92) = 4.55, P = 0.013, respectively). The associated decrease in NAD+ and NAD(H) levels was even stronger with increasing plasma levels of the protein breakdown product urea (F (2, 93) = 25.11, P≤0.001; F (2, 93) = 21.10, P≤0.001). These associations were all independent of age, gender and energy intake. However, no significant association was observed between protein intake or plasma urea, and plasma levels of NAD+ metabolites. We also observed that plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and both Kyn, and Trp, but not the Kyn/Trp ratio were higher with increasing plasma urea levels (F (2, 94) = 3.30, P = 0.041; F (2, 95) = 7.41, P≤0.001; F (2, 96) = 4.23, P = 0.017, respectively). These associations were dependent on eGFR and energy intake, except for the urea and Trp association that was independent of all. In conclusion, we report for the first time, a novel association between protein intake, its metabolism, and plasma NAD+ levels with a possible link to inflammation. These findings provide further insight into how protein restriction may contribute to the anti-ageing process observed in several studies."
https://openalex.org/W2887464961,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from their substrates and, together with ubiquitin ligases, play an important role in the regulation of protein expression. Although transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-Smad signaling is a central pathway of renal fibrosis, the role of DUBs in the expression of TGF-β receptors and Smads during the development of renal fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether PR-619, a pan-DUB inhibitor, suppresses fibrosis in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and TGF-β1-stimulated normal rat kidney (NRK)-49F cells, a rat renal fibroblast cell line. Either the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or PR-619 (100 μg) was intraperitoneally administered to mice after UUO induction once a day for 7 days. Administration of PR-619 attenuated renal fibrosis with downregulation of mesenchymal markers, extracellular matrix proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and the TGF-β1 mRNA level in UUO mice. Although type I TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRI), Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 protein expression levels were markedly increased in mice with UUO, administration of PR-619 suppressed only Smad4 expression but not TGF-βRI, Smad2, or Smad3 expression. PR-619 also had an inhibitory effect on TGF-β1-induced α-smooth muscle actin expression and reduced Smad4 levels in NRK-49F cells. Our results indicate that PR-619 ameliorates renal fibrosis, which is accompanied by the reduction of Smad4 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2886464555,"Insulin is a frequently prescribed drug in hospitals and is usually administered by syringe pumps with an extension line which can be made of various materials. Two insulin solutions were studied: an insulin analogue, Novorapid® which contains insulin aspart and two phenolic preservatives (e.g. phenol and metacresol) and Umuline rapide® with human insulin and metacresol as preservative. Some studies have indicated interactions between insulin, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE). The aim of this work was to study such interactions between Novorapid® or Umuline rapide® and infusion extension line materials (PVC, PE and coextruded (PE/PVC)). Insulin solution at 1 IU/mL was infused at 2 mL/h over 24 hours with 16 different extension lines (8 in PVC, 3 in PE and 5 in PE/PVC). Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography with diode array detection (UFLC-DAD) was performed to quantify insulin (human and aspart) and preservatives (metacresol and phenol). Limited human insulin sorption was observed thirty minutes after the onset of infusion: 24.3 ± 12.9%, 3.1 ± 1.6% and 18.6 ± 10.0% for PVC, PE and PE/PVC respectively. With insulin aspart, sorption of about 5% was observed at the onset of infusion for all materials. However, there were interactions between phenol and especially metacresol with PVC, but no interactions with PE and PE/PVC. This study shows that insulin interacts with PVC, PE and PE/PVC at the onset of infusion. It also demonstrates that insulin preservatives interact with PVC, which may result in problems of insulin conservation and conformation. Some more studies are required to understand the clinical impact of the latter during infusion."
https://openalex.org/W2886867662,"The Mesio-Temporal Lobe Epilepsy syndrome is the most common form of intractable epilepsy. It is characterized by recurrence of focal seizures and is often associated with hippocampal sclerosis and drug resistance. We aimed to characterize the molecular changes occurring during the initial stages of epileptogenesis in search of new therapeutic targets for Mesio-Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. We used a mouse model obtained by intra-hippocampal microinjection of kainate and performed hippocampal whole genome expression analysis at 6h, 12h and 24h post-injection, followed by multilevel bioinformatics analysis. We report significant changes in immune and inflammatory responses, neuronal network reorganization processes and glial functions, predominantly initiated during status epilepticus at 12h and persistent after the end of status epilepticus at 24h post-kainate. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted Cyba, Cybb and Vim as central regulators of multiple overexpressed genes implicated in glial responses at 24h. In silico microRNA analysis indicated that miR-9, miR-19b, miR-129, and miR-223 may regulate the expression of glial-associated genes at 24h. Our data support the hypothesis that glial-mediated inflammatory response holds a key role during epileptogenesis, and that microglial cells may participate in the initial process of epileptogenesis through increased ROS production via the NOX complex."
https://openalex.org/W2951431250,"In the immune system, T cells can quickly discriminate between foreign and self ligands with high accuracy. There is evidence that T-cells achieve this remarkable performance utilizing a network architecture based on a generalization of kinetic proofreading (KPR). KPR-based mechanisms actively consume energy to increase the specificity beyond what is possible in equilibrium.An important theoretical question that arises is to understand the trade-offs and fundamental limits on accuracy, speed, and dissipation (energy consumption) in KPR and its generalization. Here, we revisit this question through numerical simulations where we simultaneously measure the speed, accuracy, and energy consumption of the KPR and adaptive sorting networks for different parameter choices. Our simulations highlight the existence of a 'feasible operating regime' in the speed-energy-accuracy plane where T-cells can quickly differentiate between foreign and self ligands at reasonable energy expenditure. We give general arguments for why we expect this feasible operating regime to be a generic property of all KPR-based biochemical networks and discuss implications for our understanding of the T cell receptor circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2887621203,"To describe Chinese older adults' willingness to enter long-term care facilities and to examine individual factors associated with the willingness of using this growing model of long-term care in China.A cross-sectional study involving a random sample of 670 adults aged 60+ in the Hezuo community in Chengdu, China in 2016. Respondents were interviewed by trained staff on socio-demographics, health status, quality of life, social support, and willingness to enter long-term care facilities.Only 11.9% of the respondents were willing to enter long-term care facilities for meeting their medical and social service needs. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that willingness to enter long-term care facilities was associated with higher household income (OR = 4.55, 95% CI:1.72-12.00), insurance of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (OR = 4.80, 95% CI:1.17-19.67) and unemployment (OR = 0.48, 95% CI:0.24-0.99). Among those who were willing to enter long-term care facilities, an overwhelming majority (81.2%) would prefer going to a facility within 30-minute walking distance from their current residence, 82.5% indicated the need of nursing care, and 90.0% expected a partnership between the long-term care facility and a large hospital.A minority of older Chinese were willing to receive long-term care delivered at a facility within walking distance from their current residence. Recent policy aimed at increasing the supply of long-term care facilities may not be consistent with consumer preference for home and community-based care. Balancing investment between home and community-based care, and establishing long-term care insurance remain the top priorities for long-term care research and policy development in China."
https://openalex.org/W2886307303,"Background Allostatic load has been suggested as a pathway through which experiences become biologically embedded to influence health. Research on childhood predictors of allostatic load has focused on socioeconomic and psychosocial exposures, while few studies include prospective measures of biomedical exposures. Further, findings on sex differences in the association of childhood predictors with various health outcomes related to allostatic load are ambiguous. Aims To examine the influence of early life biomedical and social factors in the first year of life on midlife allostatic load, assessing potential sex differences. Methods This prospective cohort study includes early life information collected at birth and a one year examination for 1,648 members of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort who also participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank study (aged 49–52 years, 56% women). Allostatic load based on 14 biomarkers was selected as a measure of midlife health status. Early life factors were categorized as predominantly biomedical or social, and their associations with midlife allostatic load were examined in domain-specific and combined sex-stratified multiple regression models. Results The biomedical factors model explained 6.6% of the variance in midlife allostatic load in men and 6.7% in women, while the social model explained 4.1% of the variance in men and 7.3% in women. For both sexes, parental socioeconomic position at one year and maternal BMI significantly predicted midlife allostatic load in a model containing all early life factors. For women, additional significant predictors were complications at birth, birth weight and not living with parents at one year. Conclusion The results confirm an association of lower childhood socioeconomic position with higher adult allostatic load while demonstrating the importance of other prenatal and early life exposures and highlighting potential sex differences."
https://openalex.org/W2885291172,"Here we discuss the formation of phyllotactic patterns in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of plants, where the spatial distribution of the phytohormone auxin determines phyllotaxis in a domain that is growing and changing in time. We assume that the concentration of auxin modifies the mechanical properties of the domain and that the mechanical stress field in the SAM orients the flux of auxin. To study this problem we propose a mechanism for pattern formation in growing domains with variable curvature. The dynamics of chemicals is modeled by a reaction-diffusion system that produces a three dimensional pattern of chemical concentrations that changes the stress field in the domain while growing. The growth process is modeled by a phase-field order parameter which determines the location of the boundaries of the domain. This field is coupled to the chemical concentration through a curvature term that affects the local mechanical stress in the domain. The local stress changes in turn modify the chemical patterns. Our model constitutes a useful and novel approach in theoretical biology, as many developmental processes in organisms seem to be affected by the changes of curvature, size, mechanical stress and other physical aspects. Several patterns seen in many plants are reproduced under certain conditions by our model."
https://openalex.org/W2886508785,"Purpose To explore the utility of diffusion and perfusion changes in primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) as an early biomarker of treatment response, using diffusion weighted (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Methods Patients enrolled in a prospective pilot clinical trial received SABR for primary RCC, and had DWI and DCE MRI scheduled at baseline, 14 days and 70 days after SABR. Tumours <5cm diameter received a single fraction of 26 Gy and larger tumours received three fractions of 14 Gy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were computed from DWI data and parametric and pharmacokinetic maps were fitted to the DCE data. Tumour volumes were contoured and statistics extracted. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were computed between MRI parameter changes versus the percentage tumour volume change from CT at 6, 12 and 24 months and the last follow-up relative to baseline CT. Results Twelve patients were eligible for DWI analysis, and a subset of ten patients for DCE MRI analysis. DCE MRI from the second follow-up MRI scan showed correlations between the change in percentage voxels with washout contrast enhancement behaviour and the change in tumour volume (ρ = 0.84, p = 0.004 at 12 month CT, ρ = 0.81, p = 0.02 at 24 month CT, and ρ = 0.89, p = 0.001 at last follow-up CT). The change in mean initial rate of enhancement and mean Ktrans at the second follow-up MRI scan were positively correlated with percent tumour volume change at the 12 month CT onwards (ρ = 0.65, p = 0.05 and ρ = 0.66, p = 0.04 at 12 month CT respectively). Changes in ADC kurtosis from histogram analysis at the first follow-up MRI scan also showed positive correlations with the percentage tumour volume change (ρ = 0.66, p = 0.02 at 12 month CT, ρ = 0.69, p = 0.02 at last follow-up CT), but these results are possibly confounded by inflammation. Conclusion DWI and DCE MRI parameters show potential as early response biomarkers after SABR for primary RCC. Further prospective validation using larger patient cohorts is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2887922953,"Elevated blood pressure presents a global health threat, with rates of hypertension increasing in low and middle-income countries. Lifestyle changes may be an important driver of these increases in blood pressure. Hypertension is particularly prevalent in African countries, though the majority of studies have focused on mainland Africa. We collected demographic and health data from 513 adults living in a community in rural Madagascar. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and attributes related to household composition and lifestyle as predictors of blood pressure and hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort was 49.1% (both sexes combined: N = 513; females: 50.3%, N = 290; males: 47.5%, N = 223). Blood pressure, as well as hypertensive state, was positively associated with age and BMI. Lifestyle and household factors had no significant relationships with blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension was similar to that found in urban centers of other African countries, yet almost double what has been previously found in Madagascar. Future research should investigate the drivers of hypertension in rural communities worldwide, as well as the lifestyle, cultural, and genetic factors that underlie variation in hypertension across space and time."
https://openalex.org/W2885818145,"The mitis group, a member of the genetically diverse viridans group streptococci, predominately colonizes the human oropharynx. This group has been shown to cause a wide range of infectious complications in humans, including bacteremia in patients with neutropenia, orbital cellulitis and infective endocarditis. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been identified as a virulence factor produced by this group of streptococci. More importantly, it has been shown that Streptococcus oralis and S. mitis induce epithelial cell and macrophage death via the production of H2O2. Previously, H2O2 mediated killing was observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in response to S. oralis and S. mitis. The genetically tractable model organism C. elegans is an excellent system to study mechanisms of pathogenicity and stress responses. Using this model, we observed rapid H2O2 mediated killing of the worms by S. gordonii in addition to S. mitis and S. oralis. Furthermore, we observed colonization of the intestine of the worms when exposed to S. gordonii suggesting the involvement of an infection-like process. In response to the H2O2 produced by the mitis group, we demonstrate the oxidative stress response is activated in the worms. The oxidative stress response transcription factor SKN-1 is required for the survival of the worms and provides protection against H2O2 produced by S. gordonii. We show during infection, H2O2 is required for the activation of SKN-1 and is mediated via the p38-MAPK pathway. The activation of the p38 signaling pathway in the presence of S. gordonii is not mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein kinase IRE-1. However, IRE-1 is required for the survival of worms in response to S. gordonii. These finding suggests a parallel pathway senses H2O2 produced by the mitis group and activates the phosphorylation of p38. Additionally, the unfolded protein response plays an important role during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2887366746,"Astrocytes, key regulators of brain homeostasis, interact with neighboring glial cells, neurons and the vasculature through complex processes involving different signaling pathways. It is not entirely clear how these interactions change in the ageing brain and which factors influence astrocyte ageing. Here, we investigate the role of endocannabinoid signaling, because it is an important modulator of neuron and astrocyte functions, as well as brain ageing. We demonstrate that mice with a specific deletion of CB1 receptors on GABAergic neurons (GABA-Cnr1-/- mice), which show a phenotype of accelerated brain ageing, affects age-related changes in the morphology of astrocytes in the hippocampus. Thus, GABA-Cnr1-/- mice showed a much more pronounced age-related and layer-specific increase in GFAP-positive areas in the hippocampus compared to wild-type animals. The number of astrocytes, in contrast, was similar between the two genotypes. Astrocytes in the hippocampus of old GABA-Cnr1-/- mice also showed a different morphology with enhanced GFAP-positive process branching and a less polarized intrahippocampal distribution. Furthermore, astrocytic TNFα levels were higher in GABA-Cnr1-/- mice, indicating that these morphological changes were accompanied by a more pro-inflammatory function. These findings demonstrate that the disruption of endocannabinoid signaling on GABAergic neurons is accompanied by functional changes in astrocyte activity, which are relevant to brain ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2887418913,"Background Cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (CPR) training starting at the age of 12 years is recommended internationally. Training younger children is not recommended because young children lack the physical ability to perform adequate CPR and discouragement to perform CPR later is apprehended. The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: Are younger children discouraged after CPR training? Is discouragement caused by their lack in physical ability to perform adequate chest compressions on a standard manikin and would the use of manikins with a reduced resistance affect their motivation or performance? Methods We investigated the motivation and CPR performance of children aged 8–13 years after CPR training on manikins of different chest stiffness in a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial. 322 children underwent randomization and received 30 minutes CPR training in small groups at school. We used two optically identical resuscitation manikins with different compression resistances of 45kg and 30kg. Motivation was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire. Performance was measured with the Resusci®Anne SkillReporter™. Findings Motivation after the training was generally high and there was no difference between the two groups in any of the questionnaire items on motivation: Children had fun (98 vs. 99%; P = 0.32), were interested in the training (99 vs. 98%; P = 0.65), and were glad to train resuscitation again in the future (89 vs. 91%; P = 0.89). CPR performance was generally poor (median compression score (8, IQR 1–45 and 29, IQR 11–54; P<0.001) and the mean compression depth was lower in the 45kg-resistance than in the 30kg-resistance group (33±10mm vs. 41±9; P<0.001). Conclusions Compression resistances of manikins, though influencing CPR performance, did not discourage 8 to 13 year old children after CPR training. The findings refute the view that young children are discouraged when receiving CPR training even though they are physically not able to perform adequate CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2885113445,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is associated with increased post-procedure morbidity and mortality. Pre-procedure echocardiography (ECHO) is a widely used tool for evaluation of these patients, but its accuracy in predicting post-procedure outcomes is unproven. Self-reported exercise tolerance has not been evaluated for operative risk stratification of PHTN patients. Objective We analyzed whether self-reported exercise tolerance predicts outcomes (hospital length-of-stay [LOS], mortality and morbidity) in PHTN patients (WHO Class I–V) undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Methods and findings We reviewed 550 non-cardiac, non-obstetric procedures performed on 370 PHTN patients at a single institution between 2007 and 2013. All patients had cardiac ECHO documented within 1 year prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure comorbidities and ECHO data were collected. Functional status (< or ≥ 4 metabolic equivalents of task [METs]) was assigned based on responses to standard patient interview questions during the pre-anesthesia clinic visit. Multiple logistic regression was used to develop a risk score model (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Risk Score; PHORS) and determine its value in predicting post-procedure outcomes. In an adjusted model, functional status <4 METs was independently associated with a LOS >7 days (p < .003), as were higher ASA class (p < .002), open surgical approach (p < .002), procedure duration > 2 hours (p < .001), and the absence of systemic hypertension (p = .012). PHORS Score ≥2 was associated with an increased 30-day major complication rate (28.7% vs. 19.2%; p < 0.001) and ICU admission rate (8.6% s 2.8%; p = .007), but no statistical difference in hospital readmissions rate (17.6% vs. 14.0%; p = .29), or mortality (3.5% vs. 1.4%; p = .75). Similar ECHO findings did not further improve outcome prediction. Conclusions Poor functional status is associated with severe PHTN and predicts increased LOS and post-procedure complications in patients with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with different etiologies. A risk assessment model predicts increased LOS with fair accuracy. A thorough evaluation of underlying etiologies of PHTN should be undertaken in every patient."
https://openalex.org/W2886751735,"North Africa represents a rich and early reservoir of goat genetic diversity, from which the main African breeds have been derived. In this study, the genetic diversity of four indigenous Algerian goat breeds (i.e., Arabia, Makatia, M’Zabite and Kabyle, with n = 12 for each breed) has been investigated for the first time by genome-wide SNP genotyping; moreover in a broader context, genetic structuration of Algerian and Moroccan goats was explored (via FST, MDS, STRUCTURE, FineSTRUCTURE, BAPS, sPCA and DAPC analyses). At national level, the study revealed high level of genetic diversity and a significant phenomenon of admixture affecting all the Algerian breeds. At broader scale, clear global genetic homogeneity appeared considering both Algerian and Moroccan stocks. Indeed, genetic structuration was almost nonexistent among Arabia (from Algeria), Draa, Black and Nord (from Morocco), while the ancestral Kabyle and M’Zabite breeds, reared by Berber peoples, showed genetic distinctness. The study highlighted the threat to the Maghrebin stock, probably induced by unsupervised cross-breeding practices which have intensified in recent centuries. Moreover, it underlined the necessity to deepen our understanding of the genetic resources represented by the resilient North-African goat stock."
https://openalex.org/W2887609523,"Background Previous studies have shown that item responses and total scores on depression screening scales follow characteristic distribution patterns in the United States and Japanese general populations. However, the degree to which these findings, especially in terms of item responses, can be generalized to a European population is unknown. Thus, we analyzed the item responses and total score distribution for the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in a representative Irish cohort from a large, recent study—the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Methods We used CES-D data from the 2009–2011 TILDA (8504 individuals). Responses for the 16 depressive symptoms included “rarely,” “some of the time,” “occasionally,” and “all of the time.” Item response patterns and total score distribution across these 16 depressive symptom items were examined using graphical analyses and exponential regression modeling. Results Lines for item responses followed the same pattern across the 16 items. These lines were characterized by intersections in the vicinity of a single point between “rarely” and “some of the time” and parallel patterns from “some of the time” to “all of the time” on a log-normal scale. Total scores for the 16 items exhibited an exponential pattern, except for at the lower end of the distribution. Conclusions The present findings suggest that item responses and total scores on depression screening scales among the general population follow the same characteristic patterns across populations from multiple nations."
https://openalex.org/W2885855696,"The shoot apical meristem produces all of the leaves, stems and flowers of a flowering plant from a reservoir of stem cells at its growing tip. In Arabidopsis, the small polypeptide signaling molecule CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a member of the CLV3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) gene family, is a key component of a negative feedback loop that maintains stem cell activity in shoot and floral meristems throughout development. Because in some plant species multiple CLE genes are involved in regulating shoot apical meristem activity, we tested the hypothesis that CLE genes other than CLV3 might function in stem cell homeostasis in Arabidopsis. We identified three Arabidopsis CLE genes expressed in the post-embryonic shoot apical meristem, generated loss-of-function alleles using genome editing, and analyzed the meristem phenotypes of the resulting mutant plants. We found that null mutations in CLE16, CLE17 or CLE27 affected neither vegetative nor reproductive shoot meristem activity under normal growth conditions, although CLE27 appears to slightly prolong vegetative growth. Our results indicate that the CLE16, CLE17 and CLE27 genes have largely redundant roles in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem and/or regulate meristem activity only under specific environmental conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2951435729,"Purpose Recall by genotype (RbG) research recruits on the basis of genetic variation. Increased use of this approach presents an ethical conundrum for cohort studies/biobanks: whether to inform individuals of their genetic information and deviate from standard practice of non-disclosure of results, or mask this information at the level of the individual participant. This paper examines the perspectives of research study participants on RbG research. Methods Fifty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with young adult participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Topics included understandings of RbG research, expectations around recruitment and communication of research findings. Results Participants uniformly expressed a deep trust and faith in ALSPAC and considered themselves part of the ALSPAC team. Such perspectives, alongside a limited knowledge of genetics and modest interest in reported research outcomes, meant few participants reported immediate concerns about being recruited by genotype. Conclusion Our findings highlight the responsibility and duty of care on RbG researchers, and longitudinal studies more generally, and the importance of solidarity, reciprocity and co-production in study-participant relations. As such, we consider existing recommendations for conducting RbG research in longitudinal studies in light of our results and speak to recent changes in the approach used by ALSPAC."
https://openalex.org/W2885163628,"This study aimed to understand how people respond to different urban neighbourhoods. We explored whether participants’ mental health and wellbeing, judgements of resident wealth, family SES and sentiments reflected in descriptions of place features predicted in situ sense of threat and trust. Forty-six student participants walked in groups through 2 urban neighbourhoods, separated by a park, in the North West of England, noting responses at pre-determined stops. Significant differences existed in participants’ sense of trust and threat between the 2 neighbourhoods along with differences in perceived resident wealth and sentiments expressed. Participants’ levels of persecutory ideas and their sense of residents’ wealth predicted in situ trust in both neighbourhoods while level of personal resilience predicted the extent of threat felt in the more deprived neighbourhood. Demonstrating the value of the method, these findings have implications for the governance of urban neighbourhoods whereby obvious cues signalling a harsh environment need to be minimised to create more positive psychological responses to places."
https://openalex.org/W2885218739,"Shade coffee has shown great promise in providing crucial habitats for biodiversity outside formal protected areas. Insectivorous bats have been understudied in coffee, although they may provide pest control services. We investigated the influence of local and landscape-level features of coffee farms on aerial insectivorous bats in Chikmagalur district in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India. Bats were monitored in 20 farm sites using ultrasound detectors, and the response of bat species richness and activity to changes in tree density, proportion of built-up area in the neighborhood, and distance of farm from forest areas quantified. We examined if models built to explain the species richness and activity could also predict them in nine additional sites. We detected nine phonic types/species in the study area. The quantified predictors had no effect on assemblage-level species richness and activity of bats. Responses of edge-space and cluttered-space forager guilds mirrored those of the overall assemblage, but some species vulnerable to forest conversion like Rhinolophus beddomei were detected rarely. Best models explained up to 20% and 15% variation in assemblage-level species richness and activity respectively, and were poor predictors of both response variables. We conclude that coffee farms in our study area offer an important commuting space for insectivorous bats across a gradient of shade management. Further research should include species-specific responses to management decisions for at-risk species and quantification of ecosystem services like natural pest control to inform biodiversity conservation initiatives in the Western Ghats coffee landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2787029900,"Pleurobranchaea maculata is a rarely studied species of the Heterobranchia found throughout the south and western Pacific–and recently recorded in Argentina–whose population genetic structure is unknown. Interest in the species was sparked in New Zealand following a series of dog deaths caused by ingestions of slugs containing high levels of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. Here we describe the genetic structure and demographic history of P. maculata populations from five principle locations in New Zealand based on extensive analyses of 12 microsatellite loci and the COI and CytB regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Microsatellite data showed significant differentiation between northern and southern populations with population structure being associated with previously described regional variations in tetrodotoxin concentrations. However, mtDNA sequence data did not support such structure, revealing a star-shaped haplotype network with estimates of expansion time suggesting a population expansion in the Pleistocene era. Inclusion of publicly available mtDNA sequence sea slugs from Argentina did not alter the star-shaped network. We interpret our data as indicative of a single founding population that fragmented following geographical changes that brought about the present day north-south divide in New Zealand waters. Lack of evidence of cryptic species supports data indicating that differences in toxicity of individuals among regions are a consequence of differences in diet."
https://openalex.org/W2886799285,"Stem cells could be the next generation therapeutic option for neurodegenerative diseases including spinal cord injury (SCI). However, several critical factors such as delivery method should be determined before their clinical applications. Previously, we have demonstrated that lateral ventricle (LV) injection as preclinical simulation could be used for intrathecal administration in clinical trials using rodent animal models. In this study, we further analyzed in vivo distribution of cells that were injected into LVs of rats with SCI at thoracic level using in vivo imaging techniques. When 5 × 106 U87MG cells labelled with fluorescent magnetic nanoparticle (FMNP-labelled U87MG) were administrated into LVs at 7 days after SCI, FMNP-labelled U87MG cells were observed in all regions of the spinal cord at 24 hours after the injection. Compared to water-soluble Cy5.5 fluorescent dye or rats without SCI, in vivo distribution pattern of FMNP-labelled U87MG cells was not different, although migration to the spinal cord was significantly reduced in both Cy5.5 fluorescent dye and FMNP-labelled U87MG cells caused by the injury. The presence of FMNP-labelled U87MG cells in the spinal cord was confirmed by quantitative PCR for human specific sequence and immunohistochemistry staining using antibody against human specific antigen. These data indicate that LV injection could recapitulate intrathecal administration of stem cells for SCI patients. Results of this study might be applied further to the planning of optimal preclinical and clinical trials of stem cell therapeutics for SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2887232701,"In this study, a long neuropeptide F receptor of the blood-feeding hemipteran, Rhodnius prolixus (RhoprNPFR) has been cloned and characterized. Approximately 70% of the RhoprNPFR deduced protein sequence is identical to that of other hemipteran NPFRs. RhoprNPFR has seven highly-conserved transmembrane domains, two cysteine residues in the 2nd and 3rd extracellular loops that likely form a disulfide bond integral for maintaining the structure of the receptor, and a conserved DRY motif after the third transmembrane domain. All of these characteristics are typical of class A rhodopsin-like GPCRs. The receptor transcript is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and gut of both fifth instar and adult R. prolixus. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we identified six bilaterally-paired large median neurosecretory cells (approximately 30μm in diameter) in the brain that express the RhoprNPFR mRNA transcript. We also found RhoprNPFR transcript expression in endocrine cells in the anterior midgut of fifth instars, as well as in putative pre-follicular cells present in the germarium and between developing oocytes, and in the nutritive cord. These results suggest that RhoprNPFR may play a role within the CNS, and in digestion and possibly egg production and/or egg development in R. prolixus."
https://openalex.org/W2887509601,"This study aims to estimate the migration effect of the overall samples and different flowing scales for the floating population from the perspective of personal wages. Although we used both the OLS and PSM methods to estimate the migration effect, we found that the PSM method was preferred in the study of migration as a result of the selection bias. The empirical results show that there is a significant difference in wage before and after migration. In fact, migration increased wages by 15.18% to 23.63% overall. Additionally, wages were increased by 44.96% to 59.20%, 23.06% to 26.18%, and 10.89% to 15.08% respectively for these three migration patterns: flowing into the three largest megacities, inter-provincial migration, and inter-city migration within a province, but for this pattern of inter-district migration within a city, the migration effect is not significant. We concluded that the floating population removing policies of the largest megacities maybe are effective because of the administrative power of their government. On the other hand, for these policies of non-largest megacities to attract labor and local employment and local urbanization near the floating population’s place of origin, they were not effective enough as a result of the lack of significant migration effect in these cities."
https://openalex.org/W4214952443,"Scoring and tracking animal movements manually is a time consuming and subjective process, susceptible to errors due to fatigue. Automated and semi-automated video-based tracking methods have been developed to overcome the errors and biases of manual analyses. In this manuscript we present D-Track, an open-source semi-automatic tracking system able to quantify the 3D trajectories of dolphins, non-invasively, in the water. This software produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the pool and tracks the animal at different depths, using standard cameras. D-Track allows the determination of spatial preferences of the animals, their speed and its variations, and the identification of behavioural routines. We tested the system with two captive dolphins during different periods of the day. Both animals spent around 85% of the time at the surface of the Deep Area of their pool (5-meters depth). Both dolphins showed a stable average speed throughout 31 sessions, with slow speeds predominant (maximum 1.7 ms-1). Circular swimming was highly variable, with significant differences in the size and duration of the “circles”, between animals, within-animals and across sessions. The D-Track system is a novel tool to study the behaviour of aquatic animals, and it represents a convenient and inexpensive solution for laboratories and marine parks to monitor the preferences and routines of their animals."
https://openalex.org/W2804789765,"The degree of altruistic behavior among strangers is an evolutionary puzzle. A prominent explanation is the evolutionary legacy hypothesis according to which an evolved reciprocity-based psychology affects behavior even when reciprocity is impossible, i.e., altruistic behavior in such instances is maladaptive. Empirical support for this explanation comes from laboratory experiments showing that surveillance cues, e.g., photographs of watching eyes, increase altruistic behavior. A competing interpretation for this evidence, however, is that the cues signal the experimenter's expectations and participants, aware of being monitored, intentionally behave more altruistically to boost their reputation. Here we report the first results from a field experiment on the topic in which participants are unaware they are being monitored and reciprocity is precluded. The experiment investigates the impact of surveillance cues on a textbook example of altruistic behavior-hand hygiene prior to treating a 'patient'. We find no evidence surveillance cues affect hand hygiene, despite using different measures of hand-hygiene quality and cues that have been previously shown to be effective. We argue that surveillance cues may have an effect only when participants have reasons to believe they are actually monitored. Thus they cannot support claims altruistic behavior between strangers is maladaptive."

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe CD and inadequate response to existing treatment.This was an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter Phase 3 study conducted at nine sites in Japan between April 2012 and March 2015. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) with moderate-to-severe CD were treated with IFX 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and at 8-week intervals thereafter until Week 46, with final evaluation at Week 54. IFX dose was increased to 10 mg/kg in patients who showed loss of response to IFX from Week 14 onwards.A total of 14 patients fulfilled eligibility criteria and were treated. Dose-escalation criteria were met by five patients who then received 10 mg/kg IFX. The remaining nine patients continued to receive an IFX dose of 5 mg/kg. IFX rapidly improved clinical symptoms and its effect was maintained for up to 54 weeks. Overall Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) response rate was 85.7%, and overall PCDAI remission rate was 64.3%. Three out of five patients who increased IFX dose regained PCDAI remission by retrieval of serum IFX concentration. Adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in 100.0% and 14.3% of patients, respectively. There was no substantial difference in the safety profiles of patients taking a constant dose of 5 mg/kg and those taking an increased dose of 10 mg/kg.These findings support the effective use of IFX in the treatment of pediatric patients with CD where other treatments have proven ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2887022749,"Histone H1 is an evolutionarily conserved linker histone protein that functions in arranging and stabilizing chromatin structure and is frequently fused to a fluorescent protein to track nuclei in live cells. In time-lapse analyses, we observed stochastic exchange of photoactivated Dendra2-histone H1 protein between nuclei within the same cellular compartment. We also observed exchange of histones between genetically distinct nuclei in a heterokaryon derived from fusion of strains carrying histone H1-RFP or H1-GFP. Subsequent analysis of the resulting uninucleate conidia containing both RFP- and GFP-labeled histone H1 proteins showed only parental genotypes, ruling out genetic recombination and diploidization. These data together suggest that the linker histone H1 protein can diffuse between non-daughter nuclei in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans."

The complete genome sequence obtained (4512 nucleotides in length) shows an organization typical for aureusviruses, with five open reading frames (ORFs) and the typical ORF1-RT expression by the readthrough of an amber stop codon. The analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP) sequences showed the highest identity (respectively 75.7% and 55%) with the corresponding amino acid sequences of Pothos latent virus. These two values, below the species demarcation criteria for the genus, indicate that the detected virus is a new member of genus Aureusvirus, family Tombusviridae, with the proposed name Elderberry aureusvirus 1 (ElAV1). A survey confirmed the wide distribution of ElAV1 in elderberry in the Czech Republic. Phylogenetic analyses of RdRp and CP sequences showed distinct microevolution of geographically separated isolates, with a tendency for isolates coming from close localities or from the same region to cluster together but heterogeneity of viral populations down to a local scale was also observed. The symptomatology of the new virus is not fully clear, but many infected trees were either asymptomatic or showed mild chlorotic mosaics. More severe symptoms, potentially impacting yields of flowers or berries, were observed in plants with mixed infections of ElAV1 and other elderberry viruses. Further efforts are now needed to determine ElAV1 prevalence outside the Czech Republic and to unravel its epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2887763313,"Background Guideline-adherent prescribing for treatment of multiple risk factors in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients is expected to improve clinical outcomes. However, the relationship to Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is not straightforward since guideline-adherent prescribing can increase medication burden. Objectives To test whether guideline-adherent prescribing and disease-specific medication burden are associated with HRQoL in patients with T2D. Methods Cross-sectional study including 1,044 T2D patients from the e-VitaDM/ZODIAC study in 2012 in the Netherlands. Data from the diabetes visit, such as laboratory and physical examinations and prescribed medication, and from two HRQoL questionnaires, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EQ5D-3L) and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) were collected. Twenty indicators assessing prescribing of recommended glucose lowering drugs, statins, antihypertensives and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-inhibitors and potentially inappropriate drugs from a validated diabetes indicator set were included. Disease-specific medication burden was assessed using a modified version of the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Associations were tested with regression models, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes duration, comorbidity, body mass index and smoking. Results The mean MRCI was 7.1, the median EQ5D-3L-score was 0.86 and the mean WHO-5 score was 72. Seven indicators included too few patients and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining thirteen indicators focusing on recommended start, intensification, current and preferred use of glucose lowering drugs, statins, antihypertensives, RAAS inhibitors, and on inappropriate prescribing of glibenclamide and dual RAAS blockade were not significantly associated with HRQoL. Finally, also the MRCI was not associated with HRQoL. Conclusions We found no evidence for associations between guideline-adherent prescribing or disease-specific medication burden and HRQoL in T2D patients. This gives no rise to refrain from prescribing intensive treatment in T2D patients as recommended, but the interpretation of these results is limited by the cross-sectional study design and the selection of patients included in some indicators."

Gliders have a dramatically lower payload capacity than research vessels and are thus limited to more simple instrumentation. They have the advantage, however, of being deployable for long periods of time without the high running costs of a ship. Recent years have seen development of the use of gliders to undertake acoustic surveys of biomass in the pelagic environment, highlighting their potential to fill future survey gaps. Here it is shown, using simulation of sampling, that gliders can resolve acoustic targets at greater resolutions than ships, due to their diving pattern, but that survey accuracy is strongly dependent on the speed of the target."
https://openalex.org/W2885947080,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects economically important livestock and is one of the most contagious viral diseases. The most commonly used FMD diagnostic assay is a sandwich ELISA. However, the main disadvantage of this ELISA is that it requires anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies raised in small animals. This problem can be, in part, overcome by using anti-FMDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as detecting reagents. However, the long-term use of MAbs may be problematic and they may need to be replaced. Here we have constructed chimeric antibodies (mouse/rabbit D9) and Fabs (fragment antigen-binding) (mouse/cattle D9) using the Fv (fragment variable) regions of a mouse MAb, D9 (MAb D9), which recognises type O FMDV. The mouse/rabbit D9 chimeric antibody retained the FMDV serotype-specificity of MAb D9 and performed well in a FMDV detection ELISA as well as in routine laboratory assays. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis confirmed engagement with antigenic site 1 and peptide competition studies identified the aspartic acid at residue VP1 147 as a novel component of the D9 epitope. This chimeric expression approach is a simple but effective way to preserve valuable FMDV antibodies, and has the potential for unlimited generation of antibodies and antibody fragments in recombinant systems with the concomitant positive impacts on the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) principles."
https://openalex.org/W2886274580,"Both human parvovirus B19 (B19V) and human bocavirus (HBoV) are known to be important human pathogens of the Parvoviridae family. Our earlier investigation demonstrated that both B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u have a significantly disruptive effect on tight junctions (TJs) in A549 cells, implying the essential role of parvovirus in airway infection and lung injury. However, no direct evidence that B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u induce lung injury exists. The present study further investigates the induction of lung injury by B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u in naïve Balb/c mice following subcutaneous injection of PBS, recombinant B19V-VP1u or HBoV-VP1u. The experimental results reveal significantly increased activity, protein expression and ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to MMP-2 in Balb/c mice that received B19V-VP1u or HBoV-VP1u compared to those that received PBS. Significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1β, and greater lymphocyte infiltration in lung tissue sections were detected in mice that received B19V-VP1u or HBoV-VP1u. Additionally, significantly increased levels of phosphorylated p65 (NF-κB) and MAPK signaling proteins were observed in lung tissue of mice that received B19V-VP1u or HBoV-VP1u compared to those of mice that received PBS. These findings demonstrate for the first time that B19V-VP1u and HBoV-VP1u proteins induce lung inflammatory reactions through p65 (NF-κB) and MAPK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2887060955,"Background Use of everolimus-eluting stents (EES) has proven to be clinically effective and safe in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction but it remains unclear whether it is cost-effective compared to bare-metal stents (BMS) in the long-term. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of EES versus BMS based on the 5-year results of the EXAMINATION trial, from a Spanish health service perspective. Methods Decision analysis of the use of EES versus BMS was based on the patient-level clinical outcome data of the EXAMINATION trial. The analysis adopted a lifelong time horizon, assuming that long-term survival was independent of the initial treatment strategy after the end of follow-up. Life-expectancy, health-state utility scores and unit costs were extracted from published literature and publicly available sources. Non-parametric bootstrapping was combined with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to co-assess the impact of patient-level variation and parameter uncertainty. The main outcomes were total costs and quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Results The model predicted an average survival time in patients receiving EES and BMS of 10.52 and 10.38 undiscounted years, respectively. Over the life-long time horizon, the EES strategy was €430 more costly than BMS (€8,305 vs. €7,874), but went along with incremental gains of 0.10 quality-adjusted life-years. This resulted in an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over all simulations of €3,948 per quality-adjusted life-years gained and was below a willingness-to-pay threshold of €25,000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained in 86.9% of simulation runs. Conclusions Despite higher total costs relative to BMS, EES appeared to be a cost-effective therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients due to their incremental effectiveness. Predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below generally acceptable threshold values."
https://openalex.org/W2952720029,"Dispersal beyond the local patch in clonal plants was typically thought to result from sexual reproduction via seed dispersal. However, evidence for the separation, transport by water, and re-establishment of asexual propagules (asexual hydrochory) is mounting suggesting other important means of dispersal in aquatic plants. Using an unprecedented sampling size and microsatellite genetic identification, we describe the distribution of seagrass clones along tens of km within a coastal lagoon in Southern Portugal. Our spatially explicit individual-based sampling design covered 84 km2 and collected 3 185 Zostera noltei ramets from 803 sites. We estimated clone age, assuming rhizome elongation as the only mechanism of clone spread, and contrasted it with paleo-oceanographic sea level change. We also studied the association between a source of disturbance and the location of large clones. A total of 16 clones were sampled more than 10 times and the most abundant one was sampled 59 times. The largest distance between two samples from the same clone was 26.4 km and a total of 58 and 10 clones were sampled across more than 2 and 10 km, respectively. The number of extremely large clone sizes, and their old ages when assuming the rhizome elongation as the single causal mechanism, suggests other processes are behind the span of these clones. We discuss how the dispersal of vegetative fragments in a stepping-stone manner might have produced this pattern. We found higher probabilities to sample large clones away from the lagoon inlet, considered a source of disturbance. This study corroborates previous experiments on the success of transport and re-establishment of asexual fragments and supports the hypothesis that asexual hydrochory is responsible for the extent of these clones."
https://openalex.org/W2885427481,"Previous studies have suggested that both bipolar disorder and atopy are associated with an increased risk of stroke. However, the role of atopic diseases/diathesis in the risk of stroke among patients with bipolar disorder remains unclear.Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we selected 55,593 patients with bipolar disorder between 2002 and 2008, divided them into patients with atopic diseases/diathesis (n = 21,050) and patients without atopic diseases/diathesis (n = 34,543), and observed them until the end of 2011. Patients who experienced a stroke during the follow-up period were identified.Patients with bipolar disorder and atopic diseases/diathesis had an elevated risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.59) compared with patients with only bipolar disorder; a dose-dependent relationship was observed between the number of allergic comorbidities and the risk of ischemic stroke (1 atopic disease, HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13-1.49; 2 atopic diseases, HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.33-1.91; ≥ 3 atopic diseases, HR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.50-2.91).The role of atopic diseases in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke among patients with bipolar disorder was nonsignificant (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.64-1.09).Patients with bipolar disorder and atopic diseases/diathesis are more prone to ischemic stroke later in life than are those without atopic diseases/diathesis. Further study is required to investigate the underlying mechanism linking atopy, bipolar disorder, and stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2885560268,"It is well accepted that the introduction of negative supercoils locally unwinds the DNA double helix, influencing thus the activity of proteins. Despite the use of recent methods of molecular dynamics simulations to model the DNA supercoiling-induced DNA deformation, the precise extent and location of unpaired bases induced by the negative supercoiling have never been investigated at the nucleotide level. Our goals in this study were to use radiolabeled double-stranded DNA mini-circles (dsMCs) to locate the unpaired bases on dsMCs whose topology ranged from relaxed to hyper-negatively supercoiled states, and to characterize the binding of proteins involved in the DNA metabolism. Our results show that the Nuclease SI is nearly ten times more active on hyper-negatively supercoiled than relaxed DNA. The structural changes responsible for this stimulation of activity were mapped for the first time with a base pair resolution and shown to be subtle and distributed along the entire sequence. As divalent cations modify the DNA topology, our binding studies were conducted with or without magnesium. Without magnesium, the dsMCs topoisomers mostly differ by their twist. Under these conditions, the Escherichia coli topoisomerase I weakly binds relaxed dsMCs and exhibits a stronger binding on negatively and hyper-negatively supercoiled dsMCs than relaxed dsMCs, with no significant difference in the binding activity among the supercoiled topoisomers. For the human replication protein A (hRPA), the more negatively supercoiled is the DNA, the better the binding, illustrating the twist-dependent binding activity for this protein. The presence of magnesium permits the dsMCs to writhe upon introduction of negative supercoiling and greatly modifies the binding properties of the hRPA and Escherichia coli SSB on dsMCs, indicating a magnesium-dependent DNA binding behavior. Finally, our experiments that probe the topology of the DNA in the hRPA-dsMC complexes show that naked and hRPA-bound dsMCs have the same topology."
https://openalex.org/W2886146796,"Chronic airway inflammation in conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis is characterised by a predominant neutrophilic inflammatory response, commonly due to the presence of pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesised that down-regulation of the anti-inflammatory nuclear transcription regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ in non-CF bronchiectasis subjects may explain why this exuberant neutrophilic inflammation is able to persist unchecked in the inflamed airway.PPARγ gene expression was assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) of 35 macrolide naïve non-CF bronchiectasis subjects and compared with that in 20 healthy controls. Human RNA was extracted from pelleted BAL and PPARγ expression was determined by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Bacterial DNA was extracted from paired induced sputum and total bacterial load was determined by 16S rRNA qPCR. Quantification of individual bacterial species was achieved by qPCR.PPARγ expression was lower in subjects with non-CF bronchiectasis compared with healthy control subjects (control: 1.00, IQR 0.55-1.44, n = 20 vs. Bronchiectasis: 0.49, IQR 0.12-0.89; n = 35; p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). This lower PPARγ expression correlated negatively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (r = -0.53, n = 31; p = 0.002). No significant association was seen between PPARγ and total bacterial levels or levels Haemophilus influenzae.PPARγ is expressed in low levels in the airways of non-CF bronchiectasis subjects, despite an aggressive inflammatory response. This low level PPARγ expression is particularly associated with the presence of high levels of P. aeruginosa, and may represent an intrinsic link with this bacterial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2885421606,"Background Despite their widespread use in this population, data on the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the insulin analogs detemir and glargine in severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes are lacking. Methods The primary objective of the study was to compare the PD properties of two different doses of the basal insulin analogs detemir and glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes and a BMI > 35 kg/m2. PD data were derived from euglycemic clamp studies over 30 hours and each subject was studied for four times after the subcutaneous injection of a lower (0.8 U/kg body weight) and higher (1.6 U/kg body weight) dose of both detemir and glargine using a single-blind, randomised cross-over design. Results Six male and four female patients with type 2 diabetes and a mean BMI of 43.2±5.1 kg/m2 (mean age 55.7±2 years, mean HbA1c 7.2±0.3%) completed the study. The total GIRAUC0-30 (mean difference 1224 mg/kg, 95%CI 810–1637, p = 0.00001), GIRAUC0-24 (mean difference 1040 mg/kg, 95%CI 657–1423; p = 0.00001), GIRAUC24-30 (mean difference 181 mg/kg, 95%CI 64–298; p = 0.004), GIRmax (mean difference 0.93 mg/kg/min, 95%CI 0.22–1.64, p = 0.01) and time to GIRmax (+1.9 hours, 95%CI 0.5–3.2; p = 0.009) were higher after the higher doses of both insulins, without significant differences between detemir and glargine. However, during the last 6 hours of the clamp the GIRAUC24-30 was significantly increased with glargine (mean difference 122 mg/kg, 95%CI 6–237, p = 0.043), reflecting a more pronounced late glucose lowering effect. Conclusions A clear dose-response relationship can be demonstrated for both insulin analogs, even at very high doses in severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Compared to detemir, glargine has a more pronounced late glucose lowering effect 24–30 h after its injection. Trial registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN57547229."
https://openalex.org/W2887055970,"This paper examines the interrelationships among 9 advanced economies using a novel multichannel approach to investigate, beyond the usual causal relationships, the time-varying dimension of the channels conveying causal relationships. The model is derived from the well-known Markov Switching setting and account for systems described by multiple variables. A Markov switching causality measure is adapted to account for information transmissions between distinct multivariate systems. Each country is described by 5 different fundamental variables reflecting its state. Our multichannel causality measure is then applied on these sets of time series to determine, over time, the main channels through which the information is transmitted between the different countries. In a second step, we investigate the relationships existing between these countries and the commodity markets and look at the possible use of the commodity markets as an indirect channel of information transmission between countries."
