https://openalex.org/W4211162540,"Spatial omics emerged as a new frontier of biological and biomedical research. Here, we present spatial-CUT&Tag for spatially resolved genome-wide profiling of histone modifications by combining in situ CUT&Tag chemistry, microfluidic deterministic barcoding, and next-generation sequencing. Spatially resolved chromatin states in mouse embryos revealed tissue-type-specific epigenetic regulations in concordance with ENCODE references and provide spatial information at tissue scale. Spatial-CUT&Tag revealed epigenetic control of the cortical layer development and spatial patterning of cell types determined by histone modification in mouse brain. Single-cell epigenomes can be derived in situ by identifying 20-micrometer pixels containing only one nucleus using immunofluorescence imaging. Spatial chromatin modification profiling in tissue may offer new opportunities to study epigenetic regulation, cell function, and fate decision in normal physiology and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4211173219,"Cellular solids (e.g., foams and honeycombs) are widely found in natural and engineering systems because of their high mechanical efficiency and tailorable properties. While these materials are often based on polycrystalline or amorphous constituents, here we report an unusual dual-scale, single-crystalline microlattice found in the biomineralized skeleton of the knobby starfish, Protoreaster nodosus. This structure has a diamond-triply periodic minimal surface geometry (lattice constant, approximately 30 micrometers), the [111] direction of which is aligned with the c-axis of the constituent calcite at the atomic scale. This dual-scale crystallographically coaligned microlattice, which exhibits lattice-level structural gradients and dislocations, combined with the atomic-level conchoidal fracture behavior of biogenic calcite, substantially enhances the damage tolerance of this hierarchical biological microlattice, thus providing important insights for designing synthetic architected cellular solids."
https://openalex.org/W4211115742,"How the brain stores a sequence in memory remains largely unknown. We investigated the neural code underlying sequence working memory using two-photon calcium imaging to record thousands of neurons in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys memorizing and then reproducing a sequence of locations after a delay. We discovered a regular geometrical organization: The high-dimensional neural state space during the delay could be decomposed into a sum of low-dimensional subspaces, each storing the spatial location at a given ordinal rank, which could be generalized to novel sequences and explain monkey behavior. The rank subspaces were distributed across large overlapping neural groups, and the integration of ordinal and spatial information occurred at the collective level rather than within single neurons. Thus, a simple representational geometry underlies sequence working memory."
https://openalex.org/W3210408447,"Piezoelectrics are materials that linearly deform in response to an applied electric field. As a fundamental prerequisite, piezoelectric materials must have a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. For more than a century, this has remained a major obstacle for finding piezoelectric materials. We circumvented this limitation by breaking the crystallographic symmetry and inducing large and sustainable piezoelectric effects in centrosymmetric materials by the electric field-induced rearrangement of oxygen vacancies. Our results show the generation of extraordinarily large piezoelectric responses [with piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33) of ~200,000 picometers per volt at millihertz frequencies] in cubic fluorite gadolinium-doped CeO2-x films, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the responses observed in the presently best-known lead-based piezoelectric relaxor-ferroelectric oxide at kilohertz frequencies. These findings provide opportunities to design piezoelectric materials from environmentally friendly centrosymmetric ones."
https://openalex.org/W4211032411,"Human oocytes are prone to assembling meiotic spindles with unstable poles, which can favor aneuploidy in human eggs. The underlying causes of spindle instability are unknown. We found that NUMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein)-mediated clustering of microtubule minus ends focused the spindle poles in human, bovine, and porcine oocytes and in mouse oocytes depleted of acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (aMTOCs). However, unlike human oocytes, bovine, porcine, and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes have stable spindles. We identified the molecular motor KIFC1 (kinesin superfamily protein C1) as a spindle-stabilizing protein that is deficient in human oocytes. Depletion of KIFC1 recapitulated spindle instability in bovine and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes, and the introduction of exogenous KIFC1 rescued spindle instability in human oocytes. Thus, the deficiency of KIFC1 contributes to spindle instability in human oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4211011646,"Regioselective functionalization of arenes remains a challenging problem in organic synthesis. Steric interactions are often used to block sites adjacent to a given substituent, but they do not distinguish the remaining remote sites. We report a strategy based on remote steric control, whereby a roof-like ligand protects the distant para site in addition to the ortho sites, and thereby enables selective activation of meta carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in the absence of ortho or para substituents. We demonstrate this concept for iridium-catalyzed meta-selective borylation of various monosubstituted arenes, including complex drug molecules. This strategy has the potential to expand the toolbox of C-H bond functionalization to previously nondifferentiable reaction sites."
https://openalex.org/W4211020444,"Marginal zone (MZ) B cells produce broad-spectrum antibodies that protect against infection early in life. In some instances, antibody production requires MZ B cells to display pathogen antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules to T cells. We describe the trogocytic acquisition of these molecules from conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Complement component 3 (C3) binds to murine and human MHC II on cDCs. MZ B cells recognize C3 with complement receptor 2 (CR2) and trogocytose the MHC II-C3 complexes, which become exposed on their cell surface. The ubiquitin ligase MARCH1 limits the number of MHC II-C3 complexes displayed on cDCs to prevent their elimination through excessive trogocytosis. Capture of C3 by MHC II thus enables the transfer of cDC-like properties to MZ B cells."
https://openalex.org/W4210998457,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for initiating adaptive immune responses. However, the factors that control DC positioning and homeostasis are incompletely understood. We found that type-2 conventional DCs (cDC2s) in the spleen depend on Gα13 and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family member-E5 (Adgre5, or CD97) for positioning in blood-exposed locations. CD97 function required its autoproteolytic cleavage. CD55 is a CD97 ligand, and cDC2 interaction with CD55-expressing red blood cells (RBCs) under shear stress conditions caused extraction of the regulatory CD97 N-terminal fragment. Deficiency in CD55-CD97 signaling led to loss of splenic cDC2s into the circulation and defective lymphocyte responses to blood-borne antigens. Thus, CD97 mechanosensing of RBCs establishes a migration and gene expression program that optimizes the antigen capture and presentation functions of splenic cDC2s."
https://openalex.org/W4210992476,"Patients on dialysis are at risk of severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the neutralizing activity and coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants of vaccine-elicited antibodies is required to guide prophylactic and therapeutic COVID-19 interventions in this frail population. By analyzing plasma samples from 130 hemodialysis and 13 peritoneal dialysis patients after two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, we found that 35% of the patients had low-level or undetectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S). Neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant were low or undetectable in 49% and 77% of patients, respectively, and were further reduced against other emerging variants. The fraction of non-responding patients was higher in SARS-CoV-2-naïve hemodialysis patients immunized with BNT162b2 (66%) than those immunized with mRNA-1273 (23%). The reduced neutralizing activity correlated with low antibody avidity. Patients followed up to 7 months after vaccination showed a rapid decay of the antibody response with an average 21- and 10-fold reduction of neutralizing antibodies to vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 and Delta variant, which increased the fraction of non-responders to 84% and 90%, respectively. These data indicate that dialysis patients should be prioritized for additional vaccination boosts. Nevertheless, their antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 must be continuously monitored to adopt the best prophylactic and therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4211225168,"In this proof-of-concept work, we evaluate the performance of multiple machine-learning methods as surrogate models for use in the analysis of agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing agent-based modelling outputs can be challenging, as the relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU time. Surrogate modelling, in which a statistical model of the ABM is constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare multiple machine-learning methods for ABM surrogate modelling in order to determine the approaches best suited as a surrogate for modelling the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process surrogates, currently the most commonly used method for the surrogate modelling of complex computational models. ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using machine-learning methods for surrogate modelling, as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation."
https://openalex.org/W4211062048,"Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) previously revascularized with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are at high risk of recurrent ischemic events. We aimed to provide real-world insights into the clinical characteristics and management of this clinical population, excluding patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology.This is a multicenter, retrospective study based on the secondary use of 2014-2018 real-world data captured in the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of 1,579 patients (0.72% of the T2D population analyzed; n = 217,632 patients) from 12 representative hospitals in Spain. To access the unstructured clinical information in EHRs, we used the EHRead® technology, based on NLP and machine learning. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were considered: MI, ischemic stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, and hospitalization due to unstable angina. The association between MACE rates and the variables included in this study was evaluated following univariate and multivariate approaches.Most patients were male (72.13%), with a mean age of 70.5±10 years. Regarding T2D, most patients were non-insulin-dependent T2D (61.75%) with high prevalence of comorbidities. The median (Q1-Q3) duration of follow-up was 1.2 (0.3-4.5) years. Overall, 35.66% of patients suffered from at least one MACE during follow up. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model analysis, several independent factors were associated with MACE during follow up: CAD duration (p < 0.001), COPD/Asthma (p = 0.021), heart valve disease (p = 0.031), multivessel disease (p = 0.005), insulin treatment (p < 0.001), statins treatment (p < 0.001), and clopidogrel treatment (p = 0.039).Our results showed high rates of MACE in a large real-world series of PCI-revascularized patients with T2D and CAD with no history of MI or stroke. These data represent a potential opportunity to improve the clinical management of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4211111407,"The aim this study was to provide an epidemiological injury analysis of the National Basketball Association, detailing aspects such as frequency rate, characteristics and impact on performance (missed games), including COVID-19 related and non-related injuries.A retrospective study was conducted from the 2017-18 to 2020-2021 season. Publicly available records from the official website of the National Basketball Association were collected, including player's profiling data, minutes played per game until the injury occurred, unique injuries and injury description [location (body area), diagnosis (or mechanism)], and missed games due to injury.A total of 625 players and 3543 unique injuries were registered during the period analyzed. There was an increased incidence of missed games and unique injuries ratios, from 2017-18 until 2020-21, even when excluding COVID-19 related cases. The main body areas of injuries corresponded to lower body injuries, specifically knee, ankle and foot. The tendon/ligament group, for both games missed and unique injuries, showed the higher ratios (1.16 and 0.21, respectively), followed by muscle (0.69 and 0.16, respectively) and bones (0.30 and 0.03, respectively). Irrespective of season, the higher percentage of unique injuries occurred in the group of players playing in the 26-35 minutes, followed by the 16-25 minutes played. Guards showed the highest injury ratios compared to other playing positions. Most injuries and missed games due to injury occurred from mid-season to the end of the regular season. The majority of both injuries and missed games were concentrated in the two central experience groups (from 6 to 15 years).Despite previous efforts to better understand injury risk factors, there has been an increase in unique injuries and missed games. The distribution by body area, type of injury, when they occurred, minutes played and outcomes by play position, age a or years of experience vary between season and franchises."
https://openalex.org/W4211152682,"Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the important indicators affecting individual's social participation and resource allocation, and it also plays an important role in the health shock of individuals. Faced by the trend of aging society, more and more nations across the world began to pay attention to prevent the risk of health shock of old adults.Based on the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2013, 2015 and 2018, this study uses path analysis and ologit model to empirically estimate the effects of SES and health shock on the activities of daily living (ADL) disability of old adults.As a result, first, it was found that SES has significant impact on the disability of old adults. Specifically, economic conditions (income) plays dominant role. Economic status affects the risk of individual disability mainly through life security and health behavior. Secondly, SES significantly affecting health shock, with education and economic status showing remarkable impact, and there is an apparent group inequality. Furthermore, taking high education group as reference, the probability of good sight or hearing ability of the low education group was only 49.76% and 63.29% of the high education group, respectively, while the rates of no pain and severe illness were 155.50% and 54.69% of the high education group. At last, the estimation of path effect of SES on ADL disability indicates evident group inequality, with health shock plays critical mediating role.SES is an important factor influencing residents' health shock, and health shocks like cerebral thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage will indirectly lead to the risk of individual ADL disability. Furthermore, among the multi-dimensional indicators of SES, individual income and education are predominant factors affecting health shock and ADL disability, while occupation of pre-retirement have little impact."
https://openalex.org/W4211243308,"Identifying spatial gaps in conservation networks requires information on species-environment relationships, and prioritization of habitats and corridors. We combined multi-extent niche modeling, landscape connectivity, and gap analysis to investigate scale-dependent environmental relationships, and identify core habitats and corridors for a little-known carnivore in Iran, the striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena). This species is threatened in Iran by road vehicle collisions and direct killing. Therefore, understanding the factors that affect its habitat suitability, spatial pattern of distribution, and connectivity among them are prerequisite steps to delineate strategies aiming at human-striped hyaena co-existence. The results showed that the highest predictive power and extent of habitats was obtained at the extent sizes of 4 and 2 km, respectively. Also, connectivity analysis revealed that the extent and number of core habitats and corridors changed with increasing dispersal distance, and approximately 21% of the landscape was found to support corridors. The results of gap analysis showed that 15-17% of the core habitats overlapped with conservation areas. Given the body size of the species, its mobility, and lack of significant habitat specialization we conclude that this species would be more strongly influenced by changes in habitat amount rather than landscape configuration. Our approach showed that the scale of variables and dispersal ability must be accounted for in conservation efforts to prioritize habitats and corridors, and designing conservation areas. Our results could facilitate the conservation of striped hyaena through the identification and prioritization of habitats, establishment of conservation areas, and mitigating conflicts in corridors."
https://openalex.org/W4210973860,"Underweight and overweight both have a long-lasting significant effect on human health at the individual and population levels. However, in the context of Timor-Leste, a country that achieved independence around two decades ago, there is a severe scarcity of evidence regarding the underweight and obesity burden. We conducted this study to find out the prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity and their associated factors.This study used the nationally representative data of Timor-Leste Demographic Health Survey 2016 data. We conducted descriptive analysis followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis to find out the prevalence and investigate the associated factors. Both crude and adjusted odds ratio of covariates were reported with 95% confidence interval (CI).This study analyzed the data from a weighted sample of 16,488 Timorese aged 15-49 years. The prevalence of normal weight, underweight, and overweight or obesity were found to be 55.2% (95% CI: 54.2%-56.2%), 25.5% (95% CI: 24.4%-26.7%), and 19.3% (95% CI: 18.3%-20.3%), respectively. For underweight, age, sex, type of settlement (urban/rural), township, and wealth, marital, and educational status were found to have a statistically significant relationship (p < 0.05) with Body Mass Index(BMI). After adjustment for the covariates in the logistic regression model age, sex, township, and wealth and marital status were found to be statistically significant correlates (p < .05) of underweight. For overweight and obesity, all the background characteristics included in this study (i.e, age, sex, type of settlement, township, and wealth, marital, and educational status) were found to be statistically significant correlates, after adjustment for the covariates.This study concludes that Timor-Leste has a significant underweight and overweight burden which needs to be addressed through appropriate interventions. Further studies are also warranted to delve deeper into the complex interplay of factors associated with underweight and overweight."
https://openalex.org/W4211026529,"Although domestic infestations by Triatoma infestans have been successfully controlled across Latin America, in areas of the Gran Chaco region, recurrent post-spraying house colonization continues to be a significant challenge, jeopardizing Chagas disease vector control and maintaining active Trypanosoma cruzi transmission.To investigate the dynamics of triatomine reinfestation in a rural area of the Paraguayan Chaco, genetic characterization (based on 10 microsatellite loci and cytochrome B sequence polymorphisms) was performed on baseline and reinfestant T. infestans (n = 138) from four indigenous communities and adjacent sylvatic sites. House quality and basic economic activities were assessed across the four communities. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among all baseline triatomine populations. Faster reinfestation was observed in the communities with higher infestation rates pre-spraying. Baseline and reinfestant populations from the same communities were not genetically different, but two potentially distinct processes of reinfestation were evident. In Campo Largo, the reinfestant population was likely founded by domestic survivor foci, with reduced genetic diversity relative to the baseline population. However, in 12 de Junio, reinfestant bugs were likely derived from different sources, including survivors from the pre-spraying population and sympatric sylvatic bugs, indicative of gene-flow between these habitats, likely driven by high human mobility and economic activities in adjacent sylvatic areas.Our results demonstrate that sylvatic T. infestans threatens vector control strategies, either as a reinfestation source or by providing a temporary refuge during insecticide spraying. Passive anthropogenic importation of T. infestans and active human interactions with neighboring forested areas also played a role in recolonization. Optimization of spraying, integrated community development and close monitoring of sylvatic areas should be considered when implementing vector control activities in the Gran Chaco."
https://openalex.org/W4211084629,"The diagnosis of breast cancer—including determination of prognosis and prediction—has been traditionally based on clinical and pathological characteristics such as tumor size, nodal status, and tumor grade. The decision-making process has been expanded by the recent introduction of molecular signatures. These signatures, however, have not reached the highest levels of evidence thus far. Yet they have been brought to clinical practice based on statistical significance in prospective as well as retrospective studies. Intriguingly, it has also been reported that most random sets of genes are significantly associated with disease outcome. These facts raise two highly relevant questions: What information gain do these signatures procure? How can one find a signature that is substantially better than a random set of genes? Our study addresses these questions. To address the latter question, we present a hybrid signature that joins the traditional approach with the molecular one by combining the Nottingham Prognostic Index with gene expressions in a data-driven fashion. To address the issue of information gain, we perform careful statistical analysis and comparison of the hybrid signature, gene expression lists of two commercially available tests as well as signatures selected at random, and introduce the Signature Skill Score—a simple measure to assess improvement on random signatures. Despite being based on in silico data, our research is designed to be useful for the decision-making process of oncologists and strongly supports association of random signatures with outcome. Although our study shows that none of these signatures can be considered as the main candidate for providing prognostic information, it also demonstrates that both the hybrid signature and the gene expression list of the OncotypeDx signature identify patients who may not require adjuvant chemotherapy. More importantly, we show that combining signatures substantially improves the identification of patients who do not need adjuvant chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4211190808,"Chronic pain is associated with anhedonia and decreased motivation. These behavioral alterations have been linked to alterations in the limbic brain and could explain the increased risk for obesity in pain patients. The mechanism of these behavioral changes and how they set in in relation to the development of chronic pain remain however poorly understood. Here we asked how eating behavior was affected in low-back pain patients before and after they transitioned to chronic pain, compared to patients whose pain subsided. Additionally, we assessed how the hedonic perception of fat-rich food, which is altered in chronic pain patients, related to the properties of the nucleus accumbens in this patients' population. We hypothesized that the accumbens would be directly implicated in the hedonic processing of fat-rich food in pain patients because of its well-established role in hedonic feeding and fat ingestion, and its emerging role in chronic pain. Accordingly, we used behavioral assays and structural brain imaging to test sub-acute back pain patients (SBP) and healthy control subjects at baseline and at approximately one-year follow-up. We also studied a sample of chronic low-back pain patients (CLBP) at one time point only. We found that SBP patients who recovered at follow-up (SBPr) and CLBP patients showed disrupted eating behaviors. In contrast, SBP patients who persisted in having pain at follow-up (SBPp) showed intact eating behavior. From a neurological standpoint, only SBPp and CLBP patients showed a strong and direct relationship between hedonic perception of fat-rich food and nucleus accumbens volume. This suggests that accumbens alterations observed in SBPp patients in previous works might protect them from hedonic eating disruptions during the early course of the illness. We conclude that disrupted eating behavior specifically sets in after pain chronification and is accompanied by structural changes in the nucleus accumbens."
https://openalex.org/W4210986169,"National guidelines for treatment of distal radius fractures (DRFs) were presented in Sweden in 2021. In the guidelines, a fast-track is recommended for 4 subgroups of highly unstable DRFs. Regardless of the results of the closed reduction these are recommended for surgery within 1 week of injury. This study aims to evaluate the potential consequences of the newly presented national guidelines on incidence of surgical interventions.In all, 1,609 patients (1,635 DRFs) with primary radiographs after a DRF between 2014 and 2017 at two Swedish hospitals were included in a retrospective cohort study. An estimation was made of the percentage of patients in the historical pre-guidelines cohort, that would have been recommended early primary surgery according to the new national guidelines compared to treatment implemented without the support of these guidelines.On a strict radiological basis, 32% (516 out of 1635) of DRFs were classified into one of the 4 defined subgroups. At 9-13 days follow-up, cast treatment was converted into delayed primary surgery in 201 cases. Out of these, 56% (112 out of 201) fulfilled the fast-track criteria and would with the new guidelines have been subject to early primary surgery.The fast-track regimen in the new guidelines, has a high likelihood of identifying the unstable fractures benefitting from early primary surgery. If the proposed Swedish national guidelines for DRF treatment are implemented, a greater proportion of fractures would be treated with early primary surgery, and a delayed surgery avoided in the majority of cases. The potential benefits in relation to possible costs when using the fast-track criteria in every day practice are still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W4211050559,"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women receive influenza vaccination; however, uptake of the vaccine remains low. Maternity health care professionals (MHCPs) play an important role in motivating pregnant women to receive the influenza vaccine. However, factors such as MHCPs' views and knowledge about the vaccine, and time constraints due to workload may influence MHCPs' practices and opinions about women receiving the influenza vaccine during pregnancy. To date, the qualitative evidence exploring MHCPs' views and experiences around influenza vaccine uptake in pregnant women has not been synthesised.To systematically review and thematically synthesise qualitative evidence that explores the views and experiences of MHCPs involved in the provision of the maternal influenza vaccine worldwide.Five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched, supplemented with searches of included paper reference lists and grey literature. Study selection was conducted by up to three researchers applying pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Quality assessment was undertaken, data were extracted, coded and synthesised to develop descriptive and analytical themes.Eight studies involving 277 participants were included. Seventeen descriptive themes were interpreted, embedded within six analytical themes. MHCPs perceived that maternal influenza vaccination delivery can be facilitated by trusting relationships, good communication, knowledge about the vaccine leading to confidence in recommending vaccine, electronic vaccination prompts, and presence of national guidelines. However, workload, time constraints, MHCP's perception of pregnant women's concerns, and social/cultural/environmental influences could prevent the likelihood of delivery of influenza vaccine. Knowledgeable MHCPs who were regularly updated about vaccination based on scientific evidence were more confident when discussing and recommending the influenza vaccine to pregnant women. In addition, the presence of national policies and guidelines and electronic prompts for maternal influenza vaccination would enhance the delivery of the vaccine.Our findings suggest that approaches to enhance the vaccination uptake rate in pregnant women include addressing MHCPs barriers to discussing influenza vaccination through education, sufficient time for discussions, and electronic prompts about vaccination, as well as evidence based local and national guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W4211056737,"Subjective well-being has been associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health, and satisfaction with family life. There is evidence on gender difference in subjective well-being and differential relationships of predictors between men and women worldwide. However, little is known about the gender gaps in subjective well-being in Korean adults. Using nationwide panel survey data, this study aims to examine predictors of subjective well-being in the Korean population and to investigate if there is a difference in the impact of some predictors between men and women. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the relationship between subjective well-being and explanatory variables, using individual-level data from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) between 2017 and 2020. Model 1 investigated sociodemographic variables. Model 2 added three health-related variables (such as disability, chronic disease, and subjective health status) and satisfaction with family life. Additional models included a range of interaction terms. In the 2020 KOWEPS, 10,758 respondents rated their subjective well-being scores on the Cantril ladder. The mean score of all respondents was 6.74 (SD = 1.66). In the analysis of the pooled sample, subjective well-being was higher in women than in men (Models 1-2, p < .01). Among all variables examined, satisfaction with family life was the most important predictor of subjective well-being (β = 1.3625; p < .01). Education level and employment status had significant interaction effects with gender on subjective well-being. In particular, higher education was more important for women and stable employment was more important for men."
https://openalex.org/W4211162527,"A cross-sectional prospective cohort study including 1026 heifers administered tulathromycin due to high risk of clinical signs of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), measured poor association between BRD clinical outcomes and results of bacterial culture and tulathromycin susceptibility from BRD isolates of deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS) and adequate association with viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from nasal swabs. Isolation rates from DNS collected on day-0 and at 1st BRD-treatment respectively were: Mannheimia haemolytica (10.9% & 34.1%); Pasteurella multocida (10.4% & 7.4%); Mycoplasma bovis (1.0% & 36.6%); and Histophilus somni (0.7% & 6.3%). Prevalence of BRD viral nucleic acid on nasal swabs collected exclusively at 1st BRD-treatment were: bovine parainfluenza virus type-3 (bPIV-3) 34.1%; bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 26.3%; bovine herpes virus type-1 (BHV-1) 10.8%; and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) 54.1%. Increased relative risk, at 95% confidence intervals, of 1st BRD-treatment failure was associated with positive viral PCR results: BVDV 1.39 (1.17-1.66), bPIV-3 1.26 (1.06-1.51), BHV-1 1.52 (1.25-1.83), and BRSV 1.35 (1.11-1.63) from nasal swabs collected at 1st BRD-treatment and culture of M. haemolytica 1.23 (1.00-1.51) from DNS collected at day-0. However, in this population of high-risk feeder heifers, the predictive values of susceptible and resistant isolates had inadequate association with BRD clinical outcome. These results indicate, that using tulathromycin susceptibility testing of isolates of M. haemolytica or P. multocida from DNS collected on arrival or at 1st BRD-treatment to evaluate tulathromycin clinical efficacy, is unreliable."
https://openalex.org/W4211202970,"Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is known to induce Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but its mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the cerebral regions that are affected by CCH, and to evaluate the development of AD pathology in a rat model of CCH.A rat model of CCH was established by bilaterally ligating the common carotid arteries in adult male rats (CCH group). The identical operations were performed on sham rats without arteries ligation (control group). Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was evaluated at 1 and 3 months after bilateral CCA ligation using positron emission tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose. The expression levels of amyloid β40 (Aβ40), amyloid β42 (Aβ42), and hyperphosphorylated tau were evaluated using western blots at 3 months after the ligation. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Y-maze test at 3 months after the ligation.At 1 month after the ligation, cerebral glucose metabolism in the entorhinal, frontal association, motor, and somatosensory cortices were significantly decreased in the CCH group compared with those in the control group. At 3 months after the ligation, cerebral glucose metabolism was normalized in all regions except for the anterodorsal hippocampus, which was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group. The expression of Aβ42 and the Aβ42/40 ratio were significantly higher in the CCH group than those in the control group. The phosphorylated-tau levels of the hippocampus in the CCH group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Cognitive function was more impaired in the CCH group than that in the control group.Our findings suggest that CCH causes selective neurodegeneration of the anterodorsal hippocampus, which may be a trigger point for the development of AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4211034938,"Direct contact with nature is paramount in deepening children's and teenagers' interest in biodiversity. Learning materials chosen to convey information and engage participants during outings in nature-rich environments are varied and can support rich learning experiences. For this purpose, learning materials can be acquired ""off-the-shelf"" or developed for site-specific locations or projects. However, there is little guidance on potential techniques for those wishing to generate contextually relevant materials. With the view of responding to this challenge, we propose the cultural probes technique. We demonstrate that the technique, commonly used in qualitative research to generate novel insights in conversation with participants, can instigate innovative and thoughtful approaches to materials designed for children and teenagers to explore nature. We present a toolkit that draws on the literature on cultural probes, inquiry-based learning, and the value of sensory, emotional, and aesthetic experiences in environmental education for structuring interactions with participants. To test our approach, we applied a descriptive research design and mixed-methods approach for collecting questions from youths between the ages of 10 and 18, inspired by a nature walk and a set of exploratory tasks executed through the toolkit. Specifically, we tested our toolkit along a trail in the Nature Park of Terceira, situated in the Azores, a Portuguese volcanic archipelago in the North Atlantic. Here, we present and reflect on the data collected during one visit organized over two days with two groups of participants and one post-trail activity directed at both groups. Results demonstrate that the open-ended and playful nature of cultural probes offers a novel way to engage youths with nature-rich environments through questioning. This contribution further highlights the potential of cultural probes for instigating encounters that tap into the value of sensory, emotional, and aesthetic experience in nature, with positive outcomes for participants."
https://openalex.org/W4211072149,"The French syndromic surveillance (SyS) system, SurSaUD®, was one of the systems used to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak.This study described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19-related visits to both emergency departments (EDs) and the network of emergency general practitioners known as SOS Médecins (SOSMed) in France from 17 February to 28 June 2020.Data on all visits to 634 EDs and 60 SOSMed associations were collected daily. COVID-19-related visits were identified using ICD-10 codes after coding recommendations were sent to all ED and SOSMed doctors. The time course of COVID-19-related visits was described by age group and region. During the lockdown period, the characteristics of ED and SOSMed visits and hospitalisations after visits were described by age group and gender. The most frequent diagnoses associated with COVID-19-related visits were analysed.COVID-19 SyS was implemented on 29 February and 4 March for EDs and SOSMed, respectively. A total of 170,113 ED and 59,087 SOSMed visits relating to COVID-19 were recorded, representing 4.0% and 5.6% of the overall coded activity with a peak in late March representing 22.5% and 25% of all ED and SOSMed visits, respectively. COVID-19-related visits were most frequently reported for women and those aged 15-64 years, although patients who were subsequently hospitalised were more often men and persons aged 65 years and older.SyS allowed for population health monitoring of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. As SyS has more than 15 years of historical data with high quality and reliability, it was considered sufficiently robust to contribute to defining the post-lockdown strategy."

EP was induced at day 0 by the placement of a ligature around the mandibular left first molars. Ten animals per group/period were euthanized at 14, 22 and 37 days. Histopathological, histometric (percentage of bone in the furcation [PBF]) and immunohistochemical (for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP] and osteocalcin [OCN]) analyses were performed. Data were statistically analyzed.aPDT-pH1 showed the highest PBF as compared with the other treatments. Collectively, tissues' reaction to both dyes were controlled and healthy for the periodontium. Both aPDT protocols reduced the extent and intensity of the local inflammatory response, reduced the alveolar bone resorption, and promoted a better structural arrangement of the connective tissue as compared with SRP. TRAP expression was downregulated while OCN expression was upregulated by aPDT as compared with SRP alone.Our data implicate that the novel MB pH 1.0 is as safe as the conventional MB for use in aPDT and raises its additional benefit of increasing the amount of alveolar bone in the furcation."
https://openalex.org/W4211231202,"Bird-window collisions are a major source of human-caused avian mortality for which many mitigation and prevention options are available. However, because very little research has characterized human perspectives related to this issue, there is limited understanding about the most effective ways to engage the public in collision reduction efforts. To address this research need, we: (1) evaluated how two stakeholder groups, homeowners and conservation practitioners, prioritize potential benefits and obstacles related to bird-window collision management, (2) compared priorities between these groups, and (3) evaluated potential conflicts and collective strength of opinions within groups. We addressed these objectives by merging the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) survey approaches. Specifically, survey respondents made pairwise comparisons between strengths and weaknesses (respectively, direct outcomes and barriers related to management, such as fewer collisions and increased costs) and opportunities and threats (indirect outcomes and barriers, such as increased bird populations and fewer resources for other building-related expenses). Both homeowners and conservation practitioners ranked strengths and opportunities higher than weaknesses and threats, indicating they have an overall positive perception toward reducing bird-window collisions. However, key obstacles that were identified included costs of management and a lack of policy and guidelines to require or guide management. These results suggest that substantial advances can be made to reduce bird-window collisions because both homeowners and conservation practitioners had positive views, suggesting their receptivity toward collision management measures. However, because of more neutral views and conflicting responses within the homeowner group, results also highlight the importance of targeting homeowners with education materials that provide information about bird-window collisions and solutions that reduce them. Because bird-window collisions are a human-caused phenomenon, such information about human perspectives and priorities will be crucial to addressing this threat and thus benefitting bird populations."
https://openalex.org/W4210971824,"Vascular restenosis often presents as a consequence of injury to the vessel wall, resulting from stenting and other interventional procedures. Such injury to the arteries induces proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs), resulting in cellular hyperplasia and restenosis. We and others have previously reported de-novo production of different cytokines and growth factors such as Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Insulin like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), after vascular injury. As complex as it is, the profuse proliferation of VSMCs appears to be occurring due to several induced factors which initiate molecular mechanisms and exacerbate disease conditions. In many pathological events, the deleterious effects of TNF-α and IGF-1 in initiating disease mechanisms was reported. In the present work, we explored whether TNF-α and IGF-1 can regulate epigenetic mechanisms that promote proliferation of VSMCs. We investigated the mechanistic roles of proteins which can structurally interact with DNMT1 and initiate cellular pathways that promote proliferation of VSMCs. Our findings here, identify a novel molecular mechanism that is initiated by TNF-α and IGF-1. It was previously reported that DNMT1 expression is directly induced by TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment and increased/induced expression of DNMT1 causes silencing of genes that are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis such as the tumor suppressor genes. We have earlier reported that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment elevates DNMT1 expression in VSMCs and causes increased VSMC proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved were not fully deciphered. Interestingly, in the present study we found that TNF-α and IGF-1 treatment failed to elevate DNMT1 expression levels in absence of HDAC2 and HDAC10. Also, while HDAC2 expression was not affected by HDAC10 knockdown, HDAC2 is essentially required for HDAC10 expression. Further, in TNF-α and IGF-1 induced epigenetic signaling mechanism, the expression of two important proteins EZH2 and PCNA seem to be regulated in an HDAC2-HDAC10 dependent manner. Our results show an inter-dependence of epigenetic mediators in inducing proliferation in VSMCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows HDAC2 dependent expression of HDAC10, and suggests a novel mechanistic link between DNMT1, HDAC10 and HDAC2 that regulates EZH2 and PCNA to enhance cell proliferation of VSMCs which is the underlying cause for neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis."

https://openalex.org/W4211083885,"Neuroblastomas are one of the most common types of solid tumors in infants and children and are responsible for approximately 15% of childhood cancer deaths. Neuroblastomas rarely have mutations in p53, with less than 2% of NB containing mutations in p53, compared to up to 60% for other tumor classes. Previous studies on the therapeutic combination of a DNA damaging agent and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitor have shown that DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest can be specifically abrogated in p53-defective tumors. However, some p53-wildtype tumors have also been shown to be sensitive to this therapeutic combination, suggesting that these cells have other defects in the p53 response that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In the current study, we investigated the response to the combination of a DNA damaging agent (SN38) and a Chk1 inhibitor (UCN-01) of four p53-wildtype neuroblastoma cell lines: SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, and Lan-5. When the cells were treated with concentrations of SN38 ranging from 0-30 ng/ml, all four cell lines accumulated p53 which was phosphorylated on serines 15 and 20. However, only the SK-N-SH were found to activate p21waf1 and repress cyclin B. In order to assess sensitivity to UCN-01-mediated abrogation of cell cycle arrest, cell were treated with 10 ng/ml SN38 for 24 h, followed by 25 nM UCN-01 for 6 and 24 h. The SK-N-SH showed no sensitivity to UCN-01 treatment whereas the SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, and Lan-5 abrogated G2 arrest within 24 h. Our recent studies revealed that cells that are sensitive to checkpoint abrogation lack p53 dimers and tetramers, so we analyzed the oligomerization status of p53 in all four cell lines using glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The SK-N-SH cells possessed levels of p53 dimers and tetramers similar to what has previously been reported in p53-wildtype MCF10A cells. The SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS, and Lan-5 however, had extremely low to undetectable levels of dimers and tetramers. Our study also showed no cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 in these cells contrary to some previous reports. The results of this study suggest that oligomerization status may serve as an indicator of sensitivity of p53-wildtype tumors to the therapeutic combination of DNA damaging agent and Chk1 inhibitor."

This study was conducted to assess the developmental status and its associated factors among children under five years of slum areas of Butwal Sub Metropolitan City, Rupandehi, Nepal. Methods and findings We conducted a community-based cross-sectional descriptive study using Developmental Milestone Chart (DMC) among 165 children under five years. Ethical approval was obtained from Ethical Review Board of Nepal Health Research Council. R software was used for data analysis. The association between developmental status and associated factors were examined with Chi-square and followed by logistic regression. Notably, more than half of the children (56.4%) had delayed development across two or more domains of gross motor, fine motor, language/ speech, and social development. Age, sex, socio-economic status, availability of learning materials, the occurrence of infectious diseases, and height-for-age of children were found to be significantly associated with the developmental status of children under study (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions More than half of the children taken under the study had delayed development on different four domains. Findings from the study suggest that there should be similar studies conducted among children living in slum-like conditions. Additionally, programs should be designed as such which aims to mitigate the effect of socio-economic status on child development and has learning and nutritional aspects embedded central to its deliverance."

Consequently, countries have designed different health insurance programs to overcome financial barriers against health services utilization. Similarly, Ethiopia has been implementing community-based health insurance programs since 2011 to improve health care financing system. However, only a small number of people are enrolled which might be attributed to lack of willingness towards the program and the reasons for this remained under reported. This study was intended to examine willingness to join the community-based health insurance program and its associated factors in South Wollo, Northeast Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 households. A multistage systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit the study households. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and was exported into SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with a backward elimination method was performed to identify the determinants of willingness to join community-based health insurance. Finally, a statistically significant level was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05.Two hundred and ninety-three [73.6% (95%CI:68.8%-77.9%)] households were willing to join community-based health insurance programs. Being male headed household (AOR:0.2, 95%CI: 0.07-0.58), being a member of Idir (AOR:0.46, 95%CI: 0.25-.84), absence of chronic illness in the household (AOR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.77), and family size < 4 (AOR: 0.18, 95% CI:0.08-0.41) were barriers to join community-based health insurance program whereas rural residency (AOR:1.9, 95% CI: 1.09-3.32), perceived quality health services (AOR:2.96, 95%CI:1.4-6.24), and having positive attitude (AOR:4.1, 95%CI:2.32-7.22) and good knowledge to programs (AOR:2.62, 95%CI:1.43-4.8) were enabling factors.Nearly three-fourths of the households were willing to join community-based health insurance programs. However, different household and health service-related factors affected their willingness. The ministry of health with the regional and woreda health offices should work towards improving the quality of health services, conduct program advocacy and community sensitization towards the program, and build trust with the community."

Vitreous viscosity will affect the delivery, distribution, and half-life of intraocular drugs, and key physiological molecules. The central pig vitreous is thought to closely match human vitreous viscosity. Diffusion is inversely related to viscosity, and diffusion is of fundamental importance for all biochemical reactions. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) may provide a novel means of measuring intravitreal diffusion that could be applied to drugs and physiological macromolecules. It would also provide information about vitreous viscosity, which is relevant to drug elimination, and delivery.Vitreous viscosity and intravitreal macromolecular diffusion of fluorescently labelled macromolecules were investigated in porcine eyes using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated (FITC) dextrans and ficolls of varying molecular weights (MWs), and FITC-bovine serum albumin (BSA) were employed using FRAP bleach areas of different diameters.The mean (±standard deviation) viscosity of porcine vitreous using dextran, ficoll and BSA were 3.54 ± 1.40, 2.86 ± 1.13 and 4.54 ± 0.13 cP respectively, with an average of 3.65 ± 0.60 cP.FRAP is a feasible and practical optical method to quantify the diffusion of macromolecules through vitreous."
https://openalex.org/W4211253192,"Objectives Affective communication in outpatient care is important, especially in the palliative phase. Appropriate responses by healthcare providers to emotional cues or concerns let patients express their feelings and enhance information recall and patient satisfaction. Patients with limited health literacy experience more barriers in health-related communication and information, which makes recognizing their cues and concerns even more relevant. This study explores emotional cues/concerns expressed by patients with limited health literacy and evaluates healthcare providers’ responses to these utterances. Methods Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES), a consensus-based system for coding patients’ expression of emotional distress in medical consultations, was used in this exploratory observational study to analyse affective communication in video-recorded outpatient consultations. Consultations of 18 (10 female, 8 male) COPD or lung cancer patients (aged 70.3±6.8) with limited health literacy were recorded and analysed. Eight healthcare providers in four hospitals participated in the study. Results 101 cues and 11 concerns were observed, making 6.2 (SD = 4.2) cues or concerns per consultation. Healthcare provider responses were explicit in 56% and left scope for further disclosures in 58% of the cases. Patients with limited health literacy seem to express more cues or concerns than other patient populations. Healthcare providers responded roughly equally often in five different ways, but they shied away from further exploring the emotion disclosed in the cue/concern. Future research should elaborate on these exploratory observations, especially regarding why HCPs often only leave limited space for further disclosure of emotions in palliative care."

(1) Results show that the total green space area declined from 359.57 to 213.46 km2 over the study period. Green space large plaque index (LPI) and class area both gradually declined, whereas the number of plaques (NP) and plaque density (PD) gradually increased, indicating green space landscape fragmentation. (2) Additionally, the value of green space ecosystem services reduced from 397.42 to 124.93 million yuan. The dynamic degree of ESV change in green space increased or decreased moderately, always being < 0 and showing a decreasing trend of ESV. From a spatial variation perspective, dynamic degrees of ESV variation in the western and northern regions with relatively intensive green space were higher than those in the east. Regarding ESV of various green space types, forest land had the highest functional values of ecological regulation and support, whereas arable land provided the highest functional values of production supply. (3) The ecological service function value of green space system is negatively correlated with PD, NP, edge density, landscape shape index, and Shannon's diversity index, and positively correlated with aggregation index, contagion metrics, and LPI. The correlation coefficient between the climate regulation function of forest and the change of number of plaques is -0.874. The correlation coefficient of the recreation and culture of the wetland to the plaque density change is no less than -0.214."

Nevirapine single dose (sdNVP), sdNVP+AZT+3TC for MTCT prophylaxis and NVP+ AZT+3TC for treatment and PMTCT were withdrawn due to low genetic resistance barrier and low efficacy. However current PMTCT lines in Mozambique include DTG+3TC+TDF, TDF+3TC+EFV, DTG +ABC+3TC, and AZT + NVP syrup prophylaxis for exposed babies. We assessed NVP hair and plasma concentrations and association with HIV-1RNA suppression among HIV+ ante-partum and post-partum women under PMTCT in Maputo, Mozambique. Methods From December 2013 to November 2014, prospectively were enrolled 200 HIV+ ante-partum women on 200mg nevirapine and zidovudine 300 plus lamivudine 150mg twice daily at least with 3 months treatment and seen again at 24 weeks post-partum. Self-reported pill-taking adherence, NVP concentrations in hair, plasma, hemoglobin, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA load was evaluated. NVP concentration in hair and plasma was analyzed as categorical quartile variable based on better data fit. NVP concentration was set between ≤3.77 ng/ml in plasma and ≤17,20 ng/mg in hair in quartile one to ≥5.36 ng/ml in plasma and ≥53.21 ng/mg in hair in quartile four. Logistic regression models for repeated measures were calculated. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines we set viral suppression at HIV-1RNA &lt; 1000 c/mL. Outcome was HIV-1 RNA&lt;1000 copies/ml. Predictor was NVP concentration in hair categorized in quartiles. Results In total 369 person-visits (median of 1.85) were recorded. Self-reported adherence was 98% (IQR 97–100%) at ante-partum. In 25% person visits, NVP concentrations were within therapeutic levels (3.77 ng/ml to 5.35 ng/ml) in plasma and (17.20 ng/mg to 53.20 ng/mg) in hair. In 50% person visits NVP concentrations were above 5.36 ng/ml in plasm and 53.21 ng/mg in hair. HIV-1 RNA suppression was found in 34.7% of women with two viral loads, one at enrollment and another in post-partum. Odds of HIV-1 RNA suppression in quartile 4, was about 6 times higher than in quartile 1 (p-value = 0.006) for NVP hair concentration and 7 times for NVP plasma concentration (p-value = 0.012). Conclusions The study results alert for potential low efficacy of current PMTCT drug regimens in use in Mozambique. Affordable means for individual monitoring adherence, ART plasma and hair levels, drug resistant and HIV-1 RNA levels monitoring are recommended for prompt identification of inadequate drug regimens exposure patterns and adjust accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W4211104206,"The meaning of Publicness for organizations and for individuals has received growing attention in the public administration literature in recent years. We adopt a perceived publicness perspective to expand our understanding of the publicness concept and operationalize this perception as a means to predict employees' formal and prosocial behaviors across sectors. Using a recently developed Publicness Perceptions Scale (PPS), we present and empirically examine a model regarding the direct and indirect relationships among perceived publicness, employees' engagement, and their performance in public and hybrid organizations. Findings based on a field study of 340 employees from governmental (i.e. public) and non-governmental (i.e. hybrid) organizations reveal that perceived publicness has a positive relationship with Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCB) and that this relationship is largely mediated by employees' engagement. In addition, in non-government organizations perceived publicness is negatively related to employees' in-role performance. We thus contribute to the theoretical knowledge on publicness at the perceptual level and point to its role in formal and informal performance across sectors. Other theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed, and directions for future studies are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W4211114353,"The issue of decriminalization of medical marijuana has gained public attention globally due to the decisions of various governments in developed and developing countries who have decriminalized marijuana for medical purposes. The action was the result of the change in perception towards medical marijuana use, which is now believed to be safe, acceptable, and should be decriminalized. Due to the progress of modernization and the wide access to information, the change in perception towards medical marijuana seems to be inevitable and might have already permeated among the public in Malaysia. However, at the moment there is no baseline data to determine any of this claim.To determine the prevalence and factors associated with acceptance towards decriminalization of medical marijuana among adults in Selangor, Malaysia.The study was a cross-sectional study conducted in year 2021 among 462 adults aged 18 years old and above in Selangor, Malaysia. The respondents were sampled using a multistage random sampling. The data was collected via self-administered questionnaires and has been analyzed using SPSS version 25.More than half of the respondents in this study (64.7%) show acceptance towards the decriminalization of medical marijuana in Malaysia. The results of statistical tests indicate that there are significant associations between age (p < 0.001), gender (p = 0.005), ethnicity (p < 0.012), level of education (p < 0.011), employment status (p = 0.001), ever smoked (p < 0.001), given up smoking (p = 0.002), ever used substance (p < 0.001), current substance use (p < 0.001), given up substance (p < 0.001), exposure to medical marijuana-related content (p < 0.001), perceived risk associated with medical marijuana use (p < 0.001), perceived risk of harm of medical marijuana use (p < 0.001), and perceived approval of medical marijuana use (p < 0.001) with acceptance towards decriminalization of medical marijuana. The predictors for acceptance towards decriminalization of medical marijuana are perceived high approval of medical marijuana use (aOR = 7.023, p < 0.001, 95%CI = 3.534,13.955), perceived low risk of medical marijuana (aOR = 5.716, p < 0.001, 95%CI = 2.828,11.554), perceived low risk of harm from medical marijuana use (aOR = 3.480, p = 0.001, 95%CI = 1.702,7.114), current substance use (aOR = 2.264, p = 0.050, 95%CI = 1.001,5.118), and ever used substance (aOR = 2.005, p = 0.004, 95% CI = 0.054,0.576).The results of the survey show that the current acceptance level towards decriminalization of medical marijuana is considerably high. However, the acceptance is mainly among those who are exposed to the substance and those who perceive low risk of medical marijuana. Thus, a further exploration of this phenomenon is needed, especially by increasing the sample size and expanding the study location to other states."

Trial registration: ISRCTN85156148.This study was conducted in Lima, Peru among participants ages 13-17 years. Eligible participants were randomized into one of three arms: Arm 1: access to ARMADILLO's SMS information on-demand; Arm 2 access to ARMADILLO SMS information pushed to their phone; Arm 3 control (no SMS). The intervention period lasted seven weeks. At baseline, endline, and follow-up (eight weeks following endline), participants were assessed on a variety of contraception-related myths and misconceptions. An index of myths-believed was generated. The primary outcome assessed the subject-specific change in the mean score between baseline and endline. Knowledge retention from endline to follow-up was also assessed, as was a 'content exposure' outcome, which assessed change in participants' knowledge based on relevant SMS received.In total, 712 participants were randomized to the three arms: 659 completed an endline assessment and were included in the primary analysis. Arm 2 participants believed fewer myths at endline compared with control arm participants (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -3.69% [-6.17%, -1.21%], p = 0.004). There was no significant difference between participants in Arm 1 vs. the control Arm, or between participants in Arm 1 vs. Arm 2. A further decrease in myths believed between endline and follow-up (knowledge retention) was observed in all arms; however, there was no difference between arms. The content exposure analysis saw significant reductions in myths believed for Arm 1 (estimated subject-specific mean difference of -9.47% [-14.83%, -4.11%], p = .001) and Arm 2 (-5.93% [-8.57%, -3.29%], p < .001) as compared with the control arm; however Arm 1's reduced sample size (n = 28) is a severe limitation.The ARMADILLO SMS content has a significant (but small) effect on participants' contraception-related knowledge. Standalone, adolescent SRH digital health interventions may affect only modest change. Instead, digital is probably best used a complementary channel to expand the reach of existing validated SRH information and service programs."

https://openalex.org/W4211199039,"Past work has suggested that perception of object distances in natural scenes depends on the environmental surroundings, even when the physical object distance remains constant. The cue bases for such effects remain unclear and are difficult to study systematically in real-world settings, given the challenges in manipulating large environmental features reliably and efficiently. Here, we used rendered scenes and crowdsourced data collection to address these challenges. In 4 experiments involving 452 participants, we investigated the effect of room width and depth on egocentric distance judgments. Targets were placed at distances of 2-37 meters in rendered rooms that varied in width (1.5-40 meters) and depth (6-40 meters). We found large and reliable effects of room width: Average judgments for the farthest targets in a 40-meter-wide room were between 16-33% larger than for the same target distances seen in a 1.5-meter-wide hallway. Egocentric distance cues and focal length were constant across room widths, highlighting the role of environmental context in judging distances in natural scenes. Obscuring the fine-grained ground texture, per se, is not primarily responsible for the width effect, nor does linear perspective play a strong role. However, distance judgments tended to decrease when doors and/or walls obscured more distant regions of the scene. We discuss how environmental features may be used to calibrate relative distance cues for egocentric distance judgments."

In total, 514 Korean adolescents (aged 12–16 years) were recruited nationwide. All participants gave informed consent and completed the online self-report measures on NSSI, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. Thereafter, preliminary items were developed through a series of steps: literature review, ratings of experts on self-harm and suicide, and statistical analyses. Ten of the 20 preliminary items were eliminated after exploratory factor analysis due to low endorsement and factor loading (less than .70). The final version of the SHSI comprised 10 binary items relating to self-harm behaviors within the past year (e.g., cut my body with sharp objects, hit my body). A confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor structure, as hypothesized. The one-factor model had a good model fit ( x 2 (35) = 84.958, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .053, CFI = .981, TLI = .975, SRMR = .124). The SHSI also had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .795) and 4-week test-retest reliability ( r = .786, p &lt; .01). The SHSI had high correlations with another self-harm related scale, the Self-Harm Inventory ( r = .773, p &lt; .01), and moderate correlations with the Child Depression Inventory ( r = .484, p &lt; .01) and Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale ( r = .433, p &lt; .01). Additionally, the SHSI was negatively correlated with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale ( r = -.399, p &lt; .01). The findings indicate that the SHSI is a reliable and valid measure for the screening of self-harm behaviors among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4225881373,"Pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) localized on the host plasma membrane. These receptors activate a broad-spectrum and durable defense, which are desired characteristics for disease resistance in plant breeding programs. In this study, candidate sequences for PRRs with lysin motifs (LysM) were investigated in the Coffea arabica genome. For this, approaches based on the principle of sequence similarity, conservation of motifs and domains, phylogenetic analysis, and modulation of gene expression in response to Hemileia vastatrix were used. The candidate sequences for PRRs in C . arabica ( Ca1-LYP , Ca2-LYP , Ca1-CERK1 , Ca2-CERK1 , Ca-LYK4 , Ca1-LYK5 and Ca2-LYK5 ) showed high similarity with the reference PRRs used: Os-CEBiP , At-CERK1 , At-LYK4 and At-LYK5 . Moreover, the ectodomains of these sequences showed high identity or similarity with the reference sequences, indicating structural and functional conservation. The studied sequences are also phylogenetically related to the reference PRRs described in Arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species. All candidates for receptors had their expression induced after the inoculation with H . vastatrix , since the first time of sampling at 6 hours post‐inoculation (hpi). At 24 hpi, there was a significant increase in expression, for most of the receptors evaluated, and at 48 hpi, a suppression. The results showed that the candidate sequences for PRRs in the C . arabica genome display high homology with fungal PRRs already described in the literature. Besides, they respond to pathogen inoculation and seem to be involved in the perception or signaling of fungal chitin, acting as receptors or co-receptors of this molecule. These findings represent an advance in the understanding of the basal immunity of this species."
https://openalex.org/W4210950326,"Beyrichitine ammonoids of NV Nevada reveal a high taxonomic diversity of Anisian (Middle Triassic). This diversity is, however, in contrast to their relatively low morphologic disparity. Depending on the exact definition, morphologic disparity of a data set is a direct consequence of the sum of all ontogenetic changes. In the past, however, the interplay of both morphological processes has only rarely been addressed. Using geometric morphometric methods, this study aims at a quantification of allometric processes and the morphologic disparity of beyrichitine ammonoids. The multivariate statistical analysis revealed that morphologic disparity, intraspecific variation respectively, within and between the studied species seems to be the result of deviations in the ontogenetic allometric growth pattern (i.e. heterochrony). During deposition of the studied stratigraphic sequence, a general progressive pedomorphism (juvenilization) was observed. The intraspecific variability pattern coincides with the total morphologic disparity of the analyzed species, which suggests that intraspecific variability facilitated morphologic disparity. The comparison of ontogenetic allometric patterns and changes in intraspecific variation and morphologic disparity are likely to refine our understanding of the intrinsic factors influencing the speciation of this group."
https://openalex.org/W4210967254,"The metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is not considered in most current walking assistive devices even though it plays an important role during walking. The purpose of this study was to develop a new MTP assistive device and investigate its effectiveness on the muscle activities of the lower extremities during walking while wearing the device. The MTP assistive device is designed to support MTP flexion by transmitting force through a cable that runs parallel with the plantar fascia. Eight participants were instructed to walk at a constant speed on a treadmill while wearing the device. The muscle activities of their lower extremities and MTP joint kinematics were obtained during walking under both actuated and non-actuated conditions. Paired t-tests were performed to compare the differences in each dependent variable between the two conditions. The muscle activity of the MTP flexor was significantly reduced during walking under actuated conditions (p = 0.013), whereas no differences were found in the muscle activities of other muscles or in the MTP joint angle between actuated and non-actuated conditions (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, the cable-driven MTP assistive device is able to properly assist the MTP flexor without interfering with the action of other muscles in the lower extremities; as such, this MTP assistive device, when integrated into existing exoskeleton designs, has the potential to offer improved walking assistance by reducing the amount of muscle activity needed from the MTP flexor."
https://openalex.org/W4211083006,"Pancreatic transplantation is associated with a high rate of early postoperative graft thrombosis. If a thrombosis is detected in time, a potentially graft-saving intervention can be initiated. Current postoperative monitoring lacks tools for early detection of ischemia. The aim of this study was to investigate if microdialysis and tissue pCO2 sensors detect pancreatic ischemia and whether intraparenchymal and organ surface measurements are comparable.In 8 anaesthetized pigs, pairs of lactate monitoring microdialysis catheters and tissue pCO2 sensors were simultaneously inserted into the parenchyma and attached to the surface of the pancreas. Ischemia was induced by sequential arterial and venous occlusions of 45-minute duration, with two-hour reperfusion after each occlusion. Microdialysate was analyzed every 15 minutes. Tissue pCO2 was measured continuously. We investigated how surface and parenchymal measurements correlated and the capability of lactate and pCO2 to discriminate ischemic from non-ischemic periods.Ischemia was successfully induced by arterial occlusion in 8 animals and by venous occlusion in 5. During all ischemic episodes, lactate increased with a fold change of 3.2-9.5 (range) in the parenchyma and 1.7-7.6 on the surface. Tissue pCO2 increased with a fold change of 1.6-3.5 in the parenchyma and 1.3-3.0 on the surface. Systemic lactate and pCO2 remained unchanged. The area under curve (AUC) for lactate was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.00) for parenchymal and 0.90 (0.83-0.97) for surface (p<0.001 for both). For pCO2 the AUC was 0.93 (0.89-0.96) for parenchymal and 0.85 (0.81-0.90) for surface (p<0.001 for both). The median correlation coefficients between parenchyma and surface were 0.90 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.77-0.95) for lactate and 0.93 (0.89-0.97) for pCO2.Local organ monitoring with microdialysis and tissue pCO2 sensors detect pancreatic ischemia with adequate correlation between surface and parenchymal measurements. Both techniques and locations seem feasible for further development of clinical pancreas monitoring."
