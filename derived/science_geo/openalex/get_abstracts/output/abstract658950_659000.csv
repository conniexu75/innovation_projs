https://openalex.org/W3082105308,"Background Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload and stress. Understanding HCPs’ risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs’ self-assessment of burnout, indicated by a single item measure of emotional exhaustion, and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR = 1·57, 95% CI = 1·39–1·78, P<0·001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR = 1·32, 95% CI = 1·20–1·47, P<0·001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR = 1·18, 95% CI = 1·05–1·32, P = 0·005), and making life prioritizing decisions (RR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·02–1·31, P = 0·03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR = 0·88, 95% CI = 0·79–0·97, P = 0·01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR = 1·18; 95% CI = 1·02–1·36, P = 0·018). Interpretation Burnout is present at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, and support for family, PPE, and mental health resources."

https://openalex.org/W3081592776,"Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with high energy density that can be safely charged and discharged at high rates are desirable for electrified transportation and other applications1–3. However, the sub-optimal intercalation potentials of current anodes result in a trade-off between energy density, power and safety. Here we report that disordered rock salt4,5 Li3+xV2O5 can be used as a fast-charging anode that can reversibly cycle two lithium ions at an average voltage of about 0.6 volts versus a Li/Li+ reference electrode. The increased potential compared to graphite6,7 reduces the likelihood of lithium metal plating if proper charging controls are used, alleviating a major safety concern (short-circuiting related to Li dendrite growth). In addition, a lithium-ion battery with a disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 anode yields a cell voltage much higher than does a battery using a commercial fast-charging lithium titanate anode or other intercalation anode candidates (Li3VO4 and LiV0.5Ti0.5S2)8,9. Further, disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 can perform over 1,000 charge–discharge cycles with negligible capacity decay and exhibits exceptional rate capability, delivering over 40 per cent of its capacity in 20 seconds. We attribute the low voltage and high rate capability of disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 to a redistributive lithium intercalation mechanism with low energy barriers revealed via ab initio calculations. This low-potential, high-rate intercalation reaction can be used to identify other metal oxide anodes for fast-charging, long-life lithium-ion batteries. A vanadium-based lithium-rich disordered rock salt oxide is shown to work as a low-potential anode with rapid intercalation kinetics for lithium-ion batteries."
https://openalex.org/W3082714866,"Chromosomal instability in cancer consists of dynamic changes to the number and structure of chromosomes1,2. The resulting diversity in somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) may provide the variation necessary for tumour evolution1,3,4. Here we use multi-sample phasing and SCNA analysis of 1,421 samples from 394 tumours across 22 tumour types to show that continuous chromosomal instability results in pervasive SCNA heterogeneity. Parallel evolutionary events, which cause disruption in the same genes (such as BCL9, MCL1, ARNT (also known as HIF1B), TERT and MYC) within separate subclones, were present in 37% of tumours. Most recurrent losses probably occurred before whole-genome doubling, that was found as a clonal event in 49% of tumours. However, loss of heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and loss of chromosome 8p to a single haploid copy recurred at substantial subclonal frequencies, even in tumours with whole-genome doubling, indicating ongoing karyotype remodelling. Focal amplifications that affected chromosomes 1q21 (which encompasses BCL9, MCL1 and ARNT), 5p15.33 (TERT), 11q13.3 (CCND1), 19q12 (CCNE1) and 8q24.1 (MYC) were frequently subclonal yet appeared to be clonal within single samples. Analysis of an independent series of 1,024 metastatic samples revealed that 13 focal SCNAs were enriched in metastatic samples, including gains in chromosome 8q24.1 (encompassing MYC) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and chromosome 11q13.3 (encompassing CCND1) in HER2+ breast cancer. Chromosomal instability may enable the continuous selection of SCNAs, which are established as ordered events that often occur in parallel, throughout tumour evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3082569211,"Cosmological models in which dark matter consists of cold elementary particles predict that the dark halo population should extend to masses many orders of magnitude below those at which galaxies can form1–3. Here we report a cosmological simulation of the formation of present-day haloes over the full range of observed halo masses (20 orders of magnitude) when dark matter is assumed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles of mass approximately 100 gigaelectronvolts. The simulation has a full dynamic range of 30 orders of magnitude in mass and resolves the internal structure of hundreds of Earth-mass haloes in as much detail as it does for hundreds of rich galaxy clusters. We find that halo density profiles are universal over the entire mass range and are well described by simple two-parameter fitting formulae4,5. Halo mass and concentration are tightly related in a way that depends on cosmology and on the nature of the dark matter. For a fixed mass, the concentration is independent of the local environment for haloes less massive than those of typical galaxies. Haloes over the mass range of 10−3 to 1011 solar masses contribute about equally (per logarithmic interval) to the luminosity produced by dark matter annihilation, which we find to be smaller than all previous estimates by factors ranging up to one thousand3. Simulations of formation of dark matter haloes ranging in size from Earth mass to clusters of galaxies find a universal halo density structure spanning 20 orders of magnitude in mass."
https://openalex.org/W3082639090,"Loss of normal tissue architecture is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation1. In developing organisms, tissues architectures are sculpted by mechanical forces during morphogenesis2. However, the origins and consequences of tissue architecture during tumorigenesis remain elusive. In skin, premalignant basal cell carcinomas form 'buds', while invasive squamous cell carcinomas initiate as 'folds'. Here, using computational modelling, genetic manipulations and biophysical measurements, we identify the biophysical underpinnings and biological consequences of these tumour architectures. Cell proliferation and actomyosin contractility dominate tissue architectures in monolayer, but not multilayer, epithelia. In stratified epidermis, meanwhile, softening and enhanced remodelling of the basement membrane promote tumour budding, while stiffening of the basement membrane promotes folding. Additional key forces stem from the stratification and differentiation of progenitor cells. Tumour-specific suprabasal stiffness gradients are generated as oncogenic lesions progress towards malignancy, which we computationally predict will alter extensile tensions on the tumour basement membrane. The pathophysiologic ramifications of this prediction are profound. Genetically decreasing the stiffness of basement membranes increases membrane tensions in silico and potentiates the progression of invasive squamous cell carcinomas in vivo. Our findings suggest that mechanical forces-exerted from above and below progenitors of multilayered epithelia-function to shape premalignant tumour architectures and influence tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W3049719740,"Most cancer genomic data are generated from bulk samples composed of mixtures of cancer subpopulations, as well as normal cells. Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called MOBSTER, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3082152862,"Gene expression in eukaryotes requires the effective separation of nuclear transcription and RNA processing from cytosolic translation1. This separation is achieved by the nuclear envelope, which controls the exchange of macromolecules through nuclear pores2. During mitosis, however, the nuclear envelope in animal and plant cells disassembles, allowing cytoplasmic and nuclear components to intermix3. When the nuclear envelope is reformed, cytoplasmic components are removed from the nucleus by receptor-mediated transport through nuclear pores2. These pores have a size limit of 39 nanometres4–7, which raises the question of how larger cytoplasmic molecules are cleared from the nucleus. Here we show in HeLa cells that large cytoplasmic components are displaced before nuclear envelope assembly by the movement of chromosomes to a dense cluster. This clustering occurs when chromosomes approach the poles of anaphase spindles, and is mediated by a microtubule-independent mechanism that involves the surfactant-like protein Ki-67. Ki-67 forms repulsive molecular brushes during the early stages of mitosis8, but during mitotic exit the brushes collapse and Ki-67 promotes chromosome clustering. We show that the exclusion of mature ribosomes from the nucleus after mitosis depends on Ki-67-regulated chromosome clustering. Thus, our study reveals that chromosome mechanics help to re-establish the compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells after open mitosis. The surfactant-like protein Ki-67 mediates the clustering of chromosomes during mitotic exit, which displaces large cytoplasmic molecules from the future nuclear space and thus enables the separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear components before the nuclear envelope reforms."
https://openalex.org/W3082363786,"Scanning probe techniques can leverage atomically precise forces to sculpt matter at surfaces, atom by atom. These forces have been applied quasi-statically to create surface structures1–7 and influence chemical processes8,9, but exploiting local dynamics10–14 to realize coherent control on the atomic scale remains an intriguing prospect. Chemical reactions15–17, conformational changes18,19 and desorption20 have been followed on ultrafast timescales, but directly exerting femtosecond forces on individual atoms to selectively induce molecular motion has yet to be realized. Here we show that the near field of a terahertz wave confined to an atomically sharp tip provides femtosecond atomic-scale forces that selectively induce coherent hindered rotation in the molecular frame of a bistable magnesium phthalocyanine molecule. Combining lightwave-driven scanning tunnelling microscopy21–24 with ultrafast action spectroscopy10,13, we find that the induced rotation modulates the probability of the molecule switching between its two stable adsorption geometries by up to 39 per cent. Mapping the response of the molecule in space and time confirms that the force acts on the atomic scale and within less than an optical cycle (that is, faster than an oscillation period of the carrier wave of light). We anticipate that our strategy might ultimately enable the coherent manipulation of individual atoms within single molecules or solids so that chemical reactions and ultrafast phase transitions can be manipulated on their intrinsic spatio-temporal scales. The near field of a terahertz wave confined to a scanning probe tip provides femtosecond atomic-scale forces that coherently modulate the switching probability of a molecule between two stable adsorption geometries."
https://openalex.org/W3082857413,"Introductions of species by humans are causing the homogenization of species composition across biogeographic barriers1–3. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of introduced species derive from their effects on networks of species interactions4,5, but we lack a quantitative understanding of the impacts of introduced species on ecological networks and their biogeographic patterns globally. Here we address this data gap by analysing mutualistic seed-dispersal interactions from 410 local networks, encompassing 24,455 unique pairwise interactions between 1,631 animal and 3,208 plant species. We show that species introductions reduce biogeographic compartmentalization of the global meta-network, in which nodes are species and links are interactions observed within any local network. This homogenizing effect extends across spatial scales, decreasing beta diversity among local networks and modularity within networks. The prevalence of introduced interactions is directly related to human environmental modifications and is accelerating, having increased sevenfold over the past 75 years. These dynamics alter the coevolutionary environments that mutualists experience6, and we find that introduced species disproportionately interact with other introduced species. These processes are likely to amplify biotic homogenization in future ecosystems7 and may reduce the resilience of ecosystems by allowing perturbations to propagate more quickly and exposing disparate ecosystems to similar drivers. Our results highlight the importance of managing the increasing homogenization of ecological complexity. A quantitative analysis of the impact of species introductions on mutualistic seed-dispersal networks indicates that introduced species are increasingly erasing natural patterns of network biodiversity."

However, there is a lack of information on the characteristics of this disease in the Spanish population. The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data, signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 ± 13.1 vs. 62.8 ± 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population. Further studies are needed to complete and confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3081725073,"The masses of the lightest atomic nuclei and the electron mass1 are interlinked, and their values affect observables in atomic2, molecular3–5 and neutrino physics6, as well as metrology. The most precise values for these fundamental parameters come from Penning trap mass spectrometry, which achieves relative mass uncertainties of the order of 10−11. However, redundancy checks using data from different experiments reveal considerable inconsistencies in the masses of the proton, the deuteron and the helion (the nucleus of helium-3), suggesting that the uncertainty of these values may have been underestimated. Here we present results from absolute mass measurements of the deuteron and the HD+ molecular ion using 12C as a mass reference. Our value for the deuteron mass, 2.013553212535(17) atomic mass units, has better precision than the CODATA value7 by a factor of 2.4 and differs from it by 4.8 standard deviations. With a relative uncertainty of eight parts per trillion, this is the most precise mass value measured directly in atomic mass units. Furthermore, our measurement of the mass of the HD+ molecular ion, 3.021378241561(61) atomic mass units, not only allows a rigorous consistency check of our results for the masses of the deuteron (this work) and the proton8, but also establishes an additional link for the masses of tritium9 and helium-3 (ref. 10) to the atomic mass unit. Combined with a recent measurement of the deuteron-to-proton mass ratio11, the uncertainty of the reference value of the proton mass7 can be reduced by a factor of three. Penning trap mass spectrometry is used to measure the masses of the deuteron and the HD+ ion with unprecedented precision, reducing the uncertainty of the proton mass reference value."
https://openalex.org/W3082970249,"When placed over a less dense medium, a liquid layer will typically collapse downwards if it exceeds a certain size, as gravity acting on the lower liquid interface triggers a destabilizing effect called a Rayleigh–Taylor instability1,2. Of the many methods that have been developed to prevent the liquid from falling3–6, vertical shaking has proved to be efficient and has therefore been studied in detail7–13. Stabilization is the result of the dynamical averaging effect of the oscillating effective gravity. Vibrations of liquids also induce other paradoxical phenomena such as the sinking of air bubbles14–19 or the stabilization of heavy objects in columns of fluid at unexpected heights20. Here we take advantage of the excitation resonance of the supporting air layer to perform experiments with large levitating liquid layers of up to half a litre in volume and up to 20 centimetres in width. Moreover, we predict theoretically and show experimentally that vertical shaking also creates stable buoyancy positions on the lower interface of the liquid, which behave as though the gravitational force were inverted. Bodies can thus float upside down on the lower interface of levitating liquid layers. We use our model to predict the minimum excitation needed to withstand falling of such an inverted floater, which depends on its mass. Experimental observations confirm the possibility of selective falling of heavy bodies. Our findings invite us to rethink all interfacial phenomena in this exotic and counter-intuitive stable configuration. Manipulation of the effective gravity of an oscillating liquid creates stable buoyancy in the lower surface of a liquid layer levitating above air, allowing bodies to float upside down."

To achieve and monitor progress towards elimination, an updated estimate of the size of the CHC population is needed, but Denmark has no complete national CHC register. By combining existing registers in 2007, we estimated the population living with CHC to be 16,888 (0.38% of the adult population).To estimate the population living with diagnosed and undiagnosed CHC in Denmark on 31 December 2016. Among additional aims were to estimate the proportion of patients attending specialised clinical care.People with diagnosed CHC were identified from four national registers. The total diagnosed population was estimated by capture-recapture analysis. The undiagnosed population was estimated by comparing the register data with data from two cross-sectional surveys.The population living with diagnosed CHC in Denmark was 7,581 persons (95%CI: 7,416-12,661) of which 6,116 (81%) were identified in the four registers. The estimated undiagnosed fraction was 24%, so the total CHC infected population was 9,975 corresponding to 0.21% of the adult population (95%CI: 9,758-16,659; 0.21%-0.36%). Only 48% of diagnosed patients had received specialised clinical care.CHC prevalence in Denmark is declining and 76% of patients have been diagnosed. Linking diagnosed patients to care and increasing efforts to test people with former or current drug use will be necessary to achieve CHC elimination."
https://openalex.org/W3083339707,"Introduction Renal hyperfiltration (RHF) has been found to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcome. However, it remains uncertain whether it is precursor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a healthy population. Materials and methods To determine relative risks and identify the predictor of incident proteinuria and decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with RHF. A total of 55,992 subjects aged ≥20 years who underwent health check-up during 2004–2017 were included. Among them, 16,946 subjects who completed at least two health checkups were analyzed. Results A total of 949 (5.6%) subjects developed proteinuria and 98 (0.6%) subjects showed ≥ 30% of eGFR decline. The risk of incident proteinuria was significantly higher in those with RHF (RR: 1.644; 95% CI: 1.064–2.541). Those with RHF showed 8.720 fold (95% CI: 4.205–18.081) increased risk for ≥30% decline. ESR, CRP, and monocyte count showed reversed J shaped curve according to the increase of eGFR. The adjusted mean of monocyte count was significantly higher in participants with eGFR ≥90ml/min/1.73m2 or < 60ml/min/1.73m2 compared to that in patients with eGFR 75-89ml/min/1.73m2. Compared to subjects with the lowest tertile of monocyte and no RHF, those with the highest tertile of monocyte count in the RHF group had 3.314-fold (95% CI: 1.893–5.802) higher risk of incident proteinuria and 3.822-fold (95% CI, 1.327–11.006) risk of 30% eGFR decline. Conclusions RHF had significantly increased risk of developing proteinuria and CKD in healthy subjects. Higher monocyte count might be used as a predictor of CKD in subjects with RHF."
https://openalex.org/W3083094683,"Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) is a chronic granulomatous enteritis, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), responsible for important economic losses in the dairy industry. Current diagnostic methods have low sensitivities for detection of latent forms of MAP infection, defined by focal granulomatous lesions and scarce humoral response or MAP presence. In contrast, patent infections correspond to multifocal and diffuse types of enteritis where there is increased antibody production, and substantial mycobacterial load. Our previous RNA-Seq analysis allowed the selection of five candidate biomarkers overexpressed in peripheral blood of MAP infected Holstein cows with focal (ABCA13 and MMP8) and diffuse (FAM84A, SPARC and DES) lesions vs. control animals with no detectable PTB-associated lesions in intestine and regional lymph nodes. The aim of the current study was to assess the PTB diagnostic potential of commercial ELISAs designed for the specific detection of these biomarkers. The ability of these ELISAs to identify animals with latent and/or patent forms of MAP infection was investigated using serum from naturally infected cattle (n = 88) and non-infected control animals (n = 67). ROC analysis revealed that the ABCA13-based ELISA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of infected animals with focal lesions (AUC 0.837, sensitivity 79.25% and specificity 88.06%) and with any type of histological lesion (AUC 0.793, sensitivity 69.41% and specificity 86.57%) improving on the diagnostic performance of the popular IDEXX ELISA and other conventional diagnostic methods. SPARC and MMP8 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of animals with multifocal (AUC 0.852) and diffuse lesions (AUC 0.831), respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that quantification of ABCA13, SPARC and MMP8 by ELISA has the potential for implementation as a diagnostic tool to reliably identify MAP infection, greatly improving early detection of MAP latent infections when antibody responses and fecal shedding are undetectable using conventional diagnostic methods."
https://openalex.org/W3083072748,"There are currently many tools available for capturing and defining the context of one's environment. Digital phenotyping, the use of technology and sensors to capture moment-to-moment behavior, has shown potential in quantifying the lived experience of mental illness and in the identification of individualized targets related to recovery. Environmental data suggests that greenspace may have a restorative capacity on mental health. In this paper, we explore the relationship of greenspace derived from geolocation with self-reported symptomatology from individuals with schizophrenia as well as healthy controls. Individuals with schizophrenia had less exposure to greenspace than controls, but their exposure demonstrated a dosage effect: high greenspace environments were associated with lower symptoms for anxiety (Cohen's d = -0.70), depression (d = -0.97), and psychosis (d = -0.94), whereas effect sizes for healthy controls were all negligible or small (d < 0.38). The notion that greenspace may have a more pronounced effect on individuals with mental illness presents both potential areas for recovery as well as implications for health care policy, especially in cities with a broad range of greenspace environments."

In Rwanda, CHWs provide village-level care focused on maternal/child health, control of infectious diseases, and health education, but do not receive salaries for these services. CHWs make up the largest single group involved in health delivery in the country; however, limited information is available regarding the socio-economic circumstances and satisfaction levels of this workforce. Such information can support governments aiming to control infectious diseases and alleviate poverty through enhanced healthcare delivery. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate CHW opportunity costs, (2) identify drivers for CHW motivation, job satisfaction and care provision, and (3) report CHW ideas for improving retention and service delivery. In this mixed-methods study, our team conducted in-depth interviews with 145 CHWs from three districts (Kirehe, Kayonza, Burera) to collect information on household economics and experiences in delivering healthcare. Across the three districts, CHWs contributed approximately four hours of volunteer work per day (range: 0-12 hrs/day), which translated to 127 684 RWF per year (range: 2 359-2 247 807 RWF/yr) in lost personal income. CHW out-of-pocket expenditures (e.g. patient transportation) were estimated at 36 228 RWF per year (range: 3 600-364 800 RWF/yr). Participants identified many benefits to being CHWs, including free healthcare training, improved social status, and the satisfaction of helping others. They also identified challenges, such as aging equipment, discrepancies in financial reimbursements, poverty, and lack of formal workspaces or working hours. Lastly, CHWs provided perspectives on reasonable and feasible improvements to village-level health programming that could improve conditions and equity for those providing and using the CHW system."

We ran a prospective pilot in 3 MELAS sibs (m.3243A>G tRNALeu(UUR)) with variable % mutant blood mtDNA to assess effects of L-Arginine (L-Arg) (single dose and 6-wk steady-state trial) on regional CBF, arterial CVR and neurovascular coupling.Patients were studied with 3T MRI using arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure CBF and changes in % Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal to changes in arterial partial pressure of CO2 to measure CVR. Task fMRI consisted of an alternating black and white checkerboard to evaluate visual cortex response in MELAS and controls.Following L-Arg, there was restoration of serum Arg (76-230 μM) in MELAS sibs and a trend towards increasing CVR in frontal and corresponding decrease in occipital cortex; CVR was unchanged globally. There was a 29-37% reduction in baseline CBF in one patient following 6 wks of L-Arg. Pre-treatment fMRI activation in response to visual cortex stimulus was markedly decreased in the same patient compared to controls in primary visual striate cortex V1 and extrastriate regions V2 to V5 with a marked increase toward control values following a single dose and 6 wks of L-Arg.Proposed ""healing"" effect may be due to more efficient utilization of energy substrates with increased cellular energy balances and ensuing reduction in signalling pathways that augment flow in the untreated state.This prospective pilot study provides Class III evidence that oral L-Arginine (100 mg/kg single dose or 100 mg/kg three times daily po X 6 weeks) normalizes resting blood flow from elevated pre-treatment levels in patients with MELAS syndrome, selectively increases their CVR from reduced pre-treatment levels in regions most impaired at the expense of less abnormal regions, and normalizes reduced BOLD fMRI activation in response to visual cortex stimulus.NCT01603446."

Results: (1) The positive rate of childhood psychological maltreatment, referring to sustained and repeated experiencing at least one kind of psychological maltreatment, was reported by accounted for 33.87% of participants; (2) a significant positive correlation existed between childhood psychological maltreatment, immorality, and cyberbullying perpetration attitudes. However, these variables were negatively correlated with empathy (cognitive and affective empathy); and (3) there were three mediating paths: childhood psychological maltreatment was linked to cyberbullying perpetration attitudes of male college students through the mediating roles of cognitive empathy and immorality and the chain-mediating role of cognitive empathy and immorality. Conclusions: Greater experience of childhood psychological maltreatment predicted more favorable attitudes toward cyberbullying perpetration among male college students, mediated by cognitive empathy and immorality. These findings may assist parents and educators by providing effective intervention for cyberbullying perpetration attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3083473040,"Background In Ethiopia, uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition is managed through the outpatient therapeutic program at health posts level. This brings the services for the management of Severe Acute Malnutrition closer to the community by making services available at decentralized treatment points within the primary health care settings. So far, evidence of the treatment outcome of the program is limited. Objective The main aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of treatment outcomes of severe acute malnutrition and associated factors among under-five children at outpatient therapeutic feeding units in Gubalafto Wereda, Ethiopia, 2019. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted on 600 children who had been managed for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) under Outpatient Therapeutic Program (OTP) in Gubalafto Wereda from April to May/2019. The children were selected using systematic random sampling from 9 health posts. The structured, pre-tested, and adapted questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data was entered by using EPI-data Version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. Bivariate and Multivariate regression was also carried out to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Results A total of 600 records of children with a diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition were reviewed. Of these cases of malnutrition, the recovery rate was found to be 65%. The death rate, default rate, and medical transfer were 2.0, 16.0, and 17.0 respectively. Immunized children had 6.85 times higher odds of recovery than children who were not immunized (AOR = 6.85 at 95% CI (3.68–12.76)). The likelihood of recovery was 3.78 times higher among children with new admission than those with re-admission (AOR = 3.78at 95% CI ((1.77–8.07))). Likewise, children provided with amoxicillin were 3.38 times recovered than their counterparts (AOR = 3.38 at 95% CI ((1.61–7.08))). SAM treatment in OTP is beneficial because of its local access for most severe cases since children reach early before developing complications as a result fatalities will be reduced. Conclusions The recovery rate and medical transfer were lower than the sphere standard. Presence of cough, presence of diarrhea admission category, provision of amoxicillin, and immunization status were factors identified as significantly associated with treatment outcome of severe acute malnutrition. The impact on increasing the recovery rates of children treated using the OTP service indicates the potential benefits of increasing the capacity of such services across a target region on child mortality/recovery. Timely intervention is another benefit of a more local service like OTP. Building capacity of OTP service providers and regular monitoring of service provision based on the management protocol was recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3083702334,"Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) is a momentous pulmonary hypertension disease, and left heart disease is the most familiar cause. Mechanical stretching may be a crucial cause of vascular remodeling. While, the underlining mechanism of mechanical stretching-induced in remodeling of pulmonary vein in the early stage of PH-LHD has not been completely elucidated. In our study, the PH-LHD model rats were successfully constructed. After 25 days, doppler echocardiography and hemodynamic examination were performed. In addition, after treatment, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were determined by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays in the pulmonary veins. Moreover, the pathological change of pulmonary tissues was evaluated by H&E staining. Our results uncovered that left ventricular insufficiency and interventricular septal shift could be observed in PH-LHD model rats, and the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean left atrial pressure (mLAP) were also elevated in PH-LHD model rats. Meanwhile, we found that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 could be highly expressed in PH-LHD model rats. Besides, we revealed that stretch-activated channel (SAC)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway could be involved in the upregulations of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 mediated by mechanical stretching in pulmonary vein. Therefore, current research revealed that mechanical stretching induced the increasing expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein, which could be mediated by activation of SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway in the early stage of PH-LHD."
https://openalex.org/W3083765205,"Purpose To investigate the association between outer retinal layer metrics, including photoreceptor outer segment volume, on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and brain volume on MRI in normal aging, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Methods This was an exploratory analysis of a cross-sectional cohort study that was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board to evaluate neurodegenerative disorders. Subjects aged ≥ 50 were recruited. A comprehensive neurological exam, brain MRI with volumetric evaluation, and OCT were performed for each subject. Outer retinal layer parameters, including ellipsoid zone (EZ) to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) volume (i.e., surrogate for panmacular photoreceptor outer segment volume), were evaluated with a novel OCT analysis platform. Results Of 85 subjects, 64 eyes of 64 subjects met MRI and OCT quality control criteria. Total brain volume (%ICV) significantly correlated with EZ-RPE volume in the normal cognition control group (n = 31, Pearson correlation coefficient 0.514, P < .01), the Parkinson’s disease group (n = 19, Pearson correlation coefficient 0.482, P = .04), and the Alzheimer’s dementia group (n = 14, Pearson correlation coefficient 0.526, P = .05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that photoreceptor outer segment (i.e., EZ-RPE) volume was an independent, influential factor on total brain volume in all study subjects (Coefficient 15.2, 95% confidence interval 7.8–22.6, P < .001). Conclusion Outer retinal parameters on OCT may serve as a novel biomarker related to brain volume. This correlation was noted in control subjects suggesting a possible developmental link between retina and brain volume. This relationship was also maintained with atrophic neurodegenerative disorders. Further research is needed to explore possible threshold differences for underlying neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3083040616,"Improving sanitation conditions in low-income communities is a major challenge for rapidly growing cities of the developing world. The expenses and logistical difficulties of extending sewerage infrastructure have focused increasing attention on the requirements for safe and cost-effective fecal sludge management services. These services, which are primarily provided by the private sector, include the collection and treatment of fecal waste from latrine pits and septic tanks. To determine the degree to which market forces can promote safe fecal sludge removal in low-income neighborhoods of Kisumu, Kenya, we compared household willingness-to-pay for formal pit emptying with the prices charged by service providers. Through surveys of 942 households and a real-money voucher trial with 646 households, we found that stated and revealed demand for formal emptying services were both low, with less than 20% of households willing to pay full market prices. Our results suggest that improving fecal sludge management in these neighborhoods via the private sector will require large subsides, ranging from 55.1–81.4 million KES (551,000–814,000 USD) annually, to address the gap between willingness-to-pay and market prices. Raising and administering subsidies of this scale will require the development of a city-wide sanitation master plan that includes investment, management, and regulatory procedures for fecal sludge management. In the absence of government investment and coordination, it is unlikely that the private sector will address safe sanitation needs in low-income areas of Kisumu."
https://openalex.org/W3083382724,"There is now clear evidence that climate change affects terrestrial and marine ecosystems and can cause phenological shifts in behavior. Utilizing sound to demonstrate phenology is gaining popularity in terrestrial environments. In marine ecosystems, this technique is yet to be used due to a lack of multiyear datasets. Our study demonstrates soundscape phenology in an estuary using a six-year dataset. In this study, we showed that an increase in acoustic activity of snapping shrimp and certain fish species occurred earlier in years with warmer springs. In addition, we combined passive acoustics and traditional sampling methods (seines) and detected positive relationships between temporal patterns of the soundscape and biodiversity. This study shows that passive acoustics can provide information on the ecological response of estuaries to climate variability."
https://openalex.org/W3083006899,"Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patient-derived bioaerosol is a potential tool to measure source case infectiousness. However, current bioaerosol sampling approaches have reported low detection yields in sputum-positive TB cases. To increase the utility of bioaerosol sampling, we present advances in bioaerosol collection and Mtb identification that improve detection yields.A previously described Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC) protocol, or ""RASC-1"", was modified to incorporate liquid collection of bioaerosol using a high-flow wet-walled cyclone (RASC-2). Individuals with GeneXpert-positive pulmonary TB were sampled pre-treatment over 60-minutes. Putative Mtb bacilli were detected in collected fluid by fluorescence microscopy utilising DMN-Trehalose. Exhaled air and bioaerosol volumes were estimated using continuous CO2 monitoring and airborne particle counting, respectively. Mtb capture was calculated per exhaled air volume sampled and bioaerosol volume for RASC-1 (n = 35) and for RASC-2 (n = 21). Empty chamber samples were collected between patients as controls.The optimised RASC-2 protocol sampled a median of 258.4L (IQR: 226.9-273.6) of exhaled air per patient compared with 27.5L (IQR: 23.6-30.3) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). Bioaerosol volume collection was estimated at 2.3nL (IQR: 1.1-3.6) for RASC-2 compared with 0.08nL (IQR: 0.05-0.10) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). The detection yield of viable Mtb improved from 43% (median 2 CFU, range: 1-14) to 95% (median 20.5 DMN-Trehalose positive bacilli, range: 2-155). These improvements represent a lowering of the limit of detection in the RASC-2 platform to 0.9 Mtb bacilli per 100L of exhaled air from 3.3 Mtb bacilli per 100L (RASC-1).This study demonstrates that technical improvements in particle collection together with sensitive detection enable rapid quantitation of viable Mtb in bioaerosols of sputum positive TB cases. Increased sampling sensitivity may allow future TB transmission studies to be extended to sputum-negative and subclinical individuals, and suggests the potential utility of bioaerosol measurement for rapid intervention in other airborne infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3083408483,"Knowledge on neural processing during complex non-stationary motion sequences of sport-specific movements still remains elusive. Hence, we aimed at investigating hemodynamic response alterations during a basketball slalom dribbling task (BSDT) using multi-distance functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in 23 participants (12 females). Additionally, we quantified how the brain adapts its processing as a function of altered hand use (dominant right hand (DH) vs. non-dominant left hand (NDH) vs. alternating hands (AH)) and pace of execution (slow vs. fast) in BSDT. We found that BSDT activated bilateral premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), primary motor cortex (M1) as well as inferior parietal cortex and somatosensory association cortex. Slow dominant hand dribbling (DHslow) evoked lower contralateral hemodynamic responses in sensorimotor regions compared to fast dribbling (DHfast). Furthermore, during DHslow dribbling, we found lower hemodynamic responses in ipsilateral M1 as compared to dribbling with alternating hands (AHslow). Hence, altered task complexity during BSDT induced differential hemodynamic response patterns. Furthermore, a correlation analysis revealed that lower levels of perceived task complexity are associated with lower hemodynamic responses in ipsilateral PMC-SMA, which is an indicator for neuronal efficiency in participants with better basketball dribbling skills. The present study extends previous findings by showing that varying levels of task complexity are reflected by specific hemodynamic response alterations even during sports-relevant motor behavior. Taken together, we suggest that quantifying brain activation during complex movements is a prerequisite for assessing brain-behavior relations and optimizing motor performance."
https://openalex.org/W3083565422,"The androgen receptor (AR) is activated in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) despite low circulating levels of androgen, suggesting that intracellular signaling pathways and non-androgenic factors may contribute to AR activation. Many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and their ligands are also activated in these cells indicating that they may play a role in development of Prostate Cancer (PCa) and CRPC. Although a cross talk has been suggested between the two pathways, yet, the identity of GPCRs which may play a role in androgen signaling, is not established yet. By using blast analysis of 826 GPCRs, we identified a GPCR, GPCR 205, which exhibited maximum similarity with the ligand binding domain of the AR. We demonstrate that adhesion GPCR 205, also known as GPR56, can be activated by androgens to stimulate the Rho signaling pathway, a pathway that plays an important role in prostate tumor cell metastasis. Testosterone stimulation of GPR56 also activates the cAMP/ Protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, that is necessary for AR signaling. Knocking down the expression of GPR56 using siRNA, disrupts nuclear translocation of AR and transcription of prototypic AR target genes such as PSA. GPR56 expression is higher in all twenty-five prostate tumor patient’s samples tested and cells expressing GPR56 exhibit increased proliferation. These findings provide new insights about androgen signaling and identify GPR56 as a possible therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3083133001,"Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD), a key enzyme in carotenoid metabolism, cleaves carotenoids to form apo-carotenoids, which play a major role in plant growth and stress responses. CCD genes had not previously been systematically characterized in Brassica napus (rapeseed), an important oil crop worldwide. In this study, we identified 30 BnCCD genes and classified them into nine subgroups based on a phylogenetic analysis. We identified the chromosomal locations, gene structures, and cis-promoter elements of each of these genes and performed a selection pressure analysis to identify residues under selection. Furthermore, we determined the subcellular localization, physicochemical properties, and conserved protein motifs of the encoded proteins. All the CCD proteins contained a retinal pigment epithelial membrane protein (RPE65) domain. qRT-PCR analysis of expression of 20 representative BnCCD genes in 16 tissues of the B. napus cultivar Zhong Shuang 11 (‘ZS11’) revealed that members of the BnCCD gene family possess a broad range of expression patterns. This work lays the foundation for functional studies of the BnCCD gene family."
https://openalex.org/W3083038510,"In a recent population-based study, an elevated risk of the Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes was found in childless men compared to those who have fathered one or more children. Therefore, by using a larger cohort of more than 22 000 men from the Malmo Preventive Project (MPP) we aimed to expand our observations in order to evaluate the metabolic profile of childless men and to evaluate if childlessness is an additional and independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), mortality and incident diabetes when accounting for well-known biochemical, anthropometric, socio-economic and lifestyle related known risk factors. Logistic regression was used to assess risk of MACE, diabetes and MetS at baseline. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate the risks of MACE and mortality following the men from baseline screening until first episode of MACE, death from other causes, emigration, or end of follow-up (31st December 2016) adjusting for age, family history, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, educational status, body mass index, prevalent diabetes, high blood lipids, increased fasting glucose and hypertension. Childless men presented with a worse metabolic profile than fathers at the baseline examination, with elevated risk of high triglycerides, odds ratio (OR) 1.24 (95%CI: 1.10-1.42), high fasting glucose OR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.05-1.43) and high blood pressure, OR 1.28 (95%CI: 1.14-1.45), respectively. In the fully adjusted prospective analysis, childless men presented with elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality, HR: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.18-1.49) and all-cause mortality, HR 1.23 (95%CI: 1.14-1.33), respectively. In conclusion, these results add to previous studies showing associations between male reproductive health, morbidity and mortality. Male childlessness, independently of well-known socio-economic, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, predicts risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Consequently, this group of men should be considered as target population for preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W3083266306,"This study aimed to investigate whether young and old non-professional drivers in South Egypt have aberrant driving behaviors compared with their middle-aged counterparts.In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1764 non-professional drivers aged ≥ 19 years, residing in Beni-Suef in South Egypt, and having ≥ one year of driving experience were randomly selected. All drivers were asked to fill out a self-administered questionnaire, including personal information, driving habits, and the Arabic version of the Driver Behavior Questionnaire which evaluates driving violations, errors, and lapses.This study included 560 young drivers (19-25 years), 850 middle-aged drivers (26-59 years), and 354 old drivers (≥ 60 years). Compared with middle-aged drivers, young drivers reported more non-use of the seatbelt, eating while driving, and driving while feeling drowsy. Old drivers, in contrast, showed more careful driving behaviors including fewer violations, errors, and lapses and less likelihood of driving while feeling sleepy.This study supports the conception that young drivers pose less careful driving habits. Initiating educational programs targeting young drivers to improve their driving habits and create a traffic safety culture in Egypt is highly warranted."

We assessed the blood pressure profile of the mice. We also determined the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profile, glycemic and insulinemic profiles, and calculated the HOMA-IR. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial collagen deposit, and the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and metalloproteinases 2 and 9 were assessed immunohistologically.After 60 days, the mice treated with grape juice showed similar results as those of the group treated with simvastatin. The use of grape fruit attenuated dyslipidemia and insulin resistance and significantly increased the levels of high cholesterol density lipoproteins (HDLc). The antioxidant potential of phenolic compounds associated with the increase in HDLc levels in the mice of the HLU group prevented the development of LVH and arterial hypertension since it inhibited the inflammatory response induced by the CD40 pathway and its ligand CD40L. Consequently, there was a lower expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and lower serum levels of CRP.Grape juice has a hypolipidemic and cardiac protective potential, presenting a similar effect as that of simvastatin through a direct antioxidant action of phenolic compounds, or indirectly, via antioxidant action and anti-inflammatory activity of the HDLc. These results suggest that grape juice is a functional food possessing a high potential to prevent cardiovascular diseases."

Measurements on MMO (intra- and extra orally), Active range of motion of shoulders and neck, 30 Seconds Chair Stand Test, Grip Strength, Timed Up and Go test, and Six Minute Walk test.In total 50 participants were included. The mean age was 68.6. ± 9.9 years and median time since end of treatment was 3.0 years (Q1-Q3: 1.0-5.25 years). We found good to excellent test-retest reliability on the core set of measurements (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) 0.77 to 0.98). Measurement of MMO with cardboard card, forward flexion shoulder and Six Minute Walk test had a relatively small measurement error (Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) % 5.4% - 15.1%). Measurement of MMO with a caliper, shoulder abduction, shoulder external rotation, later flexion and rotation of the neck, grip strength, 30 Seconds Chair Stand Test, and Timed up and Go test had a relatively large measurement error (SDC% 19.8% - 44.7%).This core set of measurements on physical performance is found reliable and therefore able to differentiate in physical performance. The reported measurement errors should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of repeated measurements.A core set of physical measurements can be used to measure physical performance in survivors of Head and Neck Cancer."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 6 common germline susceptibility loci but have not investigated low-frequency inherited variants with minor allele frequencies below 5% due to limited genotyped cases of this rare tumor.We investigated the contribution of rare and low-frequency variation to EwS susceptibility in the largest EwS genome-wide association study to date (733 EwS cases and 1,346 unaffected controls of European ancestry).We identified two low-frequency variants, rs112837127 and rs2296730, on chromosome 20 that were associated with EwS risk (OR = 0.186 and 2.038, respectively; P-value < 5×10-8) and located near previously reported common susceptibility loci. After adjusting for the most associated common variant at the locus, only rs112837127 remained a statistically significant independent signal (OR = 0.200, P-value = 5.84×10-8).These findings suggest rare variation residing on common haplotypes are important contributors to EwS risk.Motivate future targeted sequencing studies for a comprehensive evaluation of low-frequency and rare variation around common EwS susceptibility loci."
https://openalex.org/W3083649945,"The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma (GB) remains grim. Concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) radiation-the cornerstone of glioma control-extends the overall median survival of GB patients by only a few months over radiotherapy alone. While these survival gains could be partly attributed to radiosensitization, this benefit is greatly minimized in tumors expressing O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which specifically reverses O6-methylguanine lesions. Theoretically, non-O6-methylguanine lesions (i.e., the N-methylpurine adducts), which represent up to 90% of TMZ-generated DNA adducts, could also contribute to radiosensitization. Unfortunately, at concentrations attainable in clinical practice, the alkylation capacity of TMZ cannot overwhelm the repair of N-methylpurine adducts to efficiently exploit these lesions. The current therapeutic application of TMZ therefore faces two main obstacles: (i) the stochastic presence of MGMT and (ii) a blunted radiosensitization potential at physiologic concentrations. To circumvent these limitations, we are developing a novel molecule called NEO212-a derivatization of TMZ generated by coupling TMZ to perillyl alcohol. Based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses, we determined that NEO212 had greater tumor cell uptake than TMZ. In mouse models, NEO212 was more efficient than TMZ at crossing the blood-brain barrier, preferentially accumulating in tumoral over normal brain tissue. Moreover, in vitro analyses with GB cell lines, including TMZ-resistant isogenic variants, revealed more potent cytotoxic and radiosensitizing activities for NEO212 at physiologic concentrations. Mechanistically, these advantages of NEO212 over TMZ could be attributed to its enhanced tumor uptake presumably leading to more extensive DNA alkylation at equivalent dosages which, ultimately, allows for N-methylpurine lesions to be better exploited for radiosensitization. This effect cannot be achieved with TMZ at clinically relevant concentrations and is independent of MGMT. Our findings establish NEO212 as a superior radiosensitizer and a potentially better alternative to TMZ for newly diagnosed GB patients, irrespective of their MGMT status."
https://openalex.org/W3083339012,"Introduction A pterygium is a wing-shaped fibro-vascular growth of conjunctiva on the superficial cornea/conjunctiva. It is an elastotic degeneration of conjunctival stroma mainly due to Ultraviolet light exposure. The prevalence of pterygium varies in different environmental conditions. Its magnitude varies widely from 1.1% to 53% globally and in Ethiopia, it reaches from 8.8% to 38.7%. Objective To determine the prevalence of pterygium and its associated factors among adults aged 18 years and above in Gambella town, Southwest Ethiopia, 2019. Methods and materials A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 15 to May 3, 2019, in Gambella town. A total of 402 study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire, torch, and magnifying loops were used to collect data. The data was entered into epidemiological information 7.1 and exported to statistical package for social science version 20 for analysis. The binary and multivariate logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify factors associated with pterygium. Odds ratio with respected 95% CI was used to identify the direction and strength of association. Results A total of 400 participants were examined with a response rate of 99.50%. The mean age of the study participants was 39.9±9.8years. The prevalence of pterygium among adults aged 18 years and above in Gambella town was 127(31.80%), (95% CI: 27.3, 36.3). male sex (AOR = 2.10 (95% CI: 1.26, 3.45), sunlight exposure (AOR = 6.86 (95% CI: 4.00, 11.79) and outdoor works (AOR = 2.10 (95% CI: 1.21, 3.60) were positively associated with pterygium whereas wearing sunglass/hat was a protective factor. Conclusion The prevalence of pterygium was high among adults living in Gambella town. Wearing sunglass/hat and reducing exposure time to the sun was important to reduce the development of pterygium in adults."

The country has prioritised the diagnosis and treatment of DM2 through a universal health care package, largely focused on the clinical dimensions of the disease. We analysed the significance of socioeconomic variables in the prevalence of DM2, as well as its related dimensions of presence of complications (diabetic foot and ophthalmologic complications), attendance to health checks and acquisition of recommended lifestyle changes due to this condition.Secondary analysis of the national health survey (ENS) 2016-2017 (n = 6,233 respondents). Crude and income-adjusted odds of reporting DM2 was estimated, as well as the relationship between complications due to diabetes and a number of clinical and sociodemographic variables using weighted log-linear multiple regression models.We found a clear social gradient of the prevalence of DM2 by household income quintiles and educational level in the adult population. Income quintile and educational level gradients remained significantly associated with the presence of complications and attendance to health checks. We found no significant association, however; between income quintile and reported lifestyle change. The association between complications due to DM2 and socioeconomic variables, particularly income, remained relevant even after adjusting for all sociodemographic variables.This is the first study to analyse the association between DM2 and socioeconomic variables in Chile, useful for monitoring and policy planning. Income was strongly associated with DM2 prevalence and with related clinical variables (complications and attendance to health checks).

https://openalex.org/W3083668714,"Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals may have osteoporosis. We aimed to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) in naïve antiretroviral (ARV) treated HIV positive patients comparing native Italian group (ItG) to a Migrants group (MiG) upon arrival in Italy. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 83 HIV patients less than 50 years old. We used the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) within six months from the HIV diagnosis. Participants were categorized as having low BMD if the femoral neck or total lumbar spine Z-score was– 2 or less. Results MiG showed low BMD more often than ItG (37.5% vs.13.6%), especially for the female gender (16.7% vs. 0.0%). A low CD4 rate (<200 cells/μl) was most often detected in MiG than ItG. In particular, we found most often male Italians with abnormal CD4 than male migrants (67.8% vs. 33.3%) and vice versa for females (30.5% vs. 66.7%). We found an abnormal bone mineral density at the lumbar site. Low BMD at the lumbar site was more frequently observed in female migrants than female Italians. Both male and female migrants had a Z-score value significantly lower than male and female Italians, respectively. By logistic regression low vitamin-D level was positively correlated to low BMD in ItG only. All data were verified and validated using a triple code identifier. Conclusions Both DXA and vitamin-D evaluation should be offered after the diagnosis of HIV infection. Lumbar site low BMD is an initial condition of bone loss in HIV young patients, especially in female migrants. Vitamin D levels and supplementation may be considered after HIV diagnosis independently of age to improve bone health. Highlights This study evaluates the frequency of bone mineral density in HIV positive patients naive to antiretroviral therapy. It compares the density of the native Italian population with that of HIV Migrants upon arrival in Italy. The results show that HIV positive migrants, even if younger than 50 years of age, are at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they are female."
https://openalex.org/W3083733723,"The immune responses exhibited by females are distinct from those of males. Females are known to generate, among others, higher levels of antibodies, greater interferon responses, and increased levels of inflammatory mediators in response to pathogens. Mounting evidence suggests that gonadal hormones play a key role in these differences. To better understand the effect of cycling hormones on the immune response, we sought to investigate the relationship between gonadal hormone fluctuations during the ovarian cycle and the levels of interleukin 1β and IL-1RA, both in circulation and in PBMCs in response to TLR4 stimulation, in healthy premenopausal females. To do this we measured the gonadal hormones 17β-estradiol, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone, and the cytokines IL-1β and IL-1RA in nine cycling females at several time points throughout one complete cycle. We evaluated 35 follicular, 17 ovulatory, and 44 luteal time points in our cohort and found a clear increase in serum levels of anti-inflammatory IL-1RA in the luteal phase, as compared to the follicular phase, and a positive correlation between both 17β-estradiol and progesterone and IL-RA. There was no difference in the serum levels of IL-1β and no difference in IL-1 β or IL-1RA produced in response to LPS by PBMCs isolated from different phases. Division of the cycle into sub-phases revealed an increase in the level of IL-1RA by ovulation that persisted through the luteal phase. These data suggest that significant changes in the immune response occur throughout the ovarian cycle in healthy females."

Furthermore, we investigated the incidence rate of different types of HL and the joint effects for HL with FM and comorbidities.This population-based retrospective cohort study included patients with new-onset FM from 2000 to 2002 (the FM group) and age- and sex-matched randomized patients without FM (the non-FM group) from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were followed up from baseline (3 months after FM diagnosis) until death, withdrawal, HL development, or December 31, 2013. The primary outcome was the risk of HL, which was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards analysis.The overall HL risk in the FM group was 1.46-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-1.55) higher than that in the non-FM group after adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities (p < 0.0001). Patients with FM had significantly greater sensorineural HL (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.37-1.56) than those without FM. Patients with FM having comorbidities of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression, and Meniere's disease had a higher risk of HL than those without FM.Our findings support the notion that FM influences HL and is in line with the hypothesis that the FM mechanism is related to a central nervous system abnormality in sensory processing. Health care professionals should provide appropriate screening for the risk of HL and prevention and counseling methods for patients with FM."
https://openalex.org/W3083151165,"Pareiorhaphis hystrix is a widely distributed species, occurring in the upper and middle Uruguay River and in the Taquari River basin, Patos Lagoon system, southern Brazil. Morphological variation has been detected throughout the distribution of P. hystrix, and this work seeks to test the conspecific nature of populations in several occurrence areas. Specimens from six areas in the Uruguay River basin and three in the Taquari River basin were compared. Variance analysis (ANOVA) was performed for the meristic data, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were conducted for morphometric data. Molecular analyses used coI, cytb, 12S and 16S mitochondrial genes, examining nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity, genetic distance, and delimitation of possible multiple species through the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) method. Phylogenetic relationships of studied populations were also investigated through Bayesian inference. While PCA indicated a tendency of overlap between areas, ANOVA and LDA detected a subtle differentiation between populations from the two hydrographic basins. Yet, both latter analyses recovered the population from Pelotas River, a tributary to Uruguay River, as more similar to populations from Taquari River, which is congruent to morphological observations of anterior abdominal plates. The molecular data indicated a nucleotide diversity lower than the haplotypic diversity, suggestive of recent expansion. The concatenated haplotype network points to slight differentiation between areas, with each locality presenting unique and non-shared haplotypes, although with few mutational steps in general. The species delimitation by coalescence analysis suggested the presence of a variable number of OTUs depending on the inclusion or exclusion of an outgroup. In general, the morphological data suggest a subtle variation by river basin, while the genetic data indicates a weak population structuration by hydrographic areas, especially the Chapecó and Passo Fundo rivers. However, there is still not enough differentiation between the specimens to suggest multiple species. The iterative analyses indicate that Pareiorhaphis hystrix is composed of a single, although variable, species."

Although it is effective, simple, and safe, it is not well known and practiced in the majority of our community. This study assessed the intention to use vasectomy and its associated factors among married men in Debre Tabor Town, North West Ethiopia, 2019.A community- based cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 married men from March 05 to April 15, 2019. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Data was collected by face to face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Questions concerned socio-demographic and reproductive variables and views on vasectomy. The association between variables was analyzed using a bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model.A total of 402 participants were included with a response rate of 98.75%. The mean participant age was 37.12(SD ± 6.553) years with the age range of 20-56 years. The prevalence of intention to use vasectomy was 19.6% with 95%CI (15.6%-23.4%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that age from 30-39 years (AOR = 3.2(95% CI: 1.19-8.86)), having more than three living children (AOR = 2.5(95% CI: 1.41-4.68)), good knowledge (AOR = 3.4(95%CI: 1.88-6.40)) and positive attitude (AOR = 4.8(95% CI: 2.61-8.80)) of married men were significantly associated with intention to use vasectomy.Intention to use vasectomy was comparable with findings in four regions of Ethiopia (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Tigray). Age, the number of living children, knowledge, and attitude were significantly associated with the intention to use vasectomy. Improving the level of knowledge and attitude towards vasectomy is an essential strategy to scale up the intention of men to use vasectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3083449732,"In this study, the physiological values of volumes of plasma, cells, total blood and the F blood factors were identified in 24 adult tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri; 12 male and 12 female; average BW of 123.9±19.19 g). The two-compartment model method of Evans Blue dye was used to obtain the plasma volume and the venous hematocrit was measured by microhematocrit method. To establish the relationship between body weight (BW) and blood volume of tree shrews, We performed linear fitting for these two datasets. Results were analyzed according to gender and weight (<120g vs.>120g). Statistical significance was assessed using the unpaired student t test and one-way ANOVA. The average volumes per 100g body weight of plasma, red blood cell (RBC) and total blood were 5.42±0.543, 3.24±0.445, and 8.66±0.680ml respectively. The mean body hematocrit, cardiac hematocrit, jugular vein hematocrit, femoral vein hematocrit, and tail vein hematocrit was 37.43±4.096, 39.72±3.219, 43.04±4.717, 40.84±3.041, and 38.71±3.442% respectively. The F cardiac was 0.94±0.072, F jugular vein 0.88±0.118, F femoral vein 0.92±0.111, and the F tail vein 0.97±0.117. Blood volume (ml) was 85.89103×BW (kg). This is the first study to provide the parameters of plasma volume, cell volume, total blood volume and F factor and a baseline for future research on blood physiology of tree shrews."
https://openalex.org/W3083749151,"A country's ability to become a prominent knowledge economy is tied closely to its ability to acquire skilled people who can compete internationally while resolving challenges of the future. To equip students with competence that can only by gained by being immersed in a foreign environment, outbound mobility is vital.To analyze outbound student mobility in Taiwan using time series methods, this study aims to propose a hybrid approach FSDESVR which combines feature selection (FS) and support vector regression (SVR) with differential evolution (DE). FS and a DE algorithm were used for selecting reliable input features and determining the optimal initial parameters of SVR, respectively, to achieve high forecast accuracy.The proposed approach was examined using a dataset of outbound Taiwanese student mobility to ten countries between 1998 and 2018. Without the requirements of any special conditions for the proprieties of the objective function and constraints, the FSDESVR model retained the advantage of FS, SVR, and DE. A comparison of the FSDESVR model and other forecasting models revealed that FSDESVR provided the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) results for all the analyzed nations. The experimental results indicate that FSDESVR achieved higher forecasting accuracy than the compared models from the literature.With the recognition of outbound values, key findings of Taiwanese outbound student mobility, and accurate application of the FSDESVR model, education administration units are exposed to a more in-depth view of future student mobility, which enables the implement of a more accurate education curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W3082998417,"After the United Kingdom has left the European Union it remains unclear whether the two parties can successfully negotiate and sign a trade agreement within the transition period. Ongoing negotiations, practical obstacles and resulting uncertainties make it highly unlikely that economic actors would be fully prepared to a “no-trade-deal” situation. Here we provide an economic shock simulation of the immediate aftermath of such a post-Brexit no-trade-deal scenario by computing the time evolution of more than 1.8 million interactions between more than 6,600 economic actors in the global trade network. We find an abrupt decline in the number of goods produced in the UK and the EU. This sudden output reduction is caused by drops in demand as customers on the respective other side of the Channel incorporate the new trade restriction into their decision-making. As a response, producers reduce prices in order to stimulate demand elsewhere. In the short term consumers benefit from lower prices but production value decreases with potentially severe socio-economic consequences in the longer term."
https://openalex.org/W3083219814,"Objective How disability manifests itself in an individual is a highly complex process influenced by a wide range of individual and environmental factors. Its complexity makes the search for generalizable characteristics of the disablement process a challenging task. Consequentially, little is known about how the effect on other health outcomes such as life expectancy are modified after the onset of chronic ailments. In this paper we posit an alternative approach to generalize health trajectories of older people with disability and then analyze how socioeconomic conditions affect the longevity within these trajectory groups. Methods Individual level information about the first three successive onsets of chronic disability after age 50 is transformed into state-sequences. We extract trajectory groups based on onset time and the time spent in a certain state. Mortality hazards are then estimated with a Gompertz proportional hazards model to compare effects of different socioeconomic measures within the trajectory groups. Results Three distinct trajectory groups are identified, the mild (1), the early severe (2), and late severe (3) pathway. Estimates of the mortality analysis suggest that social inequalities in longevity are less pronounced after onset of old-age disability. We found a consistent survival prolonging effect for individuals who engage in daily activities (such as meeting with friends, walking) that ranged between 33.2% and 77.3%. The importance of other variables varies between trajectory groups. Discussion This study shows how health trajectories of individuals with disability can be generalized when information on the onset and severity of single conditions is available. Such an approach may help us to better predict health and care expenditures and help families and individuals with their personal care planning. The findings from the subsequent survival analysis suggest a substantial reduction of socioeconomic mortality differences after onset of old-age disability, which appears to be independent of its nature."
https://openalex.org/W3083527280,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis, a potentially life-threatening disease endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Treatment of melioidosis is a long and costly process and the pathogen is inherently resistant to several classes of antibiotics, therefore there is a need for new treatments that can help combat the pathogen. Previous work has shown that the combination of interferon-gamma, an immune system activator, and the antibiotic ceftazidime synergistically reduced the bacterial burden of RAW 264.7 macrophages that had been infected with either B. pseudomallei or Burkholderia thailandensis. The mechanism of the interaction was found to be partially dependent on interferon-gamma-induced production of reactive oxygen species inside the macrophages. To further confirm the role of reactive oxygen species in the effectiveness of the combination treatment, we investigated the impact of the antioxidant and reactive oxygen species scavenger, seleno-L-methionine, on intracellular and extracellular bacterial burden of the infected macrophages. In a dose-dependent manner, high concentrations of seleno-L-methionine (1000 μM) were protective towards infected macrophages, resulting in a reduction of bacteria, on its own, that exceeded the reduction caused by the antibiotic alone and rivaled the effect of ceftazidime and interferon-gamma combined. Seleno-L-methionine treatment also resulted in improved viability of infected macrophages compared to untreated controls. We show that the protective effect of seleno-L-methionine was partly due to its inhibition of bacterial growth. In summary, our study shows a role for high dose seleno-L-methionine to protect and treat macrophages infected with B. thailandensis."
https://openalex.org/W3083565605,"Diabetes mellitus is a kind of highly prevalent chronic disease in the world. The intervention measures on the risk factors of prediabetes contribute to control and reduce the occurrence of diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between proinsulin (PI), true insulin (TI), PI/TI, 25(OH) D3, waist circumference (WC), and risk of prediabetes.In this cross-sectional study, 1662 subjects including 615 prediabetes and 1047 non-prediabetes were recruited. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore the association of PI, TI, PI/TI, 25(OH) D3, and waist circumference with prediabetes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the risk of prediabetes.Our study showed that FPI, 2hPI, FTI, 2hTI, FPI/FTI, and WC could enhance the risk of prediabetes (OR 1.034; OR 1.007; OR 1.005; OR 1.002; OR 3.577, OR 1.053, respectively; all p< 0.001). Stratified analyses indicated that FPI/FTI associated with an increased risk of prediabetes in men (OR 2.080, p = 0.042). FTI have a weak association with prediabetes risk in men and women (OR 0.987, p = 0.001; OR 0.994, p = 0.004, respectively). 2hPI could decrease prediabetes in women (OR 0.995, p = 0.037). Interesting, the sensitivity (86.0%) and AUC (0.942, p< 0.001) of combination (FPI+FTI+2hPI+2hTI+25(OH) D3+WC) were higher than the diagnostic value of these alone diagnoses. The optimal cutoff point of FPI, FTI, 2hPI, 2hTI, 25(OH) D3, and WC for indicating prediabetes were 15.5 mU/l, 66.5 mU/l, 71.5 mU/l, 460.5 mU/l, 35.5 ng/ml, and 80.5 cm, respectively. What's more, the combination (FPI+FTI+2hPI+2hTI+25(OH) D3+WC) significantly improved the diagnostic value beyond the alone diagnoses of prediabetes in men and women (AUC 0.771; AUC 0.760, respectively).The FPI, 2hPI, FTI, 2hTI, FPI/FTI, and WC significantly associated with an increased risk of prediabetes. The combination of FPI, FTI, 2hPI, 2hTI, 25(OH) D3, and WC might be used as diagnostic indicators for prediabetes."
