https://openalex.org/W1583148430,"The gene expression profile of the aging process was analyzed in skeletal muscle of mice. Use of high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing 6347 genes revealed that aging resulted in a differential gene expression pattern indicative of a marked stress response and lower expression of metabolic and biosynthetic genes. Most alterations were either completely or partially prevented by caloric restriction, the only intervention known to retard aging in mammals. Transcriptional patterns of calorie-restricted animals suggest that caloric restriction retards the aging process by causing a metabolic shift toward increased protein turnover and decreased macromolecular damage."

PHGPx exists as a soluble peroxidase in spermatids but persists in mature spermatozoa as an enzymatically inactive, oxidatively cross-linked, insoluble protein. In the midpiece of mature spermatozoa, PHGPx protein represents at least 50 percent of the capsule material that embeds the helix of mitochondria. The role of PHGPx as a structural protein may explain the mechanical instability of the mitochondrial midpiece that is observed in selenium deficiency."

Paleobotanical evidence indicates a fourfold increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and suggests an associated 3 degrees to 4 degrees C ""greenhouse"" warming across the boundary. These environmental conditions are calculated to have raised leaf temperatures above a highly conserved lethal limit, perhaps contributing to the >95 percent species-level turnover of Triassic-Jurassic megaflora."
https://openalex.org/W2010180656,"Complex cells in striate cortex of macaque showed a rapid pattern-specific adaptation. Adaptation made cells more sensitive to orientation change near the adapting orientation. It reduced correlations among the responses of populations of cells, thereby increasing the information transmitted by each action potential. These changes were brought about by brief exposures to stationary patterns, on the time scale of a single fixation. Thus, if successive fixations expose neurons' receptive fields to images with similar but not identical structure, adaptation will remove correlations and improve discriminability."
https://openalex.org/W1917926680,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is characterized by high variability, maternal inheritance, and absence of recombination. Studies of human populations have revealed ancestral associated polymorphisms whose combination defines groups of mtDNA types (haplogroups) that are currently used to reconstruct human evolution lineages. We used such inherited mtDNA markers to compare mtDNA population pools between a sample of individuals selected for successful aging and longevity (212 subjects older than 100 years and in good clinical condition) and a sample of 275 younger individuals (median age 38 years) carefully matched as to sex and geographic origin (northern and southern Italy). All nine haplogroups that are typical of Europeans were found in both samples, but male centenarians emerged in northern Italy as a particular sample: 1) mtDNA haplogroup frequency distribution was different between centenarians and younger individuals (P=0.017 by permutation tests); and 2) the frequency of the J haplogroup was notably higher in centenarians than in younger individuals (P=0.0052 by Fisher exact test). Since haplogroups are defined on the basis of inherited variants, these data show that mtDNA inherited variability could play a role in successful aging and longevity."

Accordingly, fully crystallized SnO(2), TiO(2), and ZrO(2) materials with mean crystallite sizes of approximately 20, 50, and 15 angstroms, respectively, were synthesized by replacing the hydroxyl group with methyl siloxyl before firing at 500 degrees C.

Cyclin D1 abundance is rate-limiting in normal G1 phase progression, and the abundance of cyclin D1 is induced by activating mutations of both Ras and Rac1. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) proteins consist of cytoplasmic hetero- or homodimeric Rel-related proteins complexed to a member of the IκB family of inhibitor proteins. In the current studies, activating mutants of Rac1 (RacLeu-61, RacVal-12) induced cyclin D1 expression and the cyclin D1 promoter in NIH 3T3 cells. Induction of cyclin D1 by Rac1 required both an NF-κB and an ATF-2 binding site. Inhibiting NF-κB by overexpression of an NF-κB trans-dominant inhibitor (nonphosphorylatable IκBα) reduced cyclin D1 promoter activation by the Rac1 mutants, placing NF-κB in a pathway of Rac1 activation of cyclin D1. Specific amino acid mutations in the amino-terminal effector domain of RacLeu-61 had comparable effects on NF-κB transcriptional activity and activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The NF-κB factors Rel A (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50) induced the cyclin D1 promoter, requiring both the NF-κB binding site and the ATF-2 site. Stable overexpression of RacLeu-61 increased binding of Rel A and NF-κB1 to the cyclin D1 promoter NF-κB site. Activation of Rac1 in NIH 3T3 cells induces both NF-κB binding and activity and enhances expression of cyclin D1 through an NF-κB and ATF-2 site in the proximal promoter, suggesting a critical role for NF-κB in cell cycle regulation through cyclin D1 and Rac1.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Rac interacts with specific effector proteins through domains that coordinate activation of multiple signaling cascades (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Biochemical activities of Rac/Rho chimerae identified the amino-terminal effector site, encompassing amino acids 30–40, which, in conjunction with the carboxyl-terminal effector site (amino acids 143–175), is needed for the induction of actin polymerization (2Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Rac1 regulates downstream signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathways, including the p38 pathway (3Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J.

Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The ability of Rac1 to activate an array of intracellular signaling pathways has confounded the elucidation of the mechanisms by which Rac1 regulates cell cycle regulatory targets. The cell cycle regulatory cyclin D1 gene is directly activated by Rac1 (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The abundance of the cyclin D1 gene product is rate-limiting in G1 phase progression. The abundance of the cyclin D1 gene product is rate-limiting in G1 phase progression, at least in part, because of the role of this regulatory subunit in forming cyclin-dependent kinase holoenzymes, which phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (7Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Rac1 induction of cyclin D1 occurred through a pathway that is distinct from JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), or p38 MAPK (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and the identity of this pathway remains to be determined. Like Rac1, oncogenic Ras also induces NF-κB activity (8Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar), which include NF-κB1 (p50), Rel A (p65), c-Rel, and Rel-B, all of which dimerize and bind DNA to induce gene transcription. In most cell types, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex with IκBα or IκBβ (12Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Diverse signals induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and thereby enhancing DNA sequence-specific gene transcription (13Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In the current studies we demonstrate that cyclin D1 is a direct transcriptional target of Rac1 through sequences that are activated by NF-κB. Both the wild type NF-κB response element and the cyclin D1 promoter are inhibited by a constitutive repressor of NF-κB activity. Rel A and NF-κB1 activate cyclin D1, and induction by NF-κB1 requires the Rac1-responsive sequences. The finding that Rac1 induction of cyclin D1 involves NF-κB suggests an important role for NF-κB in Rac1-induced transformation and mitogenesis. The abundance of cyclin D1 protein was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously (9Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), using monoclonal antibody DCS6 (Neomarkers, Freemont, CA) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The cyclin D1 protein was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The expression vectors for the activating the Rac1 mutant (pcDNA3-RacLeu-61 and pCGN-RacLeu-61) and the effector domain mutants were described previously (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J.

The activating Rac1 mutant Rac1Val-12 was expressed from the pcDNA3 plasmid (RacV12N/V33N, RacV12S/V35S, and RacV12H/V40H), the pCGT plasmid (RacV12N/V33N, RacV12L/V37L, and RacV12H/V40H) or the pEXV3 plasmid (RacAsn-17) (14Pestell R.G.

NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the pCGN-RacLeu-61 and pcDNA3-RacLeu-61 constructs, along with derived mutants, were pooled from >50 individual colonies selected in hygromycin (pCGN vectors) or G418 (pcDNA vectors). Expression of the mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

The consensus NF-κB site from murine Ig κ enhancer (NF-κBwt, 5′-GCA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG G-3′), a mutant NF-κB (NF-κBmt, 5′-GCA GAa Gta ACT TTC CGA GAG G-3′) site, which abolishes NF-κB binding (13Thanos D. Maniatis T.

For supershift analysis, 2 μg of antibody to NF-κB1, Rel A, Rel-B, or c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the pre-incubation mixture. In previous studies we showed that the cyclin D1 promoter was activated by transforming Rac1 mutants (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The current studies were performed to identify the molecular mechanisms governing cyclin D1 induction by Rac1. Cyclin D1 abundance was assessed in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing RacLeu-61 . In the serum-starved state, cyclin D1 levels were increased 2-fold in the RacLeu-61 cell line compared with NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA vector (Fig. 1 A). Serum induced cyclin D1 protein levels 5-fold at 24 h in the parental cell line. Cyclin D1 protein levels were elevated 2- to 3-fold fold at each time point in the RacLeu-61 stable line compared with NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with an empty vector (Fig.1 A). The cyclin D1 promoter luciferase reporter gene (−1745 CD1LUC) was co-transfected with the transforming Rac1 mutants (RacVal-12 and RacLeu-61) into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B). The cyclin D1 promoter was induced 6-fold by the Rac1 mutants. Co-expression of a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, RacAsn-17, suppressed base-line expression of −1745 CD1LUC by 30%. To identify Rac1-responsive DNA sequences, a series of cyclin D1 promoter deletion constructions or point mutants was assessed (Fig.1 C). Induction of the cyclin D1 promoter by RacVal-12 was reduced to 2-fold by deletion to −66 bp, indicating that minimal Rac1 responsive elements were located within the proximal 66 bp. Mutation of the cyclin D1 promoter CRE/ATF site at −54 (20Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines III, G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) abolished RacLeu-61 induction (Fig.1 C). Because an activating RacQL mutant induced NF-κB activity (5Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and we had identified sequences resembling an NF-κB site in the cyclin D1 promoter at −39 to −30 bp, the effect of mutating the NF-κB site on RacLeu-61 induction of the cyclin D1 promoter was assessed. Mutation of the NF-κB site also abolished RacLeu-61 induction of the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 1 C). Our studies suggested that RacLeu-61 might induce NF-κB activity in NIH 3T3 cells, consistent with previous studies in which NF-κB activity was induced by Ras in NIH 3T3 cells (8Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) or by RacQL in COS cells (5Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether RacLeu-61 directly activated the NF-κB responsive reporter 3κBLUC in NIH 3T3 cells. The 3κBLUC reporter was induced 22-fold by RacVal-12 and 11.7-fold by RacLeu-61(Fig. 2 A). The RacAsn-17 dominant negative mutant suppressed basal activity of 3κBLUC to 68 ± 12% of control (n = 6, p < 0.05). These studies suggest that basal 3κBLUC activity is sustained in part by endogenous Rac1-dependent activity. Rel A also induced the NF-κB responsive element as described previously (Fig. 2 B). Recent studies identified a role for the Rac1 amino-terminal effector domain in activation of the ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-κB pathways (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We examined the role of the amino-terminal effector domain in Rac1/NF-κB activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by comparing the effects of specific effector domain mutations on activation of the 3κBLUC and −1745 CD1LUC reporters. Mutating residue 33 or 37 in pCGT-RacVal-12 reduced induction of −1745 CD1LUC by 95% (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of residues 30, 31, 43, and 45 in pCGN-RacLeu-61suppressed induction by smaller amounts (60–70%, Fig. 3 B). Mutation of residue 40 reduced induction by pCGT-RacVal-12 some 25% (Fig. 3 A). The amino-terminal effector domain mutants exhibited a similar pattern of activation of the 3κBLUC reporter. Again, residues 30, 31, 33, 37, and 45 mutants, in their respective pCGN-RacVal-12 or pCGN-RacLeu-61 contexts, had diminished activity, but the activity was relatively preserved in the other mutants. These studies suggest that residues 30, 31 33, 37, and 45 are required for full induction of the 3κBLUC reporter and the cyclin D1 promoter but that residues 26 and 40 are less critical for induction of either reporter construction. Residue 43 is required preferentially for induction of cyclin D1. Because induction of cyclin D1 by Rac1 required an NF-κB binding site, we examined the role of NF-κB in directly regulating cyclin D1. p65 induced the cyclin D1 promoter 9-fold (Fig.4 A); however, several immediate early gene promoters (c-fos, c-myc, Myb LUC, and junB) were not induced by p65, and the cyclin A promoter were induced only 1.8-fold (Fig. 4 B). An IκB “super-repressor” expression plasmid pCMV-IκB(Sr), in which IκBα serine residues 32 and 36 in pCMV-IκB(Sr) have been mutated to alanines (24Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited activity of the 3κBLUC reporter and the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 4 B) but not the c-fos promoter (data not shown). Rac1 enhanced p65 induction of 3κBLUC and p65 enhanced Rac1 activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 4 C). To determine the cyclin D1 promoter DNA sequences required for induction by NF-κB, a series of cyclin D1 promoter constructions were examined in the presence of p50 (Fig. 4 D) or p65 (not shown). p50 induced the cyclin D1 promoter 50-fold. Mutation of the ATF-2 site reduced cyclin D1 promoter induction by 75% (Fig. 4 D), and mutation of the NF-κB site abolished induction by p50 (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether RacLeu-61 altered NF-κB binding activity in NIH 3T3 cells, EMSA were performed using either the cyclin D1 NF-κB site or a consensus NF-κB site. Nuclear extracts were obtained after 24 h of serum deprivation and after restoration of serum for 4 h (Fig.5 A) from cells stably overexpressing RacLeu-61 (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J.

The cyclin D1 NF-κB site bound a complex (Fig.5 A, lane 1, bands A and B), which was competed by specific competitor (lane 2) and was supershifted with antibodies to p65 (lane 4) and p50 (lane 5) but not control IgG (lane 3), Rel-B (lane 6), or c-Rel (lane 7). Under the same serum-starved conditions, equal amounts of nuclear extracts from the RacLeu-61 stable cell line conveyed increased binding to the same site (compare Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 8). The cyclin D1 NF-κB site bound both p65 and p50 (lanes 11, 12). The addition of serum for 4 h further induced the binding to the cyclin D1 promoter NF-κB site (compare Fig. 5 A, lanes 8 and 15). The proteins binding to the cyclin D1 NF-κB site in the RacLeu-61 cell line included p65 (lane 11) and p50 (lane 12). These studies suggested that band A consisted predominantly of p50 and the lower band B of p50/p65. The complexes binding to the consensus NF-κB probe are indicated as a′, b′, and c′ (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). Complexes a′ and c′ were supershifted with p65 antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3, 10, and 16) and complex b′ was shifted with the p50 antibody (lanes 4, 11, and 17). The relative abundance of these complexes was increased in the RacLeu-61 stable cell line extracts (Fig. 5 B, lane 1 versus 8) and was increased further with 4 h of serum treatment (Fig. 5 B, lane 8 versus 15). Cyclin D1 encodes a rate-limiting component of the cell cycle regulatory holoenzyme required for G1 phase progression, cellular mitogenesis, and Ras-induced transformation (10Liu J.-J. Chao J.-R.

Rac1 was previously shown to induce cyclin D1 through a pathway distinct from the JNK or ERK pathway (6Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In the current studies, Rac1 induction of cyclin D1 was inhibited by an NF-κB trans-dominant inhibitor; Rac1 activated the cyclin D1 promoter through DNA sequences that were also activated by NF-κB; Rac1 induced NF-κB binding to the cyclin D1 NF-κB site and Rac1 effector domain mutations correlated in their effect on NF-κB and cyclin D1 promoter activity. Thus, we demonstrate a critical role for NF-κB in Rac1-induction of cyclin D1 and also demonstrate that the cyclin D1 gene is a direct transcriptional target of NF-κB. In the current studies, the ATF-2 site contributed to cyclin D1 induction by Rac1 and p50. The cyclin D1 ATF-2 site contributes to several distinct signaling pathways that induce the cyclin D1 gene in distinct cell types. The ATF-2 site contributed to induction of cyclin D1 by SV40 small t antigen (21Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.-W. Karnezis A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl.

Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The ATF-2/c-Jun proteins form synergistic functional interactions with NF-κB (13Thanos D. Maniatis T.

The transcriptional cross-coupling between AP-1 and NF-κB proteins at the cyclin D1 promoter ATF-2 site may serve to integrate and potentiate their individual biological activities. In addition to their role in cytokine signaling and cell survival, NF-κB proteins have also been implicated in regulating cell cycle progression and transformation. NF-κB activity is induced as cells pass from the G0 into the G1 phase of the cell cycle (29Baldwin A.S.J. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1913186869,"We evaluated the role of melatonin in endotoxemia caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in unanesthetized rats. The expression of inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the increase in the oxidative stress seem to be responsible for the failure of lungs, liver, and kidneys in endotoxemia. Bacterial LPS (10 mg/kg b. w) was i.v. injected 6 h before rats were killed and melatonin (10-60 mg/kg b.w.) was i.p. injected before and/or after LPS. Endotoxemia was associated with a significant rise in the serum levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, urea, and uric acid, and hence liver and renal dysfunction. LPS also increased serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and reduced glucose levels. Melatonin administration counteracted these organ and metabolic alterations at doses ranging between 20 and 60 mg/kg b. w. Melatonin significantly decreased lung lipid peroxidation and counteracted the LPS-induced NO levels in lungs and liver. Our results also show an inhibition of iNOS activity in rat lungs by melatonin in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of iNOS mRNA in lungs and liver was significantly decreased by melatonin (60 mg/kg b. w., 58-65%). We conclude that melatonin inhibits NO production mainly by inhibition of iNOS expression. The inhibition of NO levels may account for the protection of the indoleamine against LPS-induced endotoxemia in rats."

Meta-analyses of 47 marine mesocosm experiments manipulating nutrients and consumers, and of time series data of nutrients, plankton, and fishes from 20 natural marine systems, revealed that nutrients generally enhance phytoplankton biomass and carnivores depress herbivore biomass. However, resource and consumer effects attenuate through marine pelagic food webs, resulting in a weak coupling between phytoplankton and herbivores. Despite substantial physical and biological variability in marine pelagic ecosystems, alterations of resource availability and consumers result in general patterns of community change."

At present, there is only limited information on the mechanism whereby D3-PO4 polyphosphoinositides activate atypical PKCs and little or no information on the subcellular compartments in which atypical PKCs are activated or, for that matter, whether one or both atypical PKCs are activated by insulin in specific cell types. With respect to the first point, recent findings (6Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

Indeed, in other studies, we have found that PDK-1 action is required for insulin-induced activation of PKC-ζ in rat adipocytes. 2M. L. Standaert, G. Bandyopadhyay, L. Perez, D. Price, L.

However, it is uncertain whether this requirement reflects a permissive effect of PDK-1 or whether PDK-1 mediates acute activating effects of insulin. Also, it is not clear whether other mechanisms, e.g. autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation, are also required for full enzymic activation of PKC-ζ, presumably subsequent to PDK-1-dependent loop phosphorylation, during insulin treatment.

After development by extended chemiluminescence, relevant bands were quantitated using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst Chemiluminescence/32P Imaging system. As seen in Fig.2, insulin provoked rapid increases in the enzymic activity of immunoprecipitable combined PKC-ζ/λ (precipitated with anti-C-terminal antiserum) in preparations of both plasma membrane-enriched membranes and microsomal membranes. As in total cell homogenates (3Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), increases in PKC-ζ/λ activity in both membrane fractions were distinctly biphasic with peaks at 1 and 10 min. Increases in the enzymic activity of immunoprecipitable combined PKC-ζ/λ were also observed in preparations of more highly purified plasma membranes and microsomes (Fig. 3), although increases in the highly purified plasma membranes were less than those observed in cruder preparations (Figs. 2 and 3); this difference may reflect a loss of stimulated activity because of a much greater length of time needed for purification of highly purified plasma membranes or removal of a highly active nonplasma membrane pool. (Note that in control rat adipocytes, cytosol contained approximately 80% of total cellular protein and 60% of total cellular PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity and that highly purified plasma membrane and microsomal fractions each contained approximately 10% of total cellular protein and 20% of total PKC-ζ/λ enzyme activity). These findings suggested that PKC-ζ and PKC-λ were activated in both plasma membrane and microsomal membrane fractions of the rat adipocyte.Figure 3Insulin activates PKC -ζ/λ in highly purified plasma membranes and microsomes of rat adipocytes. Adipocytes were treated for 10 min with or without 10 nminsulin, and highly purified membrane fractions were isolated, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-C-terminal antiserum, and assayed.

As seen in Fig. 4, insulin provoked increases in the activity of both HA-PKC-ζ and Myc-PKC-λ. It may be noted that the enzymic activity of HA-PKC-ζ was considerably greater than that of Myc-PKC-λ, despite the fact that expression and immunoprecipitability of both epitope-tagged isoforms (as measured with the C-terminal-targeted antiserum that would be expected to react equally with both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ) were similar (data not shown). Although the reason for this difference in enzymic activity of epitope-tagged, immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ and PKC-λ is unknown, our findings nevertheless provide seemingly clear evidence that insulin activates both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ in rat adipocytes. In this regard, it may also be noted that insulin is known to activate PKC-λ in 3T3/L1 adipocytes (1Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L., Yu, B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J.

Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, we examined the effects of PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3 on in vitro assays of separate forms of PKC-ζ and PKC-λ. For this purpose, we used (a) HA-tagged PKC-ζ and Myc-tagged PKC-λ that were transiently expressed in rat adipocytes and precipitated with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies and (b) endogenous PKC-λ that was recovered from 3T3/L1 adipocytes with the anti-C-terminal antiserum (note that, as stated above, PKC-ζ has been reported to be absent in 3T3/L1 adipocytes; see Ref 2Kotani K.

As seen in Fig. 5, the addition of PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3 to the in vitro assay provoked similar concentration-dependent increases in the activity of both PKC-ζ and PKC-λ that had been immunoprecipitated from control rat and 3T3/L1 adipocytes; moreover, these PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3-induced increases in enzyme activity in vitro (approximately 1.5–2-fold) were comparable with or only slightly less than those provoked by insulin treatment in intact adipocytes (Figs. 4 and 5). These findings suggested that increases in PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3 may be sufficient (i.e. most likely in conjunction with PDK-1, which, as reported (6Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R.

In keeping with the latter suggestion and as reported previously in studies in which PI 3,4,5-(PO4)3 was added to immunoprecipitates of combined PKC-ζ and PKC-λ (3Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P.

We gained insight into these questions by using RO 31-8220 and the PKC-ζ/λ pseudosubstrate (SIYRRGARRWRKL), both of which directly inhibit PKC-ζ and PKC-λ and thus interfere with their autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation (see Ref 3Standaert M.L.

As seen in Figs. 6 and7, the presence of RO 31-8220 during incubation of intact adipocytes led to an inhibition of insulin-induced activation of immunoprecipitable combined PKC-ζ/λ; in contrast, insulin-induced enzymic activation of immunoprecipitable PKB was not inhibited by the presence of RO 31-8220 during insulin treatment of intact adipocytes (Fig. 6). Similarly, RO 31-8220 failed to block the wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation of serine 473 in PKB that was provoked by insulin in intact adipocytes (Fig. 7; the continued activation of PKB is also in keeping with the fact that RO 31-8220 does not inhibit the activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin; see Ref. 17Standaert M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2149907763,"Recently, we demonstrated that mechanical stress results in rapid phosphorylation or activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) followed by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and AP-1 transcription factors (Hu, Y., Bock, G., Wick, G., and Xu, Q. (1998) FASEB J. 12, 1135–1142). Herein, we provide evidence that VSMC responses to mechanical stress also include induction of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which may serve as a negative regulator of MAPK signaling pathways. When rat VSMCs cultivated on a flexible membrane were subjected to cyclic strain stress (60 cycles/min, 5–30% elongation), induction of MKP-1 proteins and mRNA was observed in time- and strength-dependent manners. Concomitantly, mechanical forces evoked rapid and transient activation of all three members of MAPKs, i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), or stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38 MAPKs. Suramin, a growth factor receptor antagonist, completely abolished ERK activation, significantly blocked MKP-1 expression, but not JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation, in response to mechanical stress. Interestingly, VSMC lines stably expressing dominant negative Ras (Ras N17) or Rac (Rac N17) exhibited a marked decrease in MKP-1 expression; the inhibition of ERK kinases (MEK1/2) by PD 98059 or of p38 MAPKs by SB 202190 resulted in a down-regulation of MKP-1 induction. Furthermore, overexpressing MKP-1 in VSMCs led to the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERKs, JNKs/SAPKs, and p38 MAPKs and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mechanical stress induces MKP-1 expression regulated by two signal pathways, including growth factor receptor-Ras-ERK and Rac-JNK/SAPK or p38 MAPK, and that MKP-1 inhibits VSMC proliferation via MAPK inactivation. These results suggest that MKP-1 plays a crucial role in mechanical stress-stimulated signaling leading to VSMC growth and differentiation.

In vivo, vessel walls are exposed to three main hemodynamic forces: shear stress, the dragging frictional force created by blood flow; transmural pressure, created by the hydrostatic forces of blood within the blood vessel; and mechanical stretch or tension, a cyclic strain stress created by blood pressure (19Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar, 20Patrick Jr., C.W. McIntire L.V. Blood Purif. 1995; 13: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). VSMCs are one of the major constituents of blood vessel wall responsible for the maintenance of vascular tone (21Vinters H.V. Berliner J.A. Diabetes Metab. 1987; 13: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar). Factors ranging from physical exertion to psychological stress lead to a transient rise in blood pressure (22Henry J.P. Grim C.E. J.

Thus, mechanical stress plays an important role in the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis (35Traub O. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Xu et al. (36Xu Q. Fawcett T.W. Gorospe M. Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have previously shown that acute hypertension induces a rapid and transient expression of MKP-1 mRNA followed by elevated MKP-1 protein in rat aorta. The MKP-1 induction is blocked by prevention of elevation in blood pressure, i.e. administration of the vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside. However, it is not known whether MKP-1 production is initiated by hemodynamic force per se or by hormones, cytokines in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated potential effects of mechanical stress on MKP-1 induction in VSMCs cultivated on a flexible membrane and subjected to cyclic strain stress. We demonstrated that mechanical stress causes rapid MKP-1 expression in VSMCs, which appears to be mediated by Ras- and Rac-MAPK pathways, respectively. A rat MKP-1 cDNA was isolated from rat lung cDNA library by Liu et al. (11Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against MKP-1, ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated-ERK1/2, -JNK1/2, and -p38 MAPK and against Ha-Ras were obtained from Santa Cruz Biochem., Santa Cruz, CA. Suramin and G418 were obtained from Sigma. PD 98059 and SB 202190 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novaniochem. Plasmids expressing dominant negative Ras (Ras N17) and dominant negative Rac1 (Rac1 N17) and myc-tagged antibody were provided by G. Baier (Institute for Medical Biology and Human Genetics, University of Innsbruck, Austria). SuperFect reagent for transfection was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). VSMCs were isolated by enzymatic digestion of rat aortas using a modification of the procedure of Ross and Kariya (37Ross R. Kariya B. Bohr D.F. Somlyo A.P. Sparks H.V. Handbook of Physiology: Circulation, Vascular Smooth Muscle. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1980: 69-91Google Scholar), as described previously (38Xu Q. Li D.G. Holbrook N.J. Udelsman R. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged by treatment with 0.2% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution. Experiments were conducted on VSMCs that had just achieved confluence. Rat VSMCs were transfected with Ras N17, Rac N17, and MKP-1 plasmids, respectively, by using SuperFect Kit according to the manufacture's instructions. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 h, divided 1 to 4, and placed in culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 150 μg/ml G418 to select those carrying a neomycin-resistant plasmid. When 80% cell death in a parallel group of normal VSMCs was observed, the medium containing 150 μg/ml G418 was changed into medium containing 50 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection. After 4–8 weeks, individual cell colonies were transferred for clone expansion and maintained in culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml G418. Ras N17-, Rac N17-, and MKP-1-transfected VSMCs were identified by Western blotting analysis with antibodies to Ha-Ras, myc-tagged, and MKP-1 proteins. VSMCs were plated on silicone elastomer-bottomed culture plates (Flexcell, Meckeesport, PA). Cells achieving 90% confluence were serum-starved for 3 days and subjected to mechanical stress with the Cyclic Stress Unit, a modification of the unit initially described by Banes et al. (39Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) consisting of a controlled vacuum unit and a base plate to hold the culture plates (FX3000 AFC-CTL, Flexcell). A vacuum (15 to 20 kilopascals) was repeatedly applied to the elastomer-bottomed plates via the base plate, which was placed in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cyclic deformation (60 cycles/min) and 5 to 30% elongation of elastomer-bottomed plates were used (40Hu Y. Bock G. Wick G. Xu Q. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). VSMCs, growing in silicone elastomer-bottomed culture plates to 90% confluence, were serum-starved for 3 days, and suramin, PD 98059, or SB 202190 was added and incubated for 1 h before application of cyclic strain stress. After strain stress, VSMCs were washed twice with cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and harvested on ice in buffer A containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min with vortexing every 5 min. Cellular debris were then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge, Osterode, Germany) at 4 °C, supernatants were collected, and protein concentration measured by the Bio-Rad assay. Membrane protein preparation for Ras and Rac analysis was similar to that described by Pomerantz et al. (41Pomerantz K.B. Lander H.M. Summers B. Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E. Hajjar D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9523-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C), scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 500 μl of homogenizing buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min to remove debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cytosolic supernatant was removed, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of homogenizing buffer and sonicated for 10 s, and protein concentration was measured. For total protein extract, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C), pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min before supernatant harvest. For Ras and Rac protein analysis, 30–100 μg of membrane protein was used in reduced conditions (2.5% SDS, 250 μm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 90 °C). The procedure used for Western blot analysis was similar to that described previously (42Xu Q. Hu Y. Kleindienst R. Wick G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In short, 30–100 μg of proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies against MKP-1, Ha-Ras, myc-tagged Rac1, phosphorylated-ERK1/2, -JNK1/2, or -p38 MAPK, and specific antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL Western blot Detection Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Graphs of blots were obtained in the linear range of detection and were quantified for the level of specific induction by scanning laser densitometry (Power-Look II, UMAX Data System Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan) of graphs. Total RNA was isolated as described elsewhere (36Xu Q. Fawcett T.W. Gorospe M. Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg/lane) was denatured with formaldehyde (Merck), electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, transferred onto nylon membrane (Zeta Probe, Bio-Rad), and UV-cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). Hybridizations were performed using a fluorescein-labeled (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cDNA probe for MKP-1, as described previously (36Xu Q. Fawcett T.W. Gorospe M. Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed, detected with antifluorescein alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5,000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to ECL films. Graphs of blots were obtained in the linear range of detection. Accuracy of loading and transfer as well as RNA integrity was confirmed by quantitative analysis of the 28 S and 18 S RNA. For kinase assays, 0.5 ml of supernatant containing 0.5 mg of proteins were incubated with 10 μl of antibodies against mammalian ERK2, JNK/SAPK, or p38 MAPKs for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Subsequently, 40 μl of protein G-agarose suspension (Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc.) was added and rotation was continued for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by centrifuge and washed twice with buffers A, B (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6), and C (20 mm Mops, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2), respectively. ERK2 or p38 activities in the immunocomplexes were measured as described previously (43Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44Hu Y. Metzler B. Xu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunocomplexes were incubated with myelin basic protein (6 μg; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) for 20 min. To stop the reaction, 15 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Proteins in the kinase reaction were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel) and subjected to autoradiography. The assay for JNK/SAPK activity was performed as described above using GST-c-Jun as a substrate (the plasmid was provided by Dr. J. Woodgett) produced in Escherichia coli and isolated using glutathione Sepharose 4B RediPack columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per manufacturer's protocol. Proteins in the kinase reaction were resolved by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) and subjected to autoradiography (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Transfected VSMCs cultured in the flexible plates in medium containing 20% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 24 h were serum-starved for 4 days. VSMCs were stressed by elongation of 15% for 30 min (60 cycles/min) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine was added 4 h before cell harvest. Radiation activities were measured. Analysis of variance was performed when more than two groups were compared. An unpaired Student's t test was used to assess differences between two groups. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. To explore the possibility that the expression of MKP-1 is altered after mechanical stress, MKP-1 mRNA in stressed VSMCs were determined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, strain stress treatment (60 cycles/min, 15% elongation) resulted in significant increases in MKP-1 mRNA. Kinetic analysis indicates that this response occurred as early as 8 min with maximum induction achieved 30 min after treatment and declining thereafter (Fig. 1 A). Fig.1 B showed 18 S and 28 S RNA from the corresponding blot, indicating a similar amount of RNA loaded. Likewise, growth-arrested VSMCs were exposed to cyclic strain stress for various times, and protein extracts from control and treated cells were analyzed for MKP-1 induction. As shown in Fig. 1 C, cells treated with mechanical stress resulted in a time-dependent induction of MKP-1 proteins that was evident at 8 min, peaked at 30 min, and returned to basal line by 4 h. Fig. 1 D summarizes data of MKP-1 protein induction as determined by quantification of optical densities from autoradiograms of three experiments. A significant increase in MKP-1 proteins of VSMCs was observed between 30 min and 3 h. To further establish the relationship between mechanical strain stress and MKP-1 expression, a tensile strength response analysis of mechanical stress-induced MKP-1 mRNA accumulation was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 A, VSMCs were stretched for elongation of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% of original size, respectively, and the increase of MKP-1 mRNA amounts corresponded with the increased magnitudes of stretch stress of 5–20%. Fig. 2 B shows the amount of 18 S and 28 S RNA from the corresponding blot. Similar results were observed at the level of MKP-1 proteins (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 2 D shows statistical data from three experiments. A significant induction was found in stressed VSMCs elongated between 10 and 30%. Our results provided the first evidence that MKP-1 is induced by mechanical stress in VSMCs. There is evidence that mechanical force rapidly activates ERK and JNK/SAPK in VSMCs (45Reusch H.P. Chan G. Ives H.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 46Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6334-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but no data exists as to whether p38 MAPK is also activated in response to cyclic strain stress. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphorylated-p38 MAPK, -ERK1/2, and -JNK1/2 antibodies, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in VSMCs treated with cyclic strain stress for various times. The highest level of p38 phosphorylation was obtained between 8 and 30 min and declined thereafter. Similarly, ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was evident, but ERK proteins did not alter in response to strain stress (Fig. 3, B and C). ERK activity was measured for immunoprecipitated ERK2 to phosphorylate myelin basic protein, indicating that mechanical strain stress induced marked ERK activation (Fig. 3 D). Strain stress also resulted in a rapid activation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 3, E and F) in VSMCs. The activities of three MAPKs declined between 30 and 120 min in response to mechanical stress (Fig. 3), whereas higher levels of MKP-1 proteins persisted (Fig. 1 C), suggesting a role of MKP-1 on inactivation of MAPKs. We recently demonstrated that mechanical stress directly stimulates platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphorylation or activation and that suramin, a broad spectrum receptor antagonist, blocked such activation (40Hu Y. Bock G. Wick G. Xu Q. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was not known if growth factor receptors were also responsible for MKP-1 induction during mechanical stress. Suramin treatment markedly blocked MKP-1 expression (Fig.4 A), suggesting that the initial signal in mechanical stressed-VSMCs is, at least in part, generated on the plasma membrane via growth factor receptor activation. As expected, suramin completely blocked mechanical stress-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 4 B) but not JNK/SAPK (Fig.4 C). Surprisingly, it apparently enhanced the activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that suramin-blocked MKP-1 expression may be due to inhibition of the growth factor receptor-ERK pathway, independent of the JNK/SAPK and P38 MAPK pathways. A large number of extracellular signals stimulates Ras activation, resulting in Ras-dependent MAPK activation. Recent data reported by Gudi et al. (47Gudi S. Nolan J.P. Frangos J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2515-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) indicate that Ras protein was activated in response to shear stress in endothelial cells. It would be interesting to determine whether Ras also mediates MKP-1 expression in stressed VSMCs. VSMCs were stably transfected with plasmid-expressing dominant negative Ras (Ras N17) or a vector plasmid as control. Since plasmids contain the selective marker gene neo, multiple G418-resistant colonies were selected and tested for expression of Ras protein by Western blotting analysis with anti-Ha-Ras antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Ras protein was at a lower level in vector-transfected controls and much higher in Ras-transfected cells. Ras N17 expression reduced ERK activation (Fig.5 B) and significantly blocked MKP-1 induction (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating Ras-ERK-dependent MKP-1 induction. Interestingly, stronger stress (25% elongation)-induced MKP-1 expression can only be partially blocked by Ras N17, suggesting that other signal pathways may be also involved. Rac is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Increasing evidence indicates that members of Rac regulate a diverse array of cellular events, including the control of cell growth, cytoskeletal reorganization and the activation of protein kinases, and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (48Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin.

Using Western blotting, calcium overlays, intracellular flow cytometry, and cytospin preparations, we demonstrate that S100A12 expression in leukocytes is specifically restricted to granulocytes and that S100A12 represents one of the major calcium-binding proteins in these cells. S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 translocate simultaneously from the cytosol to cytoskeletal and membrane structures in a calcium-dependent manner. However, no evidence for direct protein-protein interactions of S100A12 with either MRP8 or MRP14 or the heterodimer was found by chemical cross-linking, density gradient centrifugation, mass spectrometric measurements, or yeast two hybrid detection. Thus, S100A12 acts individually during calcium-dependent signaling, independent of MRP8, MRP14, and the heterodimer MRP8/MRP14.

One molecular pathway of calcium signal transduction is calcium-binding proteins of the S100 multigene family, which comprises a group of small, acidic proteins with a tissue- and cell cycle-specific expression (9Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 10Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem.

S100 proteins contain two calcium-binding sites per molecule (12Heizmann C.W. Hunziker W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Two members of this family have been found in human granulocytes and monocytes, called macrophage migration inhibitory factor-related protein 8 (MRP8)1 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9), which represent up to 40% of the calcium binding capacity in monocytes (13Odink K. Cerletti N. Brüggen J. Clerc R.G. Tarcsay L. Zwadlo G. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Nature. 1987; 330: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 14Van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins form noncovalently associated complexes in a calcium-dependent manner (15Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus H.-G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Vogl T. Roth J. Sorg C. Hillenkamp F. Strupat K. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes translocate from cytoplasm to membranes, as well as to intermediate filaments, after elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, and this correlates with the induction of inflammatory actions of granulocytes and monocytes. Thus, MRP8 and MRP14 seem to be important regulators of cytoskeletal/membrane interactions during phagocyte activation (17Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lemarchand P. Vaglio M. Mauel J. Markert M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The calcium-induced change in the complex pattern of these two proteins has been considered to be important for their biological function (15Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus H.-G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo K.-G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus H.-G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For example, only the complex of MRP8 and MRP14 has been described to inhibit casein kinases I and II, two enzymes involved in regulation of gene expression via mediation of RNA polymerase activity (20Murao S. Collart F.R. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8356-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a third S100 protein (S100A12) was identified in human and porcine granulocytes (21Ilg E.C. Troxler H. Bürgisser D.M. Kuster T. Markert M. Guignard F. Hunziker P. Birchler N. Heizmann C.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of human S100A12 consists of 91 amino acids with a molecular mass of 10,444 Da confirmed by ESI-MS (21Ilg E.C. Troxler H. Bürgisser D.M. Kuster T. Markert M. Guignard F. Hunziker P. Birchler N. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). S100A12 has been also found in small amounts in lysates of monocytes (24Guignard F. Mauel J. Markert M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (23Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santomé J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the amounts of S100A12 detected in these cells were in the range of contaminations by granulocytes in these mononuclear preparations. Synonyms of S100A12 are calgranulin C, calgranulin-related protein (22Marti T. Erttmann K.D. Gallin M.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and calcium-binding protein in amniotic fluid-1 (25Yamamura T. Hitomi J. Nagasaki K. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Saito S. Tsukuda T. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Hitomi J. Yamaguchi K. Kikuchi Y. Kimura T. Maruyama K. Nagasaki K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 805-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human S100A12 shows highest homologies to MRP14 (46%) and to MRP8 (40%) (21Ilg E.C. Troxler H. Bürgisser D.M. Kuster T. Markert M. Guignard F. Hunziker P. Birchler N. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Upon calcium binding, S100A12 from porcine granulocytes undergoes a gross conformational change, supporting the idea that this protein is involved in Ca2+-dependent signal transduction events (23Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santomé J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parallel expression of MRP8, MRP14, and S100A12 in myeloid cells (24Guignard F. Mauel J. Markert M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the copurification of these three S100 proteins (27Van den Bos C. Rammes A. Vogl T. Boynton R. Zaia J. Sorg C. Roth J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the general finding of the regulatory role of protein-protein interactions on S100-protein functions (28Yang Q. O'Hanlon D. Heizmann C.W. Marks A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 246: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Sastry M. Ketchem R.R. Crescenzi O. Weber C. Lubienski M.J. Hidaka K. Chazin W.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 223-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) has led to the assumption that these three calcium-binding proteins are involved in a common signal transduction pathway. However, there are no published data available analyzing possible interactions of S100A12 with MRP8 or MRP14. We now demonstrate on the single cell level that expression of S100A12 in leukocytes is specifically restricted to granulocytes. Furthermore, we found no evidence for interaction of S100A12 with MRP8, MRP14, and/or their heterocomplexes, either in the presence or the absence of calcium, as shown by density gradient centrifugation, chemical cross-linking, UV-MALDI-MS, and a yeast two hybrid system. Therefore, we conclude that S100A12 carries out its function exclusively in granulocytes without physically interacting with MRP8 or MRP14. 45CaCl2 (1 mCi/ml) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride and nitrocellulose membranes (pore size, 0.2 μm) were from Schleicher and Schuell. Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was from Pierce. Molecular mass markers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma and were at least of analytical grade. Monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes were isolated from human buffy coats and cultured as described elsewhere (30Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 31Feige U. Overwien B. Sorg C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 54: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Zwadlo G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1986; 72: 510-515Google Scholar). Purity of monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes was >97%. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) and stimulated with Me2SO (1.25% (v/v)), 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (100 nm), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) for 3 days to induce a granulocytic, monocytic, or mature macrophage phenotype, respectively (33Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallgher R.E. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 34Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Kuruto R. Nozawa R. Takeishi K. Arai K. Yokota T. Takasaki Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The S100 proteins MRP8, MRP14, and S100A12 were isolated from human granulocytes as described in detail previously (27Van den Bos C. Rammes A. Vogl T. Boynton R. Zaia J. Sorg C. Roth J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, granulocytes were lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.5) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture using a Branson sonifier, model 250 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). After ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g for 150 min at 4 °C, Centrikon T-1065, Kontron Instruments, Munich, Germany), proteins were precipitated by 70% ammonium sulfate and subsequently separated using anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At this stage, MRP8, MRP14, and S100A12 appeared to be essentially pure (>98%) (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To prepare the singular species, S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 were separated by preparative isoelectric focusing using a rotophor device (Bio-Rad) as described earlier (27Van den Bos C. Rammes A. Vogl T. Boynton R. Zaia J. Sorg C. Roth J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The identity of all three S100 proteins was ascertained by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI-MS). MRP8 and MRP14 were detected by non-cross-reactive affinity-purified rabbit antisera (a-MRP8 and a-MRP14). The monospecifity was evaluated by immunoreactivity against recombinant and native proteins, as well as against transfected cell lines, as described previously (13Odink K. Cerletti N. Brüggen J. Clerc R.G. Tarcsay L. Zwadlo G. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Nature. 1987; 330: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 17Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit antisera against S100A12 (a-S100A12) were made by immunization of rabbits with purified S100A12. The specificity of a-S100A12 was ascertained by immunoreactivity against purified material and cell lysates on Western blots. a-S100A12 showed a slightly cross-reactivity against MRP8. For detection of MRP8/MRP14 complexes, a monoclonal antibody 27E10 (19Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo K.-G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus H.-G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was employed recognizing only the MRP8/MRP14 heterodimer but not single monomers of MRP8 and MRP14. As specific markers for granulocytes, monocytes or lymphocytes monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3, CD14, CD15, and CD16 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used. For controls, polyclonal rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and monoclonal mouse IgG1(Dianova) of irrelevant specificity were employed throughout all investigations. Monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes were separately analyzed by flow cytometry employing a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with Lysis II software. Peripheral blood leukocytes were gated by the side scatter and forward scatter filters, and the purity of each cell group was controlled by parallel stainings for CD3, CD14, CD15, and CD16. After isolation, cells were stained using an indirect immunofluorescence method as described earlier (19Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo K.-G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus H.-G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using a cell permeabilization kit according to the instructions of the company (Biozol, Eching, Germany). In addition, cytospin preparations of monocytes, granulocytes, and HL-60 cells were analyzed for expression of S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 by indirect immunocytochemistry using antisera against S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 followed by peroxidase-conjugated second stage goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dianova) for detection. Granulocytes were fractionated in subcellular compartments as described previously (17Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ferber E. Resch K. Wallach D.F.H. Imm W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 266: 494-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, containing either 0.1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA. After sonification, lysates were subjected to differential centrifugation maintaining the calcium and EGTA concentrations and a temperature of 4 °C throughout the whole procedure. Cytoskeletal fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min (Kontron, model T1065). The pellet (cytoskeleton) was washed three times in 20 mm HEPES, 1% Nonidet P-40 including sonification for three cycles. The 1000 ×g supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 ×g in order to discard cellular debris and aggregated membrane sheets. The 10,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet (membrane fraction) was washed twice in 5 mm HEPES and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to release cytosolic proteins trapped in membrane vesicles by osmotic shocks. The 100,000 × g supernatant was considered as the cytosolic fraction. The purity of subcellular fractions was established by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in the different fractions during the final washing step (38Vasault A. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974: 607Crossref Google Scholar). The lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cytoskeletal and membrane fraction was less than 0.1% of that in the cytosolic fraction. Western blots of the different fractions were stained with a-S100A12, a-MRP8, and a-MRP14 and peroxidase-conjugated second stage goat anti-rabbit antibody (17Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding of proteins was detected by the method of Murayama et al. (39Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Proteins of MonoQ fractions were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using 50 mmTris borate buffer adjusted to pH 8.3. After blotting, the membranes were incubated three times in washing buffer (10 mmimidazole, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) for 10 min. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with washing buffer containing 0.1 mCi 45CaCl2/100 ml for 15 min. Membranes were washed three times for 3 min in doubly distilled water to remove unbound calcium, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Spots were evaluated densitometrically (Personal Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Ca2+binding was corrected to the different concentrations of S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 in granulocytes. Chemical cross-linking of S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 was carried out using BS3 according to the method of Staros and Kakkad (40Staros J.V. Kakkad B.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 74: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein samples from MonoQ fractions containing either MRP8 and MRP14 or S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, and adjusted to a concentration of 0.5 mg of protein ml−1 and 2 mm BS3. The reaction was quenched after 30 min by addition of 1 m Tris to a final concentration of 20 mm. Samples cross-linked with BS3 were incubated with 1% β-mercaptoethanol prior to separation by 15% SDS-PAGE. To analyze the influence of calcium binding on a complex formation of S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14, density gradient centrifugation was employed. A glycerol gradient ranging from 15 to 30% in 50 mm HEPES, 140 mmNaCl, pH 7.3, was used in the presence of either 0.1 mmCa2+ or 1 mm EGTA. Gradients were loaded with samples containing S100A12, MRP8, and MRP14 and dialyzed against the buffer described above adjusted to 10% glycerol and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were centrifuged for 20 h at 20 °C and 150,000 × g. After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated into 20 aliquots. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The principle of UV-MALDI-MS is described in the literature (41Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1193A-1203ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gross J. Strupat K. Trends Anal. Chem. 1998; 17: 470-484Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our investigations, a home-built time-of-flight system equipped with both a linear and a reflectron port was used. A frequency-tripled Nd-YAG-laser (JK-Laser Ltd., Rugby, United Kingdom) at 355 nm with a pulse duration of 15 ns served for the desorption/ionization of molecules. A conventional secondary electron multiplier (EMI 9643, Electron Tube Ltd., Middlesex, UK) plus conversion dynode (R2362, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) in front of it was used as detector system. A transient recorder (LeCroy 9354, LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY) and a personal computer were used for data accumulation and data processing. Only a limited number of matrix/laser wavelengths combinations preserved complexes throughout the whole procedure, and most importantly, only spectra recorded from the top layer of the samples showed pronounced signals of the complexes under such conditions. This latter observation is known as the “first shot phenomenon” (43Rosinke B. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. Rosenbusch J. Dencher N. Krüger U. Galla H.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1462-1468Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 44Cohen L. Strupat K. Hillenkamp F. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 1046-1052Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The matrix employed was 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), which was prepared as a saturated solution in a mixture of acetonitrile/water (1/3; v/v). The actual UV-MALDI-samples were prepared directly on the stainless steel MALDI target by mixing 0.5 μl of the protein solution (1 mg/ml) with 0.5 μl of either doubly distilled water or a 10 mm CaCl2 solution and 2.5 μl of matrix solution. All samples were allowed to dry in a stream of cold air. A yeast two-hybrid system according to Fields and Song (45Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) was used for in vivo interaction studies of either MRP8 or MRP14 with S100A12, as well as studies of the homodimerization propensity of S100A12 as described previously (46Pröpper C. Huang X. Roth J. Sorg C. Nacken W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragments encoding the entire human S100A12 were fused to either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the yeast plasmid pAS2–1 or the GAL4 activation domain of pACT2, respectively, according to the instructions of the company (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). pAS2–1 encodes the N-terminal GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147). pACT2 encodes the C-terminal acidic GAL4 activation domain (amino acids 768–881). For interaction studies with MRP8 or MRP14, the cDNA of S100A12 was fused in frame to the GAL4 activation domain, and the cDNAs of either MRP8 or MRP14, respectively, were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, the cDNA of S100A12 was cloned in frame with the DNA-binding domain of pAS2–1 in order to investigate homodimerization formation of S100A12. The cDNA fusions were performed by ligation of cDNA of the desired S100 protein that had been amplified with polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide linkers to allow the in frame insertion into the yeast expression vectors. All constructs were sequenced in order to ensure that the intended correct insertion was successful. Transformations of pairwise vector combinations were done into the yeast strain Y190 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (47Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The phenotypical detection of protein/protein interactions was investigated by using a sensitive and rapid X-gal filter lift assay for the detection of β-galactosidase activity followed by a photometric O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside test for the quantification of β-galactosidase units (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.). Calcium-dependent signaling is a major pathway leading to activation of granulocytes and monocytes during inflammatory situations (48Gordon S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 49Gordon S. Clarke S. Greaves D. Doyle A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analysis of such signal pathways is important, because uncontrolled activation of these cell populations is a major pathomechanism in many inflammatory diseases. Three calcium-binding proteins of the S100 family, MRP8, MRP14, and S100A12, have been characterized in myeloid cells; the relation of these proteins, however, is unclear (18Lemarchand P. Vaglio M. Mauel J. Markert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19379-19382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Schleicher C.H. Dell'Angelica E.C. Santome J.A. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To investigate the expression pattern of S100A12 in leukocytes, lysates of granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, as well as of HL-60 cells stimulated with Me2SO (differentiation to granulocytes), 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (monocytes), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (mature macrophages), were analyzed by Western blot technique. We found a strong expression of S100A12 in granulocytes (Fig. 1 A), whereas we did not observe S100A12 expression in either HL-60 cell lysates or in lymphocyte lysates. Monocyte lysates exhibit a clear albeit weak immunoreactivity for S100A12. However, a low level immunoreactivity, as found by us and others (23Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santomé J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Guignard F. Mauel J. Markert M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) may well be due to contamination of the mononuclear cell fractions with granulocytes. To address this possibility, we performed intracellular flow cytometry staining for S100A12 and for cell type-specific markers simultaneously. We detected S100A12 expression exclusively in granulocytes, but not in monocytes or in lymphocytes (Fig. 1 B). Likewise, using cytospin preparations of monocytes and granulocytes, we found S100A12 expression exclusively in granulocytes (Fig. 1 C). We found no S100A12 expression in cytospin preparations of lymphocytes or HL-60 cells (data not shown). Thus, our data demonstrate that expression of S100A12 is specifically restricted to granulocytes, and detection of S100A12 in lysates of monocytes or lymphocytes as described earlier is due to contaminations by granulocytes. As shown earlier, MRP8 and MRP14 translocate from the cytosol to membrane and cytoskeletal structures in a calcium-dependent manner (17Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E.

To determine the subcellular distribution of S100A12, purified granulocytes were lysed in the presence and absence of calcium and separated into cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and membranous fractions by differential centrifugation. In the absence of calcium, S100A12 was found predominantly in the cytosol, whereas addition of calcium induced a strong translocation to both membrane and cytoskeletal components (Fig. 2), closely resembling the distribution pattern of MRP8 and MRP14 (17Roth J.

https://openalex.org/W2109110671,"It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expressed in the diaphragm during endotoxemia, participates in the development of muscular contractile failure. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this deleterious action of NO was related to its effects on cellular oxidative pathways. Rats were inoculated with E. coli lipopolysac-charide (LPS) or sterile saline solution (controls) and studied at 3 and 6 h after inoculation. iNOS protein and activity could be detected in the rat diaphragm as early as 3 h after LPS, with a sustained steady-state concentration of 0.5 µM NO in the muscle associated with increased detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In vitro, the same NO concentration produced a marked increase in H2O2 production by isolated control diaphragm mitochondria, thus reflecting a higher intramitochondrial concentration of nondiffusible superoxide anion (O2−·). In a similar way, whole diaphragmatic muscle and diaphragm mitochondria from endotoxemic rats showed a progressive increase in H2O2 production associated with uncoupling and decreased phosphor-ylating capacity. Simultaneous with the maximal impairment in respiration (6 h after LPS), nitration of mitochondrial proteins (a peroxynitrite footprint) was detected and diaphragmatic force was reduced. Functional mitochondrial abnormalities, nitration of mitochondrial proteins, and the decrease in force were significantly attenuated by administration of the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. These results show that increased and sustained NO levels lead to a consecutive formation of O2−· that reacts with NO to form peroxynitrite, which in turn impairs mitochondrial function, which probably contributes to the impairment of muscle contractility.—Boczkowski, J., Lis-dero, C.

https://openalex.org/W1909616616,"Besides the well-documented effect of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin on free radical generation, the exact signaling mechanisms by which it causes cardiac damage remain largely unknown and are of fundamental importance in understanding anthracycline cardiotoxicity. In this study, we describe that a 1 h treatment of isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes with doxorubicin (0.5 microM) induced DNA fragmentation associated with the classical morphological features of apoptosis observed after 7 days of culture. The doxorubicin toxicity was preceded by an increase in intracellular ceramide levels with a concurrent decrease in sphingomyelin. Anthracycline-induced ceramide accumulation resulted from the activation of a sphingomyelinase assayed under acidic conditions, an effect related to an increase in V(max). Pretreatment of cardiac myocytes with L-carnitine (200 microgram/ml), a compound known for its protective effect on cardiac metabolic injuries, was found to dose-dependently inhibit the doxorubicin-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation as well as subsequent cell death. However, L-carnitine did not protect cardiac myocytes from apoptosis induced by exogenous cell-permeant ceramide. L-carnitine pretreatment did not affect the sphingomyelinase basal activity but abolished the doxorubicin-induced increase in V(max). Moreover, in vitro studies conducted on cell extracts or with purified acid sphingomyelinase demonstrated that L-carnitine exerted a dose-dependent, sphingomyelinase inhibitory effect (through V(max) reduction). Taken together, these findings show that by inhibiting a (perhaps novel) drug-activated acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide generation, L-carnitine can prevent doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2054307762,Long-term depression (LTD) is a well-known form of synaptic plasticity of principal neurons in the mammalian brain. Whether such changes occur in interneurons is still controversial. CA3 hippocampal interneurons expressing Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors exhibited LTD after tetanic stimulation of CA3 excitatory inputs. LTD was independent of NMDA receptors and required both Ca2+ influx through postsynaptic AMPA receptors and activation of presynaptic mGluR7-like receptors. These results point to the capability of interneurons to undergo plastic changes of synaptic strength through joint activation of pre- and postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

In mainland populations, gene flow results in local maladaptive timing of breeding in evergreen oak forests, the rarer habitat. However, on the island of Corsica, two populations only 25 kilometers apart are highly specialized and differ between the two habitat types in breeding and morphological traits. In contrast to theoretical predictions about the homogenizing effects of gene flow, this highlights evolutionary consequences of habitat diversification and isolation at a small spatial scale in insular organisms, which should be taken into account in conservation policies."

A novel subtype of the eel AR may exist because a cDNA encoding part of another AR was isolated during cloning of eel AR (eAR1) from testis (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, differentiation of the masculine phenotype is directed by secretion of steroid hormones, usually androgen (7Wilson J. George F. Griffen J. Science. 1981; 211: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratory, using a teleost, the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), have identified 11-ketotestosterone (11KT), a major androgen in some fish, as the spermatogenesis-inducing hormone (8Miura T. Yamauchi K. Nagahama Y. Takahashi H. Zool. Sci. 1991; 8: 63-73Google Scholar, 9Miura T. Yamauchi K. Takahashi H. Nagahama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 257-262Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 11KT can induce the entire process of spermatogenesis from spermatogonial proliferation to sperm formation in both cultured testicular fragments (9Miura T. Yamauchi K. Takahashi H. Nagahama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5774-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and cocultured germ and somatic cells (10Miura C. Miura T. Yamashita M. Yamauchi K. Nagahama Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 257-262Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) from immature eels. 11KT activates Sertoli cells to stimulate production of activin B, which has been identified as the spermatogonial proliferator in the Japanese eel (11Nagahama Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 217-229PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of eel spermatogenesis by 11KT are not fully understood. To understand the mechanism of androgen action and AR regulation of gene transcription, it is important to isolate and characterize subtypes of the AR. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of an eel cDNA containing an entire AR subtype coding region. The transactivation function of this AR was determined by expressing the cDNA in transiently transfected human kidney 293 cells. The AR mRNA levels in various tissues from eels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cultivated Japanese eel males (150–200 g in body weight) were purchased from a commercial eel supplier. They were kept in recirculating freshwater tanks with a capacity of 500 liters at 20 °C. Fish were not fed throughout the experimental period. A cDNA fragment of an AR subtype (eAR2), whose sequence partially differed from eAR1, was isolated after a testis cDNA library from Japanese eels killed 1 and 3 days after human chorionic gonadotropin injection was screened using a PCR amplified product as a probe (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the 3′ terminus of the clone was truncated, 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The insert cDNA was nest-deleted at both ends using Exo III/Mung bean nuclease. Sequencing was performed using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). pcDNA-eAR2 was constructed by PCR amplification of the entire protein coding region (amino acids 1–798) of the eAR2, using primers that introduced an Eco RI site and in-frame Kozak sequence (12Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) at the 5′ end and an Eco RI site at the 3′ end. The Eco RI fragment was inserted at the Eco RI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). pcDNA-eARrev, which had the pcDNA-eAR2 inserted in the reverse direction, was also prepared as a negative control. pcDNA-eAR1 has been described elsewhere as pcDNA-eAR (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An androgen-regulated reporter vector, named pGV2-MMTV, was also constructed as described previously (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 250 ng of pGV2-MMTV, 250 ng of pRL-TK (for internal control to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency; contains the Renilla reniformis luciferase gene with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter; Toyo Ink), and 50 ng of pcDNA-eAR2, pcDNA-eAR1, or pcDNA-eARrev, using TfxTM-20 reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 1 h of incubation, 1 ml of fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum plus steroid hormones was applied to the cells. After 48 h, the cells were collected, and the luciferase activities of the cells were measured by a chemiluminescence assay using PicaGene DualTMSeaPansy Assay System kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from gill, heart, head kidney, spleen, liver, muscle, testis, and brain of male eels and ovary of female eels by a method described previously (13Todo T. Adachi S. Yamauchi K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Random primed double strand cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 1 mm sense primer (5′-TCCACAAATCTTCCTTGTCTG-3′, for eAR2), and 1 mm antisense primer (5′-GGGCCTGGGTGGGAAGCTCAT-3′, for eAR2). Both sense and antisense primers for eAR1 and β-actin were the same as described previously (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Nagae M. Adachi S. Yamauchi K. Fish Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 17: 179-186Crossref Google Scholar). 32 cycles of amplification for eAR2 and 28 cycles for eAR1 and β-actin were carried out under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 62 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 0.5 min. At completion of the PCR, fragments were separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Data from transactivation experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between groups were identified by the Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Differences were regarded as significant at p < 0.01. During cloning of eAR1 cDNA, one positive clone, whose sequence partially differed from that of eAR1 cDNA, was obtained. This insert is 1,718 base pairs in size, and the 3′-terminus of the cDNA was truncated. Thus, 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) was performed by using primer (corresponding to 1,594–1,622 base pairs) designed so that the PCR product overlapped with the 3′ terminus truncated clone at an eAR2 unique sequence. Based on the 3′ terminus truncated clone and the 3′-RACE product obtained, the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of eAR2 were determined (Fig.1). The sequence contains a long open reading frame encoding 797 amino acid residues (molecular mass, 94,688 Da). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of eAR2 with those of eel steroid hormone receptors and ARs of several species is shown in Fig.2. The eAR2 gene sequence could be subdivided into 4–5 domains (A-F) as defined by Krust et al. (15Krust A. Green S. Argos P. Kumar V. Walter P. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The putative DNA-binding domain (residues 436–522) and LBD (residues 548–797) show high homology with those of other ARs including eAR1 (DNA-binding domain, 98–88%; LBD, 59–85%). The other domains show low homology (<35%). Judging from these structures, eAR1 and eAR2 are not isoforms derived from translational initiation at two in-phase ATG codons, alternative splicing, or tetraploidy.Figure 2Comparison of eAR2 protein with eAR1 (A), steroid hormone receptors in eel (B), or androgen receptors of several species (C).

Recently, two isoforms of AR (designated rtARα and rtARβ) were reported in rainbow trout (5Takeo J. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5674-5680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). They are probably derived from salmonid tetraploidy, because homology of their full-length open reading frames is very high (85% in amino acid residues) compared with that of eAR1 and eAR2 (40% in amino acid residues). Notably, rtARβ did not activate transcription of an androgen-responsive gene. It has been reported that two types of gonadotropin α-subunit exist not only in salmonids but also in tetraploid common carp (19Huang C.J. Huang F.L. Chang G.D. Chang Y.S. Lo C.F. Fraser M.J. Lo T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when these subunits of common carp were expressed in insect cells by recombinant baculovirus, α1 associated with β subunit to form active gonadotropin, whereas α2 associated with β subunit but the resulting entity did not display gonadotropic activity (19Huang C.J. Huang F.L. Chang G.D. Chang Y.S. Lo C.F. Fraser M.J. Lo T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, rtARs appear to be isoforms derived from tetraploidy as well as gonadotropin α of carp. Moreover, both rtARs are similar to eAR2 and different from eAR1 in structure. On the other hand, tetrapod ARs are similar to eAR1. Whether a subtype corresponding to eAR2 exists in tetrapods as well as other teleosts is an interesting question. Although the N-terminal A/B domain displayed low homology overall, one conserved region is found among the ARs (residues 117–135 in the eAR2). It has been shown that the A/B domain contains transactivation function, which is dependent on cell and promoter types but less on ligand binding (20Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to determine whether the conserved regions in the A/B domain of ARs are involved in common functions, such as cell/promoter-specific transactivation. In the DNA-binding domain, the position of cysteine residues, which constitute the two zinc finger motifs, and the P box (GSCKV), which is the important region for determination of the target gene (21Umezono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), are also conserved in the eel AR2. Several amino acids in the LBD, which have been predicted as important in ligand binding based on crystallographic, genetic, or biochemical analysis (22Thornton J.W. Kelley D.B. BioEssays. 1998; 20 (, and references therein): 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), differ between hAR and eel ARs. For eAR2, these residues are Asn565 (eAR1, Asn616), Leu628 (eAR1, Leu679), Tyr633 (eAR1, the same as hAR), Val656 (eAR1, Val707), Ser658 (eAR1, Thr709), Ser765 (eAR1, Asn816), Leu766(eAR1, Leu817), Asn769 (eAR1, Cys820) (corresponding to Cys686, Gly743, Met749, Phe754, Lys777, Arg779, Met886, Val887, and Asp890 in the human AR) (22Thornton J.W. Kelley D.B. BioEssays. 1998; 20 (, and references therein): 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the affinity of eARs for various androgens may not differ greatly from that of the hAR. In addition, a leucine zipper motif, which was found in the C-terminal region of eAR1 LBD (residues 787–815) (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), is also conserved in the corresponding region of eAR2 (residues 736–764). The leucine zipper-like structure is conserved in many nuclear receptors, and is required for dimerization of receptors (23Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, this region in the eel AR could be involved in dimerization of ARs. Ligand specificity for the induction of androgen-regulated reporter activity was examined by incubation with 100 nm of various steroids (Fig.3). Only androgens were effective in inducing luciferase activity. 11KT and the synthetic androgens, mibolerone (7α,17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and 17α-methyltestosterone, were most potent. Testosterone, 11β-hydroxytestosterone, and androstenedione were also effective, but their potencies were significantly lower than that of 11KT (p < 0.01). Other androgen-related steroids (11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11-ketoandrostenedione (adrenosterone), 11-ketoetiocolanolone, and 5β-dihydrotestosterone) and other classes of steroids (cortisol, 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and estradiol-17β) were ineffective. When pcDNA-eARrev was transfected, none of the steroids induced luciferase activity (data not shown). These results show that the cloned eAR2 cDNA encodes a functional eel AR. There were three minor differences in ligand affinity between eAR2 and eAR1, although the difference in homology of LBD between eAR1 and eAR2 (77%) is smaller than that between rat ERα and ERβ (53.5%) (2Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4238) Google Scholar). First, synthetic androgens were significantly more effective than 5αDHT in inducing transcriptional activity of eAR2, a finding that differs from the pattern seen for eAR1 (Fig. 3 B). Second, androstenedione induced weak transcriptional activity in eAR2, whereas eAR1 was not significantly stimulated by this steroid. Third, 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, which is the maturation-inducing steroid of many teleosts, did not induce any significant transcriptional activity of eAR2, whereas it induced weak transcriptional activity of eAR1. The ligand binding affinity of rat ERα and ERβ protein for physiological ligands is overall quite similar, certainly when only the order of competition is compared (24Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the affinity for other estrogen-related substances (moxestrol, 17α-estradiol, etc.) differed between both ER subtypes (24Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Similar differences between eel ARs were also observed in this study. What is the native ligand of eARs? In the Japanese eel, 11KT (and not testosterone or 5αDHT) is the major androgen (quantitatively and physiologically) produced by testis during spermatogenesis (8Miura T. Yamauchi K. Nagahama Y.

A. 1991; 88: 5774-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). 11KT stimulated luciferase activity through eAR2 and eAR1 (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). The minimum stimulatory dose of 11KT was 1 nm. Serum 11KT levels in human chorionic gonadotropin-treated and untreated Japanese eel males ranged from 0.8 to 26 nm (8Miura T. Yamauchi K. Nagahama Y. Takahashi H. Zool. Sci. 1991; 8: 63-73Google Scholar). Physiological doses of 11KT are thus sufficient to activate luciferase activity via eel ARs. Thus, these results indicate that the major native ligand of ARs is 11KT. The levels of AR mRNA in various tissues from male Japanese eel were measured by reverse transcription-PCR. eAR2 mRNA was detected only in spleen, muscle, and testis, whereas eAR1 mRNA was observed in several other tissues as well (Fig. 5). Tissue distribution and/or the relative level of ERα and ERβ mRNA expression is quite different in rat (24Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Differences in tissue distribution mRNA for eel ARs are predictable because their A/B domains, which contain a region of transactivation function strongly dependent on cell and promoter types but less on ligand binding, show low homology. Thus, difference in transactivation function of ARs on certain target genes may also exist in eel. These results indicate that eAR2 is a novel AR subtype. Therefore, we suggest that this AR subtype be named eel ARβ to differentiate it from eAR1 (ARα) cloned previously (6Todo T. Ikeuchi T. Kobayashi T. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the existence of two different ARs is unclear and is being addressed in ongoing studies. We are grateful to Dr. Graham Young (University of Otago, New Zealand) for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1860141269,"Severe acute liver injury due to accidental or intentional acetaminophen overdose presents a major clinical dilemma often requiring liver transplantation. In the present study, liver regeneration after profound liver injury in mice challenged with acetaminophen was facilitated by the exogenous addition of ELR-containing CXC chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), epithelial neutrophil-activating protein-78 (ENA-78), or interleukin 8. Intravenous administration of ELR-CXC chemokines or N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) immediately after acetaminophen challenge in mice significantly reduced histological and biochemical markers of hepatic injury. However, when the intervention was delayed until 10 h after acetaminophen challenge, only ELR-CXC chemokines significantly reduced liver injury and mouse mortality. The delayed addition of ELR-CXC chemokines to cultured hepatocytes maintained the proliferation of these cells in a CXCR2-dependent fashion after acetaminophen challenge whereas delayed NAC treatment did not. These observations demonstrate that ELR-CXC chemokines represent novel hepatic regenerative factors that exhibit prolonged therapeutic effects after acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2019243957,"Class II transactivator (CIITA) is a global transcriptional coactivator of human leukocyte antigen-D (HLA-D) genes. CIITA contains motifs similar to guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. This report shows that CIITA binds GTP, and mutations in these motifs decrease its GTP-binding and transactivation activity. Substitution of these motifs with analogous sequences from Ras restores CIITA function. CIITA exhibits little GTPase activity, yet mutations in CIITA that confer GTPase activity reduce transcriptional activity. GTP binding by CIITA correlates with nuclear import. Thus, unlike other GTP-binding proteins, CIITA is involved in transcriptional activation that uses GTP binding to facilitate its own nuclear import."
https://openalex.org/W1591053743,"Mitochondria have recently been shown to serve a central role in programmed cell death. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in cell death pathways upon treatment with a variety of agents; however, the specific cellular source of the ROS generation is unknown. We hypothesize that mitochondria-derived free radicals play a critical role in apoptotic cell death. To directly test this hypothesis, we treated murine fibrosarcoma cell lines, which expressed a range of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activities, with respiratory chain inhibitors. Apoptosis was confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis and electron microscopy. MnSOD overexpression specifically protected against cell death upon treatment with rotenone or antimycin. We examined bcl-x(L), p53 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to identify specific cellular pathways that might contribute to the mitochondrial-initiated ROS-mediated cell death. Cells overexpressing MnSOD contained less bcl-x(L) within the mitochondria compared to control (NEO) cells, therefore excluding the role of bcl-x(L). p53 was undetectable by Western analysis and examination of the proapoptotic protein bax, a p53 target gene, did not increase with treatment. Activation of caspase-3 (CPP-32) occurred in the NEO cells independent of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. PARP, a target protein of CPP-32 activity, was cleaved to a 64 kDa fragment in the NEO cells prior to generation of nucleosomal fragments. Taken together, these findings suggest that mitochondrial-mediated ROS generation is a key event by which inhibition of respiration causes cell death, and identifies CPP-32 and the PARP-linked pathway as targets of mitochondrial-derived ROS-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1868989971,"We have previouslyreported that low doses of melatonin inhibit apoptosis in both dexamethasone-treated cultured thymocytes (standard model for the study of apoptosis) and the intact thymus. Here we elucidate the mechanism by which this agent protects thymocytes from cell death induced by glucocorticoids. Our results demonstrate an effect of melatonin on the mRNA for antioxidant enzymes in thymocytes, also showing an unexpected regulation by dexamethasone of these mRNA. Both an effect of melatonin on the general machinery of apoptosis and a possible regulation of the expression of the cell death related genes bcl-2 and p53 are shown not to be involved. We found melatonin to down-regulate the mRNA for the glucocorticoid receptor in thymocytes (glucocorticoids up-regulate their own receptor). The decrease by melatonin of mRNA levels for this receptor in IM-9 cells (where glucocorticoids down-regulate it) demonstrates that melatonin actually down-regulates glucocorticoid receptor. These findings allow us to propose the effects of melatonin on this receptor as the likely mediator of its thymocyte protection against dexamethasone-induced cell death. This effect of melatonin, given the oxidant properties of glucocorticoids, adds another mechanism to explain its antioxidant effects."

The prototypical example of this form of regulation is the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 since agonist-generated “inside-out” signals are required to enable αIIbβ3 to bind soluble ligands such as fibrinogen (1O'Toole T.E.

Because the binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation (2Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), regulating the affinity of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen in this way assures that only stimulated platelets aggregate. It is likely that intracellular molecules regulate the function of αIIbβ3 by interacting with its cytoplasmic domains (3Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

It was observed previously that releasing cytoskeletal constraints on integrins can increase the avidity of cell adhesion, presumably by increasing the likelihood of random encounters between integrins and immobilized ligands. Kucik et al. (27Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) reported that exposing B lymphocytes to either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or submicromolar concentrations of Cyto-D increases the random movement of the integrin αLβ2 while, at the same time, substantially increasing the number of cells adherent to ICAM-1. Lub et al. (28Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) made similar observations, whereas Elemer and Edgington (29Elemer G.S. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3159-3166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that exposing monocytes to cytochalasin B induces soluble fibrinogen and Factor X binding to the integrin αMβ2, implying that disrupting cytoskeletal associations in leukocytes can also alter the affinity of β2 integrins for ligands. On the other hand, Stewart et al. (30Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) reported that although calpain-mediated cytoskeletal disassembly in lymphocytes induces αLβ2 clustering and cell adhesion to ICAM-1, it does so without increasing the affinity of αLβ2 for soluble ICAM-1.Unlike leukocytes whose integrins interact with inducible membrane proteins like ICAM-1, circulating platelets undergo homotypic aggregation after soluble fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor binds to αIIbβ3 (31Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 16: 31-36Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the concentrations of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in plasma are substantially in excess of those required to saturate αIIbβ3(2Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), circulating platelets maintain αIIbβ3in an inactive state to prevent spontaneous platelet aggregation. However, platelet stimulation, either by inducing a change in the conformation of αIIbβ3 or by inducing αIIbβ3 clustering on the platelet surface or both, enables αIIbβ3 to bind soluble ligands (7Fox J.E.B.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Which of these events is the predominate factor in controlling αIIbβ3 affinity is not clear, although Hato et al. (33Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) recently concluded, from experiments in which αIIbβ3 could be clustered in the absence of agonist stimulation, that clustering by itself makes only a modest contribution to the affinity of αIIbβ3 for soluble ligands.A substantial fraction of the integrin αIIbβ3 in the plasma membrane of unstimulated platelets is associated with a submembranous cytoskeletal lattice containing short actin filaments, spectrin, talin, and vinculin (34Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hartwig J.H. DeSisto M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Platelet stimulation results in fragmentation of the actin filaments in this lattice (23Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and coincident with platelet aggregation, αIIbβ3 redistributes to a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal core (34Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that either platelet stimulation or ligand binding disrupts its association with the membrane skeleton. We found that exposing unstimulated gel-filtered platelets to the actin polymerization inhibitors Cyto-D and Lat-A induced the binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3, suggesting that disrupting the association of αIIbβ3 with the membrane skeleton also alters its affinity for soluble ligands. The converse of these observations, stabilizing actin filaments with jasplakinolide, prevented the induction of fibrinogen binding by Cyto-D and Lat-A as well as by ADP and provides further support for this premise.Since neither Cyto-D nor Lat-A by itself initiates actin filament turnover (4Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 9Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), it is likely that their effects on αIIbβ3 function resulted from perturbing either a slow rate of spontaneous actin filament turnover in unstimulated platelets or, more likely, actin turnover initiated by a subthreshold platelet stimulus. We found that Cyto-D- and Lat-A-induced fibrinogen binding was prevented by ADP scavengers, suggesting that the subthreshold concentrations of ADP that are present in platelet-rich plasma (13Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1980; 95: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar) or that likely are released during the gel filtration of platelets were the stimuli that initiated actin filament turnover. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that incubating gel-filtered platelets with the ADP scavenger apyrase decreased their content of F-actin and inhibited the actin nucleating activity of platelet lysates. Paradoxically, we also found that Cyto-D and Lat-A inhibited fibrinogen binding stimulated by suprathreshold concentrations of ADP, a finding consistent with previous reports that cytochalasins inhibit fibrinogen binding to agonist-stimulated platelets (5Peerschke E.I.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1984; 175: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Addo J.B. Bray P.F. Grigoryev D. Faraday N. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Fox J.E.B. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, neither agent was able to completely inhibit fibrinogen binding; indeed, there was no difference in the amount of fibrinogen bound at Cyto-D and Lat-A concentrations ≥1 μm, regardless of whether the platelets were stimulated by subthreshold or suprathreshold concentrations of ADP. Thus, Cyto-D and Lat-A inhibit the additional αIIbβ3activation induced by high concentrations of agonist.It seems unlikely that a single explanation can account for both the enhancement and inhibition of fibrinogen binding by Cyto-D and Lat-A. It is possible that at subthreshold agonist concentrations, Cyto-D and Lat-A are able to relieve cytoskeletal constraints only on a portion of the integrin αIIbβ3 in the platelet membrane; but this would not explain that fact that in the presence or absence of agonist, the fibrinogen bound when Cyto-D and Lat-A concentrations exceed 1 μm is the same. Most likely, when at least subthreshold concentrations of agonist are present, αIIbβ3 activation results from destabilizing actin filaments with Cyto-D and Lat-A. At higher agonist concentrations, αIIbβ3 activation results from actin turnover associated with net actin polymerization. In a similar situation, the lamellipodia of chemoattractant-stimulated leukocytes contain a labile pool of actin filaments that turn over rapidly, continually polymerizing at their barbed ends and depolymerizing at their pointed ends, in the presence of chemoattractant (17Cassimeris L. McNeill H. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, merely increasing the platelet content of F-actin is not sufficient to activate αIIbβ3 because jasplakinolide, which stabilizes F-actin, inhibited fibrinogen binding. Thus, it is likely that agonist stimulation reorganizes the membrane skeleton as well.How might agonist stimulation reorganize the membrane skeleton? Platelets contain at least two proteins that specifically sever and/or depolymerize actin filaments and could be involved in the platelet response to Cyto-D and Lat-A. One is gelsolin, a calcium-activated protein that severs actin filaments by rupturing noncovalent bonds between actin subunits, followed by capping the barbed end of the severed filaments (36Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Gelsolin-deficient mice have prolonged bleeding times, consistent with defective platelet function. Moreover, there is decreased actin fragmentation following platelet activation and an accompanying decrease in actin nucleating activity. A second protein is cofilin, a ubiquitously expressed member of the cofilin/ADF family of small actin-binding proteins (37Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 6: 1423-1431Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ability of cofilin to disassemble actin filaments is inhibited by LIM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-3 (38Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 39Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Davidson and Haslam (26Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that ≈25% of the cofilin in unstimulated platelets is phosphorylated and is rapidly dephosphorylated following platelet exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. We found that Cyto-D- and Lat-A-induced fibrinogen binding was inhibited by preincubating platelets with intracellular calcium chelators or with inhibitors of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A (40Shenolikar S. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the former could be acting, at least in part, to prevent the activation of gelsolin, whereas the effect of latter could be to impair the activation of cofilin. A third platelet protein, calpain, has been implicated in agonist-induced clustering of αLβ2 in T lymphocytes and increased avidity of lymphocyte adhesion (30Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, Fox et al. (41Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that calpain activation in platelets requires ligand binding to αIIbβ3; and thus, it is downstream from αIIbβ3 activation.In summary, we have shown that interrupting actin filament turnover in platelets, either by capping actin filaments with Cyto-D or by sequestering actin monomers with Lat-A, enables a substantial proportion of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3to bind soluble fibrinogen. Our results suggest that in unstimulated platelets, actin or actin-associated proteins such as talin or α-actinin in the membrane skeleton constrain αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state, perhaps by binding directly to the αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic tails (42Knezevic I.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21193-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by limiting access of αIIbβ3-activating proteins such as β3-endonexin (44Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or CIB (45Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We propose that platelet agonists initiate actin filament turnover in the membrane skeleton, perhaps by activating such actin disassembly factors as gelsolin and cofilin. In turn, the turnover of actin filaments relieves the constraint on αIIbβ3, allowing it to assume the high affinity conformation required for fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. The biochemical reactions that control actin assembly and disassembly in platelets may be relevant pharmacologic targets for regulating αIIbβ3 function in vivo. The function of integrins in circulating blood cells is regulated by limiting their access to ligands. The prototypical example of this form of regulation is the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 since agonist-generated “inside-out” signals are required to enable αIIbβ3 to bind soluble ligands such as fibrinogen (1O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because the binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation (2Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), regulating the affinity of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen in this way assures that only stimulated platelets aggregate. It is likely that intracellular molecules regulate the function of αIIbβ3 by interacting with its cytoplasmic domains (3Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In the work described in this paper, we used cytochalasin D (Cyto-D),1latrunculin A (Lat-A; another inhibitor of actin polymerization (9Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D.

DISCUSSIONOur data suggest that an increase in actin filament turnover in platelets induced by inside-out signaling relieves cytoskeletal constraints on the integrin αIIbβ3, thereby increasing its affinity for soluble ligands. It was observed previously that releasing cytoskeletal constraints on integrins can increase the avidity of cell adhesion, presumably by increasing the likelihood of random encounters between integrins and immobilized ligands. Kucik et al. (27Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) reported that exposing B lymphocytes to either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or submicromolar concentrations of Cyto-D increases the random movement of the integrin αLβ2 while, at the same time, substantially increasing the number of cells adherent to ICAM-1. Lub et al. (28Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) made similar observations, whereas Elemer and Edgington (29Elemer G.S. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3159-3166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that exposing monocytes to cytochalasin B induces soluble fibrinogen and Factor X binding to the integrin αMβ2, implying that disrupting cytoskeletal associations in leukocytes can also alter the affinity of β2 integrins for ligands. On the other hand, Stewart et al. (30Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) reported that although calpain-mediated cytoskeletal disassembly in lymphocytes induces αLβ2 clustering and cell adhesion to ICAM-1, it does so without increasing the affinity of αLβ2 for soluble ICAM-1.Unlike leukocytes whose integrins interact with inducible membrane proteins like ICAM-1, circulating platelets undergo homotypic aggregation after soluble fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor binds to αIIbβ3 (31Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 16: 31-36Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the concentrations of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in plasma are substantially in excess of those required to saturate αIIbβ3(2Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), circulating platelets maintain αIIbβ3in an inactive state to prevent spontaneous platelet aggregation. However, platelet stimulation, either by inducing a change in the conformation of αIIbβ3 or by inducing αIIbβ3 clustering on the platelet surface or both, enables αIIbβ3 to bind soluble ligands (7Fox J.E.B.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Which of these events is the predominate factor in controlling αIIbβ3 affinity is not clear, although Hato et al. (33Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) recently concluded, from experiments in which αIIbβ3 could be clustered in the absence of agonist stimulation, that clustering by itself makes only a modest contribution to the affinity of αIIbβ3 for soluble ligands.A substantial fraction of the integrin αIIbβ3 in the plasma membrane of unstimulated platelets is associated with a submembranous cytoskeletal lattice containing short actin filaments, spectrin, talin, and vinculin (34Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hartwig J.H. DeSisto M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Platelet stimulation results in fragmentation of the actin filaments in this lattice (23Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and coincident with platelet aggregation, αIIbβ3 redistributes to a detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal core (34Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that either platelet stimulation or ligand binding disrupts its association with the membrane skeleton. We found that exposing unstimulated gel-filtered platelets to the actin polymerization inhibitors Cyto-D and Lat-A induced the binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3, suggesting that disrupting the association of αIIbβ3 with the membrane skeleton also alters its affinity for soluble ligands. The converse of these observations, stabilizing actin filaments with jasplakinolide, prevented the induction of fibrinogen binding by Cyto-D and Lat-A as well as by ADP and provides further support for this premise.Since neither Cyto-D nor Lat-A by itself initiates actin filament turnover (4Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 9Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), it is likely that their effects on αIIbβ3 function resulted from perturbing either a slow rate of spontaneous actin filament turnover in unstimulated platelets or, more likely, actin turnover initiated by a subthreshold platelet stimulus. We found that Cyto-D- and Lat-A-induced fibrinogen binding was prevented by ADP scavengers, suggesting that the subthreshold concentrations of ADP that are present in platelet-rich plasma (13Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1980; 95: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar) or that likely are released during the gel filtration of platelets were the stimuli that initiated actin filament turnover. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that incubating gel-filtered platelets with the ADP scavenger apyrase decreased their content of F-actin and inhibited the actin nucleating activity of platelet lysates. Paradoxically, we also found that Cyto-D and Lat-A inhibited fibrinogen binding stimulated by suprathreshold concentrations of ADP, a finding consistent with previous reports that cytochalasins inhibit fibrinogen binding to agonist-stimulated platelets (5Peerschke E.I.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1984; 175: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Addo J.B. Bray P.F. Grigoryev D. Faraday N. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7004-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, neither agent was able to completely inhibit fibrinogen binding; indeed, there was no difference in the amount of fibrinogen bound at Cyto-D and Lat-A concentrations ≥1 μm, regardless of whether the platelets were stimulated by subthreshold or suprathreshold concentrations of ADP. Thus, Cyto-D and Lat-A inhibit the additional αIIbβ3activation induced by high concentrations of agonist.It seems unlikely that a single explanation can account for both the enhancement and inhibition of fibrinogen binding by Cyto-D and Lat-A. It is possible that at subthreshold agonist concentrations, Cyto-D and Lat-A are able to relieve cytoskeletal constraints only on a portion of the integrin αIIbβ3 in the platelet membrane; but this would not explain that fact that in the presence or absence of agonist, the fibrinogen bound when Cyto-D and Lat-A concentrations exceed 1 μm is the same. Most likely, when at least subthreshold concentrations of agonist are present, αIIbβ3 activation results from destabilizing actin filaments with Cyto-D and Lat-A. At higher agonist concentrations, αIIbβ3 activation results from actin turnover associated with net actin polymerization. In a similar situation, the lamellipodia of chemoattractant-stimulated leukocytes contain a labile pool of actin filaments that turn over rapidly, continually polymerizing at their barbed ends and depolymerizing at their pointed ends, in the presence of chemoattractant (17Cassimeris L. McNeill H. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, merely increasing the platelet content of F-actin is not sufficient to activate αIIbβ3 because jasplakinolide, which stabilizes F-actin, inhibited fibrinogen binding. Thus, it is likely that agonist stimulation reorganizes the membrane skeleton as well.How might agonist stimulation reorganize the membrane skeleton? Platelets contain at least two proteins that specifically sever and/or depolymerize actin filaments and could be involved in the platelet response to Cyto-D and Lat-A. One is gelsolin, a calcium-activated protein that severs actin filaments by rupturing noncovalent bonds between actin subunits, followed by capping the barbed end of the severed filaments (36Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Gelsolin-deficient mice have prolonged bleeding times, consistent with defective platelet function. Moreover, there is decreased actin fragmentation following platelet activation and an accompanying decrease in actin nucleating activity. A second protein is cofilin, a ubiquitously expressed member of the cofilin/ADF family of small actin-binding proteins (37Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 6: 1423-1431Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ability of cofilin to disassemble actin filaments is inhibited by LIM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-3 (38Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 39Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Davidson and Haslam (26Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that ≈25% of the cofilin in unstimulated platelets is phosphorylated and is rapidly dephosphorylated following platelet exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. We found that Cyto-D- and Lat-A-induced fibrinogen binding was inhibited by preincubating platelets with intracellular calcium chelators or with inhibitors of the Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A (40Shenolikar S. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the former could be acting, at least in part, to prevent the activation of gelsolin, whereas the effect of latter could be to impair the activation of cofilin. A third platelet protein, calpain, has been implicated in agonist-induced clustering of αLβ2 in T lymphocytes and increased avidity of lymphocyte adhesion (30Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, Fox et al. (41Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that calpain activation in platelets requires ligand binding to αIIbβ3; and thus, it is downstream from αIIbβ3 activation.In summary, we have shown that interrupting actin filament turnover in platelets, either by capping actin filaments with Cyto-D or by sequestering actin monomers with Lat-A, enables a substantial proportion of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3to bind soluble fibrinogen. Our results suggest that in unstimulated platelets, actin or actin-associated proteins such as talin or α-actinin in the membrane skeleton constrain αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state, perhaps by binding directly to the αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic tails (42Knezevic I.

We propose that platelet agonists initiate actin filament turnover in the membrane skeleton, perhaps by activating such actin disassembly factors as gelsolin and cofilin. In turn, the turnover of actin filaments relieves the constraint on αIIbβ3, allowing it to assume the high affinity conformation required for fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. The biochemical reactions that control actin assembly and disassembly in platelets may be relevant pharmacologic targets for regulating αIIbβ3 function in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2066088092,"Matrix olivines in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite are believed to have formed by condensation processes in the primitive solar nebula. However, transmission electron microscope observations of numerous matrix olivines show that they contain abundant, previously unrecognized, nanometer-sized inclusions of pentlandite and poorly graphitized carbon. Neither of these phases would have been stable at the high-temperature conditions required to condense iron-rich olivine in the solar nebula. The presence of these inclusions is consistent with formation of the olivines by parent body processes that involved overgrowth of fine-grained organic materials and sulfides in the precursor matrix materials."
https://openalex.org/W1901663601,"Signaling by insulin requires autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) at Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163. Earlier experiments with (32)P-gamma-ATP indicated that the nonphosphorylated IRK (IRK-0P) is relatively inactive, and crystallographic data indicated that the ATP binding site of IRK-0P is blocked by its activation loop. We now show that phosphocreatine (PCr) in combination with hydrogen peroxide serves as an alternative phosphate donor and that ATP and PCr use distinct binding sites. Whereas phosphorylation of the IRK by ATP is inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable competitor adenylyl-imidodiphosphate, phosphorylation by PCr is enhanced. The IRK mutant Tyr1158Phe showed no phosphorylation with PCr but almost normal phosphorylation with ATP, whereas Tyr1162Phe was phosphorylated well with PCr but less then normal with ATP. 3-Dimensional models of IRK-0P revealed that the conversion of any of the four cysteine residues 1056, 1138, 1234, and 1245 into sulfenic acid produces structural changes that bring Tyr1158 into close contact with Asp1083 and render the well-known catalytic site at Asp1132 and Tyr1162 accessible from a direction that differs from the known ATP binding site. The mutant Cys1138Ala, in contrast, showed relatively inaccessible catalytic sites and weak catalytic activity in functional experiments. Taken together, these findings indicate that 'redox priming' of the IRK facilitates its autophosphorylation by PCr in the activation loop."
https://openalex.org/W1543388017,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid metabolite, is involved in the mitogenic response of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and is formed by activation of sphingosine kinase. We examined the effect of PDGF on sphingosine kinase activation in TRMP cells expressing wild-type or various mutant betaPDGF receptors. Sphingosine kinase was stimulated by PDGF in cells expressing wild-type receptors but not in cells expressing kinase-inactive receptors (R634). Cells expressing mutated PDGF receptors with phenylalanine substitutions at five major tyrosine phosphorylation sites 740/751/771/1009/1021 (F5 mutants), which are unable to associate with PLCgamma, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, or protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, not only failed to increase DNA synthesis in response to PDGF but also did not activate sphingosine kinase. Moreover, mutation of tyrosine-1021 of the PDGF receptor to phenylalanine, which impairs its association with PLCgamma, abrogated PDGF-induced activation of sphingosine kinase. In contrast, PDGF was still able to stimulate sphingosine kinase in cells expressing the PDGF receptor mutated at tyrosines 740/751 and 1009, responsible for binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHP-2, respectively. In agreement, PDGF did not stimulate sphingosine kinase activity in F5 receptor 'add-back' mutants in which association with the Ras GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or SHP-2 was individually restored. However, a mutant PDGF receptor that was able to bind PLCgamma (tyrosine-1021), but not other signaling proteins, restored sphingosine kinase sensitivity to PDGF. These data indicate that the tyrosine residue responsible for binding of PLCgamma is required for PDGF-induced activation of sphingosine kinase. Moreover, calcium mobilization downstream of PLCgamma, but not protein kinase C activation, appears to be required for stimulation of sphingosine kinase by PDGF.-Olivera, A., Edsall, J., Poulton, S., Kazlauskas, A., Spiegel, S. Platelet-derived growth factor-induced activation of sphingosine kinase requires phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor tyrosine residue responsible for binding of PLCgamma."
https://openalex.org/W2038952850,"α-Chemokines are known heparin-binding proteins. Here, a heparin dodecasaccharide (H12) was purified and used in NMR studies to investigate binding to growth-related protein-α (Gro-α) and to platelet factor-4-M2 (PF4-M2), an N-terminal chimera of PF4. Pulsed field gradient NMR was used to derive diffusion coefficients as the protein (monomer):H12 ratio was varied. In the absence of H12, both PF4-M2 and Gro-α give diffusion coefficients consistent with the presence of mostly dimers. As the PF4-M2:H12 ratio is increased from 1:6 to 2:1, the diffusion coefficient increases, indicating dissociation to the monomer state. On addition of H12 to either protein, 15N/1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR data demonstrate loss of 1H resonance dispersion and intensity, particularly at protein:H12 ratios of 2:1 to 4:1, indicating significant perturbation to native structures. For Gro-α in particular, 1H resonance dispersion appears random coil-like. At these same ratios, circular dichroism (CD) data show general retention of secondary structure elements with a slight shift to additional helix formation. Random coil NMR resonance dispersion suggests a shift to a less compact, partially folded, and/or more flexible state. Further addition of H12 causes resonance intensity and dispersion to return making NMR spectra appear native-like. At low PF4-M2:H12 ratios, loss of resonance intensity for residues proximal to Arg-20 and Arg-22 in three-dimensional NMR HCCH-TOCSY spectra suggests that the Arg-20-Arg-22 loop either interacts most strongly with H12 and/or that binding at this site is heterogeneous. This domain was previously shown to be crucial to heparin binding. Of particular interest to the biology of PF4-heparin complex formation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody binding occurs at about the same PF4-M2:H12 ratio as does this transition to a partially folded PF4-M2 state, strongly suggesting that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody recognizes a less folded, lower aggregate state of the protein. α-Chemokines are known heparin-binding proteins.

Most of the heparin molecule is accounted for by this repeating disaccharide unit, which consists primarily of 2-O-sulfated-α-l-idopyranosyluronic acid 2-sulfate and 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-α-d-glucopyranose (GlcNSO3) 6-sulfate (1Jeanloz R.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1975; 52: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the covalent structure of a heparin dodecasaccharide. A number of proteins have been identified that bind avidly to polyanionic heparin and heparin-derived polysaccharides, e.g. fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)1 (2Tyrrell D.J. Ishihara M. Rao N.

Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), antithrombin-III (4von Boeckel C.A.A. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Visser A. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and α-chemokines (5Mire-Slius, A. & Thorpe, R. (eds) (1998) Cytokines, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar) like platelet factor-4 (PF4) and growth-related protein-α (Gro-α). α-Chemokines, which demonstrate a variety of physiological activities, some of which may be related to binding heparin-like glycosaminoglycans on the surface of cells, present good model systems for exploring heparin-protein interactions. PF4 is perhaps the strongest heparin-binding protein known (6Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). During coagulation, for example, PF4 displaces thrombin from heparin, where it forms anticoagulant complex with antithrombin-III, into solution, where thrombin is procoagulant through its interactions with blood clotting factors (7Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). PF4 exhibits other physiological effects (5Mire-Slius, A. & Thorpe, R. (eds) (1998) Cytokines, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar), including stimulation of fibroblast attachment to the substrate, chemotactic activity with respect to neutrophils, monocytes and fibroblasts, potentiation of platelet aggregation and inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis, angiogenesis, and solid tumor growth. Gro-α (also called melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA)) is secreted by a number of different cells and demonstrates a variety of biological activities (5Mire-Slius, A. & Thorpe, R. (eds) (1998) Cytokines, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar), including stimulation of melanoma cell growth, neutrophil chemotaxis, and inhibition of collagen expression. α-Chemokines can exist as dimers or tetramers (5Mire-Slius, A. & Thorpe, R. (eds) (1998) Cytokines, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar). In solution, PF4 may form dimers and tetramers, whereas Gro-α and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are observed to aggregate only to the dimer state. Structure analysis of native human PF4 (8Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C., K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) indicates that each subunit (A, B, C, and D) of the tetramer has a three-stranded β-sheet scaffold onto which is folded an amphipathic C-terminal α-helix and an aperiodic N-terminal segment. In general, such tetrameric structures naturally have three types of monomer-monomer (dimer) interactions, which are referred to in the literature as AB, AC and AD. In AB-type dimers, monomers associate by continuing their anti-parallel β-sheets to form a six stranded sheet. Gro-α and IL-8 associate as AB-type dimers. The general AB-type dimer fold that is observed in all α-chemokines is illustrated in Fig. 2 for PF4 and Gro-α. In the crystal (8Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C., K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), as well as in solution (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), native PF4 AB-type dimers associate to form tetramers that are asymmetric, i.e. each monomer in the tetramer has a slightly different orientation with respect to any other monomer subunit. In NMR spectra, this gives rise to multiple sets of resonances for each residue, one set from each subunit, making NMR solution studies with native PF4 intractable. Substitution of a highly acidic N-terminal region of PF4 with the N-terminal sequence of homologous IL-8 results in formation of a symmetric tetramer (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) wherein each monomer is identically positioned within the tetramer, thus facilitating interpretation of NMR experiments. This chimera, named PF4-M2, binds heparin nearly as tightly as native PF4 (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and has been used in the present heparin binding studies. The C terminus of PF4 (… LY60KKIIK65KLLES70) (and of α-chemokines in general) was proposed originally to be the primary mediator of heparin binding (10Loscalzo J. Melnick B. Handin R.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Cowan S.W. Bakshi E.N. Machin K.J. Isaacs N.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), particularly via interactions with the four lysine residues conformed spatially in tandem on the solvent-exposed surface of the C-terminal α-helix. In fact, a single amino acid replacement of Lys-65 (PF4) by Glu-63 (Gro-α) (… IVKKIIE63KMLNSDKS) was used to rationalize heparin binding differences between these two proteins (6Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Analysis of the PF4 tetrameric structure, however, reveals the presence of a ring of positive charge circumventing the molecule and running perpendicular to the C-terminal helices (8Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C., K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No experimentally determined structure of the PF4-heparin complex is yet known. However, two models for heparin binding to PF4 have been devised in which the heparin molecule binds either parallel (11Cowan S.W. Bakshi E.N. Machin K.J. Isaacs N.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or perpendicular (12Stuckey J.A. St. Charles R. Edwards B.F.P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to the C-terminal α-helixes of the AB dimer (see Fig. 2). In an experimental NMR study, Mayo et al. (13Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) deduced that the perpendicular binding mode is most probably favored and that, even though heparin (9,000-dalton cut-off) interacted with residues within the ring of positively charged groups, Arg-20 and Arg-22 were crucial to the binding process, more so than the C-terminal lysines. These and most other protein-heparin binding studies have been performed using commercial preparations of heparin that result in limited structural information due to heterogeneity of the heparin polymer. Moreover, these heparin preparations are known to induce protein precipitation when the heparin:protein ratio is less than about 3:1. One way to avoid these problems is to use heparinase-derived, homogeneous preparations of short-chain heparins. Heparin chains up to tetradecasaccharide in length can be obtained (14Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); however, for milligram quantities required for NMR studies, a dodecasaccharide is probably the best attainable. The present study, therefore, is aimed at investigating interactions of a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide (H12) (Fig. 1) with PF4-M2 and Gro-α. Approximately 2 g of heparin was dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water and dialyzed exhaustively, freeze-dried, and prepared at exactly 20 mg/ml in distilled water (15Linhardt R.J. Rice K.G. Kim Y.S. Lohse D.L. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To 50 ml of heparin (20 mg/ml) was added 450 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (55 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7) containing 800 mIU of heparinase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 h. At 30% reaction completion, reaction was terminated by heating to 100 °C. The depolymerization mixture was separated, and individual low molecular weight heparin oligosaccharide fractions were isolated by gel permeation chromatography and strong-anion exchange HPLC as discussed previously (14Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The heparin oligosaccharide used in the present study is a dodecasaccharide with the structure shown in Fig. 1. In the present report, this heparin-derived dodecasaccharide is referred to as H12. This procedure produced milligram quantities of H12 necessary for the NMR studies; nonetheless, amounts of H12 were limited to about 4 mg. Synthetic genes for PF4-M2 and Gro-α were expressed as non-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and grown at the 10-liter scale with 15N-enriched ammonia as the nitrogen source and [13C]glucose as the carbon source (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified and refolded essentially as described previously (16Yang Y. Mayo K.H. Daly T.J. Barry J.K. La Rosa G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20110-20118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical C4 reverse phase HPLC, and amino acid analysis. Typically, several hundred milligrams of greater than 95% pure material was isolated from 100 g of starting material. Protein concentration was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar) and calculated on the basis of protein concentrations obtained from a standard dilution series of bovine serum albumin. Protein concentrations also were checked by using the methods of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of Waddell (19Waddell W.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1956; 48: 311-314PubMed Google Scholar). 15N/13C-labeled PF4-M2 was dissolved in 10%/90% D2O/H2O at a concentration of 6 mg/ml, pH 5.9, 20 mm NaCl. This PF4-M2 solution was then titrated into a solution of H12 in aliquots of 30 μl to reach the following PF4-M2 (monomeric):H12 ratios: 1:6, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. To achieve the final ratio, unlabeled PF4-M2 was added to the 2:1 mixture of 15N/13C-labeled PF4-M2 and H12. The addition of each aliquot of PF4-M2 solution induced some opacity to the H12 solution, which became clear after heating up to 50 °C for about 30 min or sitting overnight at room temperature. Following mixing of H12 and PF4-M2, the solution pH remained essentially unchanged, varying by no more than 0.05 pH units. 15N-Labeled Gro-α was dissolved in 10%/90% D2O/H2O at concentration of 10 mg/ml. In order to facilitate NMR assignments, the solution pH was adjusted to 5.7 to be the same as that used in the assignment/structural studies of Fairbrother et al. (20Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To this solution of Gro-α was added microliter aliquots of a concentrated solution of H12 to achieve the following Gro-α (monomeric):H12 ratios: 20:1, 10:1, 4:1, 2:1, and 1:1. Addition of the initial H12 aliquot to the protein solution induced some opacity to the solution which, as with PF4-M2, became clear after heating to 50 °C for 30 min or allowing it to stand overnight at room temperature. When the Gro-α:H12 ratio reached 4:1 or greater, addition of more H12 induced no further cloudiness. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer. H121H resonances were assigned by using a combination of TOCSY (21Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) (2048 × 256, 60-ms mixing time) and NOESY (22Jeener J. Meier B. Backman P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem.

(14Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In these two-dimensional NMR experiments, suppression of the water resonance was carried out using the WATERGATE sequence (24Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional NMR 15N gradient-enhanced HSQC (25Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10668Crossref Scopus (2429) Google Scholar) (2048 × 256) spectra were collected at various molar ratios of protein:H12 as noted above. The transmitter offset for the 1H dimension was set on the water resonance. The water signal was suppressed by applying selectively shaped pulses. Two-dimensional NMR data were processed off line using the programs Felix (Biosym/MSI, San Diego) and VNMR (Varian) by zero-filling to achieve 1024 × 1024 real data points and by using skewed-sinebell or Gaussian window functions. HCCH-TOCSY (26Clore G.M. Bax A. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8172-8184Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (64 × 48 × 1024, 15.6 ms mixing time) three-dimensional NMR experiments were acquired at 50 °C and were used to assign PF4-M2 side-chain resonances for the protein in the absence and in the presence of approximately 5-fold molar heparin excess. Previous 1H resonance assignments were used from data acquired on pure PF4-M2 (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Assignments for the mixture were made under the assumption that 13C chemical shifts for side-chain carbons were nearly the same in both PF4-M2 free and H12-bound states. Gradient-enhanced TOCSY-HSQC (27Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 28Wijmenga S.S. van Mierlo C.P.M. Steensma E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (64 × 48 × 1024, 60-ms mixing time) three-dimensional NMR experiments were performed at 30 °C in order to complete 15N assignments of Gro-α.1H and 15N chemical shifts for Gro-α were essentially the same as those reported previously by Fairbrother et al. (20Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The raw three-dimensional NMR data were zero-filled to 256 × 256 × 1024 and multiplied by a sinebell window function using VNMR software (Varian). Translational diffusion measurements were performed on a Varian Inova 500 NMR spectrometer by using the pulse field gradient (PFG) method as described previously (29Ilyina E. Roongta V. Pan H. Woodward C. Mayo K.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3383-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar PFG-NMR studies have been done to assess the self-association and complexation of other protein systems (e.g. 30). The PFG longitudinal Eddy current delay pulse sequence (31Gibbs S.J. Johnson C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar) was used for all diffusion measurements. For unrestricted molecular diffusion in an isotropic medium, the amplitude of the NMR signal, A, normalized to the signal obtained in the absence of gradient pulses is related to the diffusion coefficient D by Equation 1.A(g2)=A(0)exp[−γ2g2δ2D(Δ−δ/3)]Equation 1 γ is the gyromagnetic ratio for the observed nucleus (1H in this case); g and δ are the magnitude and duration of the magnetic field gradient pulses, respectively, and Δ is the time between gradient pulses. Gradient strength was calibrated based on the known diffusion constant of water (2.3 × 10−5 cm2/s at 25 °C). Other parameters in Equation 1 were set as follows: δ = 4 ms, Δ = 34.2 ms. For each measurement, 11 NMR spectra were collected for different values of g and processed off-line by using a home-written VNMR macro. Diffusion constants for PF4-M2 and Gro-α were measured over a range of temperatures from 10 °C to 60 °C. Diffusion measurements of solutions of PF4 (30 mg/ml) and IL-8 (10 mg/ml) were used as references for tetramer and dimer sizes, respectively. The Stokes-Einstein equation,D=kBT/6πηR,Equation 2 where R is the macromolecular radius and η is the solution viscosity, was used to relate D to the apparent molecular weight Mapp. The apparent molecular weight for globular proteins is proportional to R 3, whereas for random coils, it is proportional to R 2 (32Cantor C.R.

From Equation 2, it follows that under the same conditions, diffusion coefficients for two different proteins related by their apparent molecular weights is shown by Equation 3.(D1/D2)=(M2app/M1app)aEquation 3 Here, the superscript a is 1/3 for compact proteins and 1/2 for random coils. According to this equation, a factor of 2 difference in molecular weights (e.g. monomer to dimer) results in a D 1/D 2 ratio of 1.26 to 1.41. This relationship, of course, is an approximation and works best for monomeric proteins having a spherical shape. The actual molecular shape and configuration of the aggregate are expected to affect the diffusion coefficient. Thus, using apparent molecular weights rather than experimentally measured diffusion coefficients can be a source of error. Therefore, these results are presented here in terms of diffusion coefficients. Circular dichroic (CD) spectra were measured on a Jasco JA-710 automatic recording spectropolarimeter coupled to a data processor. Curves were recorded digitally and fed through the data processor for signal averaging and base-line subtraction. Spectra were recorded at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm potassium phosphate, over a 190–250-nm range using a 0.5-mm path length, thermally jacketed quartz cuvette. Temperature was controlled by using a NesLab water bath. Protein concentration was 0.03 mm. The scan speed was 20 nm/min. Spectra were signal-averaged eight times, and an equally signal-averaged solvent base line was subtracted. CD spectra were deconvoluted as described by Sreerama and Woody (33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Since α-chemokines PF4-M2 and Gro-α are known to bind heparin and heparin fragments relatively tightly (6Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it was thought that mixing pure H12 and pure PF4-M2 or Gro-α would produce a complex of protein and GAG whose NMR spectral features would be similar to the sum of the individual species. The situation turned out to be not so simple, and the following sections report observations from diffusion, NMR, and CD measurements which catalog protein quaternary and tertiary structural changes induced by the presence of H12. To investigate how the size of PF4-M2 or Gro-α changed on binding H12, PFG-NMR self-diffusion measurements were performed at various protein (monomer):H12 ratios. For reference and calibration, Fig. 3 A plots the temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients, D, for native PF4, IL-8 dimer, Gro-α dimer, and PF4-M2 in the absence of H12. The temperature dependence of D for PF4, PF4-M2, and IL-8 is linear with apparent activation energies of 4.7, 5, and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, and follows the activation energy expected for the self-diffusion of water, 4.8 kcal/mol. Thus, one can be confident that the aggregate state of these proteins remains essentially unchanged over this temperature range and that the distribution is homogeneous, i.e. multiple oligomerization states either are not present or are minimal. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that, as indicated in the literature, aggregation states for native PF4 (34Mayo K.H. Chen M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and IL-8 (35Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18907-18911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are tetramer and dimer, respectively, at these concentrations. The temperature dependence of D for pure Gro-α at 10 mg/ml, although linear with an apparent activation energy value of 4.3 kcal/mol, does deviate more than expected for a single size species. Since Gro-α and IL-8 have nearly the same monomer molecular weight and are known to form the same type of dimers (20Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,35Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18907-18911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their dimers should display nearly the same diffusion coefficients. This is not the case with D values for Gro-α being larger than those for dimeric IL-8 and the difference in their apparent activation energies being 0.7 kcal/mol. Moreover, the temperature dependence for changes in aggregate state distributions for homologous α-chemokines PF4 (34Mayo K.H. Chen M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and NAP-2 (neutrophil activating peptide-2) (16Yang Y. Mayo K.H. Daly T.J. Barry J.K. La Rosa G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20110-20118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is small, suggesting a primarily entropy-driven process of self-association. This is consistent with the observed minimal change in activation energies for partially dissociated Gro-α. These diffusion data, therefore, indicate that Gro-α at this concentration is partly dissociated, more so at lower temperature as also observed with other α-chemokines. At 30 °C, a D value of about 15 × 10−7 cm2/s is expected for compactly folded, monomeric Gro-α, assuming the ratio of monomer/dimer diffusion coefficients is similar to that of tetramer/dimer. This would indicate that, at 30 °C, this preparation of Gro-α is about 44% dimeric. For PF4-M2, diffusion coefficients over the temperature range 10–40 °C are the same as those for IL-8, indicating that PF4-M2 is primarily dimeric under these solution conditions (6 mg/ml). This was unexpected since earlier studies (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) indicated that PF4-M2 at 6 mg/ml would be a mix of mostly dimers and tetramers. Moreover,13C and 15N NMR relaxation data (T1, T2, and NOE) 2V. Roongta, E. Ilyina, V. Daragan, and K. H. Mayo, unpublished results. yield rotational correlation times also consistent with PF4-M2 being primarily dimeric. These data contradict our earlier results regarding the aggregation states of PF4-M2 (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11399-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Originally, the equilibrium between monomer, dimer, and tetramer states of native PF4 (34Mayo K.H. Chen M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9469-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and PF4-M2 (9Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Millius R. Baker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G. Daly T.J.

https://openalex.org/W1989663904,"The thioredoxin superfamily consists of enzymes that catalyze the reduction, formation, and isomerization of disulfide bonds and exert their activity through a redox active disulfide in a Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys motif. The individual members of the family differ strongly in their intrinsic redox potentials. However, the role of the different redox potentials for the in vivo function of these enzymes is essentially unknown. To address the question of in vivo importance of redox potential for the most reducing member of the enzyme family, thioredoxin, we have employed a set of active site variants of thioredoxin with increased redox potentials (−270 to −195 mV) for functional studies in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. The variants proved to be efficient substrates of thioredoxin reductase, providing a basis for an in vivo characterization of NADPH-dependent reductive processes catalyzed by the thioredoxin variants. The reduction of sulfate and methionine sulfoxide, as well as the isomerization of periplasmic disulfide bonds by DsbC, which all depend on thioredoxin as catalyst in the E. coli cytoplasm, proved to correlate well with the intrinsic redox potentials of the variants in complementation assays. The same correlation could be established in vitro by using the thioredoxin-catalyzed reduction of lipoic acid by NADPH as a model reaction. We propose that the rate of direct reduction of substrates by thioredoxin, which largely depends on the redox potential of thioredoxin, is the most important parameter for the in vivo function of thioredoxin, as recycling of reduced thioredoxin through NADPH and thioredoxin reductase is not rate-limiting for its catalytic cycle.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), or oxidizing properties, like DsbA with a redox potential of −122 mV (3Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In general, the bacterial cytosolic members of the family such as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin are efficient reductants of disulfide bonds and are believed to be important for the maintenance of the reducing redox status of the cytosol (5Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In addition, thioredoxin catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a number of important metabolic enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase, and methionine-sulfoxide reductase, whose active sites become oxidized as part of their catalytic cycle (see Holmgren and Björnstedt (6Holmgren A. Björnstedt B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar)). In contrast, members with oxidizing redox properties like DsbA and DsbC are found in the bacterial periplasm. These enzymes catalyze the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds during folding of newly translocated proteins (7Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 8Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An exception to this correlation between cellular localization and the redox potential appears to be the periplasmically oriented thioredoxin-like proteins that are anchored to the inner bacterial membrane. An example is TlpA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which has a low redox potential (−259 mV) despite its periplasmic orientation and is required for cytochrome aa3 maturation (9Loferer H. Wunderlich M. Hennecke H. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26178-26183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Rossman R. Stern D. Loferer H. Jacobi A. Glockshuber R. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases with thioredoxin fold share a catalytic disulfide bond with the sequence Cys-Xaa1-Xaa2-Cys. An influence of the active site dipeptide Xaa1-Xaa2 on the redox properties of these enzymes has been demonstrated, which results from a modulation of the p Ka value of the more N-terminal, nucleophilic active site cysteine (11Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T.P. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 12Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C.A. Raines R.T.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In DsbA, the extremely low p Ka value (∼3.5) of the nucleophilic cysteine stabilizes the reduced state of the active site making the protein an excellent disulfide bond donor (15Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Replacement of the Xaa1-Xaa2 sequence of DsbA by that of thioredoxin decreased the redox potential by 90 mV making DsbA a 1000-fold better reductant in terms of equilibrium constants with substrate compounds (13Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Conversely, a DsbA-like Xaa1-Xaa2 variant of thioredoxin became a 200-fold better oxidant (14Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Despite these dramatic changes in redox potentials, the corresponding mutant disulfide oxidoreductases did not show phenotypic effects in bacteria under physiological conditions (10Rossman R. Stern D. Loferer H. Jacobi A. Glockshuber R. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,11Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T.P. Dallinger P.

Biol. 1999; 268: 1197-1215Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the most reducing member of the thioredoxin superfamily, thioredoxin, and variants thereof can, at least partially, substitute for the most oxidizing member DsbA when exported to the periplasm (18Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10751-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Jonda S. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Mössner E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3277-3287Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether redox potential is at all an important property of these proteins under physiological growth conditions. A certain correlation between the redox potentials of DsbA variants and their ability to complement a DsbA null phenotype could only be demonstrated for the recovery of resistance toward the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT)1in the growth medium (11Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T.P. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin-1 from E. coli serve as cytoplasmic reductants of 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase, an enzyme in the pathway of sulfate reduction. Absence of both trxA and grxA is accompanied by the inability to grow on sulfate minimal medium unless a source of reduced sulfur such as cysteine is provided (20Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is also the preferred reductant of methionine-sulfoxide reductase as shown by the inability of trxA mutants to use methionine sulfoxide as the sole source of methionine (21Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a pathway for periplasmic disulfide bond isomerization has recently been described (22Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) that funnels reducing equivalents from thioredoxin in the cytosol to the periplasmic disulfide isomerase DsbC via the membrane protein DsbD (23Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To address the question whether the intrinsic redox potential of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases is of any major importance in vivo, we have used these in vivo functions of thioredoxin to test a set of thioredoxin variants with increased redox potentials (ranging from −270 to −195 mV, cf. Table I) for complementing activity in E. coli thioredoxin null mutants. The selected mutant proteins are the three most oxidizing thioredoxin variants that have been reported so far and bear the Xaa1-Xaa2 dipeptide sequences of the following members of the thioredoxin family: glutaredoxin (active site: Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys), DsbA (active site: Cys-Pro-His-Cys), and eukaryotic protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI; active site: Cys-Gly-His-Cys). The basis for the in vivo studies presented in this paper is the finding that these thioredoxin variants are all substrates of thioredoxin reductase (TR) and show a clear in vitro correlation between their redox potentials and efficiency of catalyzing the reduction of lipoic acid by NADPH as a model reaction.Table IProperties of the active site variants of thioredoxin as substrates of TR at pH 8.0 and 25 °CThioredoxin variant (Xaa-Xaa dipeptide)E′01-aFrom Ref. 13 and 14.KM1-bThe thioredoxin reductase assay was performed as described (31) using fixed concentrations of TR (33 nM), NADPH (200 μm), and dithionitrobenzoic acid (500 μM) and varying concentrations of thioredoxin or DsbA (0.04–40 μm).

Thioredoxin wild type and the thioredoxin variants were purified from overproducing E. coli strains as described previously (14Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

The genes encoding the thioredoxin variants in the corresponding T7 expression plasmids (14Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with Sac I and Hin dIII and cloned into the vector pBAD33 (25Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J.

The sequence of all thioredoxin genes was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the resulting plasmids. The gene coding for TR, trxB (26Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the resulting expression plasmid pTR, the trxB gene is under control of the T7 promoter/lac operator (28Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol.

For overproduction of TR, E. coli BL21(DE3) (28Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) harboring pTR was grown at 25 °C in 10 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). With an optical density at 550 nm of 1.0, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown further for 18 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and disrupted twice in a French Pressure cell (18.000 p.s.i.). TR was enriched by anion exchange chromatography on DE52-cellulose, fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-agarose essentially as described (29Prongay A.J. Engelke D.R. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2656-2664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and cation exchange chromatography on CM52-cellulose (pH 4.0, NaCl gradient), TR was more than 99% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 60 mg of purified TR were obtained from this procedure. A specific absorbance of A280 nm, 1 mg/ml, 1 cm = 1.39 was used for determination of the TR concentration (30Pigiet V.P. Conley R.R. J. Biol.

All reactants (without TR) were mixed and equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C before the reactions were started by the addition of TR. The reactions were followed by the formation of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (ε412 nm = 13600m−1 cm−1) (31Luthman M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The test was performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA (purged with nitrogen) containing insulin, DTT, and thioredoxin (wild type or variant) at concentrations of 130 μm, 1.0 mm, and 1.0 μm, respectively. After incubation of thioredoxin with DTT for 10 min at 25 °C, the reaction was started by the addition of insulin. Precipitation of reduced insulin was monitored by the increase in optical density at 650 nm. The reaction was performed at 25 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA containing 500 μm NADPH, 80 μm insulin, 33 nmTR, and 20 μm thioredoxin wild type (or the corresponding thioredoxin variants). The reaction was started by the addition of TR and followed by the increase in optical density at 650 nm. The same assay was also performed at pH 8.0 in 100 mm Tris/HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA using the same initial concentrations of reactants. In addition to the increase in optical density at 650 nm, the reaction at pH 8.0 was also followed by the consumption of NADPH (ε340 nm = 6200 m−1cm−1, 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes) and by HPLC analysis of the insulin reduction. For the latter analysis aliquots were removed from the reaction at different time points, the reactions were quenched with formic acid (20% (w/v) final concentration), and the insulin reaction products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC at 55 °C on a Vydac 218TP54 column using a linear gradient from 30 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The decrease in the peak area of native insulin served to quantify the initial velocity of the reactions. Identical reactivities of the three disulfide bonds in insulin were assumed for evaluating the initial decrease in native insulin. Reduced thioredoxin was prepared by incubation of the oxidized protein with a 1000-fold molar excess of DTT (50 mm) at pH 7.0 for 1 h and subsequent removal of DTT on a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Assays with thioredoxin as stoichiometric reductant were carried out at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA. The concentration of reduced thioredoxin was 1.0 μm in all assays. Lipoic acid and oxidized DTT were used at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mm guaranteeing pseudo first-order conditions. The stoichiometric reduction of insulin was performed in the same buffer as described above but at 15 °C with identical initial concentrations (1.0 μm) of reduced thioredoxin and insulin. All reactions were followed by the decrease in the specific tryptophan fluorescence of thioredoxin at 345 nm (excitation at 295 nm) on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. The fluorescence data were evaluated according to pseudo first-order kinetics (or quasi second-order kinetics in the case of insulin reduction). Thioredoxin (6.0 μm) was reduced at 25 °C by equimolar amounts of DTT in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmEDTA. The reaction was monitored by tryptophan fluorescence as described above and evaluated according to second-order kinetics. The assay was performed at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA containing 500 μm NADPH, 33 nm TR, 20 μm thioredoxin, and 1 mm lipoic acid. The reaction was started by the addition of thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH consumption was detected by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Quartz cuvettes with a 0.1-cm path length were used. The corresponding trxA null strains were transformed with the pBAD33 derivatives containing the genes of thioredoxin wild type and the variants. All growth assays were performed at 37 °C in the absence and in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose. Growth on minimal medium was assayed using E. coli FÅ47 (ΔtrxA, grxA::kan, ara714, leu::tn10) (32Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) on M63-plates (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 0.2% (w/v) glucose and supplemented with leucine and isoleucine (50 μg/ml each). Methionine sulfoxide reduction assays were performed with the strain A313 (trxA::kan, metE::tn10) (21Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on M63-glucose plates supplemented with methionine sulfoxide (100 μg/ml). After 72 h of growth, the sizes of at least 5 well separated colonies were measured and averaged. Assays were performed with a wild-type (RI281) and trxA (RI363) strain (23Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) harboring pRDB8-A, a plasmid for constitutive periplasmic expression of mouse uPA (34Duvoisin R.M. Belin D. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pBAD33 expression plasmids for the thioredoxin variants were introduced into RI363. As a control, both RI363 and RI281 were cotransformed with the pBAD33 vector lacking the trxA gene. Bacteria were grown with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) on NZ-rich medium (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 0.2% glucose and 0.2% arabinose and harvested at mid-logarithmic phase. Whole cell lysates were prepared by five cycles of freezing/thawing in sample buffer followed by separation on a nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. uPA activity was demonstrated at 37 °C by assaying plasminogen activation using plasminogen/casein agar as described (35Belin D. Vassalli J.D. Combepine C. Godeau F. Nagamine Y. Reich E. Kocher H.P. Duvoisin R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the same cell extracts that were used for the plasminogen activation assay were separated by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed for thioredoxin by immunostaining with polyclonal rabbit antithioredoxin antibodies (gift from C. C. Richardson, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). NADPH constitutes the common donor of reducing equivalents for all thioredoxin-dependent reduction processes in E. coli. Thus, as a prerequisite for an in vivo characterization of the active site variants of E. coli thioredoxin listed in TableI, it had to be proven that the variants are still efficient substrates of TR. For this purpose, recombinant TR from E. coli was overexpressed and purified. The substrate properties of the variants toward E. coli TR were then tested using the TR- and thioredoxin-catalyzed reduction of Ellman's reagent (dithionitrobenzoic acid) by NADPH (31Luthman M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, all thioredoxin variants showed, within a factor of two, the same substrate properties (kcat/Km values) as wild-type thioredoxin (Table I). Consequently, all variants principally have the potential of complementing thioredoxin deficiency in vivo. In contrast, DsbA wild type is not a substrate of TR (Table I). To establish an in vitro model reaction that can probe the importance of thioredoxin redox potential in thioredoxin-catalyzed processes, we compared the different thioredoxin variants with respect to their ability to catalyze the reduction of insulin by DTT at pH 7.0. This reaction is a widely used standard assay for detecting thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity (36Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, this assay gave an inverse correlation between redox potential of the thioredoxin variants and the rate of insulin reduction, with the PDI-like, the glutaredoxin-like, and the DsbA-like variant being more efficient catalysts than wild-type thioredoxin (Fig.1 A). This result can however be rationalized by considering the fact that the rate-limiting step in the thioredoxin-catalyzed reduction of insulin by DTT is the re-reduction of thioredoxin by DTT (36Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the more oxidizing variants, in accordance with their increased redox potentials, are indeed reduced 20–40 times faster by DTT than the wild type (TableII, values of k2(DTTred)). A decreased rate of insulin reduction by the variants, which one might expect from their increased redox potentials, is obviously not a rate-limiting factor for this model reaction.Table IIModel reactions with thioredoxin wild type and the thioredoxin variants as stoichiometric oxidants and reductants and as catalysts of NADPH-dependent reduction processesThioredoxin variant (Xaa-Xaa dipeptide)E′oThioredoxin as stoichiometric oxidant or reductantThioredoxin as catalystk2(DTTred)2-aApparent second-order rate constant of the reduction of thioredoxin by DTT at pH 7.0 and 25 °C measured by the increase in thioredoxin fluorescence.k2(DTTox)2-bApparent second-order rate constant of the oxidation of thioredoxin by oxidized DTT at pH 8.0 and 25 °C measured by the decrease in thioredoxin fluorescence.k2(insulin)2-cApparent second-order rate constant of the reduction of insulin by thioredoxin at pH 8.0 and 15 °C measured by the decrease in thioredoxin fluorescence.k2 (lipoic acid)2-dApparent second-order rate constant of the reduction of lipoic acid by thioredoxin at pH 8.0 and 25 °C measured by the decrease in thioredoxin fluorescence.Insulin reductionLipoic acid reductionvi(NADPH)2-eInitial velocity of NADPH consumption during thioredoxin-catalyzed reduction of insulin by NADPH at pH 8.0 and 25 °C, using concentrations of 500 μm NADPH, 33 nm thioredoxin reductase, 80 μm bovine insulin, and 20 μm thioredoxin.

https://openalex.org/W2048208090,"We have recently isolated a novel actin filament-binding protein, named frabin. Frabin has one actin filament-binding domain (ABD), one Dbl homology domain (DHD), first pleckstrin homology domains (PHD) adjacent to DHD, one cysteine rich-domain (CRD), and second PHD from the N terminus to the C terminus in this order. Full-length frabin induces microspike formation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. We found here that the fragment of frabin containing DHD and first PHD stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange of Cdc42Hs small G protein, but not that of RhoA or Rac1 small G protein. However, this fragment of frabin did not induce microspike formation, and ABD was additionally necessary for microspike formation. Frabin having ABD was associated with the actin cytoskeleton, whereas frabin lacking ABD was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ABD was not necessary for JNK activation but CRD and second PHD were additionally necessary for this activation. These results indicate that the association of frabin with the actin cytoskeleton is essential for microspike formation but not for JNK activation and that different domains of frabin are involved in microspike formation and JNK activation through Cdc42 activation.

Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins)1 are important regulators of these actin-dependent cell functions (for reviews, see Refs. 4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 5Hall A.

The Rho family consists of three major subfamilies: the Cdc42, Rac, and Rho subfamilies (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, respectively). In fibroblasts, Cdc42 induces filopodium formation; Rac induces lamellipodium and membrane ruffle formation; and Rho regulates assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions. In addition to these functions, the Rho family members are involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell growth, cell-cell adhesion, and cell motility (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 5Hall A.

The Rho family members cycle between the GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The conversion from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form is stimulated by a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF). Many GEFs for the Rho family members have thus far been identified and shown to share two conserved domains: a Dbl homology domain (DHD) of about 250 amino acids (aa) and a pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of about 100 aa adjacent to DHD. We have recently isolated a novel actin filament (F-actin)-binding protein, named frabin (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Frabin has one F-actin-binding domain (ABD), one DHD, first PHD adjacent to DHD, one cysteine rich-domain (CRD), and second PHD from the N terminus to the C terminus in this order. This domain structure of frabin is similar to that of a GEF specific for Cdc42, FGD1, determined by positional cloning to be the genetic locus responsible for faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome (8Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 9Zheng Y.

Overexpression of frabin in Swiss 3T3 cells and COS7 cells induces microspike formation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, respectively, as described for Cdc42 and FGD1 (9Zheng Y.

However, we had not examined whether frabin shows GEF activity on Cdc42. In this study, we first examined this activity of frabin and then the role of each domain of frabin in microspike formation and JNK activation. Lipid-modified RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs were purified from the membrane fraction of Spodoptera frugiperda cells transfected with baculovirus carrying the respective cDNAs (10Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Dbl and GST-Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) were prepared as described (10Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The GST carrier of GST-Rho GDI was cleaved off from Rho GDI by digestion with thrombin. Primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as described previously (11Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum against frabin was raised against GST-frabin-h (aa 1–208) described below. This antiserum was affinity-purified with GST-frabin-h covalently coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ltd.) and used as an anti-frabin antibody. A monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). An anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was prepared as described previously (12Yamochi W. Tanaka K. Nonaka H. Maeda A. Musha T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1077-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). pSRα-HA-JNKα and GST-c-Jun (13Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) was purchased from Sigma. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors of frabin were constructed in pCMV-Myc (11Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Various pCMV-Myc constructs of frabin shown in Fig. 2 A contained the following aa residues: pCMV-Myc-frabin-a, aa 1–766 (full length); pCMV-Myc-frabin-b, aa 1–150; pCMV-Myc-frabin-c, aa 151–766; pCMV-Myc-frabin-d, aa 169–539; and pCMV-Myc-frabin-e, aa 1–539. GST fusion constructs of frabin contained the following aa residues: GST-frabin-h, aa 1–208; and GST-frabin DH/PH, aa 169–539. pCMV-GFP was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the GFP of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) into pCMV5. pCMV-GFP-Frabin contained full-length frabin to express the fusion protein with the C-terminal GFP. The pCMV-Myc and pCMV-GFP constructs were transfected into COS7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (17Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were purified by use of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd.). GEF activity of GST-frabin DH/PH and GST-Dbl was assayed by measuring the radioactivity of [3H]GDP bound to each lipid-modified small G protein (20 nm each) after incubation at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of an indicated amount of Rho GDI as described previously (10Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). JNK activity was assayed as described previously (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K.

Briefly, pSRα-HA-JNKα was transfected with various pCMV-Myc constructs of frabin or pEF-BOS-Myc-V12Cdc42Hs in COS7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (17Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After incubation for 16 h in serum-starved Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody. Each immunoprecipitate was then washed and used to assay the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun after incubation in the presence of [32P]ATP. The phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and quantified using an image analyzer (Fujix BAS-2000II). Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured COS7 cells and hippocampal neurons were done as described (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H.

Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done as described previously (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). FGD1 has been described to show GEF activity on Cdc42Hs, but not on Rac1 or RhoA (9Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The domains responsible for this activity of FGD1 are DHD and first PHD (9Zheng Y. Fischer D.J.

We first examined whether a GST fusion protein of frabin containing only these domains (GST-frabin DH/PH) shows GEF activity on Cdc42Hs. GST-frabin DH/PH showed GEF activity on Cdc42Hs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). GST-Dbl also showed this activity as described (10Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

GST-frabin DH/PH was inactive on RhoA and Rac1 under the conditions where GST-Dbl was active on all the three Rho family members (Fig.1 B). This result is consistent with the properties of FGD1 described previously (9Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PHD binds acidic phospholipids, such as PIP2 (20Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of PIP2 on GEF activity of frabin on Cdc42Hs. However, addition of various doses of PIP2 (0–20 μm) did not affect the activity of GST-frabin DH/PH (data not shown). It is not known at present why GEF activity of frabin is very low, but an unidentified factor(s) may enhance the activity. Rho GDI is a general regulator of all the Rho family members (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Rho GDI inhibits GEF activity of GST-Dbl on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs (10Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rho GDI inhibited GEF activity of GST-frabin DH/PH on Cdc42Hs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). We then determined the domains of frabin responsible for microspike formation in COS7 cells. We constructed the Myc-tagged, full-length and various fragments of frabin which contained various combinations of each domain (Fig.2 A). Each Myc-tagged protein was transiently expressed in COS7 cells and cell shape was analyzed by F-actin staining using fluorescent phalloidin. Consistent with our previous observation in Swiss 3T3 cells (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), full-length frabin (Myc-frabin-a) induced the formation of F-actin-containing microspikes at the periphery of cultured COS7 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The microspikes were apparently similar to those induced by a dominant active mutant of Cdc42Hs (V12Cdc42Hs). To determine whether the frabin-induced microspikes were filopodia or retraction fibers, GFP-tagged, full-length frabin was transiently expressed in COS7 cells. Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy of the expressing cells revealed that most microspikes were filopodia, but some of them were retraction fibers, consistent with an earlier observation with Cdc42Hs-induced microspikes (21Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The fragment lacking ABD (Myc-frabin-c) induced the accumulation of F-actin at the cell periphery, but it did not induce microspike formation. Neither the fragment containing ABD alone (Myc-frabin-b) nor the fragment containing DHD and first PHD (Myc-frabin-d) induced microspike formation. The fragment containing ABD, DHD, and first PHD (Myc-frabin-e) induced microspike formation. Consistent with our previous observation (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), full-length frabin (Myc-frabin-a) and the fragments having ABD (Myc-frabin-b and -e) were colocalized with F-actin whereas the fragments lacking ABD (Myc-frabin-c and -d) showed diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm. These results indicate that ABD in addition to DHD and first PHD is necessary for microspike formation. We have shown previously that full-length frabin induces JNK activation to an extent about 40% that induced by V12Cdc42Hs (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the domains responsible for this activity. We coexpressed a fragment of frabin containing various combinations of each domain with HA-tagged JNK in COS7 cells. The expressed JNK was immunoprecipitated and its kinase activity toward GST-c-Jun was assayed. The fragment of frabin lacking ABD (Myc-frabin-c) induced JNK activation to the extent similar to that induced by full-length frabin (Myc-frabin-a) (Fig.3, A and B). Neither the fragment containing ABD alone (Myc-frabin-b), the fragment containing DHD and first PHD (Myc-frabin-d), nor the fragment containing ABD, DHD, and first PHD (Myc-frabin-e) was active in this activity. These results indicate that DHD and first PHD are necessary not only for microspike formation but also for JNK activation, but that CRD and second PHD are additionally necessary for JNK activation. We analyzed the localization of frabin in growth cones of cultured rat hippocampal neurons in which filopodia are markedly formed. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that frabin was highly concentrated at filopodia and poorly detected at lamellipodia (Fig.4 A). We then examined tissue distribution of frabin in various rat adult tissues. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that frabin was expressed in all the tissues examined (Fig. 4, B and C). Lung and kidney showed strong signals on Northern blot analysis whereas brain and liver showed strong signals on Western blot analysis. The reason for this discrepancy is not known, but it may be due to the difference of the stability of frabin protein in various tissues. Two bands were detected on Western blot analysis. The exact relationship between these two bands remains to be clarified, but they may be splicing variants or posttranslationally modified forms, such as the phosphorylated form. We have shown here that frabin shows GEF activity specific for Cdc42 as described for FGD1 (9Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Like other GEFs for the Rho family members, frabin as well as FGD1 has both DHD and its adjacent PHD. The aa sequences of these domains of many GEFs for the Rho family members thus far identified are highly homologous. The aa sequences of DHD and its adjacent PHD of frabin show 26% and 23% identity to those of Dbl, respectively. However, those between frabin and FGD1 are more highly homologous than those among other GEFs: the aa sequences of DHD and its adjacent PHD of frabin show 71% and 57% identity to those of FGD1, respectively. Of the many GEFs for the Rho family members, only frabin and FGD1 are specific for Cdc42. It is likely that some specific region in these domains of frabin and FGD1 determines the specificity for Cdc42, but it remains unknown how each GEF determines their substrate specificity. We have then analyzed here the role of ABD of frabin in microspike formation and JNK activation and shown that ABD is additionally necessary for microspike formation but not for JNK activation. In our previous (7Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and present report, we have furthermore shown that full-length frabin (Myc-frabin-a) is associated with the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells and that the fragment of frabin lacking ABD (Myc-frabin-c) is diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Myc-frabin-c contains DHD and first PHD which are capable of activating Cdc42 in a cell-free system. This fragment of frabin is indeed active in intact cells, because it induces JNK activation. However, Myc-frabin-c is unable to induce microspike formation. It is likely that Cdc42 activation in the vicinity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton followed by microspike formation. It has been shown that a fragment of FGD1 containing only DHD and first PHD induces microspike formation through Cdc42 activation when microinjected into Swiss 3T3 cells (9Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Nagata K. Driessens M. Lamarche N. Gorski J.L. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15453-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is not known why there is the difference in the ability of microspike formation between the similar fragments of FGD1 and frabin, but this difference may be due to experimental conditions: In the FGD1 experiments, Swiss 3T3 cells were used and the protein or cDNA samples were microinjected, whereas in our experiments, COS7 cells were used and the cDNA samples were transfected. However, it could be concluded, at least from these two experiments, that ABD is necessary for more efficient microspike formation. In contrast, the association of frabin with the actin cytoskeleton is not essential for JNK activation. Of course, in intact cells, full-length frabin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and activates Cdc42 around there, which then induces both microspike formation and JNK activation. It may be noted that the fragment of frabin lacking ABD (Myc-frabin-c) is active but the fragment of frabin containing only DHD and first PHD (Myc-frabin-d) is inactive for JNK activation. It is not known whether this fragment is capable of activating Cdc42 in intact cells, but these results suggest that ABD, CRD, and second PHD intramolecularly or intermolecularly affect the conformation of DHD and first PHD of frabin which determines GEF activity. We have shown here that frabin is expressed in all the tissues thus far examined, but the protein is most abundant in brain and liver. The tissue distribution of frabin on Northern blot analysis is different from that of FGD1 which is expressed in heart, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle (8Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have moreover shown that frabin is localized at filopodia at least in growth cones of cultured neurons. It is not known how frabin is highly concentrated at filopodia, but this localization is consistent with its ability to induce microspike formation through Cdc42 activation. Frabin which is associated with the cortical actin cytoskeleton activates Cdc42, which then reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton to induce filopodium formation. Repetition of this process may lengthen the microspike. In other words, the frabin-Cdc42 system reorganizes the pre-existing actin cytoskeleton to a new structure. Further study is necessary to clarify how frabin is localized at filopodia and how it is activated there for our understanding of the mechanisms of microspike formation. We thank Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) for providing us with the GST-c-Jun and pSRα-HA-JNKα."
https://openalex.org/W2132796090,"BIP1is a murine IgG antibody capable of enhancing the IgE binding to Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen. We have previously generated a mimotope of BIP1, designated Bet mim 1, from a constrained phage display peptide library. We demonstrated that oral immunization of BALB/c mice with the Bet mim 1 mimotope resulted in the induction of Bet v 1-specific IgG. The aim of this study was to test the influence of such an oral immunization with Bet mim 1 on a subsequent type I allergic response to Bet v 1. Phages displaying Bet mim 1 or control mimotopes, or PBS alone, were delivered to BALB/c mice by intragastric gavages prior to systemic sensitization with recombinant Bet v 1 and Al(OH)(3), an adjuvant inducing preferentially IgE antibody responses. Only mice fed with Bet mim 1-phages displayed substantially enhanced type I allergic skin reactivity to Bet v 1, as compared to mice pretreated with control mimotopes or PBS. A gastric digestion assay indicated that Bet v 1 and its homologue from apple, Mal d 1, were degraded within seconds under physiological conditions. In contrast, phage-displayed mimotopes were resistant to digestion. Our data indicate that allergen mimics in the diet that resist digestion, can induce allergen specific IgG able to enhance an allergic response. We therefore conclude that sensitization via the oral route may represent a mechanism for aggravating type I allergic reactions, probably leading to an earlier onset of symptoms even at lower allergen dosage."
https://openalex.org/W1538838653,"We showed previously that the induction of neural crest (NC) and neural tube (NT) defects is a general property of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Since homocysteine induces NC and NT defects and can also act as an NMDAR antagonist, we hypothesized that the mechanism of homocysteine-induced developmental defects is mediated by competitive inhibition of the NMDAR by homocysteine. If this hypothesis is correct, homocysteine-induced defects will be reduced by NMDAR agonists. To test the hypothesis, we treated chicken embryos during the process of neural tube closure with sufficient homocysteine thiolactone to induce NC and NT defects in approximately 40% of survivors or with homocysteine thiolactone in combination with each of a selected set of NMDAR agonists in 0. 05-5000 nmol doses. Glutamate site agonists selected were L-glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate. Glycine site agonists were glycine, D-cycloserine, and aminocyclopropane-carboxylic acid. Glycine was the most effective overall, reducing defects significantly at two different doses (each P>0.001). These results support the hypothesis that homocysteine may affect NC and NT development by its ability to inhibit the NMDAR. One potentially important consequence of this putative mechanism is that homocysteine may interact synergistically with other NMDAR antagonists to enhance its effect on development."
https://openalex.org/W2069947158,"ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) appears to play an essential role in the endocytic/recycling pathway in several cell types. To determine whether ARF6 is involved in insulin-regulated exocytosis, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type ARF6 or an ARF6 dominant negative mutant (D125N) that encodes a protein with nucleotide specificity modified from guanine to xanthine. Overexpression of these ARF6 proteins affected neither basal nor insulin-regulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, nor did it affect the subcellular distribution of Glut1 or Glut4. In contrast, the secretion of adipsin, a serine protease specifically expressed in adipocytes, was increased by the expression of wild-type ARF6 and was inhibited by the expression of D125N. These results indicate a requirement for ARF6 in basal and insulin-regulated adipsin secretion but not in glucose transport. Our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct pathways that undergo insulin-stimulated exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, one for adipsin release and one for glucose transporter translocation."

Transferring the pore from Kv1.3 to Kv3.2 produces a chimera that binds peptidyl inhibitors of Kv1.3 with high affinity, but not diTC. Transfer of the S5 region of Kv1.3 to Kv3.2 reconstitutes diTC binding at 4-fold lower affinity as compared with Kv1.3, whereas transfer of the entire S5-S6 domain results in a normal Kv1.3 phenotype. Substitutions in S5-S6 of Kv1.3 with nonconserved residues from Kv3.2 has identified two positions in S5 and one in S6 that cause significant alterations in diTC binding. High affinity diTC binding can be conferred to Kv3.2 after substitution of these three residues with the corresponding amino acids found in Kv1.3. These results suggest that lack of sensitivity of Kv3.2 to diTC is a consequence of the presence of Phe382 and Ile387 in S5, and Met458 in S6. Inspection of Kv1.1–1.6 channels indicates that they all possess identical S5 and S6domains. As expected, diTC binds with high affinity (Kd values 7–21 nm) to each of these homotetrameric channels. However, the kinetics of binding are fastest with Kv1.3 and Kv1.4, suggesting that conformations associated with C-type inactivation will facilitate entry and exit of diTC at its binding site.

Open table in a new tab In this study, we investigate the molecular basis for interaction of diTC with Kv1.3 and design a high affinity receptor in the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2. Our results indicate that residues located in the S5 and S6 region are responsible for the high affinity interaction of diTC with Kv1.3 and that the lack of sensitivity of Kv3.2 to diTC is due to the presence of Phe382 and Ile387 in S5, and Met458 in S6. Although all Kv1 channels display conserved residues in the S5 and S6 domains and diTC binds with high affinity to all of these channels, the kinetics of ligand association and dissociation are much faster with Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 than with other Kv1 channels. The energy barrier for diTC to enter or leave its binding site may be less for Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 as a consequence of a change in channel conformation induced by C-type inactivation, which is a common feature of these two channels. A preliminary report of these findings has been made in abstract form (12Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Green B. Liu J. Sanchez M. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): 77Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONCorreolide is the first potent, small molecule, natural product inhibitor of a voltage-gated potassium channel to be described. It displays remarkable specificity among ion channels in that it only interacts with Kv1 family channels. The results presented in this manuscript address two important aspects concerning the interaction of diTC with potassium channels. The first deals with the molecular basis for high affinity interaction of diTC with Kv1 channels, and in this context it has been possible to confer high affinity diTC binding to the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2. Second, with respect to Kv1 channels, which possess a conserved diTC binding domain and to which diTC binding is of equivalent high affinity, the kinetics of ligand binding track with the ease by which these channels enter the C-type inactivated state.Studies with chimeric channels constructed from domains of Kv1.3 and the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2, indicate that it is possible to confer correolide sensitivity to Kv3.2 by transferring only the S5 region of Kv1.3. These data suggest that differences between Kv1.3 and Kv3.2 in S5 are a major determinant in the lack of sensitivity of the latter channel to this inhibitor. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three nonconserved residues that may account for the lack of sensitivity of Kv3.2 to diTC. High affinity interaction of diTC with Kv3.2 has been achieved by mutating these residues to the corresponding amino acids found in Kv1.3. Two of these residues are located in S5, whereas the third is in S6. Interestingly, differences in the S6regions of these two channels appear to play a minor role in diTC binding, despite the fact that residues of S6 have been shown to contribute to formation of the pore (28Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Two important questions arise from these studies. Is the binding domain for diTC restricted primarily to the S5 region? Alternatively, are residues of S5 critical for conferring a special conformation to a binding domain that is located in another region of the channel? Comparison of the S5 and S6regions of all Kv1 channels indicates that there are no differences among any of these proteins. However, ligand binding kinetics are markedly different between channels possessing C-type inactivation and those channels that do not display this property. It appears that conformational changes induced by C-type inactivation make drug access to the diTC binding domain easier. Thus, it is possible that the specific residues that contribute to the binding site for diTC are common to many channels, but that the three-dimensional structure of the receptor differs between these channels. On the other hand, the pathway for drug entering its receptor site could be the rate-determining step for binding. For some Kv1 channels, this energy barrier represents an additional 2 kcal/mol, but for other channels, such as Kv3.2, it could be much larger so as to prevent drug binding at all. Site-directed mutagenesis studies along S5 and S6 in Kv1.3 would be required to identify those specific residues that contribute to the diTC binding pocket.

The mechanism by which correolide and its analogs suppress T cell activation is directly related to blockade of Kv1.3. Like peptide inhibitors, correolide partially depolarizes T cells (8Felix J.P.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4922-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This depolarization leads to diminution of the Ca2+ signaling that occurs upon activation of the T cell receptor complex. As expected, the properties of correolide and its analogs resemble those of peptidyl inhibitors of Kv1.3, such as MgTX, in immunological assays (4Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P.

Given these observations, correolide-derived agents might be candidates for development as novel immunosuppressant drugs for treatment of graft rejection and autoimmune diseases.The development of a safe immunosuppressant requires a minimum side effect profile. For agents targeting voltage-gated potassium channels, this is a monumental task given the large diversity of these proteins and their wide distribution throughout the body. Peptidyl inhibitors of Kv1 channels are not state-dependent channel blockers and are generally neurotoxic. Although the safety profile of correolide and its analogs requires further investigation, preliminary results from evaluation of two correolide analogs that, after acute administration, block a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in mini-pigs, do not reveal a significant toxic side effect profile.2 Perhaps correolide achieves functional selectivity in vivo as a blocker of T cell Kv1.3 channels. Such functional selectivity may be related to the mechanism by which correolide blocks Kv1.3. Preliminary studies indicate that this agent interacts with high affinity with either open or C-type inactivated, but not with the closed state of the channel (8Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Schmalhofer W.A. Borris R. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D. Bao J.-M. Kayser F. Parsons W.H. Rupprecht K. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S.

Kv1.3 exists primarily in the inactivated state in T cells with a resting potential of approximately −50 mV (4Leonard R.J. Garcia M.L. Slaughter R.S. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). If correolide would preferentially associate with the inactivated form of the channel, it may be possible to shift the channel equilibrium to the drug-bound form that is nonconductive. In firing neurons, however, the drug-sensitive inactivated form of the channel may be present for only a very brief period of time; drug binding might be negligible under these conditions, given the slow onset of correolide action observed with brain native channels (8Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Schmalhofer W.A. Borris R. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D. Bao J.-M. Kayser F. Parsons W.H. Rupprecht K. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4922-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although more detailed studies are necessary to discern the mechanism by which correolide interacts with potassium channels, it is tempting to speculate that the state-dependent interaction of this agent, together with its kinetics of binding, may be important for limiting toxicity in vivo. Voltage-gated potassium channels participate in a number of important cellular functions (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Therefore, specific modulation of the activity of these proteins may lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents. Peptidyl blockers of potassium channels purified from venom of different organisms have been useful in defining various structural and functional properties of potassium channels (2Garcia M.L.

Two of these peptides, margatoxin (MgTX)1 and charybdotoxin (ChTX), have been critical in identifying Kv1.3 as a target for development of novel immunosuppressants (3Lin C.S. Boltz R.C. Blake J.T.

In the course of screening for small molecule Kv1.3 inhibitors to support these efforts, a novel nortriterpene, correolide, was isolated from the plant Spachea correa (7Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 2895-2898Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and shown to be a potent Kv1.3 blocker (8Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Schmalhofer W.A. Borris R. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D.

Correolide is a selective inhibitor of the Kv1 family of potassium channels, displaying very low affinity for other ion channels and membrane proteins. However, its selectivity for Kv1.3 appears to be limited and in functional assays it blocks other Kv1 channels with 4–20-fold lower potency. A tritium-labeled derivative of correolide, [3H]dihydrocorreolide (diTC; Table I), binds reversibly and saturably to Kv1.3; the stoichiometry of the binding reaction suggests that one molecule of correolide binds per channel tetramer; the binding sites for correolide and peptidyl blockers are distinct (8Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Schmalhofer W.A. Borris R. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D. Bao J.-M. Kayser F. Parsons W.H. Rupprecht K. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4922-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of the large structural diversity of voltage-gated potassium channels (9Salinas M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C.

Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), knowledge of specific molecular determinants that determine high affinity binding of modulators among different channel proteins is crucial for development of potent and selective therapeutic agents. Values of k1 or k−1 for diTC binding to homotetrameric Kv1 channels were calculated as described in the text. Kd values for diTC were also determined under equilibrium binding conditions as described. These values are the average of 2–4 determinations carried out with different membrane preparations. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis for interaction of diTC with Kv1.3 and design a high affinity receptor in the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2. Our results indicate that residues located in the S5 and S6 region are responsible for the high affinity interaction of diTC with Kv1.3 and that the lack of sensitivity of Kv3.2 to diTC is due to the presence of Phe382 and Ile387 in S5, and Met458 in S6. Although all Kv1 channels display conserved residues in the S5 and S6 domains and diTC binds with high affinity to all of these channels, the kinetics of ligand association and dissociation are much faster with Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 than with other Kv1 channels. The energy barrier for diTC to enter or leave its binding site may be less for Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 as a consequence of a change in channel conformation induced by C-type inactivation, which is a common feature of these two channels. A preliminary report of these findings has been made in abstract form (12Hanner M. Schmalhofer W.A. Green B. Liu J. Sanchez M. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): 77Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONCorreolide is the first potent, small molecule, natural product inhibitor of a voltage-gated potassium channel to be described. It displays remarkable specificity among ion channels in that it only interacts with Kv1 family channels. The results presented in this manuscript address two important aspects concerning the interaction of diTC with potassium channels. The first deals with the molecular basis for high affinity interaction of diTC with Kv1 channels, and in this context it has been possible to confer high affinity diTC binding to the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2. Second, with respect to Kv1 channels, which possess a conserved diTC binding domain and to which diTC binding is of equivalent high affinity, the kinetics of ligand binding track with the ease by which these channels enter the C-type inactivated state.Studies with chimeric channels constructed from domains of Kv1.3 and the diTC-insensitive channel, Kv3.2, indicate that it is possible to confer correolide sensitivity to Kv3.2 by transferring only the S5 region of Kv1.3. These data suggest that differences between Kv1.3 and Kv3.2 in S5 are a major determinant in the lack of sensitivity of the latter channel to this inhibitor. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three nonconserved residues that may account for the lack of sensitivity of Kv3.2 to diTC. High affinity interaction of diTC with Kv3.2 has been achieved by mutating these residues to the corresponding amino acids found in Kv1.3. Two of these residues are located in S5, whereas the third is in S6. Interestingly, differences in the S6regions of these two channels appear to play a minor role in diTC binding, despite the fact that residues of S6 have been shown to contribute to formation of the pore (28Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Two important questions arise from these studies. Is the binding domain for diTC restricted primarily to the S5 region? Alternatively, are residues of S5 critical for conferring a special conformation to a binding domain that is located in another region of the channel? Comparison of the S5 and S6regions of all Kv1 channels indicates that there are no differences among any of these proteins. However, ligand binding kinetics are markedly different between channels possessing C-type inactivation and those channels that do not display this property. It appears that conformational changes induced by C-type inactivation make drug access to the diTC binding domain easier. Thus, it is possible that the specific residues that contribute to the binding site for diTC are common to many channels, but that the three-dimensional structure of the receptor differs between these channels. On the other hand, the pathway for drug entering its receptor site could be the rate-determining step for binding. For some Kv1 channels, this energy barrier represents an additional 2 kcal/mol, but for other channels, such as Kv3.2, it could be much larger so as to prevent drug binding at all. Site-directed mutagenesis studies along S5 and S6 in Kv1.3 would be required to identify those specific residues that contribute to the diTC binding pocket.

In firing neurons, however, the drug-sensitive inactivated form of the channel may be present for only a very brief period of time; drug binding might be negligible under these conditions, given the slow onset of correolide action observed with brain native channels (8Felix J.P. Bugianesi R.M. Schmalhofer W.A. Borris R. Goetz M.A. Hensens O.D. Bao J.-M. Kayser F. Parsons W.H. Rupprecht K. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S.

Although more detailed studies are necessary to discern the mechanism by which correolide interacts with potassium channels, it is tempting to speculate that the state-dependent interaction of this agent, together with its kinetics of binding, may be important for limiting toxicity in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1546890081,"S100betabeta is a calcium binding, neurotrophic protein produced by nonneuronal cells in the nervous system. The pathway by which it enhances neuronal survival is unknown. Here we show that S100betabeta enhances survival of embryonic chick forebrain neurons in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of suboptimal amounts of S100betabeta, neuronal survival is enhanced by the immunosuppressants FK506 and cyclosporin A at concentrations that inhibit calcineurin, which is present in these cells. Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that does not inhibit calcineurin, did not enhance cell survival. Cypermethrin, a direct and highly specific calcineurin inhibitor, mimicked the immunophilin ligands in its neurotrophic effect. None of the drugs stimulated neuronal survival in the absence of S100betabeta. In the presence of suboptimal amounts of S100betabeta, FK506, cyclosporin A, and cypermethrin (but not rapamycin) also increased NF-kappaB activity, as measured by immunofluorescence of cells stained with antibody to the active subunit (p65) and by immunoblotting of nuclear extracts. Antioxidant and glucocorticoid inhibitors of NF-kappaB decreased both the amount of active NF-kappaB and the survival of neurons caused by S100betabeta alone or in the presence of augmenting drugs. We conclude that S100betabeta enhances the survival of chick embryo forebrain neurons through the activation of NF-kappaB."

Because overproduction of nitric oxide causes tissue damage in neurological, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders, design of NOS inhibitors has received much attention. Most inhibitors described to date include a guanidine-like structural motif and interact with the guanidinium region of thel-arginine-binding site. We report here studies withl-arginine analogs having one or both terminal guanidinium nitrogens replaced by functionalities that preserve some, but not all, of the molecular interactions possible for the –NH2, =NH, or =NH2+ groups of l-arginine. Replacement groups include –NH-alkyl, –alkyl, =O, and =S. Binding ofl-canavanine, an analog unable to form hydrogen bonds involving a N 5-proton, was also examined. From our results and previous work, we infer the orientation of these compounds in the l-arginine-binding site and use IC50 or Ki values and optical difference spectra to quantitate their affinity relative tol-arginine. We find that the non-reactive guanidinium nitrogen of l-arginine binds in a pocket that is relatively intolerant of changes in the size or hydrogen bonding properties of the group bound. The individual H-bonds involved are, however, weaker than expected (<2 versus 3–6 kcal). These findings elucidate substrate binding forces in the NOS active site and identify an important constraint on NOS inhibitor design.

Oxygen and NADPH are co-substrates, and N ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOH-Arg) is a tightly bound intermediate (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The enzyme is active as a homodimer, and each monomer is comprised of a heme- and tetrahydrobiopterin-containing oxygenase domain that binds and oxidizesl-arginine and a FAD- and FMN-containing reductase domain that delivers electrons from NADPH to heme. Once reduced, the heme cofactor binds and activates O2, which in turn reacts with a terminal guanidinium nitrogen of the substrate l-arginine that is bound ∼4 Å from the heme iron (3Tierney D.L. Martasek P. Doan P.E. Masters B.S.S. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2983-2984Crossref Google Scholar). That reactive, “proximal” nitrogen is first hydroxylated, forming NOH-Arg, and then oxidized further to NO. The other, previously equivalent guanidinium nitrogen is bound farther away from the heme cofactor and does not react; that “distal” nitrogen becomes the terminal –NH2 group of the product l-citrulline.There are three major isoforms of NOS in mammals (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 4Sessa W.C.

Two constitutive, Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated isoforms were initially identified in neurons (nNOS) and vascular endothelial cells (eNOS). An inducible, transcriptionally regulated isoform (iNOS) was initially identified in macrophages but can be expressed in response to inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin in many cell types. Neuronal NOS has a role in neurotransmission and/or neuromodulation (5Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 6Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Phamacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 213-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), whereas eNOS produces NO that has an important role in controlling vasorelaxation and blood pressure (7Aisaka K. Gross S.S.

In addition to these physiological roles, NOS is known to contribute to several pathological processes, typically when nNOS is overstimulated or iNOS is induced inappropriately or in excess. For example, nNOS is implicated in stroke (11Huang Z. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Dalkara T. Fishman M.C.

The possibility of treating these and other conditions by inhibiting NOS has elicited intense efforts to identify or design NOS inhibitors, preferably isoform-selective NOS inhibitors. To date well over 100 inhibitors have been reported (19Griffith O.W. Gross S.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research.

Almost all of these compounds contain a guanidine-like structural motif, and their initial binding is competitive with l-arginine, observations that suggest they are interacting with the guanidinium region of thel-arginine-binding site.In the present studies we have designed and synthesized several novell-arginine analogs (Fig. 1) in order to “map” the guanidinium region of the substrate-binding site. We have confirmed and extended previous work showing that the binding site for the reactive (i.e. oxidizable) guanidinium nitrogen can accommodate a variety of alternative groups including those much larger than –NH2 and =NOH. In contrast, the binding site for the non-reactive, distal guanidinium nitrogen does not accommodate larger groups (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hibbs Jr., J.B. Vavrin Z. Taintor R.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 550-565PubMed Google Scholar, 24Griffith O.W. Kilbourn R.G. Adv. Enzymol. Regul. 1997; 37: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have exploited this difference in size specificity to predictably direct the binding orientation of novell-arginine analogs. We find that analogs bind poorly if the binding site for the non-reactive guanidinium nitrogen ofl-arginine must be occupied by =O, =S, –CH3 or larger groups. These results extend insights gained from recently reported mutagenesis and x-ray crystallographic studies of NOS and have implications for the design of NOS inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsReagents for organic synthesis were obtained from Aldrich and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma, respectively.

Thus, N α-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-l-ornithine tert-butyl ester (2.9 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of chloroform and added to a solution of 2.5 g of CaCO3and 1.20 ml of ethyl dithioacetate dissolved in 50 ml of water. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 h and filtered. The chloroform layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (2 × 50 ml). The combined chloroform extracts were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of ethyl acetate (5 ml) and chromatographed over a silica gel column (3 × 50 cm) eluted with ethyl acetate and petroleum ether (1:4). Fractions (5 ml) were collected and the product was identified by TLC on silica plates developed in the same solvent (RF = 0.8). Product-containing fractions were pooled and solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give N α-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-N 5-(thioacetyl)-l-ornithine tert-butyl ester as an oily liquid in 25% yield. That intermediate was dissolved in ∼10 ml of dioxane and added to ∼20 ml of ice-cold dioxane containing 6 n HCl. After stirring on ice for 4 h and at room temperature overnight, evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure yielded 0.4 g of TAO (m.p. 75–78 °C): 1H NMR (D2O): δ 1.75–2.1 (m, 4H), 2.5 (s, 3H), 3.67 (t, 2H) and 4.09 (t, 1H); 13C NMR (D2O): δ 25.36, 29.89, 35.01, 47.88, 55.51, 174.98 and 203.75; MS (70 eV, EI): m/e 190 (M+); high resolution MS, m/e, C7H14N2O2S, Calculated: 190.0776, Found: 190.0763.N 5-Thiobutyryl-l-ornithine (TBO) was synthesized by reaction of Lawesson's reagent with N 5-butyryl-l-ornithine, which was obtained by reacting butyryl chloride with protectedl-ornithine.

That product (8.0 mmol) was dissolved in benzene (50 ml), Lawesson's reagent (1.82 g, 4.5 mmol) was added, and the mixture was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling, the mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was washed with water (3 × 50 ml). The benzene layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated to give an oily liquid that was chromatographed over silica gel as described previously. Product-containing fractions were determined by TLC (RF = 0.8) and evaporated to give N α-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-N 5-(thiobutyryl)-l-ornithine tert-butyl ester (2.5 g, 85%) as an oily liquid.

Reaction was initiated by the addition of NOS, and mixtures were maintained at 25 °C for 4 min. Reaction mixtures were then quenched by addition of 200 μl of stop buffer (100 mmNa+ Hepes buffer, pH 5.5, and 5 mm EGTA). After heating in a boiling water bath for 1 min, the samples were chilled and centrifuged. A portion (225 μl) of the supernatant was applied to small Dowex 50 columns (Na+ form, 1 ml of resin), and the product l-[14C]citrulline was eluted with 2 ml of water and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Where inhibition was determined to be competitive withl-arginine, Ki values were estimated from measured IC50 values using Ki = IC50(KmArg/(KmArg+ [Arg])). For purpose of calculation, KmArg values for nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS were estimated as 1.8, 3.6, and 12.5 μm, respectively, based on the present and earlier (32Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. J. Biol.

The product formed, NOH-Arg, has a much lower p Ka(∼7) and is presumed to remain unprotonated, thus facilitating reaction of the second heme-bound O2 as a peroxo rather than as an oxo species (Fig. 6). Because the double bond in NOH-Arg is directed toward the hydroxylated nitrogen (39Boyar A. Marsh R.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 1995-1998Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Crane B.R.

The presence or absence of charge is apparently of little consequence since both the cationic amidines (i.e. l-NIO and its derivatives) and neutrall-thiocitrulline bind tightly. Similarly, cationicl-arginine and neutral NOH-Arg have similar Km values with iNOS and, more importantly, kcat/Km is only ∼50% higher for l-arginine than for NOH-Arg (55Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the typical assay pH of 7.4, l-canavanine possesses a mostly uncharged side chain (p Ka ∼ 7.0) and binds somewhat less tightly than l-arginine despite being isosteric and able to form all of the H-bonds characteristic of the distal guanidinium pocket (Fig. 6). However, presence of oxygen adjacent to N 5 is known to orient the guanidinium double bond into the side chain (39Boyar A. Marsh R.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 1995-1998Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and consequent loss of the N 5 proton abolishes the H-bond between N 5 and the enzymatic glutamate residue. 4Absence of the N 5 proton and H-bond has been independently described based on an x-ray crystallographic structure of l-canavanine bound to the eNOS oxygenase domain (C. S. Raman, H. Li, P. Martásek, V. Král, B. S. S. Masters, and T. L. Poulos, submitted for publication). The modestly decreased binding affinity of nNOS for l-canavanine is attributed to loss of this H-bond. Comparison of the Ki value of l-canavanine with KmArg (viewed as a “kinetic” binding constant) suggests that the difference in free energy of binding between these species is ∼1.1 kcal/mol. 5Free energy changes were estimated from the van't Hoff equation, ΔG = -2.3 RT log(KEq1/ KEq2). In most cases 1/Ki were used as surrogate KEq values, but comparable results were obtained using 1/Ks or, for l-arginine, 1/Km. It has earlier been shown the KsArg is similar to KmArg (0.7 versus 1.8 μm, respectively) (J. C. Salerno, personal communication). We also limit our analysis to comparison of reasonably isosteric amino acids where differences in binding energy can be confidently attributed to the presence or absence of specific H-bonds. Other classes of inhibitors (e.g. the non-amino acid isothioureas) include compounds that bind with high affinity and yet form few H-bonds (50Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S.

Biotinylated and nonbiotinylated populations of the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor, the transferrin receptor, and insulin-responsive aminopeptidase were separated by adsorption to streptavidin-agarose to determine the percentage of the biotinylated protein molecules versus their total amount in different subcellular compartments. Results indicate that adipose cells possess at least two distinct cell surface recycling pathways for insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and transferrin receptor (TfR): one which is mediated by glucose transporter isoform 4(Glut4)-vesicles and another that bypasses this compartment. Under basal conditions, the first pathway is not active, and cell surface recycling of TfR and, to a lesser extent, MPR proceeds via the second pathway. Insulin dramatically stimulates recycling through the first pathway and has little effect on the second.Within the Glut4-containing compartment, insulin has profoundly different effects on intracellular trafficking of insulin-responsive aminopeptidase on one hand and MPR and TfR on the other. After insulin administration, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase is redistributed from Glut4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane and stays there for at least 30 min with minimal detectable internalization and recycling, whereas MPR and TfR rapidly shuttle between Glut4 vesicles and the plasma membrane in such a way that after 30 min of insulin treatment, virtually every receptor molecule in this compartment completes at least one trafficking cycle to the cell surface.

Several lines of evidence, including the results of sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoadsorption, demonstrate that in adipocytes, IRAP and partially MPR and TfR are co-localized in the same compartment with Glut4 (“Glut4-containing vesicles”) (4Kandror K.V.

Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), whereas the major pool of Glut4 and IRAP may be sorted out into a specialized “insulin-sensitive compartment” that does not contain recycling receptors (15Livingstone C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been based mainly on the “ablation experiments,” which demonstrate that only 60% of Glut4 can be ablated with transferrin-HRP conjugate and diaminobenzidine (15Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,20Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, given that in the adipocyte the number of Glut4 molecules may exceed the number of TfRs by 1,000-fold (2Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Davis R.G. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8708-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may not be possible to quantitatively ablate Glut4 with the TfR ligand even if Glut4 and TfR are present in the same vesicular compartment, because not every Glut4-containing vesicle may also possess a TfR molecule (21Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a previously done studies, I and others (22Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hare J.F. Taylor K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 24Ross S.A. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have applied cell surface biotinylation of fat cells to study insulin-regulated plasma membrane recycling of various intracellular proteins. Neither of these studies, however, addressed the question of what part of the total population of the individual proteins is biotinylated at the cell surface, or in other words, what is the efficiency of such recycling. Here, I describe an experimental approach by which biotinylated and nonbiotinylated individual proteins are separated by adsorption to streptavidin-agarose, and the percentage of the biotinylated protein molecules versus their total amount may readily be determined. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that the fraction of MPR and TfR that is associated with Glut4, traffics quite differently from these same receptors that reside outside of the Glut4 compartment. In the absence of insulin, there is virtually no significant plasma membrane recycling of the Glut4-associated receptors, whereas MPR and TfR not present in Glut4 vesicles do recycle to the cell surface. Insulin dramatically stimulates plasma membrane recycling of MPR and TfR, which are co-localized with Glut4, and only minimally affects receptor trafficking outside of the Glut4 compartment. These results suggest that a part of the population of MPR and TfR in adipocytes is incorporated, along with Glut4 and IRAP, in the “insulin-responsive compartment.” Interestingly, within the Glut4-containing compartment(s), insulin has profoundly different effects on intracellular trafficking of IRAP on one hand and MPR and TfR on the other. After insulin administration, IRAP is redistributed from Glut4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane and stays there for at least 30 min with minimal detectable internalization and recycling, whereas MPR and TfR rapidly shuttle between Glut4 vesicles and the plasma membrane in such a way that after 30 min of insulin treatment virtually every receptor molecule in this compartment completes at least one trafficking cycle to the cell surface. These differences in intracellular trafficking of receptor proteins and IRAP may reflect their distinct and specific biological functions in the cell and may unmask previously unknown aspects of insulin action. In this study, we used the monoclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody 1F8 (25James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F.

In biotinylation experiments, before use with cells, the buffer was pre-incubated with 0.4–0.5 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-acetate (Pierce) for 3–4 h at 37 °C and overnight at 4 °C to block free amino groups of the bovine serum albumin present in the buffer. In some experiments, cells were washed with KRP buffer without bovine serum albumin immediately before biotinylation. Insulin was administered to cells (where indicated) to a final concentration of 20 nm. Sulfo-NHS-biotin or sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (both from Pierce) was added to cells 2 min after insulin to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Biotinylation was usually performed at 37 °C, then 1 mTris, pH 7.4, and 0.2 m KCN were added to final concentrations 50 mm and 2 mm, respectively, for 2 min. For “0” time point, insulin, sulfo-NHS-biotin, KCN, and Tris were added immediately one after another. After that, cells were washed 3 times with HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4) cooled to 14–16 °C, homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (27Simpson I.A.

Isolated fractions were resuspended in PBS, which contained all of the protease inhibitors listed above. Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody, as well as nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma), were each coupled to acrylic beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000, Pierce) at a concentration of 0.8 mg of antibody/ml of resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before usage, the beads were saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for at least 1 h and washed with PBS. The light microsomes (LM) from rat adipocytes were incubated separately with each of the specific and nonspecific antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with PBS, and the adsorbed material was eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then with Laemmli sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) without reducing agents. This procedure results in immunoadsorption of 90–95% of Glut4-containing membranes (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

For binding to streptavidin-agarose (Pierce), Triton eluate (usually 150 μl) was passed over 20 μl of settled beads washed with 1% Triton in PBS for at least 5 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was taken for further analysis. In case cleavable sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin was used for biotinylation, proteins were eluted from streptavidin-agarose with Laemmli sample buffer containing freshly added 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 1.5 h at 90 °C. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (NEN Life Science Products). In some experiments, secondary antibodies were substituted with 125I-protein A. Autoradiograms were quantitated in a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Protein content was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated with sulfo-NHS-biotin in the absence and presence of insulin for 0, 5, 15, and 30 min and fractionated into subcellular fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Glut4-containing vesicles were isolated from LM by immunoadsorption on 1F8 beads, and their component proteins were eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. As we have previously reported (11Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation with insulin rapidly increases biotinylation of the major component proteins of Glut4-containing vesicles, such as MPR and IRAP as determined by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase staining (compare lanes 1–4 and 5–8). These data are also consistent with the results of Ross et al. (31Ross S.A. Herbst J.J. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) who have recently determined by streptavidin-HRP staining that the amount of biotinylated IRAP is rapidly increased inside the cell after insulin stimulation. TfR in Glut4 vesicles is also detectable by these experiments, although its total biotinylation is much less than that of the first two proteins, probably because of the small amount of TfR present in adipocytes (11Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The problem with these earlier experiments including the one shown in Fig. 1, however, is that they provide only a very general illustration of the insulin-dependent recycling of Glut4 vesicles. For example, it is not clear from Fig. 1what fraction of the individual proteins in Glut4-containing vesicles is biotinylated at the cell surface. One can imagine, for example, that 100% of MPR and only 1% of IRAP in Glut4 vesicles is biotinylated after a 30-min exposure of cells to insulin and sulfo-NHS-biotin, whereas the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase-generated signal from these two proteins may still be the same because of their different content in the vesicles, number of the biotinylation sites they have, etc. This possibility seems real, because the amount of IRAP in Glut4 vesicles was estimated to exceed the amount of MPR in this compartment at least 8-fold (22Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to monitor protein trafficking through Glut4-containing vesicles more closely, I used the following approach. Material eluted from 1F8 beads was divided into two and the first half was electrophoresed with no further treatment, whereas the second half was passed over streptavidin-agarose beads for 5 h. Material not bound to streptavidin-agarose (lanes 9–12) was electrophoresed together with the first half (lanes 5–8), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and stained with alkaline phosphatase conjugated with streptavidin to visualize biotinylated proteins (Fig. 1). Lanes 9–12 of Fig. 1 show that incubation with streptavidin-agarose completely removes biotinylated proteins from the preparation thus allowing one to determine by regular Western blot what fraction of the total pool of the individual protein does not contain biotin. Unfortunately, in these experiments, it is not possible to elute biotinylated proteins from streptavidin-agarose for quantitative analysis because of the SDS-stable nature of biotin-streptavidin binding. When this approach was applied to basal cells, it was shown that incubation of adipocytes without insulin for up to 30 min does not lead to biotinylation of any significant fraction of MPR, TfR, or IRAP in Glut4-containing vesicles (Fig.2 A, top panel), which is also consistent with Fig. 1, lanes 1–4. Thus, MPR, TfR, and IRAP practically do not cycle between the cell surface and intracellular Glut4 vesicles in the absence of insulin. Stimulation of adipocytes with insulin drastically changes the pattern of trafficking of these component proteins of Glut4-containing vesicles (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B). With time, increasing amounts of MPR and TfR molecules in Glut4-containing vesicles pick up biotin tags at the cell surface and are removed from the preparation by streptavidin-agarose binding. According to these data, in 5 min 50% of the receptor molecules have already gone through at least one round of turnover to the cell surface, and in 30 min practically every receptor molecule in intracellular Glut4 vesicles becomes biotinylated and, thus, completes one or more cycles to and from the cell surface. Insulin-induced acceleration of the receptor recycling does not lead to any significant decrease in the total amount of these proteins in intracellular Glut4 vesicles (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel, lanes 1–4), nor does it substantially increase the concentration of these proteins at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 1–4), which suggest that MPR and TfR indeed rapidly recycle between these two compartments without any substantial retention in either of them.Figure 3Plasma membrane content of the translocatable proteins. Rat adipocytes were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin in the absence and presence of insulin for 0 min (lanes 1 and 5), 5 min (lanes 2 and 6), 15 min (lanes 3 and 7), and 30 min (lanes 4 and 8). Plasma membrane fractions were isolated and analyzed by Western blotting (40 μg/lane) using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescent kit. An aliquot of each plasma membrane preparation (40 μg) was solubilized in 100 μl of PBS with 1% Triton (final volume), passed over 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose for 5 h at 4 °C to remove biotinylated proteins, and electrophoresed simultaneously with the total fractions. All proteins were visualized by consecutive staining of the same membrane.Panel B shows the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IRAP demonstrates quite a different response to insulin. Unlike the case for MPR and TfR, the amount of this protein in intracellular Glut4-containing vesicles is decreased 3-fold after incubation with insulin for 30 min. This decrease is accompanied by a corresponding augmentation in the plasma membrane IRAP content (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, in the time frame of the experiment (30 min) there is no significant recycling of IRAP between the plasma membrane and intracellular Glut4-containing vesicles, because the amount of nonbiotinylated IRAP in this compartment is equal to its total amount (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B). Thus, only a minimal fraction of the cell surface IRAP is internalized to the intracellular Glut4-containing vesicles which is, however, sufficient to generate a strong signal on streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase-stained Western blots (Fig. 1). To confirm this last result and to also check the possibility that IRAP may be internalized into another intracellular compartment different from Glut4-containing vesicles, I carried out experiments with the total fraction of intracellular LM using the cleavable reagent sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin. Cells were biotinylated for 30 min in the absence and presence of insulin and were separated into subcellular fractions by differential centrifugation. LM fraction (300 μg) in 1% Triton X-100 was incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads, which resulted in a complete binding of biotinylated proteins to the resin (not shown). Beads were washed 4 times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the bound material was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were electrophoresed in parallel with the total preparations of plasma membrane and LM (50 μg each) as well as the material not bound to streptavidin-agarose (40 μg) and blotted for IRAP (Fig. 4). The results were quantitated in a computing densitometer and normalized to the total amount of plasma membrane and LM recovered in the experiment. It turns out that the amount of biotinylated IRAP in LM of cells treated with insulin for 30 min represents only 1.4% of its total amount in this fraction and only 2.2% of the IRAP content in the plasma membrane. In basal cells, the amount of biotinylated IRAP in the LM fraction was below the detection limit. Unfortunately, heating of protein samples in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol completely destroys antigenicity of TfR and MPR, so I was unable to perform the same type of analysis on these two proteins. The amount of Glut4 in intracellular membrane fractions rapidly decreases after insulin administration (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B), and its concentration in the plasma membrane increases correspondingly (Fig. 3, A and B), which is consistent with numerous studies on Glut4 recycling. It is also seen in Fig. 3, A and B (lanes 5–8) that although MPR, TfR, and IRAP are very efficiently biotinylated at the plasma membrane, incorporation of biotin into Glut4 is low, which is consistent with our previous observations (22Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not possible to study recycling of Glut4 by cell surface biotinylation. It has been determined by independent approaches, however, that Glut4 recycles between its intracellular compartments and the cell surface both in the absence and presence of insulin (32Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vanucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jhun B.H.

Although t1/2values for Glut4 recycling vary in different studies (32Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vanucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all estimations indicate that Glut4 in insulin-treated cells may recycle faster than IRAP (summarized in Ref. 35Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This does not necessarily mean that Glut4 and IRAP do not co-localize in the cell, because these two proteins may, nevertheless, share the same intracellular compartments (see “Discussion”). To exclude the input of the Glut4 vesicle-mediated pathway in receptor recycling, I used material not bound to 1F8 beads and performed virtually the same experiments as those described above and shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the population of TfR excluded from Glut4 vesicles recycles to the cell surface both in the absence and presence of insulin, and insulin has little effect on TfR trafficking outside this compartment. Basal recycling of MPR is not as pronounced as that of TfR but is still statistically significant (Fig. 6). This may be explained by the fact that the majority of MPR molecules traffics between the Golgi apparatus and late endosomes (37Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) so that not more than 20–25% of the receptor population excluded from Glut4 vesicles is translocated to the cell surface in 30 min. Insulin administration markedly stimulates MPR cell surface recycling via alternative pathways (Fig. 6), but it still remains much slower (t1/2, 22 min) than recycling through Glut4 vesicles, which has t1/2 of 5 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Finally, there is no detectable IRAP in the material not bound to 1F8 beads, which is consistent with the idea that the vast majority of this protein is co-localized with Glut4 (4Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,16Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol.

The bottom panel shows the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results described in this paper indicate that adipose cells possess at least two distinct cell surface recycling pathways for MPR and TfR: one that is mediated by Glut4 vesicles, and another that bypasses this compartment. Under basal conditions, the first pathway is not active, and all cell surface recycling of both MPR and TfR proceeds via the second pathway. Insulin dramatically stimulates recycling through the first pathway and has only a small effect on the second. Thus, I suggest that the former pathway is specific for insulin-sensitive cells and may possess certain analogies with the regulated recycling of synaptic vesicles in neurons, whereas the latter represents a ubiquitous endosomal recycling pathway, which has been extensively characterized in fibroblasts (19Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). According to this model, Glut4 vesicles (i.e. the material that is obtained by immunoadsorption with anti-Glut4 antibody) represent, in fact, a mixture of two different compartments: sorting/recycling endosomes and insulin-responsive vesicles, IRV, that have been postulated in fat cells (1Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 239-297Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 269-278Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) but never obtained experimentally in a pure form. One reason for this is that the protein composition of IRV may be very close to that of sorting endosomes, because the major cargo proteins of the endosomal compartment, such as recycling receptors, are not sorted away from Glut4 and IRAP, which are considered protein markers of IRV. Under basal conditions, Glut4 vesicles include sorting endosomes and a large quantity of IRV whose exocytosis is arrested in the absence of insulin so that IRV are accumulated inside the cell in a “ready-to-go” position. After insulin administration, the recycling block is released, presumably by Akt-mediated phosphorylation (41Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the intracellular pool of IRV is rapidly depleted due to their fusion with the plasma membrane so that the major increase in the plasma membrane Glut4 and IRAP content takes place in the first 5 min of insulin treatment (Fig. 3). So, in Glut4-containing vesicles from insulin-treated cells, the ratio between endosomes (the amount of which should not change) and IRV is increased. This, however, does not lead to any significant changes in the total polypeptide composition of Glut4 vesicles (11Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because sorting endosomes and IRV consist of the same major proteins. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that insulin induces certain physico-chemical changes of Glut4 vesicles: it increases their sedimentation coefficient by about 20 S and decreases their buoyant density by 0.02–0.03 g/cm3 (30Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This suggests that sorting/recycling endosomes are larger and less dense than IRV, which may allow further separation and purification of each of these individual compartments. Thus, in basal adipocytes, several functionally different recycling proteins may be compartmentalized mainly in the form of IRV. Upon insulin stimulation, IRV rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane and deliver all their cargo proteins, such as MPR, TfR, IRAP, and Glut4 to their functional site, the cell surface. Here, however, these proteins have different fates. IRAP, being an aminopeptidase, stays at the plasma membrane with no or little recycling long enough to hydrolyze its extracellular substrates which, however, have not yet been identified. MPR and TfR, on the other hand, have different biological functions that are facilitated not by augmentation of the plasma membrane concentration of these proteins, as is the case with IRAP, but rather by intensification of their recycling, and this is exactly what has been determined in these experiments. This suggests that there must be a stringent sorting step at the level of the plasma membrane and that individual component proteins of Glut4 vesicles are internalized into this compartment at their own distinctive rates.

However, the long range intramolecular interaction between the Ca2+ sites and the nucleotide binding site that triggers formation of a transition state for phosphoryl transfer and the nature of this transition state are not well understood. Electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of the phosphoryl groups of ATP and Asp351 and other catalytic residues may be expected to dominate during ATP binding and in the transition state and possibly drive changes in the transport sites (6Pedersen P.A.

Acta. 1985; 815: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), E2H3 must be able to bind ATP without preventing the access of Pi to Asp351, suggesting that the γ-phosphoryl group of the bound ATP is at some distance from Asp351 in this conformation, in contrast to the E1Ca2 state. A change in the interaction of bound nucleotide with Asp351 related to enzyme activation by Ca2+ is clearly demonstrated with TNP-8N3-ATP1 that has been covalently attached to Lys492 by light activation (14McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol.

Tethering the nucleotide still permits Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis in the forward direction of catalysis, proving direct interaction with Asp351, and yet has little effect on Pi-dependent phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+, showing that the nucleotide, or at least a portion of it, shifts position with respect to the aspartyl residue upon Ca2+ binding. The phosphorylated aspartate and adjoining residues on the COOH-terminal side, segment 351DKTGTLT357, termed the phosphorylation loop in this study, are highly conserved in P-type ATPases (17Green N.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 970-972Google Scholar), and previous mutational analysis has documented their functional importance (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides Asp351, also Lys352, Thr355, Leu356, and Thr357 are critical to Ca2+ transport as well as phosphorylation (19Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and further clarification of the distinct roles of these residues in nucleotide binding, phosphoryl transfer, and long range interaction with the Ca2+ sites may aid understanding of energy transduction in the pump. In this study, we assess the effects on nucleotide binding of mutations to the phosphorylation loop residues that previously were shown to result in severely impaired or inactive pumps (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP binding is measured mainly through inhibition of TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling of Lys492, which has recently been successfully applied to Ca2+-ATPase mutated in segment487FSRDRK492 (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In selected cases where the affinity is extremely high, binding is also measured by a direct filtration assay. In addition, the effects of the mutations on Ca2+ occlusion induced with CrATP are determined. The results show that most of the mutations in the phosphorylation loop affect nucleotide binding and disrupt CrATP-induced Ca2+occlusion. Our analysis of mutations to Asp351 reveals high intrinsic nucleotide binding energies when the negative charge is removed, particularly in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, i.e. in the E1Ca2 state (KD = 0.001 μm for mutant D351A). These favorable interactions may be utilized to gain the transition state and to provoke conformational changes that communicate with the transport sites. The mutant Ca2+-ATPase cDNAs used in this study were the same as those described previously (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

COS-1 cell microsomes containing expressed wild-type or mutated Ca2+-ATPase were isolated by differential centrifugation 48–72 h after transfection (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The exogenous Ca2+-ATPase content of the microsomal fraction was assayed with a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (21Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP, photolabeling of COS-1 cell microsomes, the inhibition by ATP, quantification of labeled bands by electronic autoradiography (“imaging”) following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, curve fitting equations and calculations of the “true”KD(ATP) have been described previously (16McIntosh D.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For fitting of the TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data, the Hill equation with or without a linear component was used, and the Hill coefficient was set to 1. The concentration of free Ca2+was set with 5 mm EGTA and variable amounts of total CaCl2 as calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (23Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) taking the Mg2+ concentration and pH into consideration. CrATP-dependent Ca2+ occlusion was measured as before (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium ATP binding to mutants D351N and D351A was also measured by filtration. COS-1 cell microsomes (1 μl of stock microsomes in 1 ml; approximately 0.5 pmol of Ca2+-ATPase protein/ml) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm[3H]sucrose, and other components as indicated in the Fig. 7 legend for 1 min at 25 °C, and the sample was filtered on Millipore GS 0.22-μm filters under mild vacuum. The radioactivity of the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The wet volume of the filter was determined from the tritium radioactivity (range: 28–42 μl), allowing determination of the radioactivity of unbound nucleotide, which was subtracted from the total 32P cpm to obtain the amount of ATP bound to the microsomes. The formation of a slowly dissociating CrATP complex with the Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+ was followed through the inhibition of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling. Microsomes containing expressed wild-type or mutated Ca2+-ATPase were incubated at 37 °C with CrATP for up to 1 h. Aliquots were taken at timed intervals and diluted 50-fold into irradiation medium with 0.5 μm[γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP. The samples were irradiated for 1 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity was quantified by electronic autoradiography as described previously (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Twenty-four mutations have previously been introduced into the conserved phosphorylation loop of the Ca2+-ATPase between Ile348 and Thr357 (18Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the mutants with alteration to the aspartic acid residue Asp351receiving the phosphoryl group during catalysis are inactive, and so are the mutants with alterations to Lys352, even in the case of the most conservative replacement of Lys352 with arginine. Activity is not affected by conservative replacements of Thr355 or Thr357 with serine, but replacement with alanine reduces the Ca2+ transport activity as well as the level of phosphoenzyme. Replacement of Leu356 with isoleucine is without effect on activity, but mutation to threonine inactivates the pump. Hence, these residues (nine mutants in all; see Table I) were selected for the present study of nucleotide binding properties.Table INucleotide binding parameters and CrATP-dependent Ca2+ occlusion of wild-type Ca2+-ATPase and mutantsK0.5(TNP-8N3-ATP)KD(ATP)1-aThe “true” KD calculated under the assumption of competitive inhibition as described in Ref. 16; the concentration of TNP-8N3-ATP was 3 ×K0.5 except for mutants K352Q and T357A where it was equal to the K0.5.Ca2+occlusion1-b−, no occlusion; +, partial occlusion; ++, full occlusion; ND, not determined.

The assay for nucleotide binding, which is based on specific [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling of Lys492 and nucleotide competition, has been validated previously (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Results obtained under optimum labeling conditions at pH 8.5 demonstrated that this assay is able to produce highly accurate values for TNP-8N3-ATP and ATP binding affinities of Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cell microsomes (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In assessing the results to be described below, it is furthermore useful to know that TNP-8N3-ATP is a substrate of the Ca2+-ATPase, albeit a slow one, whether untethered or tethered to Lys492 by photolabeling (15McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21587-21595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This means that the position of the γ-phosphoryl group of the bound nucleotide must be similar, although probably not identical, to that of bound ATP. The concentration dependence of TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling of wild-type and mutant Ca2+-ATPases at pH 8.5 in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ (presence of EGTA) is shown in Fig. 1 A. The data could be fitted satisfactorily to the sum of a simple hyperbolic binding function and a linear component, the latter representing nonspecific labeling as previously explained (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For most of the mutants, the linear component was small and insignificant, but as seen in Fig. 1 the linear component was rather prominent for mutant K352Q, for unknown reasons. The derived K0.5 values corresponding to the hyperbolic component are listed in Table I. It can been seen that removal of the negative charge on Asp351, as shown by mutants D351N, D351A, and D351T, led to a pronounced increase in TNP-8N3-ATP affinity, with D351N exhibiting the largest increase of 156-fold. By contrast, mutation D351E, which conserves the negative charge, did not significantly affect the TNP-8N3-ATP binding affinity. The concentration of Ca2+-ATPase in the irradiation assay was approximately 0.4 nm for the tightly binding mutants and approximately 2 nm for the rest to ensure a reasonably high ratio of free to bound nucleotide, thereby allowing the total concentration to be equated with the free concentration. Mutation K352Q, which removes the positive charge of Lys352, lowered the affinity for TNP-8N3-ATP at least 5-fold, whereas the more conservative replacement with arginine, K352R, was without significant effect. Mutation T355A was likewise silent, but T357A lowered the affinity for the TNP nucleotide about 6-fold. Mutant L356T exhibited a low level of labeling that was linear with increasing concentrations of TNP-8N3-ATP up to 30 μm. This indicates that either Lys492 was not being labeled or the affinity was extremely poor (K0.5 estimated to be >50 μm). The inhibition of photolabeling by ATP under the same buffer conditions is shown in Fig. 1 B, and the derived true KD values assuming competitive inhibition are listed in Table I. Usually, the concentration of TNP-8N3-ATP was fixed at 3 × K0.5 to ensure that the binding site is close to saturation; however, in the case of mutants K352Q and T357A, inhibition was so poor at these concentrations that the TNP-8N3-ATP concentrations were lowered to the K0.5 in each case. It is apparent that removal of the negative charge on Asp351 caused a large increase in affinity for ATP (83-fold, 45-fold, and 22-fold for D351N, D351T, and D351A, respectively) similar to that seen for TNP-8N3-ATP. Mutations D351E and T355A appeared to slightly decrease the affinity for ATP (1.5–2-fold compared with wild type). While mutation K352R resulted in a 13-fold reduction of ATP affinity, K352Q led to a spectacular effect, reducing the ATP affinity close to 1000-fold. Mutation T357A decreased the affinity for ATP at least 40-fold. Because the affinity of the latter two mutants was too low for complete inhibition to be reached, the choice of the offset of the binding curve was somewhat uncertain in these cases, resulting in corresponding uncertainties with respect to the exact KD(ATP) values. Hence, the results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the most disruptive mutation in terms of nucleotide binding is L356T, followed by K352Q, T357A, and K352R. The latter three mutations affected ATP binding much more than the binding of TNP-nucleotide, similar to the situation with mutations close to Lys492 (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All of the mutants in which the negative charge on Asp351 was removed exhibited a large increase in affinity for both nucleotides, with D351N being the most dramatic. On the other hand, mutation D351E had little effect on the binding of either nucleotide. Nucleotide binding and the coupling between the catalytic and transport sites can be assessed by measuring CrATP-induced Ca2+occlusion. CrATP slowly forms a complex with the Ca2+-ATPase at the catalytic site without phosphorylating Asp351 and causes simultaneous occlusion of Ca2+ at the transport sites (24Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Serpersu E.H. Kirch U. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Bochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 855: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3539-3550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this complex is very stable, requiring hours to dissociate,45Ca2+ occlusion with CrATP can be measured in Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cell microsomes by size exclusion HPLC following detergent solubilization of the microsomes (24Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of such measurements on the wild type and selected mutants are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I. The microsomes were incubated 1 h at 37 °C with 1 mm CrATP and 40 μm45Ca2+, i.e. just about enough to ensure saturation of the occlusion reaction in the wild-type enzyme, before solubilization and chromatography. Equal amounts of expressed Ca2+-ATPase, according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements, were chromatographed, so the elution profiles are comparable. The control represents microsomes without expressed Ca2+-ATPase, i.e. harvested from COS-1 cells mock-transfected with the expression vector without insert. The amount of control microsomes in mg of total membrane protein corresponds to that chromatographed in the case of the wild type. The distinct peak of radioactivity eluting between 14 and 15 min in the experiment with the wild type and in some of the experiments with mutants represents Ca2+ occluded in the detergent-solubilized monomeric enzyme (24Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen, there was no such peak for mutants D351N and D351A, and hence these mutants did not occlude Ca2+. Mutants K352R and T355A showed partial occlusion, and mutants K352Q, L356T, and T357A also failed to occlude Ca2+. Thus, for some mutations, notably those that slightly or grossly lower the affinity for ATP, the effect on CrATP-induced Ca2+occlusion seems to be correlated with the change in ATP binding affinity. However, mutations to Asp351, which caused a huge increase in affinity for ATP, also appeared to prevent CrATP-induced Ca2+ occlusion. In order to elucidate whether this was due to defective CrATP complexation at the catalytic site or an uncoupling of CrATP complexation and Ca2+ occlusion, we devised an assay wherein the microsomes were incubated with CrATP for up to 1 h at 37 °C and then diluted substantially prior to photolabeling with TNP-8N3-ATP. The affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for CrATP is not high, and a concentration of CrATP in the millimolar range is required to obtain saturation so that occlusion occurs in a reasonable period of time. To minimize the competitive binding of contaminant ATP that might be present in the CrATP preparation, the samples were irradiated under conditions where the affinity for TNP-8N3-ATP is reasonably high and that for ATP is fairly low (pH 8.5 in the presence of EDTA). Also with this in mind, a concentration of TNP-8N3-ATP of approximately 10× K0.5 was chosen. As seen in Fig.3, photolabeling of the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase was inhibited by CrATP in a time-dependent manner, indicative of a gradual and effectively irreversible complexation of CrATP at the catalytic site. In mutants D351N and D351A, CrATP failed to inhibit photolabeling, showing that the irreversible binding of CrATP had not occurred. This explains the lack of CrATP-induced Ca2+ occlusion in these mutants. The buffer conditions in the above binding experiments with TNP-8N3-ATP and ATP (pH 8.5, in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+) largely favor accumulation of the E1 state of the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, whereas the E2H and E2H3 forms (cf. Scheme 1) would predominate at neutral and acid pH in the absence of Ca2+ (7Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the huge increase in nucleotide affinity induced by mutations D351N and D351A and the implications for the catalytic mechanism, we investigated the influence of pH, Mg2+, and Ca2+, as well as thapsigargin, a tightly binding inhibitor that appears to lock the enzyme into E2 or an “E2-like” state (28Sagara Y.

Our studies demonstrated that abnormal exposure of nonbilayer arrangements may induce autoimmune responses as found in the antiphospholipid syndrome. hexagonal II l-α-phosphatidylcholine l-α-phosphatidic acid antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies against nonbilayer phospholipid arrangements enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fluorescein isothiocyanate forward scatter light side scatter light relative fluorescence fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay 1-acyl-2-(12[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl) cardiolipin l-α-phosphatidylserine l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol cholesterol dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidate The lamellar or bilayer phase is the most common molecular association adopted by phospholipids and glycolipids in the matrix of cell membranes. However, membrane lipids are in dynamic transition, 30–40% can adopt nonbilayer arrangements (1Lafleur M. Bloom M. Cullis P.R. Biochem.

In isolated form, some phospholipids form hexagonally packed cylinders of the hexagonal II (HII)1 tubular phase. The HII-preferring lipids can also form intermediate structures of the HII phase, or nonbilayer arrangements, in lipid bilayers of experimental model systems, such as liposomes (2Cullis P.R.

In this study, antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies were developed against nonbilayer phospholipid arrangements produced on liposomes. These antibodies also identify nonbilayer structures in membranes of cultured cells. These results are the first evidence that nonbilayer lipid structures are present in cells and may be involved in the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies which can participate in the development of the human antiphospholipid syndrome (16Asherson R.A.

Liposomes prepared from specific lipids in TBS buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm NaCl, pH 7) (10Baeza I. Aguilar L. Alvarado F. Soto C. Escobar A. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Wong C. Biochem.

Polyclonal antibodies were obtained as described previously (10Baeza I. Aguilar L. Alvarado F. Soto C. Escobar A. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Wong C. Biochem.

Hybridomas were obtained by fusing myeloma P3X63Ag8U.1 with spleen cells isolated from mice immunized with PC/PA liposomes in 5 mmMn2+. Supernatants were screened for APmAb by a liposomal ELISA method and flow cytometry (10Baeza I. Aguilar L. Alvarado F. Soto C. Escobar A. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Wong C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 17Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12509) Google Scholar). Individual clones were obtained by limited dilution (17Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12509) Google Scholar). Clones producing APmAb were expanded by in vitro culture and by inoculation in BALB/C mice to obtain ascites fluid. APmAb was detected by a liposomal ELISA method and flow cytometry. ELISA wells were coated with liposomes (0.1 μmol/100 μl of TBS) alone or treated with 3 mmCa2+ or 5 mm Mn2+. Wells blocked with 0.4% gelatin in TBS alone or containing the appropriate cation were incubated with inactivated immune mice sera or APmAb diluted in the correspondent TBS buffer. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyvalent or anti-mouse IgM antibodies were used. Bound antibodies were detected by reaction with o-phenylenediamine solution. Liposomes (0.1 μmol/100 μl of TBS) alone or treated with 3 mmCa2+ or 5 mm Mn2+ were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark with FITC-H308-APmAb at 1:10 dilution in TBS alone or containing 3 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm Mn2+. Liposomes were washed by sedimentation at 200,000 × g for 50 min at 18 °C with the appropriate TBS buffer. Flow cytometry was accomplished using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. Ten-thousand liposomes were analyzed using CELLQuest software at FL1 compensation of 0.8% and a detector compensation threshold FSC-H of 52 V, with the detectors: FSC of E00, SSC of 401 V, and FL1 of 748 V. Results are reported as relative fluorescence (FL1) and relative forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) light histograms in logarithmic mode (18Darzynkiewicz Z. Kapuscinski J. Melamed M. Lindmo T. Mendelson M. Flow Cytometry and Shorting. J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 290-314Google Scholar). In a similar way as was described for cells (18Darzynkiewicz Z. Kapuscinski J. Melamed M. Lindmo T. Mendelson M. Flow Cytometry and Shorting. J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 290-314Google Scholar), the diffraction of the laser beam (FSC) is proportional to the liposome surface area and/or liposomal aggregation, while refraction plus reflection of the beam (SSC) are proportional to the complexity of liposomal bilayers (10Baeza I. Aguilar L. Alvarado F. Soto C. Escobar A. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Wong C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As a negative control an irrelevant monoclonal antibody of IgM isotype directed to a surface protein of Trichinella spiralis (Ts-mAb) was used (19Ortega-Pierres G. Chayen A. Clark N.W. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1984; 88: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PC/PA 2:1 liposomes in 5 mm Mn2+ were incubated with ascites fluid in presence of 5 mm Mn2+ for 30 min at 37 °C. Mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 ×g and the pellet washed with TBS plus 5 mmMn2+. APmAb was released from liposomes by addition of TBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Purity of APmAb was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis. Relative fluorescence of PC/1-acyl-2-(12[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl) (NBD)-PA 2:1 liposomes was measured by excitation at 465 nm and emission at 530 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorometer. Quenching percentage was calculated by the equation, (Fo −F)/Fo × 100 (20Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7961-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where Fo, is fluorescence intensity of liposomes in 3 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm Mn+2prior to addition of APmAb, and F is fluorescence following addition of APmAb. As a negative control Ts-mAb was used (19Ortega-Pierres G. Chayen A. Clark N.W. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1984; 88: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HeLa, C5337, C33, and MCF-7 cells were analyzed as described in Naciff et al. (21Naciff J.M. Behbehani M.M. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2004-C2015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes containing the HII-preferring lipid PA were unilamellar in TBS buffer, with “smooth” surfaces, and varied from 100 to 400 nm in size (Fig.1 A). Ca2+ ions (3 mm) induced nonbilayer structures (33 Å thick), which form a complex network of interconnected strings. These structures show fusogenic properties by forming considerably larger liposomes up to 1 μm of radius. A small portion of a fused liposome is shown in Fig.1 A. Mn2+ (5 mm) induce nonbilayer structures (37 Å thick) which are organized in quadrangular and pentagonal strings that did not modify the size of liposomes (Fig.1 A). Both cations also induced nonlamellar structures in liposomes containing the HII-preferring lipids bovine heart cardiolipin (CL) or bovine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS), which were similar to those described for PC/PA liposomes. In contrast, PC and egg yolkl-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (PG)/cholesterol (Chol) 1:1 liposomes, without HII-preferring lipids, displayed smooth surfaces either alone or when they were incubated with the cations (data not shown). Liposomes treated with Ca2+or Mn2+ remained nonaggregated, since it was not necessary to add EDTA to visualize them by freeze-fracture as individual entities (6Baeza I. Wong C. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Farfán N. Argüello C. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After the addition of Ca2+ (3 mm) to liposomes containing PA or CL, the 31P NMR spectrum became sharper than those without cations and had a slight shift to a lower field (Fig. 1 B), which indicate isotropic motion of PA or CL in the nonbilayer structures (2Cullis P.R. Tilcock C.P. Hope M.J. Wilschut J. Hoekstra D. Membrane Fusion. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 65-85Google Scholar, 3Verkleij A.J. Wilschut J. Hoekstra D. Membrane Fusion.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mn2+ (5 mm) peaks were not evident (Fig.1 B). Mn2+ induces the formation of nonbilayer structures. Mn2+ penetrates the vesicle exerting paramagnetic effects on phospholipids from both the outer and inner liposomal bilayers, which completely broadens the NMR spectra (6Baeza I. Wong C. Mondragón R. González S. Ibáñez M. Farfán N. Argüello C. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Fenske P.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 64: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar changes in NMR spectra of all liposomes were obtained with 0.5 mm Ca2+ or Mn2+. PC liposomes did not show spectral changes when they were incubated with Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B). However, in the presence of Mn2+ (3 mm) the spectrum signal intensity decreased. This change is due to the Mn2+ paramagnetic effect and was exerted only on lipids from outer liposomal bilayers (Fig. 1B); similar results were obtained with PG/Chol 1:1 liposomes. Freeze-fracture and NMR studies clearly showed the nonbilayer structures on liposomes. Both methods demonstrated that only liposomes containing HII-preferring lipids produce nonbilayer structures. Antibodies were evaluated by an ELISA method using PC/PA 2:1 liposomes as the antigen. Both polyclonal and hybridoma supernatant containing APmAb bind to nonbilayer structures. The highest binding was attained with APmAb clone H308 and Mn2+-induced nonbilayer structures (Fig.2 A). Polyclonal antibodies, but not H308-APmAb, also recognized the smooth liposomes incubated with TBS buffer. The irrelevant monoclonal antibody Ts-mAb did not show reaction with smooth liposomes or bearing nonbilayer structures (Fig.2 A). Using this method, 42 hybridomas producing APmAb were selected. The isotype of all APmAb obtained was IgM as determined by ELISA. Since the routine method to clinically measure antiphospholipid autoantibodies is an ELISA assay that uses a coated plate with lipids dissolved in ethanol (22Loizou S. McCrea J.D. Rudge A.C. Reynolds R. Boyle C.C. Harris E.N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1985; 62: 738-745PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of H308-APmAb to purified PC, PA, or CL was evaluated. Our data showed that H308-APmAb did not interact with the nonliposomal lipid-coated plates. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to these lipid-coated surfaces (Fig.2 B). These results strongly suggest that H308-APmAb interacts with nonplanar lipid surfaces. The fact that H308-APmAb specifically recognizes nonbilayer structures on liposomes, an antigen similar to biological membranes, and not lipid-coated surfaces suggests that antibodies similar to H308-APmAb could be produced in human autoimmune disorders such as the antiphospholipid syndrome. H308-APmAb was affinity-purified directly from ascites by taking advantage of the property of H308-APmAb to bind to liposomes bearing Mn2+-induced nonbilayer structures. All H308-APmAb bound to liposomes was specifically eluted by chelation of Mn2+(Fig. 3 C). A considerable portion of purified H308-APmAb was not glycosylated (Fig.3 C). H308-APmAb did not show any interaction with smooth PC/PA liposomes, since liposomal fluorescence (Fig. 3 A, panel a) was similar to that of liposomes alone or Ca2+-treated (Fig.3 A, panel m). In contrast, the 60-fold increase in fluorescence, compared with that of smooth liposomes (with a difference among populations in a logarithmic scale (D) = 0.9, at p < 0.001), clearly showed the interaction of H308-APmAb with Ca2+-induced nonbilayer structures (Fig.3 A, panel a). In addition, SSC values, which show the complexity of liposomal bilayers, i.e. the presence of nonbilayer arrangements, indicated that the pattern of Ca2+-induced structures was different after the immunoreaction, compared with the pattern of these structures on Ca2+-treated liposomes (Figs. 3 A, panels b and n). These profiles reflect the dynamic feature of nonbilayer arrangements. Liposomal aggregation (FSC), which can produce nonspecific increases in fluorescence, was not evident, since the FSC values, after the antibody binding, were similar to those of liposomes bearing nonbilayers structures without H308-APmAb (Figs. 3 A, panels c and o). Liposomal fluorescence, SSC, and FSC values in the presence of affinity-purified Ts-mAb were similar to that of Ca2+-treated liposomes, demonstrating that Ts-mAb does not bind vesicles. Analysis of liposomes containing PA incubated with Ca2+ and Ts-mAb is also shown in Fig. 3 A, panels m to o. H308-APmAb also binds to liposomes bearing Ca2+-induced nonlamellar structures formed by PS or CL. Analysis of liposomes containing CL is shown in Fig. 3 A, panels d to f. This reaction, although positive, was clearly distinct from the reaction with liposomes containing PA (Fig. 3 A, panels b and e). H308-APmAb did not show interaction with PC liposomes alone or incubated with Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A, panel g). Furthermore, values of FSC and SSC did not show liposomal aggregation or the presence of nonbilayer structures (Fig. 3 A, panels h and i). Similar results were obtained with PG/Chol 1:1 liposomes. In addition, similar binding of H308-APmAb was obtained when all liposomes were incubated with 0.5 mmCa2+. These results support the fact that only liposomes containing nonbilayer structures have an immunoreaction with H308-APmAb. An alternative conclusion is that the antibody recognizes the lipid-divalent cation complex and/or the resultant reduction in the liposomal charge in the presence of divalent cations. These possibilities were eliminated by the use of “rigid” liposomes. Liposomes made from dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC)/PC/dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidate (DPPA) 1.2:0.8:1 or DPPC/PC/E. coli CL 1.2:0.8:1 have a higher content of saturated fatty acids in their DPPC, DPPA, or E. coli CL (23Killian J.A. Koorengevel M.C. Bouwstra J.A. Gooris G. Dowhan W. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consequently the bilayers of these liposomes are more rigid than the bilayers of the liposomes containing similar lipids isolated from egg yolk or bovine heart such as those from Fig. 3 A (panels a–f and m–o). Divalent (Ba2+ or Ca2+) or trivalent (La3+) ions can interact with rigid liposomes and modify their surface charge, but these interactions are not associated with the formation of nonbilayer structures as is shown for DPPC/PC/DPPA liposomes (Fig.3 A, panels k and l). These results were corroborated by NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). H308-APmAb did not show interaction with rigid liposomes incubated with Ba2+ or La3+ (Fig. 3 A, panels j–l). These results confirm that the H308-APmAb recognition of the anionic lipid-metal ion complex is only associated with the transition of lipids to nonbilayer structures. The binding of H308-APmAb was also analyzed by the quenching of NBD-chromophore induced by clustering of fluorescent NBD phospholipids upon H308-APmAb-membrane binding. Affinity-purified H308-APmAb bound to liposomes containing NBD-PA or NBD-PS, while Ts-mAb did not present any binding (Fig. 3 B). These results corroborate that H308-APmAb specifically binds to Ca2+ or Mn2+-induced nonbilayer structures. Liposomal ELISA, flow cytometry, and FRET demonstrated that the specificity of H308-APmAb is against a nonbilayer structure formed by the HII-preferring anionic phospholipids PA, CL, or PS. These data suggest that the specificity of H308-APmAb is not against a chemical structure but against a specific lipid molecular arrangement. In mammalian cells, negatively charged surfaces are formed by the exposure of anionic phospholipids on the outer leaflet of plasma membranes. In the present study, it has been demonstrated that the anionic phospholipids PA, CL, and PS form antigenic nonbilayer structures recognized by our APmAb. Thus, we analyzed whether nonbilayer structures are formed on the membranes of mammalian cells. Cell lines HeLa, C5337, C33, and MCF-7 were directly immunostained with a Cy3-conjugated H308-APmAb. Immunostaining of cells showed that H308-APmAb recognizes cellular membranes possible in apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 4 A). This finding indicates that nonbilayer phospholipid arrangements occur in these biological membranes. These findings support the studies that demonstrate a strong correlation between nonbilayer arrangements and the viability of E. coli (14Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. De Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Morein S. Anderson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These results indicate that cells maintain a fragil balance between bilayer and nonbilayer lipid arrangements during the dynamic events of membrane function. The presence of these unique phospholipid arrangements suggests their involvement in membrane functions. Therefore, this monoclonal antibody can be used to evaluate the role of HII-preferring lipids in the modulation of physiological and pathological membrane activities. These unique antinonbilayer antibodies could be different antibodies to those currently detected in clinical assays using lipid-coated ELISA plates, including anti-cardiolipin and anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies. It has been reported that lupus anticoagulant antibodies specifically recognize the HII tubular phase of phosphatidylethanolamine but not the bilayer arrangements of this lipid (13Rausch J. Janoff A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4112-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Rauch J. Tannenbaurm M. Neville C. Fortin P.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to reconcile membrane features with extensive areas of the lipid HII phase. Instead, we propose that intermediate structures of the HII phase in lipid bilayers, such as those analyzed here, are more compatible with the structure and the modulation of physiological and pathological membrane activities. Since nonbilayer structures are immunogenic, their abnormal exposure may induce autoimmune responses as found in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, stroke, and cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2054873637,"Abstract Control of transcription frequently involves the direct interaction of activators with RNA polymerase. In bacteria, the formation of stable open promoter complexes by the ς54 RNA polymerase is critically dependent on ς54 amino Region I sequences. Their presence correlates with activator dependence, and removal allows the holoenzyme to engage productively with melted DNA independently of the activator. Using purified Region I sequences and holoenzymes containing full-length or Region I-deleted ς54, we have explored the involvement of Region I in transcription activation. Results show that Region Iin trans inhibits a reversible conformational change in the holoenzyme believed to be polymerase isomerization. Evidence is presented indicating that the holoenzyme (and not the promoter DNAper se) is one interacting target used by Region I in preventing polymerase isomerization. Activator overcomes this inhibition in a reaction requiring nucleotide hydrolysis. Region Iin trans is able to inhibit activated transcription by the holoenzyme containing full-length ς54. Inhibition appeared to be noncompetitive with respect to the activator, suggesting that a direct activator interaction occurs with parts of the holoenzyme outside Region I. Stabilization of isomerized holoenzyme bound to melted DNA by Region I in trans occurs largely independently of the initiating nucleotide, suggesting a role for Region I in maintaining the open complex."

Based on subunit composition and primary structures of the subunits, the archaeal A1A0ATPases and the eucaryal V1V0 ATPases are closely related (1Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem.

However, they differ with respect to function. The V1V0 ATPase exhibits only ATP hydrolase activity and serves to energize the membranes of certain organelles and cells. Methanogenic archaea are not fermentative but are strictly chemiosmotic, and the presence of an ATP synthase has been known for a long time (6Müller V. Blaut M. Gottschalk G. Ferry J.G. Methanogenesis. Chapman and Hall, New York1993: 360-406Crossref Google Scholar, 7Deppenmeier U. Müller V. Gottschalk G. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 149-163Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ATPases isolated from membranes of various methanogens were all classified as V1V0-like enzymes (now called A1A0 ATPases), whereas F1F0-like enzymes have never been isolated (5Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies revealed that the A1A0 ATPase from Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 is a Δμ̃H+-driven ATP synthase (8Becher B. Müller V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which gave experimental evidence that methanogens synthesize ATP by means of the A1A0 ATPase. Moreover, the genome of Methanococcus jannaschii harbors only genes encoding the A1A0 ATPase but not the F1F0 ATPase (9Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L.X. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A.

Woese C.R. Venter J.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar), which is clear evidence that this hyperthermophile also engages the A1A0ATPase for ATP synthesis. It was postulated that the diversion of the A1A0 and V1V0 ATPases took place by a duplication and subsequent fusion of the genes encoding the proteolipid, a very hydrophobic, membrane-integral subunit known to participate in transmembrane H+ transport, which in all hitherto known A1A0 ATPases is 8 kDa but is 16 kDa in all V1V0 ATPases (2Gogarten J.P. Taiz L. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 33: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The apparent inability of the V1V0 ATPases to synthesize ATP was thought to be the result of this gene duplication. The elucidation of the genomic sequence of M. jannaschii revealed only one proteolipid-encoding gene, embedded in the A1A0ATPase operon, but surprisingly this gene is triple the size of the proteolipid-encoding gene found in every other archaeon investigated so far. This finding stands in sharp contrast to the current view of evolution of structure and function of V1V0/A1A0 ATPases. The proteolipid-encoding gene of M. jannaschii is not only triplicated, but in addition, the first of the three predicted transmembrane hairpins lacks the proton-translocating carboxyl group. However, because of the presence of three potential translational start codons, it is impossible to predict unambiguously from the genomic sequence the molecular mass of the proteolipid. Apart from the first start codon 103 bp downstream of the stop of ahaI, which would lead to a 21.3-kDa proteolipid, two additional putative start codons are present, which would give rise to peptides of 13.5 and 10 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). Furthermore, post-translational modifications such as peptolytic cleavage, which would result in much smaller mature polypeptides, could not be excluded a priori. Therefore, it was essential to establish the gene-polypeptide correspondence and to determine the exact molecular mass of the mature proteolipid. We will provide evidence that the proteolipid-encoding gene of M. jannaschii arose by triplication with subsequent fusion of the genes. The proteolipid does not undergo peptolytic cleavage; the mature polypeptide is a triplication of the 8-kDa proteolipid found in other archaea and in bacteria. These findings are discussed in view of the evolution and the structure/function relationship of H+-ATPases. All chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany).N-ethylmaleimide, diethylstilbestrol, and DCCD1 were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Deisenhofen, Germany). [14C]DCCD was from NEN, Dreieich, Germany, and [35S]methionine was purchased from Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany. M. jannaschii (DSMZ 2661) was obtained from the “Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen” (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were grown in 2-liter serum bottles with 600 ml of medium as described (10Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar) except that 1 g of yeast extract/liter was added. Strict anaerobic techniques (11Balch W.E. Wolfe R.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1976; 32: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were applied. The bottles were pressurized with H2/CO2 (80:20) to 0.3 MPa and incubated at 60 °C in a water bath shaker. At an A600 of 0.6 the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C) in a Sorvall Superspeed RC2-B. The pellets were stored at −20 °C. For purification of the proteolipid, M. jannaschii was grown in a 300-l fermentor at 85 °C in the medium described (10Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar) except that 3 g/liter NaHCO3, 18 g/liter NaCl, and 0.5 g/liter Na2S, but no cysteine-HCl, were added. The fermentor was pressurized to 0.3 MPa with H2/CO2 (80:20). The gas flow-through was adjusted to 1–7 liter/min, depending on the growth phase. M. jannaschii cells (2 mg protein/ml) were lysed by osmotic shock during incubation for 5 min at 37 °C in 25 mm TES buffer, pH 6.8, containing DNase. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), the membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 100 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 7, to a protein concentration of 0.02–0.1 mg/ml. These membranes were used for labeling as well as activity measurements. To solubilize the proteolipid, 0.5% CHAPS was added, and the suspension (20 mg protein/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), [14C]DCCD (54 mCi/mmol) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.36 mm. This solution was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by autoradiography as described (12Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 369-379Crossref Scopus (10480) Google Scholar, 13Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). T denotes the total percentage concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide, and C denotes the percentage of the cross-linker relative to the total concentration T (14Hjerten S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 99: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine ATPase activity, 10–20 μl of the membrane suspension was added to 975 μl of ATPase buffer (100 mm MES, 100 mm Tris, 40 mm NaHSO3, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8). After preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the incubation temperature was increased to 80 °C, and the reaction was started by adding Na2ATP (final concentration, 2.5 mm). Samples were taken at 0, 2, 4, and 6 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of trichloroacetic acid. Activity was measured as the release of inorganic phosphate as described (15Heinonen J.E. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Membranes were preincubated with inhibitors at room temperature for 30 min. Inhibitors were dissolved in water or ethanol. Controls contained the solvent only. Extraction of membranes by chloroform/methanol was performed as described (16Beechey R.B. Linnett P.E. Fillingame R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) except that the organic phase after incubation with water was washed with 0.5 volumes of chloroform/methanol/water (3:47:48). The extract was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex LH-60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For N-terminal sequencing, the proteins were blotted on a BioTraceTM polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (pore size 0.45 μm, PALLGelmanSciences, Rossdorf, Germany) according to (17Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The protein bands were excised from the membrane and sequenced with a model 473A sequencer from Applied Biosystems using a faster version of the standard cycle. 1 μl of the fraction obtained after Sephadex LH-60 chromatography (1 μg protein/μl) was mixed with 1 μl of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v). 0.5 μl of this solution was applied to the target surface and dried. The measurements were performed with a VOYAGER-MALDI-TOF (PerSeptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). The sample was ionized with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length). ATPase activity as catalyzed by washed membranes of M. jannaschii was maximal at 80 °C and pH 8 (146 milliunits/mg protein). The temperature optimum reflects the optimum for growth (85 °C), whereas the pH optimum was more alkaline than that observed for growth (10Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Sodium ions did not stimulate ATPase activity. The membrane-bound ATPase was inhibited by the sulfhydryl-reactive compound N-ethylmaleimide (I50, 3.4 μmol/mg protein). Low concentrations (0.1 mm) of the F0-directed inhibitor diethylstilbestrol had a stimulating effect, but higher concentrations decreased the ATPase activity (I50, 2.8 μmol/mg protein) with 100% inhibition at 10 mm. DCCD was the most effective inhibitor tested, and half-maximal and maximal inhibition were obtained at 1.1 and 8.7 μmol/mg protein, respectively, corresponding to 0.5 and 4 mm DCCD. To determine the apparent molecular mass of the proteolipid and the potential cleavage products, membranes of M. jannaschii were labeled with [14C]DCCD, which is known to bind covalently to the proton-translocating carboxyl group of the proteolipid, subjected to 12.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As seen in Fig.2, only one polypeptide was labeled; however, the apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa is considerably smaller than that predicted from the DNA sequence of the proteolipid-encoding gene. To analyze the mature proteolipid, it was purified from membranes of M. jannaschii. Because the proteolipid is very hydrophobic and therefore soluble in organic solvents, the membranes were extracted with chloroform/methanol. This purification led to the isolation of only two proteins (Fig. 2), of which the N termini were determined. The N terminus of the high molecular mass protein (MDIVSAIVPLIEMT) is identical with MtrD, a subunit of the N 5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M methyltransferase, which is a primary sodium ion pump (18Müller V. Winner C. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Becher B. Müller V. Gottschalk G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 239-244Google Scholar, 20Becher B. Müller V. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7656-7660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The higher molecular mass proteins are aggregates of MtrD, as revealed by N-terminal sequencing. The lower molecular mass protein was identified as the proteolipid. The sequences obtained (MVDPLILGAVGAGLA and VDPLILGAVGAGLA) showed that the N-terminal methionine has been excised from a fraction of the proteolipids. These N-terminal sequences revealed that translation initiates 103 bp downstream of atpI (cf. Fig. 1). The open reading frame encodes a protein of a deduced molecular mass of 21,318 Da. Different concentrations of acrylamide/bisacrylamide were used to analyze the apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE. At 12.5%T, 3% C the proteolipid migrated as a 15-kDa protein (Fig. 2), as seen before, but at 16.5% T, 6% C, the apparent molecular mass was 19 kDa, which is close to the predicted value. The same dependence of the migration behavior on the acrylamide concentration was observed with MtrD. To determine the apparent molecular mass accurately, the peptides were submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The removal of lipids from the sample, which is a prerequisite of this analysis led to the generation of a high molecular mass aggregate of MtrD, which did not leave the MALDI matrix. In the MALDI-TOF MS analysis, two forms of the proteolipid with molecular weights of 21,316 and 21,183 were determined (Fig. 3). This finding is in good correlation with the prediction (21,318 and 21,187 for the methionine-free form); the small deviation of the determination from the predicted molecular masses is due to matrix effects. The MALDI-TOF MS analysis is final proof that the proteolipid from M. jannaschii is a triplication of the 8-kDa proteolipid found in other archaea. The data presented here demonstrate that the proteolipd-encoding gene of M. jannaschii is indeed approximately 3 times the size of all other archaeal proteolipid-encoding genes known so far. The gene can be divided into three parts, atpK1 (bp 1–240), atpK2 (bp 241–423), and atpK3 (bp 424–660), which are very similar to each other (atpK1:atpK2, 65% identity;atpK2:atpK3, 68% identity;atpK1:atpK3, 61% identity). This is clear evidence that atpK arose by triplication and fusion of an ancestral gene. Not only the gene but also the mature product is triplicated, as it is evident from the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the purified protein. Hydropathy analysis suggests that AtpK consists of three hairpins with two transmembrane helices connected by polar loops. Although the hairpins are very similar to each other (AtpK1:AtpK2, 58% identity; AtpK2:AtpK3, 57% identity; AtpK1:AtpK3, 46% identity), the proton-translocating carboxyl group is only conserved in hairpins two and three but not in hairpin one. The ATPases are rotary enzymes, and it is suggested that the proteolipid oligomer is organized in a ring-like structure (22Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 23Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Valiyaveetil F.I. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ion flow across the membrane is assumed to be coupled to rotation of the proteolipid ring against a stator, most probably subunit I in A1A0 ATPases. This rotation is transmitted via a shaft to the hydrophilic domain. The lack of the proton-translocating carboxyl group as observed in the M. jannaschii ATPase, and V1V0 ATPases is important in the context of the function of the ATPases. Our experiments gave clear evidence that it is not the size of the proteolipid but the capability to synthesize ATP that distinguishes V1V0 and A1A0 ATPases. The capability to synthesize ATP is directly dependent on the number of protons translocated per ATP synthesized. According to ΔGp = −n·F·Δp, a phosphorylation potential (ΔGp) of ∼50–70 kJ/mol is sustained by the use of n = 3-4 H+/ATP at physiological electrochemical proton potentials of −180 mV (Δp). However, if the number of protons is lower, then ATP can no longer be synthesized. It is assumed that the ring-like proteolipid oligomer contains 24 transmembrane helices (23Fillingame R.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29701-29705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of the bacterial and archaeal 8-kDa proteolipids with two transmembrane helices, 12 monomers and 12 proton-translocating carboxyl groups are present per oligomer. Taking into account three ATP-synthesizing or hydrolyzing centers, this gives a stoichiometry of 4 H+/ATP. In contrast, six copies of the 16-kDa proteolipid with four transmembrane helices are required to form the proteolipid oligomer of V1V0 ATPases (25Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the proton-translocating group is lost in the first pair of transmembrane helices, the stoichiometry is only 2 H+/ATP, which is too low to allow ATP synthesis. In M. jannaschii, the proton-translocating group is substituted by a glutamine residue in hairpin one (verified repeatedly by cloning and sequencing of the gene in our laboratory), which results in a H+/ATP stoichiometry of 2.7. This stoichiometry is apparently sufficient for ATP synthesis because the enzyme from M. jannaschii is clearly an ATP synthase (see above). In this context, it would be interesting to determine the threshold values for ATP synthesis in M. jannaschii. On the other hand, it is conceivable that not four but six copies are present in the oligomer with, for example, the first hairpin oriented into the center of the ring. In this way, a H+/ATP stoichiometry of four could be achieved. In any case, the proteolipid from M. jannaschii is a rather unique polypeptide offering new insights into the structure and function of A1A0 ATPases."

The outer and the inner membrane machinery have been termed Toc1 (translocon of the outer membrane of chloroplasts) and Tic (translocon of the inner membrane of chloroplasts), respectively (5Schnell D.J.

This envelope channel, which is located in the inner membrane, will be called p rotein i mport-r elated a nion c hannel (PIRAC) here. The PIRAC was shown to be inactivated, i.e. the open probability of the channel (Po) was decreased, by the addition of precursor protein. The inactivation was found to be dependent on ATP and the presence of a functional transit sequence. The exact role of PIRAC in chloroplast protein import, however, is not known yet. In this report a further characterization of PIRAC is described. An initial approximation of the pore size of PIRAC is made. Furthermore, the relationship between PIRAC and the Tic machinery is investigated. It is found that antibodies raised to Tic110 completely inactivate PIRAC. Chloroplasts were isolated from pea leaves by cutting them gently with a razor blade in electrolyte solution used in the bath for the electrophysiological measurements, as indicated in the text. The sliced preparation was transferred directly to a chamber, which was mounted on a light microscope to allow visual selection of single intact chloroplasts. A standard patch clamp technique was used to record the currents across the chloroplast envelope (10Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

Electrodes were filled with electrolyte solution as indicated in the text. Electrode resistances were found to be typically around 30 megaohms.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that the seals consist of the outer membrane alone. Moreover, in over 2000 successful seals no (changes in) current signals associated with gating activity of the pores were ever observed. It is conceivable that the seal consists of a sandwich-like structure of the outer and the inner membranes. In this configuration gating of the outer membrane pores would cause shifts in the base-line current because of the opening and closing of the pore. Such shifts in base-line currents were never observed in any of the successful seals, which argues against the presence of the outer membrane in the patch. In addition no light-induced currents (12Vredenberg W. Bulychev A. Dassen H. Snel J. Van Voorthuysen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 77-80Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were ever observed after seal formation (i.e. in the attached configuration) or after excision of the patch. This finding indicates that the thylakoid membrane under the conditions used here was not included in the patch. The patch is therefore likely to consist of the inner membrane alone. The possibility cannot be excluded, however, that the outer membrane pores are silent in a patch consisting of both the outer and inner membrane tightly compressed. Such a sandwich-like patch would give rise to a higher capacitance seal as compared with a seal with only one membrane present. When patch pipettes identical to those used in the present chloroplast experiments were applied to obtain seals of the vacuole membrane in the inside-out configuration, the capacitive current induced by a stepwise change in holding potential was not significantly different (data not shown). This finding indicates that the membrane sizes or the thickness of the seals obtained from the chloroplast envelope or the vacuole membrane are identical, thus arguing for a seal consisting of the inner envelope membrane alone. In single-channel recordings presented here, the current runs across the inner membrane. Because only the effect of an antibody added to the stromal side of the patch is described, the data are not affected by the presence or absence of the outer membrane in the patch. The single-channel conductance of PIRAC in symmetrical 100 mm KCl is 42 pS. This conductance is calculated from the current voltage relationship, where the open channel current is plotted against the membrane potential. In Fig.1 A, single-channel recordings of PIRAC in symmetrical 100 mm KCl buffer at different membrane potentials are shown. Fig. 1 B shows small parts of the same single-channel recordings at a higher time resolution. At positive potentials the channel shows fast transitions between the open and the closed levels. This behavior is known as flickering. At negative potentials flickering is less pronounced, as can be judged from Fig. 1 B. The single-channel recordings of PIRAC (Fig.1) show no indication for the existence of subconductance levels. Fig.2 shows the current-voltage relationship of PIRAC in 100 mm KCl; each point was taken from at least five different single-channel recordings. In buffer containing 25 mm KCl, the single-channel conductance of PIRAC is found to be around 10 pS (not shown). The open probability of PIRAC in symmetrical 100 mm KCl is found to be around 0.85 (not shown).Figure 2Current-voltage relationship of PIRAC in symmetrical 100 mm KCl (open symbols) and 10/100 mm KCl (closed symbols), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was shown previously that PIRAC is an anion selective channel (9Van den Wijngaard P.W.J. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-294331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the anion selectivity of PIRAC, the KCl concentration of the bath solution was lowered from 100 to 10 mm. In this 10-fold KCl gradient across the patch, the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2) shows a reversal potential of +33 mV. Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, this reversal potential corresponds to a permeability ratio of PCl−/PK+ of 6.6. If PIRAC is considered as a water-filled cylindrical pore, the diameter of the pore would be around 6.5 Å. This estimation is based on the simplest model of channel geometry and is fairly rough (13Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 294-298Google Scholar), but it provides limits for the hydrophilic pore at the narrowest point. The same approximation was used to estimate the pore diameter of the reconstituted Toc75 channel (14Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). If the resistivity in the channel is assumed to be five times the bulk resistivity (15Smart O.S. Breed J. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1109-1126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) a pore diameter of 15 Å is calculated. To identify a possible association of PIRAC with Tic the effect of the addition of antibodies to Tic110 on PIRAC gating was tested. When Tic110 IgG was added to the bath solution PIRAC activity could be observed directly after excision of the patch. After approximately 60 s, PIRAC activity was completely lost. In Fig. 3 a single-channel recording of PIRAC in the presence of Tic110 IgG is shown. This loss of PIRAC activity in the presence of Tic110 IgG was found in 14 of 18 single-channel recordings. Single-channel recordings of PIRAC without antibody in the bath solution very rarely show loss of channel activity because of channel rundown. In the control situation, channel rundown is observed in approximately 5% of PIRAC containing patches and occurs in these patches after several hundreds of seconds. The loss of channel activity in the presence of Tic110 IgG can therefore be ascribed to the action of the antibodies. To test the specificity of the antibody effect on PIRAC gating, antibodies against a component of the outer membrane translocon, Toc75, were added to the bath solution as well. In the presence of these antibodies, loss of PIRAC activity in single-channel recordings was never observed in 10 recordings of 180 s or longer. PIRAC has been shown to be an envelope anion channel with a single-channel conductance of 50 pS in 250 mm KCl (9Van den Wijngaard P.W.J. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-294331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This value is close to the 42-pS conductance reported here in 100 mm KCl. The value for the single-channel conductance of PIRAC in 25 mm KCl is around 10 pS. Thus, it appears that below 100 mm KCl the conductance depends linearly on the KCl concentration. From this concentration dependency it can be concluded that the saturation value of PIRAC single-channel conductance is close to 50 pS. Saturation of the single-channel conductance in relatively low ionic strength buffers was also observed previously for the reconstituted Toc75 channel (14Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The reversal potential found here for a 10-fold KCl gradient (10/100 mm) is in good agreement with what has been found before in 25/250 mm KCl (9Van den Wijngaard P.W.J. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-294331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The open probability found in 100 mm KCl is identical to the open probability of PIRAC in 25/250 mm KCl as described elsewhere (9Van den Wijngaard P.W.J. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-294331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This correspondence indicates that the open probability of PIRAC is not influenced by salt concentration or gradient. The data presented here demonstrate that PIRAC is associated with the import machinery of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. It was shown previously that PIRAC is inactivated by a translocation-competent precursor protein (9Van den Wijngaard P.W.J. Vredenberg W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29430-294331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This inactivation is the result of an interaction between precursor protein and a protein complex of which PIRAC is a constituent. 2P. W. J. van den Wijngaard, unpublished results. The loss of PIRAC activity induced by antibodies to Tic110 demonstrates that PIRAC is associated with Tic110. This component of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane protein import machinery is an integral membrane protein with a large hydrophilic stretch facing the chloroplast stroma (8Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16583-16588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is thought that Tic110 functions as a docking site for stromal chaperones that are involved in protein import. An association of Tic110 and stromal chaperonin 60 was shown to exist in isolated chloroplasts (6Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Another stromal chaperone, the Hsp100 homologue ClpC, was also shown to interact with Tic110 (16Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This suggested role for Tic110 implies that the large hydrophilic part of the protein, which faces the stroma, is located near the stroma-facing exit of the protein translocation channel of the inner envelope membrane. The inactivation of PIRAC by antibodies to Tic110 shows close similarities with the inactivation of the mitochondrial multiple conductance channel by antibodies to Tim23 (17Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The multiple conductance channel has been shown to be blocked by a mitochondrial presequence. This channel is therefore thought to be involved in mitochondrial protein import (18Lohret T.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15950-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because of the inactivation of PIRAC by Tic110 antibodies, it seems likely that PIRAC represents the protein conducting channel of the inner membrane. With an approximate PIRAC pore size of 6.5 Å, precursor proteins have to be completely unfolded to pass through the PIRAC pore. The reconstituted protein translocation channel of the outer membrane, Toc75, has been reported to have an approximate pore size of 8.5 Å (14Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This value is based on the same approximation as the one used for PIRAC in this study, which indicates that the pores of the protein import channels of the outer and inner membranes are of comparable sizes.

https://openalex.org/W1887265481,"The aim of this paper is to verify whether the control played by poly(ADP-ribosyl)-ation on genomic DNA methylation, and in particular on CpG islands, can also be seen on foreign DNA transfected in cells where inhibition of the poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation process was obtained by treating them with 2 mM 3-aminobenzamide for 24 h. The CpG island-like pVHCk plasmid containing the bacterial chloramphenicol acyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of SV40 early promoter was transfected in L929 mouse fibroblast cells. The bisulfite reaction, which is capable of immortalizing the methylation state of cytosine on DNA, was performed before amplification of the plasmid DNA fragment, then used for sequence analysis. Our results have shown that 1) when transfected in control cells, the plasmid maintains its characteristic unmethylated pattern, whereas this pattern is lost when the plasmid is transfected in cells treated with 3-aminobenzamide; and 2) the presence of new methyl groups on plasmid DNA is paralleled by a decrease of CAT reporter gene expression. These data confirm that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a process tightly involved in protecting genomic DNA from full methylation and suggest the use of 3-aminobenzamide as a possible experimental strategy to mime other conditions of DNA hypermethylation in cells.—Zardo, G., Marenzi, S., Perilli, M., Caiafa, P.

The purpose of the present study was to establish the profile of endothelin-1-induced calcium transients in pericytes and to identify changes occurring after culture in high concentrations of glucose. Glucose had no effect on basal levels of cytosolic calcium or on endothelin-1-induced calcium release from intracellular stores. However, influx of calcium from the extracellular medium after endothelin-1 stimulation was reduced in pericytes that had been cultured in 25 mmd-glucose. L-type Ca2+ currents were identified by patch clamping. The L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, (−)-Bay K8644, caused less influx of calcium from the extracellular medium in pericytes that had been cultured in 25 mmd-glucose than in those cultured with 5 mmd-glucose. However, 3-O-methylglucose, a nonmetabolizable analogue of glucose which can cause glycation, had similar effects to those of high concentrations of glucose. The results suggest that reduced function of the L-type Ca2+ channel that occurs in bovine retinal pericytes after culture in high concentrations of d-glucose is probably due to glycation of a channel protein.

Erdreich L.J. Stober J.A. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 501-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Longitudinal studies in diabetes have shown that alterations in capillary function and blood flow occur in advance of the structural changes seen in diabetic retinopathy such as pericyte loss, microaneurysm formation, and neovascularization (2Tooke J.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 721-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Pericyte tone normally regulates retinal capillary blood flow (3Kohner E.M. Patel V. Rassam S.M. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 603-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because retinal capillaries are devoid of extrinsic innervation (4Ye X. Laties A.M. Stone R.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1731-1737PubMed Google Scholar), pericyte tone is controlled to a large extent by changes in the partial pressures of blood gases (5Riva E.C. Grunvald J.E. Sinclair S.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1983; 24: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar) and endothelium-derived agonists such as endothelin-1 (ET-1)1 (6Takagi C. Bursell S.-E. Lin Y.-W. Takagi H. Duh E. Jiang Z. Clermont A.C. King G.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 2504-2518PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously shown (7Chakravarthy U. McGinty A. McKillop J. Anderson P. Archer D.B. Trimble E.R. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that exposure to high ambient glucose concentrations in vitro caused a reduction in the contractile response of the bovine retinal pericyte (BRP) to ET-1 without any reduction in either ET-1 binding or generation of inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). The aim of the present study was 1) to establish the profile of ET-1-induced changes in cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in the cultured pericyte and 2) to determine whether prior exposure to raised concentrations of glucose would alter ET-1-induced calcium transients in these cells.DISCUSSIONET-1 produced a biphasic rise in [Ca2+]i that consisted of an initial peak followed by a sustained plateau phase. The plateau phase was abolished in Ca2+-free medium, showing that this phase arose from influx through Ca2+ channels. The probability that these were L-type Ca2+ channels was suggested by identification of a nifedipine-sensitive inward current and by (−)-Bay K8644-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. The plateau phase was depressed in high concentrations of glucose; the implication of this is that culture in high concentrations of d-glucose attenuated Ca2+ channel function. This idea was supported by the effects of (−)-Bay K8644, an L-type channel agonist that had a lesser effect on Ca2+ influx in cells grown in 25 mmglucose compared with those grown in 5 mm glucose. These differences were unlikely to result from differences in resting membrane potential, which is unchanged by high concentrations of glucose (13Berweck S. Thieme H. Helbig H. Lepple-Wienhues A. Wiederholt M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The present study shows that sustained exposure to high concentrations of glucose alters the properties of L-type Ca2+ channels in BRP.The initial phase of the ET-1-induced Ca2+ transient is composed of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, and this is superimposed on the earliest part of influx from the extracellular medium. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was similar in BRP grown in 5 or 25 mm glucose. This is consistent with previous results that showed that ET-1 binding and Ins(1,4,5)P3production by BRP were unaffected by glucose under similar culture conditions (7Chakravarthy U. McGinty A. McKillop J. Anderson P. Archer D.B. Trimble E.R. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results show that continued exposure to high concentrations of glucose attenuates the [Ca2+]i rise produced by ET-1 by an action on L-type Ca2+channels but has no effect on that mediated by Ins(1,4,5)P3. The results from studies with 3-OMG strongly suggest that glucose affects the Ca2+channel by a mechanism involving glycation. We have not been able to detect any evidence of free radical attack, at least on lipids, either in this study where F2-isoprostanes were measured or in a previous study (12Sharpe P.C. Liu W.-H.

The attenuated increase in [Ca2+]i may explain, at least in part, the previously observed reduced contractile response to ET-1 of BRP grown in high concentrations of glucose despite the fact that ET-1 binding and Ins(1,4,5)P3 production were unchanged (7Chakravarthy U. McGinty A. McKillop J. Anderson P. Archer D.B. Trimble E.R. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In conclusion, culture of BRP in high concentrations of glucose for extended periods leads to reduced function of L-type Ca2+channels; the observed effects may be due to glycation of a channel protein. These results suggest that glycation of Ca2+channel proteins may affect the quality of retinal pericyte response to ET-1 and, hence, control of retinal capillary blood flow in the presence of sustained hyperglycemia.

These results suggest that glycation of Ca2+channel proteins may affect the quality of retinal pericyte response to ET-1 and, hence, control of retinal capillary blood flow in the presence of sustained hyperglycemia. We are grateful to Dr. U. Chakravarthy for teaching the pericyte culture technique and to the colleagues of Professor J. M. C. Gutteridge for measuring bleomycin-detectable iron levels in the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2148461603,"Gelsolin belongs to a family of proteins that modulate the structural dynamics of cytoskeletal actin. Gelsolin activity is required for the redistribution of actin occurring during membrane ruffling, cell crawling, and platelet activation. A point mutation (G654A) in the gelsolin gene causes a dominantly inherited systemic amyloidosis called familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type (FAF). This disease is characterized by a cranial neuropathy that cannot be explained solely by amyloid deposits. To address the question of whether gelsolin has a specific role in neural cell development, we transfected cDNA for wild type and G654A point-mutated gelsolin into a neural cell line, Paju, which can be induced to differentiate by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Overexpressed wild type gelsolin inhibited neural differentiation whereas mutated gelsolin did not, indicating that appropriate gelsolin activity is essential for neural sprouting. The G654A mutant gelsolin induced stabilization of F-actin and reduced the plasticity of neural development. This provides a novel etiopathogenetic mechanism for the neuronal dysfunction in FAF."
https://openalex.org/W2124995602,"The influence of cell hydration on the heat shock response was investigated in H4IIE hepatoma cells at the levels of HSP70 expression, MAP kinase activation, induction of c-jun and the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1, heat resistance, and development of tolerance/sensitization to arsenite after a priming heat treatment. Induction of HSP70, MKP-1, and c-jun by heat was delayed, but more pronounced or sustained, under hyperosmotic conditions compared with normo- and hypo-osmotically exposed cells. Anisosmolarity per se was ineffective to induce HSP70; some expression of the mRNAs for MKP-1 and c-jun in response to hyperosmolarity was found, but was small compared with the response to heat. Heat-induced activation of JNK-1 was increased under hyperosmotic conditions and more sustained than the JNK-activity induced by hyperosmolarity at 37°C. A prominent Erk-2 activation was found immediately after heat shock under hypo- and normo-osmotic conditions, but Erk-2 activation was weak in hyperosmolarity-exposed cells. Despite anisosmotic alterations of the heat shock response at the molecular level, the heat resistance of H4IIE cells toward heat shock was not affected by ambient osmolarity. However, an osmolarity-dependent sensitization to arsenite was induced by a priming heat shock. The osmodependence of the H4IIE cell response to heat differs from that recently found in primary rat hepatocytes. The data are discussed in terms of cellular adaption mechanisms and their physiological relevance.—Schliess, F., Wiese, S., Häussinger, D.

https://openalex.org/W2038236714,"β-Lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, a reaction that destroys their antibacterial activity. These enzymes, of which four classes are known, are the primary cause of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. The class A β-lactamases form the largest group. A novel class A β-lactamase, named the nonmetallocarbapenamase of class A (NMC-A) β-lactamase, has been discovered recently that has a broad substrate profile that included carbapenem antibiotics. This is a serious development, since carbapenems have been relatively immune to the action of these resistance enzymes. Inhibitors for this enzyme are sought. We describe herein that a type of monobactam molecule of our design inactivates the NMC-A β-lactamase rapidly, efficiently, and irreversibly. The mechanism of inactivation was investigated by solving the x-ray structure of the inhibited NMC-A enzyme to 1.95 Å resolution. The structure shed light on the nature of the fragmentation of the inhibitor on enzyme acylation and indicated that there are two acyl-enzyme species that account for enzyme inhibition. Each of these inhibited enzyme species is trapped in a distinct local energy minimum that does not predispose the inhibitor species for deacylation, accounting for the irreversible mode of enzyme inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence in favor of a dynamic motion for the acyl-enzyme species, which samples a considerable conformational space prior to the entrapment of the two stable acyl-enzyme species in the local energy minima. A discussion of the likelihood of such dynamic motion for turnover of substrates during the normal catalytic processes of the enzyme is presented. β-Lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, a reaction that destroys their antibacterial activity.

Mobashery S. Rosen B.P. Mobashery S. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox: Progress in Understanding Drug Resistance and Development of New Antibiotics. Plenum Press, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar). These enzymes hydrolyze the β-lactam moiety of β-lactam antibiotics, and by so-doing, render them inactive. There are four classes of these enzymes, of which the class A is the largest group (1Bush K. Mobashery S. Rosen B.P. Mobashery S. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox: Progress in Understanding Drug Resistance and Development of New Antibiotics. Plenum Press, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar). The active-site serine in the class A β-lactamases undergoes acylation by the substrate and the acyl-enzyme intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed to give substrate turnover (1Bush K. Mobashery S. Rosen B.P. Mobashery S. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox: Progress in Understanding Drug Resistance and Development of New Antibiotics. Plenum Press, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar,2Matagne A.

Class A enzymes perform this task with their preferred substrates, penicillins, at the diffusion limit (3Hardy L.W. Kirsch J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Many of the “parental” β-lactamases of class A, such as the TEM-1 β-lactamase, have undergone mutations that impart to them an increase in the breadth of their substrate profile (1Bush K. Mobashery S. Rosen B.P. Mobashery S. Resolving the Antibiotic Paradox: Progress in Understanding Drug Resistance and Development of New Antibiotics. Plenum Press, New York1998: 71-98Google Scholar), as well as the ability to avoid being inhibited by the known clinical inhibitors. This is currently a serious clinical challenge.One new class A β-lactamase, designated NMC-A1 (4Nordmann P. Mariotte S. Naas T. Labia R. Nicolas M.H. Antimicrob.

Currently, carbapenem antibiotics such as imipenem are considered antibiotics of last resort, and the advent of enzymes that turn them over efficiently bodes poorly for the prospects of continued clinical utility of these versatile antibacterials.The x-ray structure of the NMC-A enzyme, and its comparison to that of the classical class A enzyme (8Swarén P. Maveyraud L. Raquet X. Cabantous S. Duez C. Pedelacq J.D. Mariotte-Boyer S. Mourey L. Labia R. Nicolas-Chanoine M.H. Nordmann P. Frère J.M. Samama J.P. J. Biol.

The subtle relocation of this residue in the active site by a mere 1 Å, enlarges the substrate-binding site to accommodate the 6α-hydroxyethyl substituent of carbapenems, allowing the turnover process to take place (9Mourey L. Miyashita K. Swarén P. Bulychev A. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9382-9383Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations were the basis for the design of a novel inactivator for the NMC-A β-lactamase, namely 6α-hydroxypropylpenicillanate (9Mourey L. Miyashita K. Swarén P. Bulychev A. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9382-9383Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure determination of the complex of the NMC-A β-lactamase and the inhibitor illustrated that inactivation of the enzyme arose from interactions between the protein and inhibitor that prevented the approach of the hydrolytic water to the ester of the acyl-enzyme intermediate (9Mourey L.

These are effective inactivators for this enzyme, and their mechanism of action is distinct compared with that of 6α-hydroxypropylpenicillanate, which was reported earlier (9Mourey L. Miyashita K.

The mechanistic implications of interactions of the NMC-A β-lactamase and one of the inhibitors of our design are addressed by the determination of the crystal structure of the complex, as well as by computational molecular dynamics simulations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe NMC-A β-lactamase was purified to homogeneity according to a literature procedure (8Swarén P. Maveyraud L. Raquet X. Cabantous S. Duez C. Pedelacq J.D. Mariotte-Boyer S. Mourey L. Labia R. Nicolas-Chanoine M.H. Nordmann P. Frère J.M. Samama J.P. J. Biol.

Syntheses of compounds 1 and 6 were reported previously (10Bulychev A. O'Brien M.E. Massova I. Teng M. Gibson T.A. Miller M.J. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5938-5943Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and those for the remainder of the inhibitors are given in the Supplementary Material available in the on-line version. Spectrophotometric studies were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array instrument. Calculations were performed by the MS Excel program.Kinetic ExperimentsA 1.0-ml assay mixture typically consisted of 0.5 mm cephaloridine in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of cephaloridine was monitored at 290 nm (Δε290 = 2070m−1 cm−1) upon addition of the enzyme (final concentration was typically 5 nm).Inactivation experiments were performed as follows. An aliquot of the stock solution of the inactivator (100 μm in p-dioxane) was added to the NMC-A β-lactamase (0.4 μm final concentration) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 4 °C (10% p-dioxane final). Portions (10 μl) were removed from the mixture at time intervals and were diluted 100-fold into the assay mixture containing 0.5 mm cephaloridine. The enzyme activity was monitored until cephaloridine was entirely consumed. The remaining enzyme activity was calculated from the initial linear portion of the hydrolysis curve.Rates of hydrolysis of the inactivated acyl-enzyme species (krec), and the attendant recovery of activity, were measured under conditions of excess substrate (0.5 mmcephaloridine) (11Koerber S.C. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A solution of a given inactivator in p-dioxane (typically 300 μm final concentration) was mixed with the NMC-A β-lactamase (0.7 μm final concentration). The mixture was incubated (30 min to 6 h, depending on the inhibitor) at room temperature until residual enzyme activity was less than 2%. A 10-μl portion of this mixture was added to the solution of cephaloridine (0.5 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Hydrolysis of cephaloridine was monitored at 290 nm (Δε290 = 2070m−1 cm−1). The computation of the rate constant was performed according to the method of Glick et al. (12Glick B.R. Brubacher L.J. Leggett D.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Michaelis-Menten parameters for turnover (Km and kcat) for compounds 1-4 were evaluated by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The concentrations of the compounds were varied from 2.5 to 15 μm. A portion of the enzyme was added to a solution of the inhibitor to give a final concentration of 4 nm for the enzyme in a total volume of 1.0 ml; hydrolysis was monitored at 240 nm (1,Δε240 = 11,480 m−1cm−1; 2, Δε240 = 6140m−1 cm−1; 3,Δε240 = 12,700 m−1cm−1; 4, Δε240 = 15,100m−1 cm−1).Determination of the X-ray Structure of the Enzyme Inhibited by Compound 6Crystals of NMC-A (8Swarén P.

After 15 min, crystals were mounted in cryoloops and were flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to 120 K. A 1.95-Å data set was collected on the W32 wiggler beam line at LURE-DCI (Orsay, France), tuned at a wavelength of 0.97 Å, and equipped with a large MarResearch imaging plate. The crystal to detector distance was set to 270 mm. A total of 60 frames (1.5° oscillation per frame and 10-min exposure) were collected from a single NMC-A crystal. Data were processed with MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.W. Joint Collaborative Computing Project 4 and European Science Foundation-European Association of the Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and CCP4 (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

There is one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was refined with the program X-PLOR, version 3.1 (15Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), applying a bulk solvent correction. A total of 5% of the reflections were randomly selected in order to provide a test set for the Rfree calculations (16Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar). These reflections were omitted during refinement, but were included in the electron density map calculations.

Rigid body refinement, performed between 8.0 and 3.0 Å (Rfactor = 0.36), was followed by molecular dynamics refinement in the resolution range 31.2–1.95 Å, using a slow cooling protocol starting from 3000 K, energy minimization, and individual thermal factor refinement. Water molecules were added as neutral oxygen atoms when they appeared as positive peaks above 4.0 ς in the (Fobs −Fcalc) exp(iαcalc) map in acceptable hydrogen-bonding geometry. Hereafter, the simulated annealing was performed from 500 K. The electron density maps revealed two conformations for the inhibitor covalently bound in the active site to Ser-70. The starting geometry of the inhibitor was obtained by optimization using DISCOVER (MSI). The final model of the enzyme−inhibitor complex, composed of all protein atoms with the exception of the solvent-exposed side chains of three lysine residues, includes 266 crystallographic water molecules and three molecules of MES buffer molecules. Alternate conformations were assigned to two side chains. The average B factors were 11.7 Å2 for protein atoms (10.5 Å2 and 12.9 Å2 for main chains and side chains, respectively), 17.2 Å2 for Ser-70 acylated by 6, 23.1 Å2 for solvent atoms, and 58.8 Å2 for MES buffer atoms. The final crystallographic R and Rfree values were 0.179 and 0.226, respectively.Molecular Modeling and Dynamics SimulationsThe coordinates of the native NMC-A β-lactamase were obtained by removing the bound inhibitor from the active site of the enzyme in the x-ray structure. This native structure was utilized to construct an immediate acyl-enzyme species for structure 11. The immediate acyl-enzyme species refers to what would be generated after serine acylation, whereby the ester carbonyl is ensconced in the oxyanion hole with strong hydrogen bonds to the backbone amines of Ser-70 and Ser-237. There is ample structural evidence for the existence of such a species from our earlier work (19Maveyraud L. Mourey L. Kotra L.P. Pédelacq J.D. Guillet V. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem.

The model for the immediate acyl-enzyme intermediate included the crystallographic waters and an additional box of water molecules up to 8-Å thickness from the surface of the enzyme. The model was energy-minimized and was utilized for the molecular dynamics simulations as the starting conformation. Molecular dynamics were performed using the Amber 5.0 software package (Oxford Molecular Inc.) (21Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A.

The complete system was warmed from 0 to 300 K in steps of 20 K per 5 ps and then equilibrated at 300 K for 25 ps (a total of 100 ps). Snapshots of the structures were collected from here on for every 0.2 ps for 128 ps, and the resulting structures were analyzed. β-Lactamases are the primary cause of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (1Bush K.

We disclose herein inhibition of the NMC-A β-lactamase by a set of monobactam inhibitors. These are effective inactivators for this enzyme, and their mechanism of action is distinct compared with that of 6α-hydroxypropylpenicillanate, which was reported earlier (9Mourey L. Miyashita K. Swarén P. Bulychev A. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9382-9383Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanistic implications of interactions of the NMC-A β-lactamase and one of the inhibitors of our design are addressed by the determination of the crystal structure of the complex, as well as by computational molecular dynamics simulations. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe NMC-A β-lactamase was purified to homogeneity according to a literature procedure (8Swarén P. Maveyraud L. Raquet X. Cabantous S. Duez C. Pedelacq J.D. Mariotte-Boyer S.

Cephaloridine was purchased from Sigma. Syntheses of compounds 1 and 6 were reported previously (10Bulychev A. O'Brien M.E. Massova I. Teng M. Gibson T.A. Miller M.J. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5938-5943Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and those for the remainder of the inhibitors are given in the Supplementary Material available in the on-line version. Spectrophotometric studies were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array instrument. Calculations were performed by the MS Excel program.Kinetic ExperimentsA 1.0-ml assay mixture typically consisted of 0.5 mm cephaloridine in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of cephaloridine was monitored at 290 nm (Δε290 = 2070m−1 cm−1) upon addition of the enzyme (final concentration was typically 5 nm).Inactivation experiments were performed as follows. An aliquot of the stock solution of the inactivator (100 μm in p-dioxane) was added to the NMC-A β-lactamase (0.4 μm final concentration) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 4 °C (10% p-dioxane final). Portions (10 μl) were removed from the mixture at time intervals and were diluted 100-fold into the assay mixture containing 0.5 mm cephaloridine. The enzyme activity was monitored until cephaloridine was entirely consumed. The remaining enzyme activity was calculated from the initial linear portion of the hydrolysis curve.Rates of hydrolysis of the inactivated acyl-enzyme species (krec), and the attendant recovery of activity, were measured under conditions of excess substrate (0.5 mmcephaloridine) (11Koerber S.C. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A solution of a given inactivator in p-dioxane (typically 300 μm final concentration) was mixed with the NMC-A β-lactamase (0.7 μm final concentration). The mixture was incubated (30 min to 6 h, depending on the inhibitor) at room temperature until residual enzyme activity was less than 2%. A 10-μl portion of this mixture was added to the solution of cephaloridine (0.5 mm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Hydrolysis of cephaloridine was monitored at 290 nm (Δε290 = 2070m−1 cm−1). The computation of the rate constant was performed according to the method of Glick et al. (12Glick B.R. Brubacher L.J. Leggett D.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1978; 56: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Michaelis-Menten parameters for turnover (Km and kcat) for compounds 1-4 were evaluated by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The concentrations of the compounds were varied from 2.5 to 15 μm. A portion of the enzyme was added to a solution of the inhibitor to give a final concentration of 4 nm for the enzyme in a total volume of 1.0 ml; hydrolysis was monitored at 240 nm (1,Δε240 = 11,480 m−1cm−1; 2, Δε240 = 6140m−1 cm−1; 3,Δε240 = 12,700 m−1cm−1; 4, Δε240 = 15,100m−1 cm−1).Determination of the X-ray Structure of the Enzyme Inhibited by Compound 6Crystals of NMC-A (8Swarén P.

After 15 min, crystals were mounted in cryoloops and were flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to 120 K. A 1.95-Å data set was collected on the W32 wiggler beam line at LURE-DCI (Orsay, France), tuned at a wavelength of 0.97 Å, and equipped with a large MarResearch imaging plate. The crystal to detector distance was set to 270 mm. A total of 60 frames (1.5° oscillation per frame and 10-min exposure) were collected from a single NMC-A crystal. Data were processed with MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.W. Joint Collaborative Computing Project 4 and European Science Foundation-European Association of the Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and CCP4 (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) packages (TableI). The space group was P 21212 with cell parameters a = 77.48 Å, b = 52.69 Å, c = 67.10 Å. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was refined with the program X-PLOR, version 3.1 (15Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR , version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), applying a bulk solvent correction. A total of 5% of the reflections were randomly selected in order to provide a test set for the Rfree calculations (16Brünger A.T.

https://openalex.org/W1594039500,"The effects of the glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs) from Trypanosoma cruzi on T lymphocyte activation were investigated in a mouse T cell hybridoma (DO-11.10). Purified GIPLs from T. cruzi strains Y and G markedly increased IL-2 mRNA transcripts and IL-2 secretion induced by mitogenic anti-CD3 and anti-Thy1 mAbs. This costimulatory function was also revealed by the induction of IL-2 secretion after the simultaneous addition of the T. cruzi GIPLs and either the calcium ionophore A23187 or phorbol ester. The capacity of the GIPL molecule to induce an increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels was also demonstrated. After exposure of T cell hybridoma to GIPL, the nuclear transcription factor NFAT1 became partially dephosphory-lated, and its nuclear localization was demonstrated both in the T cell hybridoma and in Balb/c CD3+ cells. These results demonstrate that T. cruzi GIPL molecules are capable of signaling to T cells and therefore could be valuable tools for the study of T cell activation, besides playing a potential role in subverting the T lymphocyte immune response during T. cruzi infection.—Bellio, M., Oliveira, A.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2085128926,"Hypophosphatemia leads to an increase in type II Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-2) mRNA and protein levels in the kidney and increases renal phosphate reabsorption. Nuclear transcript run-on experiments showed that the effect of a low phosphate diet was post-transcriptional. In an in vitro degradation assay, renal proteins from hypophosphatemic rats stabilized the NaPi-2 transcript 6-fold compared with control rats and this was dependent upon an intact NaPi-2 3'-untranslated region (UTR). To determine an effect of hypophosphatemia upon NaPi-2 protein synthesis, the incorporation of injected [(35)S]methionine into renal proteins was studied in vivo. Hypophosphatemia led to increased [(35)S]methionine incorporation only into NaPi-2 protein. The effect of hypophosphatemia on translation was studied in an in vitro translation assay, where hypophosphatemic renal proteins led to increased translation of NaPi-2 and other transcripts. NaPi-2 RNA interaction with cytosolic proteins was studied by UV cross-linking and Northwestern gels. Hypophosphatemic proteins led to increased binding of renal cytosolic proteins to the 5'-UTR of NaPi-2 mRNA. Therefore, hypophosphatemia increases NaPi-2 gene expression post-transcriptionally, which correlates with a more stable transcript mediated by the 3'-UTR, and an increase in NaPi-2 translation involving protein binding to the 5'-UTR. These findings show that phosphate regulates gene expression by affecting protein-RNA interactions in vivo."
