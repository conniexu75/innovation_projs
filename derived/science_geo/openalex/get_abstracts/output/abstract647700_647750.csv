https://openalex.org/W3005835533,"Importance Clinical guidelines currently recommend against amyloid imaging for cognitively unimpaired persons. The goal of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention, together with advances in understanding the pathophysiology of AD, however, has led to trials testing drugs in cognitively unimpaired persons who show evidence of AD biomarkers. Assuming the eventual success of such trials, millions of patients will be affected. There is a need to understand the effects of biomarker disclosure on those individuals. Design The Study of Knowledge and Reactions to Amyloid Testing (SOKRATES) involved 2 semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who received amyloid PET scan results as part of screening for research participation. Post-disclosure interviews were conducted at 4 to 12 weeks and again 1 year later. Data were collected from November 5, 2014 to November 30, 2016. Interviews were transcribed and coded in NVivo 12.0. Participants 80 adults aged 65 and older: 50 who received and 30 who received amyloid PET scan results. Main outcomes Interviews examined four domains: (1) comprehension of the amyloid PET scan result; (2) implications of the result for sense of self, memory, and future; (3) sharing of results with others; and (4) AD risk-reduction behaviors. Results Participants who received an elevated amyloid PET scan result viewed the result as more serious and sensitive than other medical test results given its unique implications for identity, self-determination, and stigma. In contrast, participants who received a not-elevated amyloid PET scan result described feeling relief and reinterpreted perceived memory impairments as normal aging. Participants with elevated amyloid reported contemplating and making more changes to health behaviors and future plans than their peers with not-elevated amyloid. Conclusions Clinical practice in the diagnosis and treatment of persons with preclinical AD, a stage of the disease defined by the presence of biomarkers in the absence of cognitive impairment, will need to address matters of identity, stigma, and life-planning."
https://openalex.org/W3006243445,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation plays a critical role in regulating transcript levels in the cell and is a major control point for modulating gene expression. In yeast and other model organisms, codon identity is a powerful determinant of transcript stability, contributing broadly to impact half-lives. General principles governing mRNA stability are poorly understood in mammalian systems. Importantly, however, the degradation machinery is highly conserved, thus it seems logical that mammalian transcript half-lives would also be strongly influenced by coding determinants. Herein we characterize the contribution of coding sequence towards mRNA decay in human and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. In agreement with previous studies, we observed that synonymous codon usage impacts mRNA stability in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, however, we also observe that the amino acid content of a gene is an additional determinant correlating with transcript stability. The impact of codon and amino acid identity on mRNA decay appears to be associated with underlying tRNA and intracellular amino acid concentrations. Accordingly, genes of similar physiological function appear to coordinate their mRNA stabilities in part through codon and amino acid content. Together, these results raise the possibility that intracellular tRNA and amino acid levels interplay to mediate coupling between translational elongation and mRNA degradation rate in mammals."

The evaluation of nutritional status is important, but there is no universally accepted screen methodology.We aimed to use the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) for evaluating the effect of premorbid undernutrition on short-term outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.A total of 1,906 patients were included for analysis. Baseline characteristics were collected. We evaluated the nutritional status of the patients using the GNRI and body mass index(BMI). The GNRI was calculated as {1.519×serum albumin(g/dL) + 41.7×present weight (kg)/ideal body weight (kg)}. All patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the GNRI score.Among the included patients, 546 patients had an unfavorable outcomes. The proportion of patients with moderate and severe risk, assessed in GNRI, was significantly higher in the unfavorable outcome group compared to the favorable outcome group (33.3% vs 15.0%). The increased risk of premorbid undernutrition was associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcome in a dose-response manner after adjusting for covariates.This study demonstrated that GNRI was associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. GNRI may be used to screen patients at high risk for unfavorable outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3006555414,"The emergence of pre-extensively and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (Pre-XDR/XDR-TB) is the major hurdle for TB prevention and care programs especially in developing countries like Ethiopia. The less emphasis on universal access to laboratory techniques for the rapid diagnosis of TB and drug susceptibility testing (DST) makes the management of MDR-TB a challenge. Early detection of second line anti-TB drugs resistance is essential to reduce transmission of Pre-XDR/XDR-TB strains and adjusting the treatment regimen in MDR-TB.To determine the prevalence and resistance pattern of Pre-XDR- and XDR-TB among MDR-TB patients in the Amhara region, Ethiopia.A cross sectional study was carried out in nine MDR-TB treatment centers in the Amhara region. Sputum samples were collected from all pulmonary rifampicin resistant (RR) or MDR-TB patients prior to anti-TB treatment. Lӧwenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture, Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) smear, MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays were performed according to the standard procedures. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 software. Chi-square and/or Fishers exact test was employed.Overall, 6.3% of MDR-TB isolates were resistant to at least one second line drugs. Pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB isolates accounted 5.7% and 0.6% respectively. Moreover, 3.4% were resistant to FQs and 3.4% were resistant to second line injectable drugs. All isolates were susceptible for low level kanamycin. Almost all pre-XDR-TB strains (90%) were previously treated with anti-TB drugs. Drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were disproportionately distributed in districts of the Amhara region and the majorities were concentrated in urban areas.The high proportion of MDR-TB patients resistant to at least one second line drug is alarming. Strengthening the laboratory facilities to monitor pre-XDR and XDR-TB patients is crucial. The TB programs need to give emphasis on the effective and rational use of second line drugs for newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients to prevent the emergence of pre-XDR/XDR-TB strains."
https://openalex.org/W3006238154,"There is emerging consensus that Grit's two facets-perseverance of effort and consistency of interest-are best understood as facets of the Big Five dimension of Conscientiousness. However, an in-depth investigation on whether Grit's facet offer any added value over more established facets of Conscientiousness is absent from the literature. In the present study, we investigated whether Grit's facets are empirically distinguishable from three facets of Conscientiousness as conceived in the well-validated Big-Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2), namely, Organization, Responsibility, Productiveness. Moreover, we investigated whether Grit's facets show different (and possibly stronger) associations than the facets of Conscientiousness with a broad set of external criteria (age, educational attainment, monthly income, life satisfaction, mental and physical health, fluid and crystallized intelligence); as well as whether the criterion correlations of Grit's facets are incremental over Conscientiousness. Findings from two latent-variable models in a large and diverse sample (N = 1,244) indicated that the facets of Grit showed moderate to strong relationships related to each other and to the three Conscientiousness facets of the BFI-2 (.41 ≤ r ≤ .94). Grit-Perseverance was almost indistinguishable from the Productiveness facet of Conscientiousness, whereas Grit-Consistency appeared to capture something unique beyond the Conscientiousness facets. The relationships with external criteria of Grit's facets were similar in direction and size to those of the Conscientiousness facets. The results give further purchase to the view that Grit's facets can be subsumed under the Conscientiousness domain."
https://openalex.org/W3006477896,"To evaluate whether if ultrasonography (US)-based radiomics enables prediction of the presence of BRAFV600E mutations among patients diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcninoma (PTC).From December 2015 to May 2017, 527 patients who had been treated surgically for PTC were included (training: 387, validation: 140). All patients had BRAFV600E mutation analysis performed on surgical specimen. Feature extraction was performed using preoperative US images of the 527 patients (mean size of PTC: 16.4mm±7.9, range, 10-85 mm). A Radiomics Score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Univariable/multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors including Radiomics Score in predicting BRAFV600E mutation. Subgroup analysis including conventional PTC <20-mm (n = 389) was performed (training: 280, validation: 109).Of the 527 patients diagnosed with PTC, 428 (81.2%) were positive and 99 (18.8%) were negative for BRAFV600E mutation. In both total 527 cancers and 389 conventional PTC<20-mm, Radiomics Score was the single factor showing significant association to the presence of BRAFV600E mutation on multivariable analysis (all P<0.05). C-statistics for the validation set in the total cancers and the conventional PTCs<20-mm were lower than that of the training set: 0.629 (95% CI: 0.516-0.742) to 0.718 (95% CI: 0.650-0.786), and 0.567 (95% CI: 0.434-0.699) to 0.729 (95% CI: 0.632-0.826), respectively.Radiomics features extracted from US has limited value as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting the presence of BRAFV600E mutation status of PTC regardless of size."
https://openalex.org/W3005661593,"Cardiac perfusion PET is increasingly used to assess ischemia and cardiovascular risk and can also provide quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) and flow reserve (MBFR) values. These have been shown to be prognostic biomarkers of adverse outcomes, yet MBF and MBFR quantification remains underutilized in clinical settings. We compare MBFR to traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a large and diverse clinical population (60% African-American, 35.3% Caucasian) to rank its relative contribution to cardiovascular outcomes. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including unstable angina, non-ST and ST-elevation myocardial infarction, stroke, and death, were assessed for consecutive patients who underwent rest-dipyridamole stress 82Rb PET cardiac imaging from 2012–2015 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (n = 1283, mean follow-up 2.3 years). Resting MBF (1.1 ± 0.4 ml/min/g) was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. MBFR (2.1 ± 0.8) was independently and inversely associated with MACE. Furthermore, MBFR was more strongly associated with MACE than both traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of perfusion defects in regression analysis. Decision tree analysis identified MBFR as superior to established cardiovascular risk factors in predicting outcomes. Incorporating resting MBF and MBFR in CAD assessment may improve clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3005973505,"Global changes in climate and land use are occurring at an unprecedented rate, often triggering drastic shifts in plant communities. This study aims to reconstruct the changes that occurred over 35 years in the plant communities of temperate bogs subjected to indirect human-induced disturbances. In 2015–17, we resurveyed the vascular flora of 76 plots located in 16 bogs of southern Québec (Canada) first sampled in 1982. We evaluated changes in species richness, frequency of occurrence and abundance, while considering species shade-tolerance and preferential habitat. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and evaluated differences between the two surveys using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. We found a significant increase in species richness and beta diversity over the last 35 years associated with major species turnovers, indicating a biotic differentiation of the Sphagnum-bog plant communities. These changes were mostly associated with an increase in the abundance and frequency of shade-tolerant and facultative species, suggesting a global phenomenon of woody encroachment. Because the observed changes occurred in a few decades on sites free of in situ human disturbances, we suggest that they were likely induced by the synergic effect of the agricultural drainage occurring in the surrounding mineral soils, climate warming, and nitrogen atmospheric depositions. We also believe that further changes are to be expected, as the triggering factors persist. Finally, our results highlight the need for increased bog conservation or restauration efforts. Indeed, a rise in beta diversity due to the introduction of nearby terrestrial species could induce biotic homogenization of the bog flora with that of surrounding habitats and ultimately impoverish the regional species pool."
https://openalex.org/W3006141853,"Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of neonatal deaths. Malawi has high rates of preterm birth, with 18.1 preterm births per 100 live births. More than 50% of preterm neonates develop respiratory distress which if left untreated, can lead to respiratory failure and death. Term and preterm neonates with respiratory distress can often be effectively managed with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and this is considered an essential intervention for the management of preterm neonates by the World Health Organization. Bubble CPAP may represent a safe and cost-effective method for delivering CPAP in low-income settings.The study explored the factors that influence the implementation of bubble CPAP among health care professionals in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Malawi.This was a qualitative study conducted in three district hospitals and a tertiary hospital in southern Malawi. We conducted 46 in-depth interviews with nurses, clinicians and clinical supervisors, from June to August 2018. All data were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed.Factors that influenced implementation of bubble CPAP occurred in an interconnected manner and included: inadequate healthcare provider training in preparation for use, rigid division of roles and responsibilities among providers, lack of effective communication among providers and between providers and newborn's caregivers, human resource constraints, and inadequate equipment and infrastructure.There are provider, caregiver and health system level factors that influence the implementation of bubble CPAP among neonates in Malawian health facilities. Ensuring adequate staffing in the nurseries, combined with ongoing training for providers, team cohesion, improved communication with caregivers, and improved hospital infrastructure would ensure optimal utilization of bubble CPAP and avoid inadvertent harm from inappropriate use."
https://openalex.org/W3005917297,"Objective In the present study, we aimed to determine whether pregravid obesity independently predicts increased risks of perinatal complications following in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the weight loss goals to reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study. Population All pregnancies after first the fresh IVF cycle from January 2014 to December 2016 in the Reproductive Center affiliated to Shandong University were reviewed. A total of 3,962 eligible singleton births were stratified into cohorts based on the body mass index (BMI) definitions of the Working Group on Obesity in China (WGOC). Main outcome measures Adverse perinatal outcomes. Results Pregravid overweight and obesity were associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE), polyhydramnios, preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), placental abruption, preterm birth (PTB) <37 weeks, caesarean section (CS), fetal macrosomia, large for gestational age (LGA) >90th percentile, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and congenital anomalies as compared with the normal-weight group after adjustment of differences in age, parity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). The increased risks of PPROM, NRDS and congenital anomalies were eliminated after adjustment of GDM development, whereas the increased risk of NRDS disappeared after adjustment of HDP. Placenta previa was not significantly different between the obese group and reference group (REF). Moreover, the rates of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), PTB<32 weeks, small for gestational age (SGA) >90th percentile and perinatal mortality were also not significantly different between above-mentioned two groups. For obese women, a 10%-15% reduction in prepregnancy BMI was associated with significantly decreased risks of GH, CS and fetal macrosomia. For overweight women, just a 5% reduction in BMI could significantly reduce the risks of GDM, CS and fetal macrosomia. Conclusions Pregravid obesity could independently predict a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes after adjustment of differences in maternal age, parity, PCOS, and type of COH in IVF pregnancies. The potential mechanism that obesity potentiated the risks of some poor perinantal outcomes might occur through the development of GDM and HDP. A 10%-15% reduction in pregravid BMI for obese women and a 5% reduction for overweight women were associated with a significant reduction of poor perinatal complications."
https://openalex.org/W3006291031,"A fluorescence marker mOrange was inserted to the popular pLentiCrispr-V2 to create pLentiCrispr-V2-mOrange (V2mO) that contained both a puromycin selection and a fluorescent marker, making viral production and target transduction visible. Lentiviruses packaged with this plasmid and appropriate guide RNAs (gRNAs) successfully knocked out the genes RhoA, Gli1, and Gal3 in human gastric cancer cell lines. Cas9-gRNA editing efficiency could be estimated directly from Sanger electropherograms of short polymerase chain reaction products around the gRNA regions in Cas9-gRNA transduced cells. Single cloning of transduced target cell pools must be performed to establish stable knockout clones. Rescue of wildtype (RhoA and Gal3) and mutant (RhoA.Y42C) genes into knockout cells was successful only when cDNAs, where gRNAs bind, were modified by three nucleotides while the amino acid sequences remained unchanged. Stringent on-target CRISPR/Cas9 editing was observed in Gal3 gene, but not in RhoA gene since RhoA.Y42C already presented a nucleotide change in gRNA5 binding site. In summary, our improved strategy added these advantages: adding visual marker to the popular lentiviral system, monitoring lentiviral production and transduction efficiencies, cell-sorting Cas9+ cells in target cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, direct estimation of gene editing efficiency of target cell pools by short PCR electropherograms around gRNA binding sites, and successful rescue of wildtype and mutant genes in knockout cells, overcoming Cas9 editing by modifying cDNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3006618135,"Background The prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is poorly described overall and in women living with HIV (WLWH) and HIV-negative women living in Botswana, a high HIV and cervical cancer-burden country. We conducted a pilot study of self-collection and high-risk HPV testing for cervical screening, from which data on HPV prevalence was available. Methods From five health facilities in the Kweneng East District, 1,022 women aged 30–49 years were enrolled to self-collect their cervicovaginal specimen for hrHPV testing by the Xpert HPV Test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Crude and age group-adjusted hrHPV prevalence by HIV status were calculated, and the relationship of hrHPV risk groups HPV16>HPV18/45>other hrHPV types) to the presence and severity of visible lesions. Results Of the 1,022 women enrolled, 1,019 (99.7%), 570 WLWH and 449 HIV-negative women, had hrHPV testing results. Crude hrHPV prevalences were 25.2% (95%CI = 21.2–29.4%) for HIV-negative women and 40.4% (95%CI = 36.3–44.5%) for WLWH. Age group-adjusted hrHPV prevalences were 23.7% (95%CI = 19.9–27.9%) for HIV-negative women and 41.3% (95%CI = 37.2–45.4%) for WLWH. Age group-adjusted prevalences of HPV16 (p<0.001), HPV18/45 (p<0.001), HPV31/33/35/52/58 (p<0.001), and HPV39/56/66/68 (p = 0.011) were greater among WLWH than HIV-negative women. Riskier hrHPV groups were more likely to have visible abnormalities (ptrend = 0.004) and visible abnormalities not eligible for cryotherapy (ptrend = 0.030). Conclusions hrHPV infection was common among all women in the study living in Botswana, to a greater extent in WLWH than their HIV-negative counterparts. Strategies to triage hrHPV-positive women will be needed to avoid over-treating many women with benign hrHPV infections."
https://openalex.org/W3005537905,"Bioirrigation has been defined as the transfer of hydraulically lifted water by a deep-rooted plant to a neighbouring shallow-rooted plant which cannot access deep soil moisture. In this study, we tested if facilitative effects of bioirrigation or the competition for water dominate the interaction of two intercropped plants—deep-rooted pigeon pea (PP) and shallow-rooted finger millet (FM) before and during a drought. Additionally, we tested how the presence of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN) affects the balance between facilitative (i.e. bioirrigation) and competitive interactions between two intercropping species. Our results show that PP can indeed promote the water relations of FM during a drought event. Specifically, stomatal conductance in FM controls dropped to low values of 27.1 to 33.6 mmol m-2s-1, while FM in intercropping treatments were able to maintain its stomatal conductance at 60 mmol m-2s-1. In addition, the presence of PP reduced the drought-induced foliar damage and mortality of FM. The observed facilitative effects of PP on FM were partially enhanced by the presence of a CMN. In contrast to the facilitative effects under drought, PP exerted strong competitive effects on FM before the onset of drought. This hindered growth and biomass production of FM when intercropped with PP, an effect that was even enhanced in the presence of a CMN. The results from our study thus indicate that in intercropping, deep-rooted plants may act as ""bioirrigators"" for shallow-rooted crops and that a CMN can promote these facilitative effects. However, the interspecific competition between the intercropped plants under conditions of abundant moisture supply can be strong and are enhanced by the presence of a CMN. In more general terms, our study shows that the extent by which the antagonistic effects of facilitation and competition are expressed in an intercropping system strongly depends on the availability of resources, which in the case of the present study was water and the presence of biotic interactions (i.e. the presence of a CMN)."
https://openalex.org/W3005761987,"Background The plenteous resistance to and undesirable consequences of the existing antipiroplasmic therapies have emphasized the urgent need for new chemotherapeutics and drug targets for both prophylaxis and chemotherapy. Hydroxyurea (HYD) is an antineoplastic agent with antitrypanosomal activity. Eflornithine (α-difluoro-methyl ornithine, DFMO) is the best choice therapy for the treatment of late-stage Gambian human African trypanosomiasis. Methods In this study, the inhibitory and combination efficacy of HYD and DFMO with existing babesicidal drugs (diminazene aceturate (DA), atovaquone (ATV), and clofazimine (CLF)) deoxyribonucleotide in vitro against the multiplication of Babesia and Theileria. As well as, their chemotherapeutic effects were assessed on B. microti strain that infects rodents. The Cell Counting Kits-8 (CCK-8) test was used to examine their cytotoxicity on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF), mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3), and Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Findings HYD and DFMO suppressed the multiplication of all tested species (B. bigemina, B. bovis, B. caballi, B. divergens, and T. equi) in a dose-related manner. HFF, NIH/3T3, or MDBK cell viability was not influenced by DFMO at 1000 μM, while HYD affected the MDBK cell viability at EC50 value of 887.5±14.4 μM. The in vitro combination treatments of DFMO and HYD with CLF, DA, and ATV exhibited synergistic and additive efficacy toward all tested species. The in vivo experiment revealed that HYD and DFMO oral administration at 100 and 50 mg/kg inhibited B. microti multiplication in mice by 60.1% and 78.2%, respectively. HYD-DA and DFMO-DA combined treatments showed higher chemotherapeutic efficacy than their monotherapies. Conclusion These results indicate the prospects of HYD and DFMO as drug candidates for piroplasmosis treatment, when combined mainly with DA, ATV, and CLF. Therefore, further studies are needed to combine HYD or DFMO with either ATV or CLF and examine their impact on B. microti infection in mice."

The present study aimed to investigate the roles of IL-17A and IL-18 in periodontitis and DM by measuring salivary and serum levels, respectively.A total of 49 participants with type 2 DM and 25 control subjects without type 2 DM were recruited. A periodontal screening and recording (PSR) index (0, 1-2, 3, and 4) was used to classify whether these subjects had periodontitis. Salivary and serum IL-17A and IL-18 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between these cytokines and clinical parameters.Salivary IL-17A levels were not significantly different between patients with DM and controls, however, the levels were significantly higher in controls with periodontitis than those without periodontitis (p = 0.031). Salivary IL-17A levels were significantly associated with the PSR index (β = 0.369, p = 0.011). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed the association of salivary IL-18 levels and fasting plasma glucose (β = 0.270, p = 0.022) whereas serum IL-18 levels were associated with HbA1C (β = 0.293, p = 0.017). No correlation between salivary and serum levels of IL-17A and IL-18 was found.Salivary IL-17A was strongly associated with periodontitis, whereas salivary IL-18 was associated with FPG and serum IL-18 was associated with HbA1C. These results suggest the role of these cytokines in periodontal inflammation and DM."
https://openalex.org/W3006203636,"Kyoto University Substance (KUS) 121, an ATPase inhibitor of valosin-containing protein, is a novel neuroprotectant. We tested the safety and effectiveness of KUS121 in patients with acute central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). We conducted an investigator-initiated, first-in-humans, phase 1/2 clinical trial. Nine patients with non-arteritic CRAO symptoms lasting for 4-48 h were enrolled. These patients received daily intravitreal injections of KUS121 for 3 days: 25 μg (low-dose) in the first three patients and 50 μg (high-dose) in the next six patients. The primary endpoint was the safety of the drug. As a secondary endpoint, pharmacokinetics was evaluated. Other key secondary endpoints were changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart, visual field scores, and retinal sensitivities between baseline and week 12; and decimal BCVA at week 12. Administration of KUS121 did not result in serious adverse events. All nine patients (100%) showed significant improvement of BCVA. Average readable letter counts, visual field scores, and retinal sensitivities also improved. Decimal BCVA at week 12 was better than 0.1 in four patients (44%) and equal to or better than 0.05 in seven patients (78%). This first-in-humans clinical trial provides support for the safety and efficacy of intravitreal KUS121 injection. To substantiate the safety and effectiveness for patients with acute CRAO, further larger scale clinical studies will be needed."
https://openalex.org/W3005754804,"The goal of our ongoing research is to identify strengths and weaknesses of high school level science fair and improvements that can help science educators make science fair a more effective, inclusive and equitable learning experience. In this paper, we confirm and extend our previous findings in several important ways. We added new questions to our anonymous and voluntary surveys to learn the extent to which students had an interest in science or engineering careers and if science fair participation increased their interest in science or engineering. And we surveyed a national rather than regional high school student group by incorporating our survey into the Scienteer online portal now used by Texas and some other states for science fair registration, parental consent, and project management. We learned that about ~60% of the more than 300 students in the national cohorts completing surveys in 2017 and 2018 said that they were interested in a career in science or engineering, and ~60% said that participating in science fair increased their interest in science or engineering. About two-thirds of the students were required to participate in science fair, and that requirement reduced the frequency of students who said that science fair increased their interest. In the worst case, ~10% of the students who said that they were not interested in a career in science or engineering and who were required to participate in science fair engaged in research misconduct (i.e., plagiarism and making up their results). Students’ positive comments about competition in science fair focused on the competition incentive, whereas their positive comments about science fair that was non-competitive focused on learning about the scientific process and learning in general. We discuss the findings in the context of National Science Teaching Association guidance about voluntary science fair participation and begin to identify features of science fair practice consistent with increased student interest in the sciences or engineering."

Factors associated with stroke among hypertensive patients are not consistent across different studies and there are limited studies particularly to hypertensive stroke in the particular setting. This study aimed to assess factors associated with stroke among patients with hypertension in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia, in 2018. Methods Hospital-based case-control study was conducted from February to April 2018. Cases were adult hypertensive patients with stroke and controls were adult hypertensive patients without a stroke. Cases and controls were identified from the patient’s card review. Using a systematic random sampling technique 89 cases and 356 controls were included in this study. Record review, physical measurement, and interview techniques were used to collect data. Data was entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 23. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression were selected for multivariable logistic regression. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to determine the association. P-value <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results The mean age of cases and controls were 56.3 years (SD±13.53) and 51.9 years (SD±12.67) respectively. Lost to follow-up (AOR = 2.474, 95%CI: 1.368–4.929), alcohol drinking (AOR = 2.440, 95%CI: 1.291–4.613), use of excessive salt in diet (AOR = 3.249, 95%CI: (1.544–6.837), medication non-adherence (AOR = 3.967, 95%CI: 2.256–6.973), uncontrolled systolic blood pressure, (AOR = 3.196, 95%CI: 1.60–6.382), uncontrolled diastolic blood pressure (AOR = 2.204, 95%CI: 1.130–4.297) and high cholesterol level (AOR = 2.413, 95%CI: 1.319–4.414) were found to be significant factors. Conclusion Lost to follow-up, alcohol drinking, uses of excessive salt in diet, medication non-adherence, and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with stroke. Health education on lifestyle practices and hypertension-related complications in each follow-up visit is very essential for improving the primary stroke prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3005871084,"The alcohol withdrawal syndrome increases autonomic activation and stress in patients during detoxification, leading to alterations in motor activity and sleep irregularities. Intranasal oxytocin has been proposed as a possible treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. The aim of the present study was to explore whether actigraphy could be used as a tool to register symptoms during alcohol detoxification, whether oxytocin affected actigraphy variables related to motor activity and sleep compared to placebo during detoxification, and whether actigraphy-recorded motor function during detoxification was different from that in healthy controls.This study was a part of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 40 patients with alcohol use disorder admitted for acute detoxification were included. Of these, 20 received insufflations with intranasal oxytocin and 20 received placebo. Outcomes were actigraphy-recorded motor activity during 5-hour sequences following the insufflations and a full 24-hour period, as well as actigraphy-recorded sleep. Results were related to clinical variables of alcohol intake and withdrawal, including self-reported sleep. Finally, the actigraphy results were compared to those in a group of 34 healthy individuals.There were no significant differences between the oxytocin group and the placebo group for any of actigraphy variables registered. Neither were there any correlations between actigraphy-recorded motor function and clinical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, but there was a significant association between self-reported and actigraphy-recorded sleep. Compared to healthy controls, motor activity during alcohol withdrawal was lower in the evenings and showed increased variability.Intranasal oxytocin did not affect actigraphy-recorded motor activity nor sleep in patients with acute alcohol withdrawal. There were no findings indicating that actigraphy can be used to evaluate the degree of withdrawal symptoms during detoxification. However, patients undergoing acute alcohol withdrawal had a motor activity pattern different from than in healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W3005910597,"Objective Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their first opioid. Methods A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424 patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365 days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. Results We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score, derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15–29, medical history of substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for predicting opioid use disorder. Conclusions CROUD could be used by clinicians to obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for contraindication or to restrict utilization."

The burden of neonatal AKI is not known in Tanzania despite having high neonatal mortality. This study was conducted to determine the burden of AKI among critically ill neonates admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital.This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the neonatal ward at the MNH. Eligible critically ill neonates were recruited consecutively between October 2017 and March 2018. Data was collected using a standardized structured questionnaire. Blood specimen was drawn to measure baseline creatinine at admission, 48th hour, 72nd hour and 14th day. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20.0 Univariate analysis was done using chi-square to determine the association between categorical variables and multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of AKI.A total of 378 critically ill neonates were recruited, 31.5% had AKI and independent predictors of AKI were noted to be neonatal sepsis (aOR 2.237, 95%CI 1.3-3.6, P = 0.001), severe pneumonia (aOR3.0, 95%CI 1.0-9.3, P = 0.047) and use of gentamycin (aOR6.8, 95%CI 1.3-9.3, P = 0.02). Complete resolution of renal dysfunction at the fourteenth day was seen in 83.1% of the neonates while 16.9% had persistence of renal dysfunction. Ultrasound scan were performed among 105 participants with AKI revealed increased echogenicity, mild hydronephrosis and ectopic kidneys in 25 (23.8%), 4 (3.8%) and 2 (1.9%) respectively. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among neonates with AKI (70.6%) as compared to those without (29.4%) p< 0.001.AKI was noted in a third of critically ill neonates, with neonatal sepsis, severe pneumonia and use of gentamycin as independent predictors of AKI. Neonates who suffered AKI had twice as much mortality as compared to those without."
https://openalex.org/W3005557077,"The development of new antimicrobial peptides has become an attractive alternative to conventional antibiotics due to the increasing rates of microbial drug resistance. Ib-M corresponds to a family of cationic synthetic peptides, 20 amino acids in length, that have shown inhibitory effect against the non-pathogenic strain Escherichia coli K-12. This work evaluated the antimicrobial potential of Ib-M peptides against the pathogenic E. coli O157: H7 using a reference strain and a clinical isolate. The Ib-M peptides showed antibacterial activity against both strains of E. coli O157: H7; the minimum inhibitory concentration of Ib-M peptides ranged from 1.6 to 12.5 μM and the minimum bactericidal concentration ranged from 3.7 to 22.9 μM, being Ib-M1 and Ib-M2 the peptides that presented the highest inhibitory effect. Time-kill kinetics assay showed a reduction of the bacterial population by more than 95% after 4 hours of exposure to 1xMIC of Ib-M1. Low cytotoxicity was observed in VERO cells with 50% cytotoxic concentration in the range from 197.5 to more than 400 μM. All peptides showed a random structure in hydrophilic environments, except Ib-M1, and all of them transitioned to an α-helical structure when the hydrophobicity of the medium was increased. In conclusion, these findings support the in vitro antimicrobial effect of Ib-M peptides against the pathogenic bacteria E. coli O157: H7 and prove to be promising molecules for the development of new therapeutic alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W3005636948,"The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of human cryptosporidiosis in Québec from 2016 to 2017 and to identify possible exposures associated with the disease, and the dominant Cryptosporidium species in circulation. A descriptive analysis was performed on data collected from the provincial notifiable infectious diseases registry and the epidemiological investigation. Fecal sample were sent to the Laboratoire de santé publique du Québec for molecular characterization. In Québec, from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, a total of 201 confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis were notified. A peak in the number of reported cases was observed at the end of the summer. The regional public health department with the highest adjusted incidence rate for sex and age group for both years was that of Nunavik, in the north of Québec. A higher average annual incidence rate was observed for females between the ages of 20 to 34 years compared to males. Overall, for both males and females the distribution appeared to be bimodal with a first peak in children younger than five years old and a second peak in adults from 20 to 30 years of age. Molecular characterization showed that 23% (11/47) of cases were infected with C. hominis while 74% (35/47) were infected with C. parvum. Meanwhile, subtyping results identified by gp60 sequencing, show that all C. parvum subtypes belonged to the IIa family, whereas the subtypes for C. hominis belonged to the Ia, Ib, and Id families. Finally, the epidemiological investigation showed that diarrhea was the most common reported symptom with 99% (72/73) of investigated cases having experienced it. This first brief epidemiological portrait of cryptosporidiosis in Québec has allowed for the description, both at the provincial and regional level, of the populations that could be particularly vulnerable to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3005775962,"Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive lung disease with poor prognosis due to the consequent right heart ventricular failure. Pulmonary artery remodeling and dysfunction are culprits for pathologically increased pulmonary arterial pressure, but their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Previous genome-wide association studies revealed a significant correlation between the genetic locus of family with sequence similarity 13, member A (FAM13A) and various lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis; however whether FAM13A is also involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension remained unknown. Here, we identified a significant role of FAM13A in the development of pulmonary hypertension. FAM13A expression was reduced in the lungs of mice with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. We identified that FAM13A was expressed in lung vasculatures, especially in endothelial cells. Genetic loss of FAM13A exacerbated pulmonary hypertension in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia in association with deteriorated pulmonary artery remodeling. Mechanistically, FAM13A decelerated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition potentially by inhibiting β-catenin signaling in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Our data revealed a protective role of FAM13A in the development of pulmonary hypertension, and therefore increasing and/or preserving FAM13A expression in pulmonary artery endothelial cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3006065081,"Objectives To examine and compare changes in strength and physical function from pre- to post-diagnosis among men with prostate cancer (PC, [cases]) and matched non-cancer controls identified from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Materials and methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 2 strength and 3 physical function-based measures among both cases and controls, identified from a large cohort of community living older adults enrolled in the Health ABC study. We plotted trajectories for each measure and compared cases vs. controls from the point of diagnosis onwards using mixed-effects regression models. For cases only, we examined predictors of poor strength or physical function. Results We identified 117 PC cases and 453 matched non-cancer controls (50% African Americans). At baseline, there were no differences between cases and controls in demographic factors, comorbidities or self-reported physical function; however, cases had slightly better grip strength (44.6 kg vs. 41.0 kg, p<0.01), quadriceps strength (360.5 Nm vs. 338.7 Nm, p = 0.02) and Health ABC physical performance battery scores (2.4 vs. 2.3, p = 0.01). All men experienced similar declines in strength and physical function over an equivalent amount of time. The loss of quad strength was most notable, with losses of nearly two-thirds of baseline strength over approximately 7 years of follow up. Conclusions Among both cases and controls, strength and physical function decline with increasing age. The largest declines were seen in lower body strength. Regular assessments should guide lifestyle interventions that can offset age- and treatment-related declines among men with PC."
https://openalex.org/W3006210609,"The global nephrology workforce is shrinking and, in many countries, is unable to meet healthcare needs. Accurate data pertaining to human resources in nephrology in South Africa is lacking. This data is critical for the planning and delivery of renal services and the training of nephrologists in South Africa to meet the challenge of the growing burden of chronic kidney disease.A cross-sectional study of adult and paediatric nephrologists currently delivering nephrology services in South Africa was conducted. Participants were identified using various data sources, including the register of the Health Professions Council of South Africa. This cohort of doctors was described in terms of their demographics and distribution. A survey was then conducted among these nephrologists to collect additional information on their training, scope of practice, job satisfaction, challenges and future plans. Finally, two focus group interviews were conducted to probe themes identified from the survey data.A total of 120 adult nephrologists and 22 paediatric nephrologists were identified (an overall density of 2.5 per million population). There is a male predominance (66%) and the median age is 45 years. The bulk of the workforce (128 nephrologists, 92%) is distributed in three of the nine South African provinces, and two provinces have no nephrologist at all. The survey was completed by 57% of the nephrologists. Most reported positive attitudes to their chosen profession; however, 35 nephrologists (43%) reported an excessive workload, 9 (11%) were planning emigration and 15 (19%) were planning early retirement. A higher frequency of dissatisfaction regarding remuneration (39% vs. 15%) and unsatisfactory work conditions (35% vs. 13%) was observed amongst nephrologists working in the public sector compared to the private sector. A total of 13 nephrologists participated in the focus group interviews. The themes which were identified included that of a rewarding profession, an overall shortage of nephrologists, poor career planning, a need for changes to nephrologists' training, excessive workloads with inadequate remuneration, and challenging work environments.There are insufficient numbers of nephrologists in South Africa, with a markedly uneven distribution amongst the provinces and healthcare sectors. Qualitative data indicate that South African nephrologists are faced with the challenges of a high workload, obstructive policies and unsatisfactory remuneration. In the public sector, a chronic lack of nephrologist posts and other resources are additional challenges. A substantial proportion of the workforce is contemplating emigration."
https://openalex.org/W3006316950,"Chemical modifications that regulate protein expression at the translational level are emerging as vital components of the cellular stress response. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are significant targets for methyl-based modifications, which are catalyzed by tRNA methyltransferases (Trms). Here, Saccharomyces cerevisiae served as a model eukaryote system to investigate the role of 2'-O-ribose tRNA methylation in the cell's response to oxidative stress. Using 2'-O-ribose deletion mutants for trms 3, 7, 13, and 44, in acute and chronic exposure settings, we demonstrate a broad cell sensitivity to oxidative stress-inducing toxicants (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, rotenone, and acetic acid). A global analysis of hydrogen peroxide-induced tRNA modifications shows a complex profile of decreased, or undetectable, 2'-O-ribose modification events in 2’-O-ribose trm mutant strains, providing a critical link between this type of modification event and Trm status post-exposure. Based on the pronounced oxidative stress sensitivity observed for trm7 mutants, we used a bioinformatic tool to identify transcripts as candidates for regulation by Trm7-catalyzed modifications (i.e., enriched in UUC codons decoded by tRNAPheGmAA). This screen identified transcripts linked to diverse biological processes that promote cellular recovery after oxidative stress exposure, including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and nutrient acquisition (i.e., CRT10, HIR3, HXT2, and GNP1); moreover, these mutants were also oxidative stress-sensitive. Together, these results solidify a role for TRM3, 7, 13, and 44, in the cellular response to oxidative stress, and implicate 2'-O-ribose tRNA modification as an epitranscriptomic strategy for oxidative stress recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3006586250,"Although their functional outcomes remain largely unknown, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) may interact with adipokines, especially leptin and adiponectin, to modify the risk of colorectal cancer. We conducted a prospective study of 375 colorectal cancer cases and 750 matched controls to examine the effects of SNPs in the FTO, either alone or in interaction with pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels. Using a conditional logistic regression model, we obtained odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of colorectal cancer. Seven SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium demonstrated a similarly positive association with colorectal cancer, and most evidently for rs1558902, rs8050136, rs3751812, and rs9939609 (Ptrend = 0.02). Of interest, we observed a statistically significant interaction of rs8050136 with plasma total adiponectin levels (Pinteraction = 0.03). Compared to non-carriers in the lowest quintile of plasma total adiponectin, A allele carriers in the same quintile showed a considerably elevated risk of colorectal cancer, with a body mass index-adjusted OR of 2.54 (95% CI, 1.36–4.75). This investigation of the interaction between SNPs in the FTO and pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels has revealed the importance of both genetic and hormonal factors associated with adiposity in colorectal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3006630724,"Prediction and early detection of kidney damage induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) would provide the best chances of maximizing the anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing the risk of kidney damage. Unfortunately, biomarkers for detecting NSAID-induced kidney damage in cats remain to be discovered. To identify potential urinary biomarkers for monitoring NSAID-based treatments, we applied an untargeted metabolomics approach to urine collected from cats treated repeatedly with meloxicam or saline for up to 17 days. Applying multivariate analysis, this study identified a panel of seven metabolites that discriminate meloxicam treated from saline treated cats. Combining artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms and an independent testing urinary metabolome data set from cats with meloxicam-induced kidney damage, a panel of metabolites was identified and validated. The panel of metabolites including tryptophan, tyrosine, taurine, threonic acid, pseudouridine, xylitol and lyxitol, successfully distinguish meloxicam-treated and saline-treated cats with up to 75–100% sensitivity and specificity. This panel of urinary metabolites may prove a useful and non-invasive diagnostic tool for monitoring potential NSAID induced kidney injury in feline patients and may act as the framework for identifying urine biomarkers of NSAID induced injury in other species."
https://openalex.org/W3005542863,"Background Elderly patients with glioblastoma and an accumulation of negative prognostic factors have an extremely short survival. There is no consensus on the clinical management of these patients and many may escape histologically verified diagnosis. The primary aim of this study was to characterize this particular subgroup of patients with radiological glioblastoma diagnosis without histological verification. The secondary aim was to evaluate if oncological therapy was of benefit. Methods Between November 2012 and June 2016, all consecutive patients presenting with a suspected glioblastoma in the western region of Sweden were registered in a population-based study. Of the 378 patients, 131 (35%) met the inclusion criteria of the present study by typical radiological features of glioblastoma without histological verification. Results The clinical characteristics of the 131 patients (72 men, 59 women) were: age ≥ 75 (n = 99, 76%), performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≥ 2 (n = 93, 71%), significant comorbidity (n = 65, 50%) and multilobular tumors (n = 90, 69%). The overall median survival rate was 3.6 months. A subgroup of 44 patients (34%) received upfront treatment with temozolomide, with an overall radiological response rate of 34% and a median survival of 6.8 months, compared to 2.7 months for those receiving best supportive care only. Good performance status and temozolomide treatment were statistically significant favorable prognostic factors, while younger age was not. Conclusion Thirty-five percent of patients with a radiological diagnosis of glioblastoma in our region lacked histological diagnosis. Apart from high age and poor performance status, they had more severe comorbidities and extensive tumor spread. Even for this poor prognostic group upfront treatment with temozolomide was shown of benefit in a subgroup of patients. Our data illustrate the need of non-invasive diagnostic methods to guide optimal individualized therapy for patients considered too fragile for neurosurgical biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W3005952047,"Objectives Fasting during the month of Ramadan is a basic pillar of Islam. While patients may be religiously exempted from fasting, literature indicates that the majority decide to fast. Caring for millions of Muslim patients who decide to fast during Ramadan can be challenging for clinicians around the globe. This study proposes a communication tool, RAMCOM, which aims to assist clinicians in communicating with Muslim patients considering fasting during Ramadan. It addresses the following questions: What are the clinicians’ preferences for the tool in terms of Content, Format, Style, Length and language? How do clinicians perceive factors that would impact their intentions to sue the tool? What would facilitate the implementation and dissemination of the proposed tool? Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of clinicians in Egypt (11) and the US (10). Clinicians were purposefully sampled to assure variance in age, gender, time in practice, specialty, and religious background. Directed content analysis was conducted and emerging data were mapped to constructs within the theory of planned behavior. Iterative sampling and analysis continued until saturation was reached. Results In total, 21 clinicians were interviewed. The tool was iteratively revised according to clinicians’ comments on format, content, language and usability. Factors contributing to using RAMCOM included perception of tool (need for use, perceived burden of use), perceived norm (perceived patient expectations), and ability to use tool (time, frequency of seeing patients, knowledge of Ramadan and Islam). Practice environment factors that impact the use of RAMCOM include education, early reminders, colored laminated copies, communication training, involvement of support staff, and patient education. Conclusion Clinicians provided valuable perceptions on the implementability and use of RAMCOM, a new communication tool designed to assist in caring for Muslim patients during Ramadan. These perceptions should be considered by different stakeholders to facilitate goal-concordant care for Muslim patients considering fasting."
https://openalex.org/W3005584679,"Purpose This study has two main objectives: 1) to assess the value of combining the rapid assessment of avoidable blindness (RAAB) and the recently developed rapid assessment of hearing loss (RAHL) based on existing population-based data from Cameroon andIndia; 2) to test the feasibility of a combined RAAB-RAHL protocol. Methods A secondary data analysis of population-based disability surveys in India and Cameroon (in 2013–2014) was conducted, focussing on people aged 50+. Hearing impairment (HI) was defined as pure tone average of ≥41dB (better ear).Visual impairment (VI) was defined as presenting visual acuity of <6/18 (better eye). The relationship between HI and VI was examined. The feasibility of a combined RAAB-RAHL survey was assessed within a RAHL conducted among adults aged 50+ in Malawi in 2018. Outcomes included: time taken, costs, number of people examined in a day, and qualitative feedback from participants and field teams. Results The prevalence of combined VI and HI among people aged 50+ was 4.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 6.4) in India and 4.8% (95%CI 3.0, 8.0) in Cameroon. Among participants with VI, approximately a third in India (29.3%) and Cameroon (35.1%) also had HI. A quarter of participants in India (25.4%) and Cameroon (26.9%) who had HI also had VI. In Malawi, the total time taken to complete both RAAB and RAHL assessments was approximately 27 minutes per participant. It was feasible to complete 30 participants per day for a team of four people. The estimated cost of a combined RAAB-RAHL approach in comparison to two separate impairment surveys is up to 37% less depending on the method of combination. Conclusion The substantial overlap between VI and HI supports a combined rapid survey of the two impairments. The pilot study of a combined RAAB-RAHL survey demonstrates feasibility and lower cost compared to conducting two standalone impairment surveys. A combined RAAB-RAHL approach could maximize limited resources to increase prevalence data for both vision and hearing impairment."

Methods This study enrolled RA patients who met the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria from Kyoto University Rheumatoid Arthritis Management Alliance (KURAMA) cohort in 2015. 22-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was taken for the measurement of dietary habit in a single-institution cohort of RA (Kyoto University Rheumatoid Arthritis Management Alliance: KURAMA) in 2015. The disease activities of RA using the Disease Activity Score calculated based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) level, the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), disease duration, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated antibody, and body mass index were also examined. All of them were combined and statistically analyzed. Results 441 RA patients (81% women; mean age 65 years; mean disease duration 15 years) were enrolled from the KURAMA cohort. Average Disease Activity Score-28 using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) was 2.7. Univariate analysis showed that intake frequency of vegetables had a statistically significant negative correlation with disease activity markers, such as DAS28-ESR (ρ = −0.11, p<0.01), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) (ρ = −0.16, p<0.001), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) (ρ = −0.21, p<0.0001), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (ρ = −0.13, p<0.01). Factor analysis with varimax rotation was done to simplify the relevance of disease activity to various food items. 22 foods were categorized into five dietary patterns: “seafoods”, “vegetables/fruits”, “meats/fried foods”, “snacks”, and “processed foods”. The multivariate analysis adjusted for clinically significant confounders showed that “seafoods” had statistically significant negative correlations with DAS28-ESR (β = −0.15, p<0.01), SDAI (β = −0.18, p<0.001), MMP-3 (β = −0.15, p<0.01), and HAQ (β = −0.24, p<0.0001). “Vegetables/fruits” had statistically significant negative correlations with SDAI (β = −0.11 p<0.05), MMP-3 (β = −0.12, p<0.01), and HAQ (β = −0.11, p<0.05) Conclusions These results suggest that high intake frequency of vegetables/fruits and/or seafoods might correlate with low disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3006286679,"Until 2018, cervical cancer screening in France was an unorganized individual screening, with the exception of some pilot programs in some territories. We aimed to assess, before the implementation of organized cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) nonavalent vaccine introduction in the vaccination schedule in 2018, (i) the individual cervical cancer screening coverage, (ii) the management of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and (iii) the related costs. We used the Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) (Echantillon Généraliste de Bénéficiaires [EGB] and Programme de Médicalisation des systèmes d’information [PMSI]) to assess the cervical screening coverage rate in France between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2014, and to describe diagnostic investigations and therapeutic management of SIL in 2013. After extrapolation to the general population, a total of 10,847,814 women underwent at least one smear test over the 3-year study period, corresponding to a coverage rate of 52.4% of the women aged 25 to 64 included. In 2013, 126,095 women underwent HPV test, 327,444 women underwent colposcopy, and 9,653 underwent endocervical curettage; 31,863 had conization and 12,162 had laser ablation. Besides, 34,067 women experienced hospital stays related to management of SIL; 25,368 (74.5%) had high-grade lesions (HSIL) and 7,388 (21.7%) low-grade lesions (LSIL). Conization was the most frequent in-hospital therapeutic procedure: 89.5% (22,704) of women with an in-hospital procedure for HSIL and 64.7% (4,781) for LSIL. Mean cost of smear test, colposcopy and HPV tests were around 50€. Total cost for hospital stays in 2013 was estimated at M41€, or a mean cost of 1,211€ per woman; 76% were due to stays with HSIL. This study highlights the low coverage rate of individual cervical cancer screening and a high burden related to SIL management."
https://openalex.org/W3006530305,"Staphylococci are a key component of the human microbiota, and they mainly colonize the skin and anterior nares. However, they can cause infection in hospitalized patients and healthy individuals in the community. Although majority of the Staphylococcus aureus strains are coagulase-positive, some do not produce coagulase, and the isolation of coagulase-positive non-S. aureus isolates in humans is increasingly being reported. Therefore, sound knowledge of the species and characteristics of staphylococci in a given setting is important, especially isolates from children and immunocompromised individuals. The spectrum of Staphylococcus species colonizing children in Uganda is poorly understood; here, we aimed to determine the species and characteristics of staphylococci isolated from children in Eastern Uganda. Seven hundred and sixty four healthy children less than 5 years residing in Iganga and Mayuge districts in Eastern Uganda were enrolled. A total of 513 staphylococci belonging to 13 species were isolated from 485 children (63.5%, 485/764), with S. aureus being the dominant species (37.6%, 193/513) followed by S. epidermidis (25.5%, 131/513), S. haemolyticus (2.3%, 12/513), S. hominis (0.8%, 4/513) and S. haemolyticus/lugdunensis (0.58%, 3/513). Twenty four (4.95%, 24/485) children were co-colonized by two or more Staphylococcus species. With the exception of penicillin, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates were low; all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin. The prevalence of methicillin resistance was 23.8% (122/513) and it was highest in S. haemolyticus (66.7%, 8/12) followed by S. aureus (28.5%, 55/193) and S. epidermidis (23.7%, 31/131). The prevalence of multidrug resistance was 20.3% (104/513), and 59% (72/122) of methicillin resistant staphylococci were multidrug resistant. Four methicillin susceptible S. aureus isolates and a methicillin resistant S. scuiri isolate were mupirocin resistant (high-level). The most frequent AMR genes were mecA, vanA, ant(4')-Ia, and aac(6')-Ie- aph(2'')-Ia, pointing to presence of AMR drivers in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3005869632,"Intraflagellar transport (IFT) in C. elegans chemosensory cilia is an example of functional coordination and cooperation of two motor proteins with distinct motility properties operating together in large groups to transport cargoes: a fast and processive homodimeric kinesin-2, OSM-3, and a slow and less processive heterotrimeric kinesin-2, kinesin-II. To study the mechanism of the collective dynamics of kinesin-II of C. elegans cilia in an in vitro system, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy to image the motility of truncated, heterodimeric kinesin-II constructs at high motor densities. Using an analysis technique based on correlation of the fluorescence intensities, we extracted quantitative motor parameters, such as motor density, velocity and average run length, from the image. Our experiments and analyses show that kinesin-II motility parameters are far less affected by (self) crowding than OSM-3. Our observations are supported by numerical calculations based on the TASEP-LK model (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process-Langmuir Kinetics). From a comparison of data and modelling of OSM-3 and kinesin-II, a general picture emerges of the collective dynamics of the kinesin motors driving IFT in C. elegans chemosensory cilia and the way the motors deal with crowding."

The antimicrobial effect of a series of potential chemicals such as lactic acid, propionic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, octenidine dihydrochloride, chlorocresol, Ampholyt 20 and the registered biocide DESINTEC® Hoof Care Special D (Desintec) were investigated by culture based in vitro testing. The microcidal effect of various Desintec concentrations were then compared against routinely used 4% formaldehyde and 10% zinc sulfate in ex vivo assays on sheep feet from slaughter. For this purpose a newly established PMA (propidium monoazid) real-time PCR using the improved dye PMAxx™ was applied that allows discrimination of viable and dead D. nodosus. In the ex vivo experiments, 4% formaldehyde was significantly more effective than 10% zinc sulfate and was chosen as positive control for assessing the new disinfectant. The disinfectant effect of Desintec in a minimal concentration of 6% was equally effective as 4% formaldehyde, meaning that it offers a comparable antimicrobial effect against virulent D. nodosus. In conclusion, Desintec is a promising disinfectant for replacing formaldehyde, copper sulfate and zinc sulfate in footbaths against footrot."
https://openalex.org/W3005728808,"It is commonly acknowledged that gamma-band oscillations arise from interplay between neural excitation and inhibition; however, the neural mechanisms controlling the power of stimulus-induced gamma responses (GR) in the human brain remain poorly understood. A moderate increase in velocity of drifting gratings results in GR power enhancement, while increasing the velocity beyond some ‘transition point’ leads to GR power attenuation. We tested two alternative explanations for this nonlinear input-output dependency in the GR power. First, the GR power can be maximal at the preferable velocity/temporal frequency of motion-sensitive V1 neurons. This ‘velocity tuning’ hypothesis predicts that lowering contrast either will not affect the transition point or shift it to a lower velocity. Second, the GR power attenuation at high velocities of visual motion can be caused by changes in excitation/inhibition balance with increasing excitatory drive. Since contrast and velocity both add to excitatory drive, this ‘excitatory drive’ hypothesis predicts that the ‘transition point’ for low-contrast gratings would be reached at a higher velocity, as compared to high-contrast gratings. To test these alternatives, we recorded magnetoencephalography during presentation of low (50%) and high (100%) contrast gratings drifting at four velocities. We found that lowering contrast led to a highly reliable shift of the GR suppression transition point to higher velocities, thus supporting the excitatory drive hypothesis. No effects of contrast or velocity were found in the alpha-beta range. The results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of gamma oscillations and developing gamma-based biomarkers of disturbed excitation/inhibition balance in brain disorders."

This study tried to utilize cyanobacteria as a raw material to produce biological poly(vinyl)alcohol-based films. Cyanobacteria was firstly modified with poly(ethylene glycol), guanidine hydrochloride, carboxymethyl cellulose and 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane as plasticizer, modifier, toughening agent and coupling agent, respectively. And then the modified cyanobacteria was introduced to poly(vinyl)alcohol and cellulose nanofibers/poly(vinyl)alcohol matrix to improve the barrier properties of poly(vinyl)alcohol to light and water. Compared with poly(vinyl)alcohol and cellulose nanofibers/poly(vinyl)alcohol films, the obtained cyanobacteria/poly(vinyl)alcohol and the cyanobacteria/cellulose nanofibers/poly(vinyl)alcohol composites exhibit better resistance to light and water. More interestingly, we found that after adding cyanobacteria, the poly(vinyl)alcohol-based films present better barrier properties to blue-violet light and red light. In adddition, introducing cyanobacteria into poly(vinyl)alcohol or cellulose nanofibers/poly(vinyl)alcohol matrix increases the surface roughness and contact angle to water of the composites."
https://openalex.org/W3006014638,"Non-prescription purchase of antibiotics is undesirable and has not recently been investigated in a representative population in a high-income low-use country during travel abroad. This study examined self-reported prevalence of antibiotic purchase abroad with and without prescription among participants reporting international travel in a general adult population in Norway, and the associations with socio-demographic, lifestyle and health factors.We analysed questionnaire-data from 19995 participants (10470 women) ≥40 years in the population-based Tromsø Study 7, 2015-2016. Data from the Norwegian Prescription Database were used to examine antibiotic use in Norway. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for ""travel abroad"", ""any antibiotic purchase abroad"", and ""antibiotic purchase abroad with"" and ""without prescription"" using multivariable logistic regression.Over half (55.0%, 95%CI 54.3-55.7%) participants reported travel abroad of >1 week duration in the past year. Travelers were more likely than non-travelers to be women (AOR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.42-2.88%) and report high education/income, childhood mostly lived abroad, healthy lifestyle, and good/excellent self-rated health. In total, 17904 travel episodes to 148 countries were reported. Altogether, 3.7% (95% CI 3.4%-4.1%) of travelers had purchased antibiotic abroad in the past year. Non-prescription purchase (1.5%, 95% CI 1.3-1.7) was associated with younger age, being female (AOR 1.41, 1.0-1.97), number of travels (reference: one episode, two: AOR = 1.82, 1.25-2.67, three: 2.60, 1.58-4.28, four: 3.10, 1.40-6.36 and ≥five: 4.70, 2.30-9.62), occurrences of diarrhoea (one: 2.42, 1.50-3.93 and ≥two: 3.08, 1.29-7.35), and antibiotic use in Norway in the past year (1.84, 1.29-2.62), whereas purchase with prescription (2.4%, 2.1-2.7) was associated with low income, growing-up abroad, recent hospital admission, additionally including number of travels/diarrhoea, and antibiotic use in Norway. Thailand (10.7%, 95% CI 7.8-14.3), Turkey (5.5%, 3.8-7.8) and Spain (3.6%, 3.0-4.3) were the countries most commonly associated with any antibiotic purchase. About two in five travelers who bought antibiotics in Thailand had done so without prescription, three in five in Turkey, and less than one in three in Spain.Overall, a small proportion of travelers had bought antibiotics abroad in the past year. Low prevalence of non-prescription purchase may be explained by awareness of the risks associated with self-medication, cultural views, unawareness of the non-prescription availability, and/or few infections. Divergent predictors for purchase abroad with versus without prescription may suggest different reasons for these practices."
https://openalex.org/W3005615112,"The purpose of this study was to ascertain the relationships between the amplitude of the corneal pulse (CP) signal and the parameters of corneal biomechanics during ex-vivo intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation experiments on porcine eyes with artificially induced ocular pulse cycles. Two experiments were carried out using porcine eyes. In the first one, a selected eye globe was subjected to three IOP levels (15, 30 and 45 mmHg), where changes in physical ocular pulse amplitude were controlled by infusion/withdrawal volumes (ΔV). In the second experiment, six eyes were subjected to IOP from 15 mmHg to 45 mmHg in steps of 5 mmHg with a constant ΔV, where corneal deformation parameters were measured using Corvis ST. In both experiments, at each IOP, the CP and IOP signals were acquired synchronically using a non-contact ultrasonic distance sensor and a pressure transmitter, respectively. Based on the amplitudes of the CP and IOP signals ocular pulse based corneal rigidity index (OPCRI) was calculated. Results indicate positive correlations between ΔV and the physical ocular pulse amplitude, and between ΔV and the corneal pulse amplitude (both p < 0.001). OPCRI was found to increase with elevated IOP. Furthermore, IOP statistically significantly differentiated changes in OPCRI, the amplitudes of CP and IOP signals and in most of the corneal deformation parameters (p < 0.05). The partial correlation analysis, with IOP as a control variable, revealed a significant correlation between the length of the flattened cornea during the first applanation (A1L) and the corneal pulse amplitude (p = 0.002), and between A1L and OPCRI (p = 0.003). In conclusion, this study proved that natural corneal pulsations, detected with a non-contact ultrasonic technique, reflect pressure-volume dynamics and can potentially be utilized to assess stiffness of the cornea. The proposed new rigidity index could be a simple approach to estimating corneal rigidity."
https://openalex.org/W3005809928,"Bangladesh introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-10) in 2015. We measured population-based incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) prior to introduction of PCV-10 to provide a benchmark against which the impact of PCV-10 can be assessed.We conducted population, facility and laboratory-based surveillance in children 0-59 months of age in three rural sub-districts of Sylhet district of Bangladesh from January 2014 to June 2015. All children received two-monthly home visits with one week recall for morbidity and care seeking. Children attending the three Upazilla Health Complexes (UHC, sub-district hospitals) in the surveillance area were screened for suspected IPD. Blood samples were collected from suspected IPD cases for culture and additionally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from suspected meningitis cases for culture and molecular testing. Pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotyping of cases detected by molecular testing was done by sequential multiplex polymerase chain reaction.Children under surveillance contributed to 126,657 child years of observations. Sixty-three thousand three hundred eighty-four illness episodes were assessed in the UHCs. Blood specimens were collected from 8,668 suspected IPD cases and CSF from 177 suspected meningitis cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 46 cases; 32 (70%) were vaccine serotype. The population-based incidence of IPD was 36.3/100,000 child years of observations. About 80% of the cases occurred in children below two years of age.IPD was common in rural Bangladesh suggesting the potential benefit of an effective vaccine. Measurement of the burden of IPD requires multiple surveillance modalities."
https://openalex.org/W3005830890,"Simple instructions have been shown to robustly influence individual creativity, which is key to solve local problems. Building on social labeling theory, we examine the possibility of nudging individual’s creativity using “creative” and “not creative” labels. Study 1 showed that subjects labeled as “creative” or “not creative” performed better in a creative task than unlabeled subjects and established the moderating effect of self-perceived creativity. Among subjects scoring low on self-perceived creativity, those labeled as “creative” performed better than those labeled as “not creative”. Conversely, among subjects scoring high on self-perceived creativity, those labeled as “not creative” tend to perform better than those labeled as “creative”. Study 2 and Study 3 further explored the psychological mechanisms at play in both cases: specifically, Study 2 showed that applying a “creative” label has the ability to increase creative self-efficacy through self-perceived creativity, whereas Study 3 demonstrated that applying a “not creative” label has the ability to increase individual creativity performance through a higher involvement in the creative task."
https://openalex.org/W3006254956,"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a highly conserved family of membrane-bound transcription factors, is an essential regulator for cellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in mammalian cells. Sre1, the homolog of SREBP in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), regulates genes involved in the transcriptional responses to low sterol as well as low oxygen. Previous study reported that casein kinase 1 family member Hhp2 phosphorylated the Sre1 N-terminal transcriptional factor domain (Sre1N) and accelerated Sre1N degradation, and other kinases might exist for regulating the Sre1 function. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the Sre1 activity and to identify additional kinases involved in regulation of Sre1 function, we developed a luciferase reporter system to monitor the Sre1 activity through its binding site called SRE2 in living yeast cells. Here we showed that both ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and hypoxia-mimic CoCl2 caused a dose-dependent increase in the Sre1 transcription activity, concurrently, these induced transcription activities were almost abolished in Δsre1 cells. Surprisingly, either AMPKα Subunit Ssp2 deletion or Glycogen Synthase Kinases Gsk3/Gsk31 double deletion significantly suppressed ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors- or CoCl2-induced Sre1 activity. Notably, the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 mutant showed further decreased Sre1 activity when compared with their single or double deletion. Consistently, the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 mutant showed more marked temperature sensitivity than any of their single or double deletion. Moreover, the fluorescence of GFP-Sre1N localized at the nucleus in wild-type cells, but significantly weaker nuclear fluorescence of GFP-Sre1N was observed in Δssp2, Δgsk3Δgsk31, Δssp2Δgsk3, Δssp2Δgsk31 or Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 cells. On the other hand, the immunoblot showed a dramatic decrease in GST-Sre1N levels in the Δgsk3Δgsk31 or the Δssp2Δgsk3Δgsk31 cells but not in the Δssp2 cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that Gsk3/Gsk31 may regulate Sre1N degradation, while Ssp2 may regulate not only the degradation of Sre1N but also its translocation to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W3006466252,"Fasting has been shown to increase longevity and alter immune function in a variety of animals, but little is understood about how reduced caloric intake may impact regeneration and infections in animals that must regularly repair and regenerate tissue in marine environments that contain high levels of bacteria. We examined the possibility that fasting could enhance spine regeneration and reduce bacteremia in the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. A small number of spines were removed from urchins and rates of spine regrowth and levels of culturable bacteria from the coelomic fluid were measured for 21 days in fed and fasted urchins. Fasted urchins had higher rates of spine regrowth and lower levels of colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of coeolomic fluid. The predominant bacteria in the coelomic fluid was isolated and identified by DNA sequence-based methods as Vibrio cyclitrophicus. After 21 days, fasted and fed urchins were injected with V. cyclitrophicus. Two hours after injection, fed urchins had about 25% more culturable bacteria remaining in their coelomic fluid compared to fasted urchins. We found no evidence that fasting altered coelomic fluid cell number or righting response, indicators of physiologic and behavioral stress in urchins. Our results demonstrate that V. cyclitrophicus is present in purple urchin coelomic fluid, that fasting can increase spine regeneration and that fasted urchins have much lower levels of culturable bacteria in their coelomic fluid than fed urchins. Overall, our data suggests that fasting may ultimately reduce bacteremia and infection in injured or damaged urchins."
https://openalex.org/W3005996363,"Despite the success of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program in South Africa, the 30% HIV prevalence among women of childbearing age requires the PMTCT program to be maximally efficient to sustain gains in the prevention of vertical HIV transmission. We aimed to determine the immunologic and virologic status at entry into antenatal care (ANC) and at childbirth among HIV positive women who conceived under the CD4<500 cells/μl antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility threshold and universal test and treat (UTT) policies in the Gauteng province of South Africa.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 692 HIV positive adult (>18 years) postpartum women who gave birth between September 2016 and December 2017. Demographic, viral load (VL) and CD4 data at ANC start (3-9 months before delivery) and delivery (3 months before/after) were obtained from medical records of consenting women. We compared CD4≥500 cell/μl and viral load (VL) suppression (<400 copes/ml) rates at ANC start and delivery among women with a pre-pregnancy ART, women known HIV positive but with in-pregnancy ART and newly diagnosed women with in-pregnancy ART. Predictors of having a high CD4 and suppressed VL were assessed by log-binomial regression.Of the 692 participants, 394 (57.0%) had CD4 data and 326 (47.1%) had VL data. Overall women with a pre-pregnancy ART were more likely to start ANC with CD4 count≥500 cell/μl (46.3% vs 24.8%, adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.9; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.4-2.5), compared to newly diagnosed women. This difference was no longer apparent at the time of delivery (aRR 1.2 95% CI: 0.4-3.7). Similarly, viral suppression at delivery was higher among women with pre-pregnancy ART (87.2% vs 69.3%, aRR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6) as compared to the newly diagnosed women. Viral suppression rate among newly diagnosed women increased substantially by the time of delivery from 43.5% to 69.3% (p = 0.001).These results show that pre-pregnancy ART improves immunologic and virologic control during pregnancy and call for renewed efforts in HIV testing, linkage to ART and viral monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3006034297,"Carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is a well-known risk indicator of thromboembolism, but it is not easy to rapidly detect IPH in acute symptomatic carotid disease. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the detection of IPH and evaluate the degree of stenosis and stroke patterns in patients with acute symptomatic carotid disease.We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with acute symptomatic carotid disease who were admitted within 12 h after stroke onset. Fifty-nine patients underwent TOF MRA at admission and were categorized according to the presence or absence of intraplaque high signal intensity (HSI). The severity of carotid stenosis and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging lesion patterns were evaluated.Intraplaque HSI was detected in 28.8% of the enrolled patients (17/59). Mild-to-moderate symptomatic carotid stenosis was more frequent in the intraplaque HSI-positive group (70.6%) than in the intraplaque HSI-negative group (42.8%) (p = 0.015). The patients with intraplaque HSI more frequently exhibited a disseminated small infarction pattern (76.5% in the intraplaque HSI-positive group, 47.6% in the -negative group), and did not exhibit a border-zone infarction pattern (0% in the positive group, 16.7% in the negative group).TOF MRA may be a useful noninvasive and rapid tool to detect IPH in patients with acute symptomatic carotid disease. IPH was common in those with a lower degree of carotid stenosis and manifested as a disseminated small infarction pattern. Intraplaque HSI on TOF MRA in acute symptomatic carotid disease may help to determine the mechanism of stroke and establish early treatment plans."
https://openalex.org/W3006482436,"The need to recognise individuals in population and behavioural studies has stimulated the development of various identification methods. A commonly used method is to employ natural markers to distinguish individuals. In particular, the automated processing of photographs of study animals has gained interest due to the speed of processing and the ability to handle a high volume of records. However, automated processing requires high-quality photographs, which means that they need to be taken from a specific angle or at close distances. Polar bears Ursus maritimus, for example, may be identified by automated analysis of whisker spot patterns. However, to obtain photographs of adequate quality, the animals need to be closer than is usually possible without risk to animal or observer. In this study we tested the accuracy of an alternative method to identify polar bears at further distances. This method is based on distinguishing a set of physiognomic characteristics, which can be recognised from photographs taken in the field at distances of up to 400 m. During five trials, sets of photographs of 15 polar bears from six zoos, with each individual bear portrayed on different dates, were presented for identification to ten test observers. Among observers the repeatability of the assessments was 0.68 (SE 0.011). Observers with previous training in photogrammetric techniques performed better than observers without training. Experience with observing polar bears in the wild did not improve skills to identify individuals on photographs. Among the observers with photogrammetric experience, the rate of erroneous assessment was on average 0.13 (SE 0.020). For the inexperienced group this was 0.72 (SE 0.018). Error rates obtained with automated whisker spot analysis were intermediate (0.26-0.58). We suggest that wildlife studies will benefit from applying several identification techniques to collect data under different conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3006078507,"The DevRS two-component system plays a pivotal role in signal transmission and downstream gene regulation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Under the hypoxic condition, phosphorylated DevR interacts with multiple binding sites at the promoter region of the target genes. In the present work, we carried out a detailed computational analysis to figure out the sensitivity of the kinetic parameters. The set of kinetic parameters takes care of the interaction among phosphorylated DevR and the binding sites, transcription and translation processes. We employ the method of stochastic optimization to quantitate the relevant kinetic parameter set necessary for DevR regulated gene expression. Measures of different correlation coefficients provide the relative ordering of kinetic parameters involved in gene regulation. Results obtained from correlation coefficients are further corroborated by sensitivity amplification."
