https://openalex.org/W2080127961,"A polysaccharide isolated from the body wall of the sea cucumber Ludwigothurea grisea has a backbone like that of mammalian chondroitin sulfate: [4-β-D-GlcA-1→3-β-D-GalNAc-1]n but substituted at the 3-position of the β-D-glucuronic acid residues with sulfated α-L-fucopyranosyl branches (Vieira, R. P., Mulloy, B., and Mourão, P. A. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13530-13536). Mild acid hydrolysis removes the sulfated α-L-fucose branches, and cleaved residues have been characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy; the most abundant species is fucose 4-O-monosulfate, but 2,4- and 3,4-di-O-sulfated residues are also present. Degradation of the remaining polysaccharide with chondroitin ABC lyase shows that the sulfated α-L-fucose residues released by mild acid hydrolysis are concentrated toward the non-reducing end of the polysaccharide chains; enzyme-resistant polysaccharide material includes the reducing terminal and carries acid-resistant L-fucose substitution. The sulfated α-L-fucose branches confer anticoagulant activity on the polysaccharide. The specific activity of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay is greater than that of a linear homopolymeric α-L-fucan with about the same level of sulfation; this activity is lost on defucosylation or desulfation but not on carboxyl-reduction of the polymer. Assays with purified reagents show that the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate can potentiate the thrombin inhibition activity of both antithrombin and heparin cofactor II.

Sulfated polysaccharides constitute a complex group of macromolecules known to possess a wide range of important biological properties. These anionic polymers are widespread in nature, occurring in a great variety of organisms. In marine algae, for example, the carrageenans and fucoidans are composed mainly of sulfated galactose and fucose, respectively (1Painter T.J. Aspinall G.O. The Polysaccharides. Vol 2. Academic Press, New York1983: 195Google Scholar). In the animal kingdom, sulfated glycosaminoglycans abound in vertebrate tissues (2Mathews M.B. Connective Tissue, Macromolecular Structure and Evolution. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1975: 93Google Scholar). Invertebrate species are also a rich source of sulfated polysaccharides with novel structures (3Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Google Scholar, 4Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S.

Anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities are among the most widely studied properties of sulfated polysaccharides. The anticoagulant glycosaminoglycan heparin is an important therapeutic agent used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis (14Kakkar V.V. Hedges A.R. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 455Google Scholar); dermatan sulfate is also an anticoagulant, although of lower potency than heparin (15Merton R.E. Thomas D.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 58: 839-842Google Scholar, 16Maggi A. Abbadini M. Pagella P.G. Borowska A. Pangrazzi J. Donati M.B. Haemostasis. 1987; 17: 329-335Google Scholar, 17Thomas D.P. Merton R.E. Barrowcliffe T.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 556: 313-320Google Scholar). A chemically sulfated xylan from beechwood, pentosan polysulfate, has been available for many years as an anticoagulant polysaccharide (18Fischer A.M. Barrowcliffe T.W. Thomas D.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1982; 47: 104-108Google Scholar, 19Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 571-578Google Scholar, 20Scully M.F. Ellis V. Kakkar V.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 41: 489-499Google Scholar). Sulfated fucans from brown seaweed have anticoagulant activity due to the ability to potentiate inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin or heparin cofactor II (21Church F.C. Meade J.B. Treanor R.E. Whinna H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3618-3623Google Scholar, 22Colliec S. Fisher A.M. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Boisson C. Durant P. Jozefonvicz J. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 143-154Google Scholar). Recently, we isolated novel sulfated polysaccharides from the body wall of a sea cucumber (5Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18176-18183Google Scholar, 7Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Google Scholar, 9Mulloy B. Ribeiro A.-C. Alves A.-P. Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22113-22123Google Scholar, 10Ribeiro A.C.

We found that the main fraction has a chondroitin sulfate-like structure, containing large numbers of sulfated α-L-fucopyranose branches linked to position 3 of the β-D-glucuronic acid residues (5Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18176-18183Google Scholar, 7Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Google Scholar). We now present both revision and further refinement of our previous structure. The analogy in structure between the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from sea cucumber, heparin, or dermatan sulfate from mammalian tissues and sulfated fucans from brown algae led us to investigate the possible anticoagulant activity of the echinoderm polysaccharide. We observed a high anticoagulant activity in the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate due to its ability to potentiate inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa by antithrombin or heparin cofactor II. Measurements of anticoagulant activities of chemically modified polymers show that the high anticoagulant activity of the sea cucumber polysaccharide can be assigned mainly to sulfated fucose branches linked to the chondroitin sulfate core. Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate was extracted from the body wall of the sea cucumber Ludwigothurea grisea by papain digestion, and purified by procedures previously described (5Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18176-18183Google Scholar, 7Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Google Scholar). Desulfation of this polysaccharide by solvolysis in dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (9:1, v/v) at 80°C for 6 h (23Nagasawa K. Inove Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Google Scholar) and reduction of the hexuronic acid carboxyl groups in the polysaccharide by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-NaBH4 (24Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1976; 7: 149-151Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Yield and integrity of the polysaccharides obtained after these two procedures were the same as in our previous study (7Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Google Scholar, 11Ruggiero J. Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 256: 275-287Google Scholar). Partial removal of sulfated fucose branches from the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate was performed by mild acid hydrolysis. In these experiments, the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (50 mg) was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 150 mM H2SO4, maintained at 100°C for 30 min, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 with 0.3 ml of ice-cold 1.0 M NaOH. Chondroitin 4-sulfate from whale cartilage, chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage, dermatan sulfate from bovine mucosa, and heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa were from Sigma. Dermatan sulfate was treated with nitrous acid (25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Google Scholar) to remove contaminating heparin. Heparan sulfate from human aorta was extracted and purified as described previously (26Cardoso L.E.M. Mourão P.A.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 115-124Google Scholar). The heparin for the APTT 1The abbreviations used are: APTTactivated partial thromboplastin time. assay was the 4th International Standard (85/502), obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK. activated partial thromboplastin time. Alkaline-catalyzed β-elimination of the linkage region of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (50 mg) was performed in 1.0 ml of 0.1 M NaOH in the presence of ∼2 mCi of [3H]NaBH4 at room temperature. After 8 h non-labeled NaBH4 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M and the solution was maintained at room temperature for an additional 8-h period. The solution was then neutralized with acetic acid, and the products were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (see below). Fractions were collected, assayed by metachromasia using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (27Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Google Scholar) and the radioactivity was counted on a scintillation counter. The fractions containing the 3H-labeled fucosylated chondroitin sulfate were pooled and lyophilized. 3H-Labeled fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (50 mg) was submitted to mild hydrolysis with acid (see above). After neutralization with NaOH, the solution was applied to a Bio-Gel P-4 column (88 × 1.5 cm) and eluted with 50 mM pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected and assayed by metachromasia using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (27Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Google Scholar), the carbazole (28Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar), and Dubois (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar) reactions, and the radioactivity was counted on a scintillation counter. The fractions containing the “acid-resistant fragments,” hereafter designated as partial defucosylated chondroitin sulfate, were identified by the carbazole and metachromatic positive tests. The released “sulfated fucose” was identified by positive Dubois test and the absence of carbazole and metachromatic reactions. Both fractions were pooled and lyophilized. In order to remove small amounts of unsulfated fucose (and also of inorganic sulfate) from the sulfated fucose sample, the fraction was re-applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column (90 × 0.8 cm) and eluted with distilled water at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected and assayed by the Dubois reaction (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar). The fractions of this second column containing sulfated fucose were pooled and lyophilized. This product (∼15 μg) was applied to Whatman No. 1 paper and separated by descending chromatography in isobutyric acid, 1.0 M NH4OH (5:3,v/v) for 24 h. In addition, the purified sulfated fucose (∼15 μg) was applied to Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and submitted to electrophoresis in 0.3 M pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 5.0), run for 4 h at 500 V. The chromatogram and paper electrophoresis were stained with silver nitrate. The partial defucosylated chondroitin sulfate (∼20 mg) was incubated with 1 unit of chondroitin ABC lyase (EC) from Proteus vulgaris (Seikagaku American Inc., Rockville, MD) in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 5 mM EDTA and 15 mM sodium acetate. After incubation at 37°C for 12 h, the reaction mixture was applied to a Bio-Gel P-4 column and chromatographed as described above. The fractions containing the “chondroitin lyase-resistant fragments” were identified by the carbazole and metachromatic positive tests. The released disaccharides were identified by the positive carbazole reaction. Both groups of fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The disaccharides fraction (∼100 μg) was applied to Whatman No. 1 paper, separated by descending chromatography in isobutyric acid, 1.0 M NH4OH for 48 h and stained with silver nitrate. Native fucosylated chondroitin sulfate, the acid-resistant and chondroitin lyase-resistant fragments (∼2.0 mg of each) or a solution containing standard hyaluronic acid (50 μg), heparan sulfate (200 μg), chondroitin sulfate (200 μg), dermatan sulfate (200 μg), and heparin (200 μg) were applied to a Mono Q column-FPLC (HR 5/5) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The column was developed by a linear gradient of 0-2.0 M NaCl in the same buffer. The flow rate of the column was 0.45 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed by metachromasia using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (27Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Google Scholar) and by the carbazole (28Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar) and Dubois (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar) reactions. After strong acid hydrolysis (4.0 M HCl, 100°C for 6 h) of the polysaccharide total hexosamine and sulfate were estimated by a modified Elson-Morgan reaction (30Rondle C.J. Morgan W.T.J. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 586-589Google Scholar) and by the BaCl2-gelatin method (31Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Google Scholar), respectively. Standard curves for hexosamine and sulfate were constructed from glucosamine and Na2SO4. The hexuronic acid content was estimated by the carbazole reaction (28Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar). The percentages of fucose and galactosamine in the acid hydrolysates were estimated by paper chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 48 h or in isobutyric acid, 1.0 M NH4OH (5:3, v/v) for 24 h and by gas-liquid chromatography of the corresponding alditol acetates (32Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Google Scholar). 1H spectra were recorded at 500 MHz and 13C spectra at 125 MHz using a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer in the FT mode. Polysaccharide samples were converted to their sodium salts by passage through a column 1 × 10 cm of Dowex 50 × 8 Na+ form. About 15 mg of each polysaccharide sample was dissolved in approximately 0.7 ml of 99.8% D2O (Goss Scientific, Ingatestone, United Kingdom) for NMR spectroscopy. The polysaccharide spectra were recorded at 60°C, with suppression of the HOD signal by presaturation. 13C spectra were recorded with full proton decoupling using the WALTZ sequence (33Shaka A.J. Keeler J. Freeman R.J. J. Magnetic Res. 1983; 53: 313-340Google Scholar). Two-dimensional double-quantum filtered COSY (34Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Google Scholar), TOCSY (35Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magnetic Res. 1983; 53: 521-528Google Scholar), and NOESY (36Bodenhausen G. Koghes H. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 370-388Google Scholar) spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the pulse programs supplied by the manufacturer. TOCSY spectra were run with a spin-lock field of about 10 kHz and a mixing time of 120 ms; the NOESY spectrum was run with a mixing time of 100 ms. All chemical shifts are relative to internal or external trimethylsilylpropionic acid. APTT clotting assays were carried out as described previously (37Eggleton C.A. Barrowcliffe T.W. Merton R.E. Thomas D.P. Thromb. Res. 1981; 34: 319-328Google Scholar, 38Thomas D.P. Merton R.E. Thromb. Res. 1982; 28: 343-350Google Scholar). Normal human plasma (90 μl) was incubated with 10 μl of a solution of polysaccharide (0-100 μg) and 100 μl of kaolin + bovine phospholipid reagent (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control reference reagent). After 5 min of incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of 0.25 M CaCl2 were added to the mixtures and the clotting time recorded. The activity was expressed as international units/mg using a parallel standard curve based on the 4th International Heparin Standard (193 international units/mg). These experiments were based on the assay of amidolytic activity of thrombin or factor Xa using chromogenic substrates, as described previously (39Teien A.N. Abildgaard U. Höök M. Thromb. Res. 1976; 8: 859-867Google Scholar, 40Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Throm. Res. 1984; 35: 257-266Google Scholar). Fifty μl of the sulfated polysaccharide solution was mixed with 50 μl of 1 unit/ml of purified human antithrombin from Chromogenix AB (Molndal, Sweden) in 0.02 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 M NaCl, and the mixture was preincubated at 37°C for 2 min. Then, 50 μl of a 4 NIH units/ml solution of purified human thrombin (Sigma) in the same Tris buffer was added to initiate the reaction. After a 1-min incubation period (inhibition period), 50 μl of 1.48 mM chromogenic substrate S-2238 from Chromogenix AB (Molndal, Sweden) was added and the remaining thrombin activity recorded by the absorbance at 405 nm. In the short incubation periods, used to measure activity versus concentration of sulfated polysaccharide, amidolysis was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 50% acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. This assay was essentially as described above except that heparin cofactor II (25 μg/ml) from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France) instead of antithrombin was added to the incubation mixtures. This assay was performed as described for the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin (see above) except that 4 units/ml purified bovine factor Xa (Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden) instead of thrombin was added to the mixtures. In addition, the chromogenic substrate employed in this experiment was 2.73 mM S-2222 Chromogenix AB (Mölndal, Sweden). In the short incubation periods used to measure activity versus concentration of the sulfated polysaccharide no inhibition occurred when thrombin or factor Xa was incubated with antithrombin or heparin cofactor II in the absence of sulfated polysaccharide, nor did inhibition occur when thrombin or factor Xa was incubated with sulfated polysaccharide alone over the range of concentrations tested. The fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the body wall of sea cucumber has a chondroitin sulfate-like core, containing side chains of sulfated α-L-fucose linked at the C-3 position of the β-D-glucuronic acid. The intact polysaccharide is totally resistant to chondroitin lyase digestion (5Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18176-18183Google Scholar, 7Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Google Scholar). Since fucose forms a glycosidic linkage that is more sensitive to acid than that formed by glucuronic acid or by hexosamine (41Aspinall G.O. Aspinall G.O. The Polysaccharides. Vol 1. Academic Press, New York1982: 19Google Scholar), we attempted to defucosylate the polysaccharide using partial hydrolysis with acid. Indeed, this chemical treatment releases sulfated fucose and leaves “acid resistant-fragments,” eluted at Vo and Vt of Bio-Gel P-4 column, respectively (Fig. 1A). The 3H radioactivity (closed triangles in Fig. 1A) introduced to label the reducing terminal of the polysaccharide still eluted at the Vo of the column. Sulfated fucose was further purified on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (inset to Fig. 1A), and on paper chromatography shows a major component (Fig. 1B) which migrated as glucuronic acid standard on paper electrophoresis at pH 5.0 (Fig. 1C). Upon strong acid hydrolysis it releases almost exclusively fucose (Fig. 1, B and C). Another component, which migrated as disulfated fucose, was also observed on paper electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Overall, these experiments indicate that the major products released from the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate by partial acid hydrolysis are fucose monosulfate and fucose disulfate. The 1H spectrum of fucose released from the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate by mild acid treatment is shown in Fig. 2. Eight spin systems consistent with assignment to fucose residues could be identified using the TOCSY and DQCOSY 1H spectra of the released fucose, and a further five minor anomeric doublets were visible which may also come from α-fucose. The DQCOSY and TOCSY spectra gave connectivities for H1 through to H4, and H5 to H6. The coupling constant between H4 and H5 is small for fucose residues, so H4-H5 cross-peaks cannot be seen, but the connectivity can be established by cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum resulting from the close spatial proximity of H4 and H5. Comparison of the chemical shifts for each of these fucose residues with shifts for standard, unsulfated fucose (Table I) showed strong downfield shifts of some signals consistent with sulfation at those positions, and less strong downfield shifts attributable to sulfation at the adjoining position. These signals are marked in bold type in Table I.Table I.1H chemical shifts of sulfated fucose obtained by partial acid hydrolysis of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (see Fig. 1) and of standard unsulfated fucoseSugarAnomeric formChemical shiftsaThe 500 MHz 1H spectrum was recorded at 55°C in D2O.

Open table in a new tab Three α- and β-fucose systems correspond: those for fucose 4-O-monosulfate, fucose 2,4-O-disulfate, and fucose 3,4-O-disulfate. Approximate integration of the anomeric signals gives the proportions of these three as 49, 20, and 17% of the sample, respectively. A further α-fucose 4-O-monosulfate makes up at least 4% of the sample, and a β-fucose 3-O-monosulfate at least 6%. It was not possible to identify the partner anomeric forms of these last two species; either they are the non-reducing residues of disaccharides or the anomeric equilibrium strongly favors the form seen over the form not seen. The acid-resistant fragments obtained after partial acid hydrolysis of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate still contain fucose (open circles in Fig. 1A and Table II). Thus, this chemical treatment produces only a partially defucosylated polysaccharide.Table II.Chemical composition of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate before and after partial acid hydrolysis and incubation with chondroitin ABC lyasePolysaccharideGlcUAGalNHFucSulfate/total sugarMolar/ratiosNative fucosylated chondroitin sulfate1.000.921.230.70Acid-resistant fragments1.000.870.270.62Chondroitin lyase-resistant fragments1.000.930.41NDaND, not determined.Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate after desulfationbDesulfation of the polysaccharide was by solvolysis in dimethyl sulfoxidemethanol (9:1, v/v) at 80°C for 6h.1.000.970.640.05a ND, not determined.b Desulfation of the polysaccharide was by solvolysis in dimethyl sulfoxidemethanol (9:1, v/v) at 80°C for 6h. Open table in a new tab If the sulfated L-fucose branches released by partial acid hydrolysis were distributed randomly through the chondroitin sulfate core, we would expect that chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of the acid-resistant fragments would produce a wide variety of oligosaccharides with different molecular weights. Instead, mainly disaccharides and small amounts of tetrasaccharides were released, as well a proportion of polymeric chondroitin lyase-resistant material (Fig. 3). 2Incubation with chondroitin AC lyase produces similar results as obtained with chondroitin ABC lyase. Of the disaccharides produced, 15% are saturated and therefore originated from the non-reducing ends of polysaccharide molecules (Fig. 3, A and C). The average molecular mass of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate decreases from ∼30 kDa in the native polysaccharide to ∼15 kDa after partial acid hydrolysis and to ∼10 kDa after subsequent incubation with chondroitin ABC lyase (Fig. 3B). In addition, the 3H label at the reducing terminal of the polysaccharide (closed triangles in Fig. 3A) is found in the 10-kDa chondroitin lyase-resistant fragments. Our interpretation of these experiments is that sulfated L-fucose branches susceptible to release by mild acid treatment are located as a cluster at the non-reducing terminal of the polysaccharide. 3Comparison of electrophoretic behavior of the native branched compound with the defucosylated, relatively unbranched molecule (Fig. 3B) does not indicate molecular weight change with sufficient accuracy to allow us to exclude other modifications, such as a small extent of cleavage of N-acetyl-β-D-galactosamine glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide, during defucosylation by mild acid hydrolysis. However, our proposed structure of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate remains valid except in the highly unlikely circumstance that the mild acid hydrolysis cleaves a single galactosamine glycosidic linkage in each molecule, separating blocks of the polysaccharide containing chondroitin lyase-resistant and sensitive portions. Overall, the combination of partial acid hydrolysis and incubation with chondroitin lyase allows a sequential degradation of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate. The fucose:glucuronic acid molar ratio decreases in the polysaccharide after partial acid hydrolysis and increases again after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (Table II). Analysis of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q-FPLC column (Fig. 4) shows a homogeneous compound and confirms the high negative charge density of this polysaccharide. Thus, the sea cucumber chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 4B) was eluted from the column at a higher NaCl concentration than mammalian glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 4A). After sequential degradation by partial acid hydrolysis (Fig. 4C) and incubation with chondroitin lyase (Fig. 4D), the resistant fragments showed increasingly wider chromatographic fractions and eluted at lower NaCl concentrations than the native polysaccharide. The 1H NMR spectra of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate, before and after partial acid hydrolysis and degradation with chondroitin ABC lyase, are shown in Fig. 5. The two signals at 3.39 and 3.59 ppm, attributable to H-2 and H-3, respectively, of non-substituted glucuronic acid residues (42Welti D. Rees D.A. Welsh E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 505-514Google Scholar, 43Holme K.R. Perlin A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 186: 301-312Google Scholar) are almost absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of the fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 5A). After mild acid hydrolysis, which partially releases the sulfated fucose branches, the intensity of these two signals increases markedly (Fig. 5B), and decreases after incubation with chondroitin lyase (Fig. 5C). Some L-fucose residues remain after partial acid hydrolysis of the sea cucumber chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 5B), and are concentrated in the polymeric remainder after chondroitin lyase degradation (Fig. 5C). A signal at 5.22 ppm in the spectrum of these preparations is particularly noticeable, but there are several possible fucose anomeric signals between 5.1 and 5.7 ppm. The TOCSY spectrum (not shown) displays cross-peaks for two of these signals, the signal at 5.22 ppm and a further less intense signal at 5.44 ppm. Two H5-H6 cross-peaks can also be identified in the TOCSY"
https://openalex.org/W2089190393,"Previously, we isolated the murine “leukocyte-type” 12-lipoxygenase (L-12LO) cDNA from RNA of peritoneal-elicited cells that consisted predominantly of leukocytes (Chen, X.-S., Kurre, U., Jenkins, N. A., Copeland, N. G., and Funk, C. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13979-13987). By in situ hybridization we show that the L-12LO gene is expressed abundantly in a subset of peritoneal macrophages but not in elicited leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, or bone marrow-derived macrophages. L-12LO is highly related to human and rabbit 15-lipoxygenases, enzymes that have been implicated in the maturation process of red blood cells, and the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins that is implicated in atherogenesis. Accordingly, these enzymes have been referred to as 12/15-lipoxygenases. We have inactivated the L-12LO gene in mice using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Macrophage expression of L-12LO was abolished in homozygous deficient mice as was formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). In zymosan-stimulated cells, there was significant diversion of metabolism to the 5-lipoxygenase products leukotriene C4 and 5-HETE and in A23187-treated cells to 5-HETE only. The enhanced formation of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites was not due to compensatory changes of 5-lipoxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase activating protein but rather an apparent substrate diversion. L-12LO-deficient mice have no obvious abnormalities in reticulocyte or mature red blood cells, which suggest that in mice this pathway is not functionally important for erythrocytic development. Indices for oxidation of low density lipoprotein (measured as either thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances or the oxidant stress marker isoprostane 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α) were identical in incubations with unstimulated wild-type and L-12LO-deficient macrophages, but the zymosan-induced increase observed with wild-type macrophages was abolished in L-12LO-deficient cells. Thus, 12/15-lipoxygenase-deficient mice will be useful for the study of interaction between lipoxygenase pathways and determination of the in vivo role of 12/15-lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of LDL in atherogenesis.

Two types of 12-lipoxygenase enzymes have been described that differ biochemically and in immunoreactivity (1Walstra P. Verhagen J. Vermeer M.A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 312-319Google Scholar, 2Takahashi Y. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 613-621Google Scholar). The primary sequences are 58-65% identical based on the cloned cDNA sequence data (3Funk C.D. Furci L. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5638-5642Google Scholar, 4Yoshimoto T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar). Enzyme activity for the “platelet-type” 12-lipoxygenase (P-12LO) was first found in human platelets more than 20 years ago (6Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3400-3404Google Scholar). P-12LO has been found to be the predominant isoform in epidermal skin specimens and A431 epidermoid cells (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar, 7Takahashi Y. Reddy G.R. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Arase S. J. Biol.

Liu Y.-W. Ning C.-C. Suzuki H. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18734-18739Google Scholar). The other 12-lipoxygenase, referred to as “leukocyte-type,” was first characterized extensively from porcine leukocytes (10Yokoyama C. Shinjo F. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Oates J.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16714-16721Google Scholar) and was found to have a rather broad distribution in porcine and canine tissues by immunochemical assays (11Shinjo F. Yoshimoto T. Yokoyama C. Yamamoto S. Izumi S. Komatsu N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3377-3381Google Scholar, 12Nishiyama M. Watanabe T. Ueda N. Tsukamoto H. Watanabe K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 111-117Google Scholar). Besides tissue distribution, the leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase (L-12LO) is distinguished from the platelet-type enzyme by its ability to form 15-HPETE in addition to 12-HPETE from arachidonic acid substrate. L-12LO is highly related to 15LO in that both are dual specificity lipoxygenases, and they are about 85% identical in primary structure in higher mammals (excluding rodent sequences) (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar, 13Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Google Scholar, 14Sigal E.

L-12LO and 15LO have not yet been shown conclusively to co-exist within the same species at the molecular level, so it has been postulated that the 15LO found in human reticulocytes, airway epithelium, and eosinophils is the species equivalent of the L-12LO's found in bovine tracheal epithelium, porcine leukocytes, and mouse macrophages (5Chen X.-S.

The biological functions of these so-called 12/15-lipoxygenases are poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of specific, potent inhibitors for these pathways. The 15LO of rabbit reticulocytes has been proposed to oxygenate membrane lipids in a step leading to intracellular organelle degradation and erythrocyte maturation (18Rapaport S. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 471-495Google Scholar, 19Kühn H. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1454-1458Google Scholar). This pathway has also been implicated in the oxidative modification of LDL (20Parthasarathy S. Wieland E. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1046-1050Google Scholar, 21Harats D. Mulkins M.A. Sigal E. Trends Cardiovascular Med. 1995; 5: 29-36Google Scholar), a process believed important in foam cell development and atherosclerosis. To explore potential roles for the 12/15-lipoxygenase, we describe the development of L-12LO-deficient mice and focus primarily on the role and expression of this pathway in different types of macrophages. Resident peritoneal macrophages (PM) were collected after -intraperitoneal injection of 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in complete medium, and plated onto culture dishes. After 2 h at 37°C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator, the macrophages were washed twice with DMEM to remove nonadherent cells. Alveolar macrophages (AM) were harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage with five 1-ml rinses of complete medium at 37°C and prepared as above for PM. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM) were obtained from marrow plugs flushed from femurs with 2.5 ml of ice-cold complete medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After centrifugation at 1200 rpm (Jouan CR422) for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in fresh DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum and 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium, dispersed by three passes through a 30-gauge needle, and the cells (3.2 × 105/ml) seeded onto 100-mm non-tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37°C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator for 5-7 days. After 5 days incubation, cells were rinsed and stimulated as follows for 48 h: murine recombinant IL-4 (100 pM, 500 pM; Life Technologies, Inc., 107 units/mg), LPS (100 ng/ml; Sigma, from Salmonella enteritidis), murine recombinant IFN-γ (500 units/ml; Genzyme Diagnostics, 107 units/mg), recombinant mouse IL-2 (10 units/ml; Genzyme Diagnostics, 2.5 × 106 units/mg), mouse tumor necrosis factor-α (400 units/ml; Boehringer Mannheim, 6 × 107 units/mg), recombinant murine IL-13 (5 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Inc.). The cells were characterized by nonspecific esterase activity and morphology. PM, AM, and BM were cytospun onto Probe-On Plus slides (Fisher) at 4 × 105 cells/ml, 200 μl/slide for 5 min at 550 rpm (Shandon cytospin centrifuge). The macrophages were fixed immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 15 min, washed with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated PBS three times, and air-dried for 5 min. The slides were used either immediately or stored at −70°C. The slides were soaked in 2 × SSC at room temperature for 10 min, exposed to UV light for 5 min, and incubated with prehybridization solution (0.6 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 50% formamide, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA) at 50°C for 1 h. The solution was gently removed, and 300 μl of hybridization solution (prehybridization solution plus 10% dextran sulfate and 10 mM dithiothreitol) containing L-12LO riboprobe (see below) was added. After hybridization at 50°C overnight, the slides were washed with 2 × SSC for 1 h at the same temperature, incubated with 50 μg/ml RNase I at 37°C for 1 h, rewashed, and a final overnight wash in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Na4P2O7) was performed. After dehydration in ethanol, the slides were coated with emulsion (Kodak NTB-2, 0.5 × concentrated), exposed at 4°C for 7 days, developed, and stained with Wright's Giemsa. A 1.2-kb L-12LO cDNA (nucleotides −3 to 1182) cloned in pCRII (Invitrogen) was linearized with SpeI or XhoI and incubated with T7 (antisense) or SP6 (sense) RNA polymerase, respectively, and [33P]UTP under standard in vitro transcription procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). After DNase I digestion, the probe was subjected to limited alkaline hydrolysis to ≈200 nucleotide fragments, neutralized, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol. The complete mouse L-12LO gene was cloned previously (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar) from a strain 129 Sv genomic library. A 6.9-kb XbaI fragment was excised and cloned into pGEM3zf(−) (Promega). A blunt-ended neo cassette under control of the polII promoter and 3′ bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence (23Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Google Scholar) was inserted into the StuI site within exon 3 (see Fig. 2). Actually, during the cloning process into the blunt-ended site, only one clone was obtained that contained two neomycin cassettes in reverse orientation. A thymidine kinase cassette cleaved from pMC1-TK (obtained from B. Hogan, Vanderbilt University) with XhoI and inserted into the SalI site in the polylinker was introduced for negative selection. The plasmid was linearized with a SalI site within the polylinker of pMC1-TK. DNA (25 μg) was electroporated into D3H mouse embryonic stem cells as described previously (24Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E.N. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Google Scholar). After 8 days selection in G418 (300 μg/ml) and ganciclovir (2 μM; gift of Syntex, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) colonies were picked, placed in 96-well plates, and processed for cell freezing and DNA Southern blot analysis as described by Ramirez-Solis et al. (25Ramirez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with StuI/BamHI, electrophoresed in a 1% agarose/TAE (Tris acetate EDTA) gel, blotted to nylon membrane, and hybridized with a random prime 32P-labeled 240-base pair fragment external to the targeting vector (probe A, Fig. 2). Hybridization to a 10-kb band, in addition to the wild-type 5.4-kb band, was indicative of targeted events. Clones exhibiting the proper targeting were subjected to further analysis with probes A, B, or neo and other restriction digests. Targeted embryonic stem cells (10Yokoyama C. Shinjo F. Yoshimoto T.

Male chimera (evidence of agouti coat color) offspring were mated with C57BL/6 females to obtain germ line transmitting progeny. All mice used in these studies were a mixed C57BL/6 × 129 Sv genetic background. Total RNA was isolated from macrophages by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel as described (27Persson H. Gray H.E. Godeau F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2903-2912Google Scholar), blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with a random prime 32P-labeled L-12LO probe (same fragment of cDNA as mentioned above) and human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion). Macrophages were sonicated in PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 60 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and homogenate protein was subjected to electrophoresis in 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels with a stacking layer. The protein was electroblotted to Hybond EC nitrocellulose and probed with an anti-mouse L-12LO antiserum (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar) at 1:100 dilution or anti-human 5-lipoxygenase or FLAP antibodies (generous gifts of Dr. Jilly Evans, Merck Frosst, Canada; 1:700 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively). An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system was used (Amersham Corp.). Macrophages (8 × 106 cells/ml) or platelets were incubated without or with arachidonic acid (100 μM unlabeled or 25 μM 1-14C, ≈106 cpm) plus A23187 (2 μM) for 15 min or opsonized zymosan (2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. In some experiments the FLAP inhibitor MK-886 (Calbiochem) at 5-15 μM was added 15 min prior to other additions. For direct analysis of HETEs, without prior extraction, the samples were loaded onto an Altex Ultrasphere 5-μm ODS-silica column (Beckman, 25 × 0.46 cm) using a solvent system of MeCN/MeOH/H2O/HAc (350:150:250:1) and flow rate of 1.5 ml/min as described (28Chen X.-S. Funk C.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Google Scholar). Labeled samples were extracted with ODS-silica columns (Millipore) and separated by RP-HPLC using a Phenomenex ODS-silica column (5-μm particle size; 25 × 0.3 cm) and a solvent system consisting of MeCN/MeOH/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (37.5:25:37.5:0.05) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min with UV detection first at 280 nm for detection of leukotrienes and then switched to 235 nm for HETE detection using a Hewlett-Packard Series 1050 HPLC system and HP Chem Station for LC data analysis program. Integrated peak areas were compared with standard curves prepared from known amounts of 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-HETE, and leukotriene C4 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Radioactivity in 1-min fractions was detected by scintillation counting. Blood (≈100 μl) was drawn from the retro-orbital plexus of lightly ether-anesthetized 8-week-old mice into heparinized microhematocrit tubes and diluted with 4 volumes PBS/EDTA (2 mM). The blood cells were subjected to automated cell analysis with a Technicon H1 electronic cell counter (Miles, Inc.). Leukocyte differentials were performed on blood smears stained with Wright's Giemsa (Sigma), and reticulocyte counts were performed on blood samples placed immediately in new methylene blue stain. For platelet incubations, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, centrifuged at 100 × g, the platelet-rich plasma collected and spun at 1000 × g. The cell pellet was washed once with Tyrode's buffer and the cells suspended in PBS. Experiments to measure mouse ear swelling with arachidonic acid or phorbol myristate acetate and influx of neutrophils to nonspecific glycogen challenge were performed as described previously (24Chen X.-S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E.N. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Google Scholar). Nitric oxide production was measured with Greiss reagents, and spectrophotometric readings were performed at 540 nm with sodium nitrite as standard (29Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Struehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2414Google Scholar). Mannose receptor activity was measured (30Cowan H.B. Vick S. Conary J.T. Shepherd V.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 314-320Google Scholar) as the ability to internalize the mannose-containing protein horseradish peroxidase. Rosette and phagocytosis assays were performed essentially as described (31Boltz-Nitulescu G. Spiegelberg H.L. Cell. Immunol. 1981; 59: 106-114Google Scholar). Phagocytosis was assessed also by the ability to uptake opsonized Texas Red-conjugated yeast BioParticles (Molecular Probes; 25:1 particles/cell) as described by de Lanerolle et al. (32de Lanerolle P. Gorgas G. Li Q. Schluns K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16883-16886Google Scholar). For apoptosis assays, after PM were stimulated with LPS (several doses between 5 and 1000 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (50-600 units/ml) for 24 h, the macrophages were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed. Isolated DNA (10-15 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose/TAE gel. Apoptosis was also assessed by the TUNEL method using a fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Antitumor cell activity was measured as described (33Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Google Scholar). Mice were infected with various doses of L. monocytogenes intravenously, and 4 days after infection the number of viable bacteria in spleen and liver homogenates was determined (34Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lötsher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Köntgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Google Scholar). LDL was prepared according to previously described methods that minimize oxidation and exposure to endotoxin (35Cathcart M.K. Chisholm G.M. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 1001-1008Google Scholar). PM were plated onto 6-well plates (3 × 106 cells/well) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 3 h, the macrophages were washed twice with Ham's F-10 medium and then incubated with F-10 medium containing human LDL (0.4 mg/ml, dialyzed at 4°C against PBS without calcium or magnesium in the dark before use) without or with opsonized zymosan (2 mg/ml) for 12 and 24 h. The medium was collected, and LDL oxidation was assayed by measurement of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) monitored at 532 nm (36Schuh J. Fairclough G.F. Haschemeyer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3173-3177Google Scholar) and by formation of an isoprostane oxidant stress marker 8-epi-PGF2α that was extracted by addition of 2 volumes of Folch reagent (CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1) from base-hydrolyzed (1.0 M KOH) lipids and quantitated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis (37Praticó D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Google Scholar). Values obtained for LDL oxidation in the absence of cells were subtracted from the values obtained with cells. Iodination of LDL was performed with Na125I as described by the iodine monochloride method (38Jessup W. Darley-Usmar V. O'Leary V. Bedwell S. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 163-169Google Scholar), and the iodinated LDL (specific radioactivity 60 cpm/ng of LDL protein) was separated from unreacted iodide using a column of Sephadex G-25 (PD-10, Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) followed by dialysis overnight against PBS at 4°C. Macrophage-modified LDL (24 h incubation) was incubated in degradation assays as described (39Henrickson T. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6499-6503Google Scholar). Briefly, PM from wild-type mice were plated onto 24-well plates (106 cells/well) and incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C overnight. The macrophages were washed twice with DMEM, and the modified 125I-LDL(10 μg/ml) was added to the macrophages. After 5 h, the medium was assayed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble, silver nitrate-soluble (non-iodide) radioactivity as described (39Henrickson T. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6499-6503Google Scholar). Modified 125I-LDL control incubations in wells containing no cells were performed, and these values were subtracted from the experimental values. After incubations, the macrophages were treated with 0.2 N NaOH and protein-assayed with Bio-Rad reagents. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Instat computer software (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA) using the unpaired t test for single comparisons or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The murine L-12LO cDNA was isolated previously from RNA of glycogen-elicited peritoneal cell exudates (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar) that contain predominantly leukocytes (≈75-80%) and macrophages (≈20-25%). To identify which cell type expressed the L-12LO gene, we performed in situ hybridization on cytospin peritoneal cell preparations with an antisense L-12LO probe. High level gene expression was detected in about 30-40% of resident peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1A), but no specific expression was detected in elicited leukocytes, including eosinophils (Fig. 1A, inset). Hybridization with a sense probe showed no specific signal in any cells (Fig. 1B). Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages showed approximately the same percentage L-12LO-positive cells and L-12LO-immunoreactive protein as resident macrophages (data not shown). Surprisingly, other populations of mouse macrophages (alveolar and bone marrow-derived) did not show positive hybridization with the antisense L-12LO probe (Fig. 1, C and D). Incubation of bone marrow-derived macrophages with LPS, LPS + IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IL-2 + IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α+ IFN-γ, or splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin A did not induce L-12LO gene expression as assessed by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 4B and data not shown).Fig. 4Northern blot (A) and protein immunoblot (B) analyses to verify absence of L-12LO mRNA and protein in homozygous L-12LO−/− mice. A, total RNA (8 μg) from resident peritoneal macrophages (PM) or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM) was electrophoresed in an agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a mouse 1.2-kb 32P-labeled L-12LO probe (top) or human G3PDH probe (bottom). The blots were exposed for 4 and 8 h, respectively, to Kodak X O-Mat film at −70°C. B, proteins (5 μg) were electrophoresed, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with a mouse L-12LO antiserum (1:100 dilution) with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. The 61-kDa immunoreactive standard (5 ng) is a previously described (5Chen X.-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Google Scholar) GST/N-terminal portion of L-12LO. The arrow indicates the positive L-12LO immunoreactive band at 75 kDa. A nonspecific immunoreactive band was observed in AM and BM samples. −/−, homozygous; +/−, heterozygous; +/+, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A targeting vector was constructed from a 6.9-kb genomic fragment containing exons 1-8 of the L-12LO gene, and the gene was disrupted within exon 3 (Fig. 2). The neomycin insertion introduces an in-frame stop codon 109 bases downstream. This construct would be expected to yield a null allele upon homologous recombination since the non-heme iron atom ligands that are essential for activity are all located in downstream exons. The targeting vector was electroporated into D3H embryonic stem cells, and G418/ganciclovir-resistant colonies were picked and expanded for Southern blot analysis. Negative selection afforded a 2.8-fold enrichment. Seven of 288 clones exhibited the expected targeted 10-kb band with a 5′ external probe (Fig. 3 top). Upon further examination with neo and 3′ external probes, 5 clones showed proper targeting (not shown). Embryonic stem cells from 3 clones were injected into 3.5-day C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeric mice were generated. One male chimera from clone L1-7 transmitted the disruption through the germ line. Heterozygous offspring were interbred, and homozygous (L-12LO−/−) mice were obtained (Fig. 3, bottom) at the expected Mendelian frequency indicating that disruption of the L-12LO gene in mice is not essential for development. To verify that the gene disruption resulted in a null allele, PM were harvested from L-12LO−/− mice and wild-type littermate controls, and L-12LO mRNA, protein, and enzyme activities were assessed. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A) indicated no evidence for L-12LO mRNA in the defic"

In COS-1 cells, elevated expression of RelA (p65) repressed AR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NFκB1 (p50), another major member of the NF-κB family, did not influence transactivation. The repression of AR appeared to involve the N-terminal region of the protein between residue 297 and the DNA-binding domain. RelA-mediated transrepression could not be overcome by increasing the amount of AR. Transcriptional interference between RelA and AR was mutual in that cotransfected AR was able to attenuate transactivation by RelA in a dose- and steroid-dependent fashion. An excess of RelA was able to rescue the repression to some extent. Immunological analyses of RelA and AR protein levels indicated that transrepression was not due to reciprocal decrease in their amounts. Neither did AR increase the concentration of IκBα, which can sequester and inactivate RelA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using extracts from cotransfected cells and purified recombinant proteins showed that AR and RelA did not significantly influence each other's DNA binding activity. Nevertheless, protein-protein interaction experiments demonstrated a weak association between AR and RelA. Collectively, these data suggest that the mutual repression in intact cells is due to formation of AR-RelA complexes that are held together by another partner or to competition for a coactivator required for transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1980040001,"The human estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that contains two transcriptional activation functions, one located in the NH2-terminal region of the protein (AF-1) and the second in the COOH-terminal region (AF-2). Antiestrogens, such as trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT), have partial agonistic activity in certain cell types, and studies have implied that this agonism is AF-1-dependent. We have made progressive NH2-terminal and other segment deletions and ligations in the A/B domain, and studied the transcriptional activity of these mutant ERs in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer and HEC-1 human endometrial cancer cells. Using several estrogens and several partial agonist/antagonist antiestrogens, we find that estrogens and antiestrogens require different regions of AF-1 for transcriptional activation. Deletion of the first 40 amino acids has no effect on receptor activity. Antiestrogen agonism is lost upon deletion to amino acid 87, while estrogen agonism is not lost until deletions progress to amino acid 109. Antiestrogen agonism has been further defined to require amino acids 41-64, as deletion of only these amino acids results in an ER that exhibits 100% activity with E2, but no longer shows an agonist response to TOT. With A/B-modified receptors in which antiestrogens lose their agonistic activity, the antiestrogens then function as pure estrogen antagonists. Our studies show that in these cellular contexts, hormone-dependent transcription utilizes a range of the amino acid sequence within the A/B domain. Furthermore, the agonist/antagonist balance and activity of antiestrogens such as TOT are determined by specific sequences within the A/B domain and thus may be influenced by differences in levels of specific factors that interact with these regions of the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2069433740,"The effect of ethanol on the viability of a HepG2 cell model which was developed to constitutively express human CYP2E1 was studied in an attempt to establish a linkage between CYP2E1, reactive oxygen intermediates, and ethanol toxicity. Assays of toxicity included leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, trypan blue uptake, morphology, and formazan production. Ethanol was toxic to HepG2 E9 cells, which express CYP2E1, but not to HepG2 MV5 cells, which do not express CYP2E1. The ethanol toxicity was dependent on the concentration of ethanol, starting with 10 mM ethanol, and on the time of incubation with ethanol. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which increases the expression of CYP2E1 in this model, increased the toxicity by ethanol. Ethanol toxicity was prevented by 4-methylpyrazole and by diallyl sulfide, inhibitors of CYP2E1. The ethanol toxicity was also prevented by radical trapping agents such as N-acetylcysteine and N-t-butyl-α-phenylnitrone, antioxidative agents such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, thiourea, and uric acid, and inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, such as vitamin E phosphate, Trolox, and diphenylphenylenediamine. Besides ethanol, other substrates such as Me2SO, CCl4, isoniazid, and N,N-dimethylnitrosamine were cytotoxic to cells expressing CYP2E1 but not to control cells. These results indicate that ethanol was toxic to HepG2 cells which express human CYP2E1 by a pathway sensitive to inhibitors of CYP2E1 and to a variety of antioxidative agents. This model appears to be useful in efforts to establish a CYP2E1-dependent ethanol hepatotoxicity system and to evaluate the role of oxidative stress and reactive radical species in the toxicity by ethanol.

This model appears to be useful in efforts to establish a CYP2E1-dependent ethanol hepatotoxicity system and to evaluate the role of oxidative stress and reactive radical species in the toxicity by ethanol. A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to play important roles in pathways of ethanol toxicity to the liver. Some of these include effects of ethanol on mitochondrial functions and bioenergetics, membrane fluidity, and altered signal transduction, redox state changes as a consequence of ethanol oxidation, effects on the immune system or on eicosanoid metabolism, formation of acetaldehyde adducts, ethanol-induced hypoxia and reperfusion injury, ethanol-induced activation of Kupffer or stellate cells, and induction of CYP2E1. CYP2E1 oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde and oxidizes many agents to reactive metabolites that are hepatotoxic (1Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res.

CYP2E1 also displays high NADPH oxidase activity and is very reactive in production of O O2·− 2 and H2O2 during NADPH oxidation (4Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

It has been difficult to establish direct linkage between CYP2E1, ethanol induction of reactive oxygen species, and ethanol hepatotoxicity largely because of the lack of suitable models which display alcoholic liver disease. A major advance has been the development of the intragastric model of ethanol feeding in which prominent induction of CYP2E1 occurs and in which significant alcohol liver injury occurs with rats consuming diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids (17Tsukamoto H.

The expressed CYP2E1 was catalytically active with typical CYP2E1 substrates, including ethanol, and was reactive in formation of reactive oxygen species, such as O O2·− 2 and H2O2, and in catalyzing lipid peroxidation (28Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Google Scholar). Acetaminophen, an effective substrate for CYP2E1, was found to be cytotoxic to the HepG2 cells which expressed the CYP2E1 (E9 cells) but not to the control cells which were infected with retrovirus lacking the CYP2E1 cDNA (MV5 cells) (29Dai Y. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 1497-1505Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of ethanol to HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 and compare these effects to control cells which do not express CYP2E1 and to evaluate the effect of inhibitors of CYP2E1 and antioxidants on the ethanol toxicity. It was hoped that this model might prove useful in attempts to establish a CYP2E1-dependent ethanol hepatotoxicity system, and to evaluate the effect of antioxidants on the ethanol toxicity, in order to establish linkage between CYP2E1, generation of reactive species and ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. Fetal bovine serum, MEM, antibiotics, and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. Ethanol (95%) was from Fisher. Trypan blue, LDH kit, Me2SO, NAC, DAS, PBN, vitamin E phosphate, DPPD, uric acid, desferrioxamine, and thiourea were from Sigma. Trolox was from Aldrich. Catalase and superoxide dismutase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Cell culture flasks and plates were from Corning Inc. (Corning, NY). Two human hepatoma HepG2 sublines, which were established previously in our laboratory (28Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Google Scholar, 29Dai Y. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 1497-1505Google Scholar), were used as models in this study. MVh2E1-9, contains a copy of human CYP2E1 cDNA under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter in the PMV-7 retroviral shuttle vector. This human CYP2E1 copy was from a full- length human cytochrome P4502E1 complementary DNA which was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of PMV-7. This cell line stably expresses human CYP2E1. The p-nitrophenol oxidation activity is usually at the level of 50 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein to 100 pmol/min/mg. In the presence of 5 mM 4-methylpyrazole or 0.025 to 0.1 μg/ml phorbol myristate acetate, this activity can be induced to levels 3-4-fold higher. PMA was usually present in the incubation medium for most experiments to increase the content of CYP2E1. MV5 is the control HepG2 cell line that has the PMV-7 vector alone. This cell line does not express CYP2E1 or only contains a trace amount of CYP2E1 on Western blot analysis using chemiluminescence detection. These cell lines were grown in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg/ml G418, supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotics. Cells were subcultured at a 1:5 ratio once a week. During the actual experiments with ethanol, the fetal bovine serum concentration was reduced to 3%, and 2% TCH, a commercial serum replacement was added. The TCH does not contain animal proteins but supports the growth of human cells very well. No significant LDH leakage was found in cell culture when the 3% fetal bovine serum plus 2% TCH mixture was used. The Cell Titer96 assay (Promega kit G4100) determines the conversion of a tetrazolium salt to a blue formazan product and is widely used to assess cell viability (30Mosmann T.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar, 31Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942Google Scholar). E9 or MV5 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a cell concentration of 4 × 104 in MEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with 3% FBS plus 2% TCH and treated with ethanol and/or various agents for 1-3 days. Most experiments involved a 2-day incubation period with ethanol. All plates (including controls) were wrapped in Parafilm to minimize evaporation of ethanol; medium and reagents were changed every 24 h. No change in pH was noted under these conditions in any of the samples. The medium was removed, the cells washed, and 1 ml of fresh medium containing MTT was added for a 1-h incubation at 37°C. Stop solution was added (1 ml/well), and after 30-60 min, the absorbance at 570 and 630 nm was measured. The net difference A570− A630 was used to express the viability of the cells. To assay for LDH leakage, E9 and MV5 cells were seeded onto six-well culture plates in the amount of 8 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h of culture in MEM medium containing 10% FBS, the medium was replaced with 3 ml of MEM containing 3% FBS plus 2% TCH, and ethanol and various agents were added, and the cells were incubated for varying times, usually for 2 days. At this point, the culture medium was collected and assayed for LDH using the Sigma LDH-20 diagnostic kit. Fresh medium (2 ml) was added to the cells, and the cells were scrapped with a cell scraper and collected in MEM. The cells were sonicated for 30 s using the microtip of an ultrasound sonicator, and aliquots were assayed for LDH. LDH leakage was expressed as the percentage of LDH in the medium to the sum of LDH in the medium plus LDH in the sonicated cell extract. To assay for trypan blue exclusion, 1 × 104 E9 or MV5 cells were seeded onto 24-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h with MEM containing 10% FBS. Fresh MEM containing 3% FBS plus 2% TCH was added, followed by the addition of ethanol. After 2 days of incubation, a 0.1-ml solution of 0.05% trypan blue in 0.81% NaCl, 0.06% dibasic potassium phosphate was added to each well. After 5-10 min of incubation, the numbers of cells excluding or staining positively for uptake of trypan blue were counted under a light microscope. Cell morphology was also visualized under the light microscope. Results refer to mean ± S.D., and most results are from four experiments. Initial experiments evaluated the effect of several substrates and ligands for CYP2E1 on the viability of cells expressing CYP2E1 (E9 cells) and control HepG2 cells, which were infected with retrovirus lacking the cDNA for CYP2E1 (MV5 cells). Ethanol, Me2SO, N,N-dimethylnitrosamine, and isoniazid all proved to be toxic to E9 cells at concentrations which had no effect on the viability of MV5 cells (Table I). Previous experiments reported on the toxicity of acetaminophen to E9 cells (29Dai Y. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 1497-1505Google Scholar). The toxicity by ethanol was evaluated in further detail by a variety of techniques. Leakage of LDH was increased about 4-fold by ethanol in the E9 cells, whereas no effect was found with MV5 cells (Table II). Uptake of trypan blue was also increased by ethanol with the E9 cells, whereas vital dye staining (formazan production from MTT) was decreased by ethanol with E9 cells. No significant effects by ethanol were found with MV5 cells (Table II). Ethanol caused morphological changes in the E9 cells, as many cells were swollen, with condensed cytoplasm and nucleus, accumulation of intracellular vesicles, and irregular membrane shape with plasma membrane blebbing (Fig. 1). Ethanol had little or no effect on morphology of MV5 cells, as the cells maintained a regular plasma membrane, without blebbing, with few intracellular granules or vesicles and little condensation of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1).Table I.Toxicity of CYP2E1 substrates and ligands to E9 cellsAdditionCell viability (A570− A630 nm)E9 cellsMV5 cellsNone0.40 ± 0.010.66 ± 0.03Ethanol, 100 mM0.24 ± 0.03 (−40)aThe effect of the addition is shown in parentheses (%).0.64 ± 0.03 (−3)Me2SO, 20 mM0.20 ± 0.03 (−50)0.60 ± 0.03 (−9)N,N-Dimethylnitros-amine, 2 mM0.24 ± 0.03 (−40)0.67 ± 0.04 (+2)Isoniazid, 1 mM0.16 ± 0.02 (−60)0.63 ± 0.03 (−5)a The effect of the addition is shown in parentheses (%).

Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Google Scholar). PMA was previously shown to increase the content of CYP2E1 about 3-fold by activating the retroviral promoter (32Dai Y. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1614-1622Google Scholar). If ethanol toxicity in the E9 cells involved CYP2E1, increasing the expression of CYP2E1 by PMA treatment would be expected to enhance the toxicity of ethanol. This proved to be the case, as the increase in LDH leakage by E9 cells produced by 50 or 100 mM ethanol was increased from values of about 50 to 100% in the absence of PMA, to values of about 100 to 200% in the presence of PMA (Table III). Ethanol had no effect on LDH leakage by MV5 cells in the absence or presence of PMA (Table III).Table IIIEffect of PMA on ethanol toxicity to E9 cellsAdditionConcentration of ethanolLDH leakageE9 cellsMV5 cellsmM%Control09.5 ± 26.6 ± 3.65014.5 ± 3.35.9 ± 3.910019.7 ± 1.98.3 ± 1.3PMA09.8 ± 4.38.5 ± 0.55022.7 ± 8.43.5 ± 210037.4 ± 9.26.8 ± 2.3 Open table in a new tab The toxicity by ethanol increased as a function of time of incubation of the E9 cells with ethanol over a 1-3-day time period (Fig. 2).

Ethanol concentrations as high as 200 mM had no significant toxic effect on MV5 cells, nor did incubating these cells with 100 mM ethanol for up to three days (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Concentration curve for ethanol toxicity to E9 cells.

If ethanol toxicity to the E9 cells involved oxidation of ethanol by CYP2E1, 4MP would be expected to prevent this toxicity. 4MP proved to be completely protective against ethanol toxicity as assessed by either LDH leakage or formazan production (Table IV). 4MP also prevented the enhanced toxicity by ethanol in the presence of PMA (Table IV). In the absence of ethanol, 4MP alone had no effect on the viability of the E9 (or MV5) cells.Table IV.Prevention of ethanol toxicity to E9 cells by 4-methylpyrazoleConcentration of ethanolConcentration of 4MPLDH leakage or A570− A630 nmE9 cellsPMA E9 cellsmMA009 ± 211 ± 20511 ± 39 ± 550019 ± 128 ± 650510 ± 66 ± 3100025 ± 138 ± 510055 ± 210 ± 2B000.77 ± 0.040.64 ± 0.02050.71 ± 0.060.59 ± 0.075000.54 ± 0.04 (30Mosmann T.R.

Open table in a new tab The effect of a variety of antioxidative agents on the ethanol toxicity to E9 cells was evaluated (Table V). The iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine proved to be very toxic to the E9 (and MV5) cells during the typical 2-day experimental period, most likely reflecting the need for iron for cell growth and viability. Superoxide dismutase and catalase were protective against the ethanol toxicity (Table V), suggesting a role for O O2·− 2 and H2O2 in the overall mechanism. Uric acid and thiourea, antioxidants which were shown to protect HepG2 cells against H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity (38Gergel D. Misik V. Ondrias K. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20922-20929Google Scholar), were very powerful protectants against the ethanol toxicity to E9 cells as assayed by formazan production (Table V) or by morphology (Fig. 4). The cell swelling, the formation of intracellular vesicles, and the membrane blebbing caused by ethanol were largely prevented by thiourea and uric acid (Fig. 4). The protection by superoxide dismutase, catalase, thiourea, uric acid, PBN, and NAC against the ethanol toxicity is consistent with a role for reactive radical intermediates in the pathway responsible for the ethanol-induced injury. Lipid peroxidation is one of the possible toxic consequences to cells as a result of elevated formation of reactive radical species. The effect of several powerful inhibitors of lipid peroxidation on the ethanol toxicity to the E9 cells was determined. Vitamin E phosphate, DPPD, and Trolox (a synthetic vitamin E analogue) all proved to be protective against the ethanol toxicity (Table V). The toxicity of ethanol to the liver can probably be accounted for by a variety of mechanisms which are due to the metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450, and the direct interaction of ethanol with numerous biochemical pathways. Ethanol hepatotoxicity is likely to be multifactorial. Induction of CYP2E1 and the formation of reactive intermediates, including reactive metabolites, reactive oxygen species, and reactive ethanol radicals such as the 1-hydroxyethyl radical, appears to be one of the mechanisms that is receiving much current interest in studies evaluating how ethanol is hepatotoxic. It has been demonstrated that relative to several other P450 isozymes, CYP2E1 displays high NADPH oxidase activity, loose coupling and to be more reactive in oxidizing ethanol to the 1-hydroxyethyl radical (4Gorsky L.D.

Within the heart, increased activity of NOS2 in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) also can diminish the contractile function of adjacent cardiac myocytes. Glucocorticoids, which are known to suppress cytokine induction of NOS2 in many cell types, caused only a moderate (approximately 20%) decline in NOS2 protein content and maximal activity measured in homogenates of cytokine-treated CMEC, but almost completely inhibited synthesis of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by intact cells. To determine whether glucocorticoids were inhibiting cellular NOx production by limiting the availability of NOS co-factors or substrate, the effect of dexamethasone on tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and L-arginine availability in cytokine-treated CMEC was examined. Dexamethasone prevented the coordinate induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I with NOS2 after exposure to interleukin-1β and interferon-γ and also the increase in intracellular BH4 content in cytokine-treated CMEC. Addition of BH4 overcame dexamethasone-mediated suppression of nitrite production. Dexamethasone also prevented a cytokine-mediated increase in L-arginine uptake into CMEC by suppressing the induction of the high affinity cationic amino acid transporters CAT-1 and CAT-2B and the low affinity CAT-2A transporter. In addition, dexamethasone also inhibited cytokine induction in CMEC of argininosuccinate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of arginine from citrulline.

https://openalex.org/W2122393978,"Interaction domains located in the NH2 terminus of IRS-1 mediate its recognition by the insulin receptor. Alignment of IRS-1 and IRS-2 reveals two homology regions: the IH1PH contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and the IH2PTB contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. A third region in IRS-1 called SAIN was proposed to contain another functional PTB domain. Peptide competition experiments demonstrated that the IH2PTB in IRS-2, like the corresponding domain in IRS-1, binds directly to peptides containing NPXY motifs. In contrast, these peptides do not bind to IH1PH or the SAIN regions. In 32D cells the IH1PH was essential for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and p70s6k phosphorylation. In contrast, the IH2PTB and the SAIN regions were not required for these insulin actions; however, the IH2PTB improved the coupling between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Overexpression of the insulin receptor in 32DIR cells increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and mediated insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. The sensitivity of these responses was partially reduced by deletion of either the IH1PH or the IH2PTB and significantly reduced when both regions were deleted together. Thus, the PH and PTB domains equally couple IRS-1 to high levels of insulin receptor normally expressed in most cells, whereas at low levels of insulin receptors the PTB domain is inefficient and the PH domain is essential for a productive interaction. Interaction domains located in the NH2 terminus of IRS-1 mediate its recognition by the insulin receptor. Alignment of IRS-1 and IRS-2 reveals two homology regions: the IH1PH contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and the IH2PTB contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. A third region in IRS-1 called SAIN was proposed to contain another functional PTB domain. Peptide competition experiments demonstrated that the IH2PTB in IRS-2, like the corresponding domain in IRS-1, binds directly to peptides containing NPXY motifs. In contrast, these peptides do not bind to IH1PH or the SAIN regions. In 32D cells the IH1PH was essential for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and p70s6k phosphorylation. In contrast, the IH2PTB and the SAIN regions were not required for these insulin actions; however, the IH2PTB improved the coupling between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Overexpression of the insulin receptor in 32DIR cells increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and mediated insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. The sensitivity of these responses was partially reduced by deletion of either the IH1PH or the IH2PTB and significantly reduced when both regions were deleted together. Thus, the PH and PTB domains equally couple IRS-1 to high levels of insulin receptor normally expressed in most cells, whereas at low levels of insulin receptors the PTB domain is inefficient and the PH domain is essential for a productive interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1994853655,"Interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is a member of the C-X-C chemokine family. Using mRNA differential display, we isolated a rat homologue to murine and human IP-10 from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated carotid arteries. Our studies demonstrated that IP-10 is a potent mitogenic and chemotactic factor for vascular smooth muscle cells, the critical features of smooth muscle cells for their contribution to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis. IP-10 induced a concentrationdependent stimulation of DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell migration of rat aortic smooth muscle cells. A concentration- and time-dependent IP-10 mRNA induction was observed in lipopolysaccharide- or interferon-γ-stimulated, but not interleukin-1β- or tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated smooth muscle cells. A marked synergistic effect on IP-10 mRNA expression was observed when smooth muscle cells were challenged with interferon-γ together with interleukin-1β or tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, IP-10 mRNA expression was induced in the rat carotid artery after balloon angioplasty. The mitogenic and chemotactic features of IP-10 for smooth muscle cells, along with its discrete induction in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and in carotid arteries after balloon angioplasty (neointima formation) suggest that IP-10 may play an active and distinct role in vascular remodeling processes."
https://openalex.org/W2082528130,"Matrix metalloproteinases belong to a family of structurally related enzymes that plays important role in tissue morphogenesis, differentiation, and wound healing. Their expression is negatively regulated by several members of the steroid hormone receptor family. This is thought to occur through interaction of the steroid receptors with the transcription factor AP-1 that is otherwise required for positive regulation. Here, we demonstrate that AP-1 is not always a target for down-regulation of expression of matrix metalloproteinases by steroid receptors. Androgen receptor negatively regulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression not through AP-1 but through a family of Ets-related transcription factors that are also required for positive regulation. This negative regulation is specific for the androgen receptor. It does not require the DNA binding activity but needs amino-terminal sequences of the receptor. These results identify a novel regulatory pathway for negative regulation utilized by a member of the steroid hormone receptor family for down-regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W2020622509,"An inherent therapeutic limitation of many G protein-coupled receptor agonists is a short duration of action due to rapid dissociation from receptors. Salmeterol is a modified β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonist that has a long duration of action at the β2AR (but not the β1AR) both in vitro and in vivo and that is persistent despite extensive washout of the agonist. It has been proposed that salmeterol binds not only to the active site of the β2AR (localized to receptor transmembrane spanning domains (TMDs) 3 and 5) but also to another site (termed the “exosite”) that anchors it to the receptor and provides for repetitive active-site binding events. To identify the location of this exosite, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace β2AR amino acids 149-173 (within TMD4) with β1AR sequence. The resulting constructs were then expressed in COS-7 cells for radioligand binding studies. Using this approach, when this domain was replaced with the analogous β1AR sequence, the ability of salmeterol to persist at the receptor under washout conditions was reduced by 67%. The results from more selective mutants (S-(149-166), S-(164-173), and S-(149-158)) indicated that a limited 10-amino acid region (β2AR residues 149-158), localized at the interface of the cytoplasm and the transmembrane domain, contains a critical determinant for exosite binding. Whereas CHW cells stably expressing wild-type β2AR displayed persistent salmeterol-promoted cAMP accumulation despite agonist washout, substitution of β2AR residues 149-158 with β1AR sequence resulted in a 56% attenuation of salmeterol-promoted cAMP accumulation under identical washout conditions. A reverse chimera was also studied, which consisted of a substitution of β2AR residues 152-156 into the β1AR. This substitution was found to confer exosite binding to the β1AR. None of these mutations decreased the affinity of salmeterol for the receptor at the active site as assessed in competition binding studies. Anchored binding to this motif thus represents a novel mechanism by which agonists like salmeterol can repetitively activate receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1980536586,"αB-crystallin (αBC) is a major structural protein (22 kDa) of the ocular lens as well as a bona fide heat shock protein in non-lens tissue. The αBC gene is abundantly expressed in tissues with high oxidative capacity, including the heart and type I skeletal muscle fibers, and is regulated by the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors during myogenesis. To test the hypothesis that αBC expression may be directly regulated by the demand for oxidative metabolism, we examined the expression of αBC and the ancestral-related Hsp27 in rabbit tibialis anterior muscle subjected to continuous low frequency motor nerve stimulation (3 V, 10 Hz). αBC mRNA and protein increased within the 1st day of continuous contractile activity (5- and 2.5-fold, respectively) and achieved maximum levels (>20-and 4-fold, respectively) after 21 d of stimulation. Hsp27 mRNA and protein levels also increased with stimulation, but with a less specific and dramatic induction pattern. In agreement with the Northern analysis, <i>in situ</i> hybridization performed on cross sections from tibialis anterior muscle revealed progressively increasing αBC transcript signal, localized in a ringlet pattern, from 1 through 21 days of stimulation. Serial sections subjected to myosin immunohistochemistry revealed that αBC expression was confined to slow-twitch type I and a subpopulation of fast twitch type II fibers after 1 day but present in nearly all fibers after 21 days of stimulation. Transcript levels of all four myogenic regulatory factors (MyoD, myogenin, <i>myf-5</i>, and MRF4) also increased with stimulation in a pattern temporally similar with αBC, suggesting that expression of αBC in response to stimulation may, in part, be regulated through myogenic regulatory factor(s) interaction with the canonical E-box element located within the αBC promotor. These data demonstrate that expression of the small heat shock protein, αBC, is rapidly induced independent of the ancestrally related Hsp27 in a fiber type specific pattern in skeletal muscle subjected to the oxidative stress imposed by continuous contractile activity."

The second multidrug transporter, LmrA, is a 589-amino acid integral membrane protein and belongs to the ATP-binding cassette family of drug transporters. 2van Veen, H. W., Venema, K., Bolhuis, H., Oussenko, I., Kok, J., Poolman, B., Driessen, A. J. M., and Konings, W. N. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. Most strikingly, LmrA is the first example of a bacterial ATP-dependent multidrug extrusion system in which both functional and structural properties of the human MDR1 gene-encoded MDR transporter P-glycoprotein are united. The involvement of the Δp as a driving force for multidrug extrusion by TEXAN members has not been studied extensively. Instead, this characteristic of TEXANs is based on the inhibition of drug transport by protonophores like carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone and on their structural similarity to other secondary transport systems (16Neyfakh A.A. Bidnenko V.E. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Bogaki M. Nakamura S. Ubukata K. Konno M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6942-6949Google Scholar, 18Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8938-8942Google Scholar). We have now studied the energetics and mechanism of drug transport by LmrP in membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli expressing the protein. Evidence is presented that LmrP mediates drug transport via an electrogenic mechanism in which drugs are expelled from the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. L. lactis strains were grown at 30°C on M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with glucose (25 mM) and erythromycin (5 μg/ml) when needed. E. coli was grown aerobically at 37°C on Luria Broth (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside when needed. General procedures for cloning and DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). In order to subclone lmrP, the gene was amplified from the chromosome of L. lactis MG1363 via the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Google Scholar). The amino-terminal polyhistidine (His6)-tag containing LmrP derivative H-LmrP was constructed by subcloning the lmrP containing polymerase chain reaction fragment in frame with a His6-tag encoding sequence in the E. coli expression vector pET302 (Manting, van der Does, and Driessen, submitted), and transformation of ligated DNA to E. coli DH5α. The different cloning steps were checked by restriction analysis and double-stranded DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain-termination procedure (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) and the T7 DNA sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). E. coli DH5α was grown aerobically at 37°C to an A660 of about 0.8 on Luria Broth supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) plus isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (100 μg/ml) when appropriate. Inside-out (ISO) (21Ambudkar S.V. Zlotnick G.W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6142-6146Google Scholar) and right-side-out (RSO) (22Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 31: 698-709Google Scholar) membrane vesicles were prepared as described and resuspended in 50 mM potassium HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM MgSO4 (ISO) or in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM MgSO4 (RSO). Membrane vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen. H-LmrP was partially purified via Ni-NTA (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid)-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen Inc.). Membrane vesicles (5 mg of protein) were solubilized in 3.5 ml of buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) plus 600 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl, and 20%, v/v, glycerol) plus Triton X-100 (1%, w/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged (15 min, 350,000 × g at 4°C), and the supernatant was gently mixed with 200 μl of a 50% Ni-NTA resin slurry (100 μl of column material) for 30 min at room temperature, after which the suspension was poured into a column. The column was subsequently washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A plus 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (buffer B), followed by 50 column volumes of buffer B plus 10 mM imidazole, and 5 column volumes of buffer B plus 25 mM imidazole. Finally, H-LmrP was eluted from the column with 5 volumes of buffer B plus 250 mM imidazole and the total fraction (500 μl) was collected. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The amount of membrane associated TMA-DPH (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was measured fluorimetrically as described (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). ISO membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli DH5α (0.4 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in oxygen-saturated 50 mM potassium HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 25 mM K2SO4 plus 5 mM MgSO4. A Δp (inside positive and acidic) was generated by the oxidation of D-lactate via a constitutively expressed, membrane-associated lactate dehydrogenase (25van Schie B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. van Dijken J.P. Elferink M.G.L. van Dijl J.M. Kuenen J.G. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 493-499Google Scholar). The fluorescence development upon addition of TMA-DPH (100 nM, final concentration) was recorded in time using excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 425 nm, and slit widths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. TPP+ accumulation in RSO membrane vesicles was calculated from the external free probe concentration as recorded by a TPP+-selective electrode (26Shinbo T. Kama N. Kurihara K. Kobataka Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 187: 414-422Google Scholar). In competition experiments, ethidium bromide was added prior to TPP+ to correct for changes in the electrode output. RSO membrane vesicles were resuspended in potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 5 mM MgSO4 to a final concentration of 0.3 mg of protein/ml. A Δp (inside negative and alkaline) was generated by oxidation of glucose (10 mM) via the membrane bound pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase of E. coli (25van Schie B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. van Dijken J.P. Elferink M.G.L. van Dijl J.M. Kuenen J.G. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 493-499Google Scholar). Pyrroloquinoline quinone was added to a final concentration of 1 μM. LmrP was heterologously expressed in E. coli strain DH5α using the plasmid vector pET302 on which LmrP was transcribed from the trc promoter. To evaluate the expression of LmrP in E. coli, a His-tag was engineered at the amino terminus of the protein, yielding H-LmrP, which allows detection of the protein after purification by nickel-NTA chromatography. Fig. 1 shows that H-LmrP corresponds to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa on SDS-PAGE. To asses the functional expression of H-LmrP in E. coli, TPP+ efflux by isolated RSO membrane vesicles was monitored using an ion selective electrode. Generation of a Δψ (inside negative) by glucose oxidation, in the presence or absence of the potassium/proton ionophore nigericin, resulted in a high accumulation of TPP+ in control RSO membrane vesicles (Fig. 2; pET302). The Δψ-driven passive influx of TPP+ was much lower in RSO membrane vesicles containing H-LmrP (Fig. 2; pHLP1). Importantly, measurements of Δψ by the fluorescent probe DiSC3(5Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Google Scholar) (3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide) revealed comparable values for the control and LmrP containing RSO membrane vesicles (data not shown), indicating that differences in TPP+ accumulation are most likely due to active extrusion of TPP+ via H-LmrP. An enhanced Δψ-driven uptake of TPP+ was observed in pHLP1 RSO membrane vesicles in the presence of reserpine (Fig. 2), a known inhibitor of LmrP and other MDR transporters (14Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Google Scholar, 27Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Neyfakh A.A. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11086-11089Google Scholar). The TPP+ accumulation in the presence of reserpine was similar for the control and H-LmrP containing RSO membrane vesicles. These data show that the decreased TPP+ accumulation in pHLP1 RSO membrane vesicles results from LmrP-mediated TPP+ extrusion. In previous experiments we have shown that ethidium bromide is a substrate for LmrP (14Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Google Scholar). In accordance with this observation, the accumulation of TPP+ in pHLP1 RSO membrane vesicles was enhanced in the presence of increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide, whereas TPP+ accumulation was not affected by ethidium bromide in control RSO membrane vesicles or in pHLP1 RSO membrane vesicles plus reserpine (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrate that H-LmrP is functionally expressed in E. coli. The H-LmrP-mediated extrusion of TPP+ in the presence of nigericin (Fig. 2) indicates that the Δψ can function as the sole driving force for efflux. To study the energetics of LmrP in greater detail, TMA-DPH transport was measured in ISO membrane vesicles of E. coli DH5α in which an inversed Δp (inside acidic and positive) was generated by the oxidation of D-lactate. TMA-DPH is an amphiphilic, cationic and hydrophobic membrane probe (partition coefficient in octanol/water of 2.4 * 105), which is only fluorescent when present in the membrane (28Prendergast F.G. Haugland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Google Scholar). Therefore, the fluorescence properties of TMA-DPH can be directly used to follow the concentration of the probe in the lipid bilayer by means of fluorescence spectrophotometry (29Kuhry J.G. Duportal G. Bronner C. Laustriat G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 60-67Google Scholar). TMA-DPH added to pre-energized pHLP1 ISO membrane vesicles exhibited a rapid increase in TMA-DPH fluorescence, which was immediately followed by a fluorescence decrease. These results indicate that TMA-DPH inserts rapidly into the membrane and, subsequently, translocates from the membrane into the intravesicular space (Fig. 4). Importantly, TMA-DPH transport into the intravesicular space was partially inhibited upon dissipation of the ΔpH by nigericin or by dissipation of the Δψ by the potassium ionophore valinomycin. Complete inhibition of TMA-DPH transport was observed by (i) total dissipation of the Δp by nigericin plus valinomycin, and (ii) complete inhibition of LmrP activity by reserpine. In the control ISO membrane vesicles, TMA-DPH fluorescence was not affected by dissipation of the Δp or addition of reserpine (Fig. 4). These experiments clearly demonstrate that both the Δψ and the ΔpH function as a driving force of LmrP-mediated drug transport. The kinetics of TMA-DPH fluorescence development upon the addition to cells is biphasic (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 4). The initial fast phase reflects probe partitioning in the outer leaflet of the membrane, while the second and slower phase is due to the transbilayer movement of TMA-DPH into the inner leaflet of the membrane. In L. lactis EthR cells overexpressing the ATP-dependent MDR-transporter, the initial TMA-DPH extrusion rate correlates with the amount of probe associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that LmrA extrudes the TMA-DPH from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. As shown in Fig. 5A, similar results are obtained when L. lactis cells are used that overexpress LmrP. The initial rate of TMA-DPH extrusion increases in the course of probe flipping from the outer to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane, whereas the steady-state TMA-DPH fluorescence level remains the same (Fig. 5A). The initial TMA-DPH extrusion rate increased in the course of probe flipping from the external to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane, whereas the steady-state TMA-DPH fluorescence levels reached similar values (Fig. 5A). In pHLP1 ISO membrane vesicles, however, the initial transport rates were identical and independent of the partitioning of TMA-DPH into the internal leaflet of the inverted membrane system. The steady-state TMA-DPH fluorescence in this experiment increased along with the partitioning of TMA-DPH into the internal leaflet of the membrane (Fig. 5B). The observed kinetics of TMA-DPH transport in whole cells and ISO membrane vesicles further demonstrate that the rate of TMA-DPH transport depends on the amount of probe associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane. The energetics and mechanism of LmrP-mediated drug extrusion have been studied in membrane vesicles of E. coli DH5α in which LmrP was functionally expressed. The lack of TPP+ accumulation in pHLP1 RSO membrane vesicles upon generation of a Δp and the restoration of TPP+ accumulation, up to levels observed in the control RSO membrane vesicles, upon addition of reserpine (Fig. 2) demonstrate that TPP+ extrusion is LmrP-mediated. In addition, the competition between TPP+ and ethidium bromide for LmrP-mediated transport (Fig. 3) is in agreement with our previous conclusion that multidrug resistance and transport of various unrelated drugs by L. lactis correlate with the overexpression of LmrP (14Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Google Scholar). The slight enhancement of TPP+ accumulation in the control RSO membrane vesicles upon addition of reserpine points to the presence of a low endogenous TPP+ transport activity in E. coli. Indeed, genes specifying MDR transporters such as the mini-TEXAN EmrE (11Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar) and the TEXANs EmrAB (18Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8938-8942Google Scholar) and AcrAB (30Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 45-55Google Scholar) are present in E. coli. Low level expression of one or more of these proteins might be responsible for the extrusion of TPP+. Therefore, in general, data obtained from the transmembrane distribution of lipophilic cations like TPP+, or other probes that report changes in the Δp (31Molenaar D. Bolhuis H. Abee T. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3118-3124Google Scholar), have to be treated with caution as these probes might be recognized by endogenous MDR transporters. To study the energetics and mechanism of LmrP-mediated drug transport in greater detail, the fluorescent membrane probe TMA-DPH was used as a model substrate. Preliminary studies in whole cells of L. lactis MG1363 expressing LmrP indicated that TMA-DPH is a substrate for LmrP (Fig. 5A). 3H. Bolhuis, H. W. van Veen, J. R. Brands, M. Putman, B. Poolman, A. J. M. Driessen, and W. N. Konings, unpublished results. Consistent with this, LmrP-mediated TMA-DPH uptake could be measured in pHLP1 ISO membrane vesicles, while no transport was observed in the control ISO membrane vesicles (Fig. 4). The role of LmrP in the transport of TMA-DPH was confirmed by the complete inhibition of TMA-DPH transport by reserpine. The generation of a Δψ (inside positive) and/or ΔpH (inside acidic) in pHLP1 ISO membrane vesicles resulted in a significant decrease of TMA-DPH fluorescence and indicated that LmrP-mediated drug transport is driven by both components of the Δp. In view of the charge of the transported drugs, being monovalent cationic, the data strongly suggest drug transport via an electrogenic drug/nH+ (n ≥ 2) antiport mechanism. A similar mechanism was proposed for the mini-TEXANs Smr (12Grinius L.L. Goldberg E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29998-30004Google Scholar) and EmrE (11Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this mechanism differs from that of the LmrP homolog TetA, which mediates the electroneutral exchange of a positively charged tetracycline-metal complex for one proton (32McMurry L. Petrucci R.E. Levy S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3974-3977Google Scholar, 33Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Google Scholar), despite the fact that LmrP confers resistance to tetracycline as well.3 The initial rate of LmrP-dependent TMA-DPH transport correlates with the amount of TMA-DPH in the inner membrane leaflet of whole cells and with the amount of TMA-DPH in the outer leaflet of ISO membrane vesicles (Fig. 5). Since the outer membrane leaflet of inversely oriented ISO membrane vesicles corresponds to the cytoplasmic leaflet in vivo, both observations rule out the external leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane as possible site of drug binding to LmrP. Fig. 6 summarizes our current view of LmrP-mediated drug transport as depicted for TMA-DPH. The association of TMA-DPH with lipid bilayers and the concomitant fluorescence development has been extensively studied (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 28Prendergast F.G. Haugland R.P. Callahan P.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7333-7338Google Scholar, 29Kuhry J.G. Duportal G. Bronner C. Laustriat G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 60-67Google Scholar). Due to the charged TMA moiety, TMA-DPH is restrictively oriented perpendicular to the surface of the membrane. Since the TMA-DPH partitioning is highly asymmetric on a time scale of several minutes, in which the fast partitioning of TMA-DPH in the external leaflet of the membrane is followed by a slow passive transbilayer movement of TMA-DPH to the trans face, it was possible to follow the redistribution of the probe over both membrane leaflets. As was shown previously, the passive release of TMA-DPH from the membrane into the aqueous space is a slow process (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an energy barrier at the membrane water interface. This notion is consistent with the slow desorption of phospholipids from the vesicle surface (34Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 7-14Google Scholar). In terms of MDR, the slow passive release from the membrane of amphiphilic cationic drugs would favor a mechanism in which drugs are directly transported from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane into the external medium. Indeed this is what is observed for the initial LmrP-mediated TMA-DPH transport into ISO membrane vesicles. A fluorescence decrease rather than an increase is observed when LmrP is active (Fig. 5B). The latter would be expected when drugs are actively translocated from the cytoplasmic to the external leaflet of the membrane followed by passive diffusion into the external medium. LmrP-mediated TMA-DPH extrusion from the inner leaflet into the external medium is consistent with the “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner” model (35Mülder H.S. van Grondelle R. Westerhoff H.V. Lankelma J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 871-882Google Scholar, 36Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 18-21Google Scholar, 37Gros P. Croop J. Housman D.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar) which predicts that hydrophobic drugs are most efficiently transported from the compartment where the transporter encounters the highest substrate concentration, i.e. from the membrane. Our studies suggest a role for MDR-type transporters in maintaining membrane integrity, which is important since several hydrophobic compounds are known to be toxic at the membrane level (40Barabas K. Sizensky J.A. Faulk W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9437-9442Google Scholar, 41Sikkema J. de Bont J.A.M. Poolman B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 201-222Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mechanism of drug extrusion by LmrP is similar to that of the ATP-dependent drug transporter LmrA of L. lactis (24Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). This shows that despite of a different mechanism of energy coupling to drug transport (Δp versus ATP hydrolysis), these nonhomologous proteins may share similar structural features involved in drug extrusion from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane. These features are likely to be present in other MDR transporters as well, including the human P-glycoprotein (42Smit J.J.M. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L.

In in vitro transcription experiments we show that the abundance of the mRNA and the specificity of the expression are regulated primarily at the level of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2093352973,"The enzyme dUTPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, thereby preventing a deleterious incorporation of uracil into DNA. The best known dUTPase is that from Escherichia coli, which, like the human enzyme, consists of three identical subunits. In the present work, the catalytic properties of the E. coli dUTPase were investigated in the pH range 5-11. The enzyme was found to be highly specific for dUTP and discriminated both base and sugar as well as the phosphate moiety (bound dUDP was not hydrolyzed). The second best substrate among the nucleotides serving as building blocks for DNA was dCTP, which was hydrolyzed an astonishing 105 times less efficiently than dUTP, a decline largely accounted for by a higher Km for dCTP. With dUTP·Mg as substrate, kcat was found to vary little with pH and to range from 6 to 9 s−1. Km passed through a broad minimum in the neutral pH range with values approaching 10−7M. It increased with deprotonation of the uracil moiety of dUTP and showed dependence on two ionizations in the enzyme, exhibiting pKa values of 5.8 and 10.3. When excess dUTPase was reacted with dUTP·Mg at pH 8, the two protons transferred to the reaction medium were released in a concerted mode after the rate-limiting step. The Mg2+ ion enhances binding to dUTPase of dUTP by a factor of 100 and dUDP by a factor of 10. Only one enantiomer of the substrate analog 2′-deoxyuridine-5′-(α-thio)-triphosphate was hydrolyzed by the enzyme. These results are interpreted to favor a catalytic mechanism involving magnesium binding to the α-phosphate, rate-limiting hydrolysis by a shielded and activated water molecule and a fast ordered desorption of the products.

Only one enantiomer of the substrate analog 2′-deoxyuridine-5′-(α-thio)-triphosphate was hydrolyzed by the enzyme. These results are interpreted to favor a catalytic mechanism involving magnesium binding to the α-phosphate, rate-limiting hydrolysis by a shielded and activated water molecule and a fast ordered desorption of the products. The results are discussed with reference to recent data on the structure of the E. coli dUTPase·dUDP complex."

In addition, a 17-kDa protein referred to as the δ subunit co-purifies with the rod soluble phosphodiesterase and the cone phosphodiesterase. We report here partial protein sequencing of the rod δ subunit and isolation of a cDNA clone encoding it. The predicted amino acid sequence is unrelated to any other known protein. Of eight bovine tissue mRNA preparations examined by Northern analysis, the strongest δ subunit-specific signal was present in the retina. A less intense signal was seen in the brain and adrenal mRNA. In bovine retinal sections, rod δ subunit anti-peptide antibodies label rod but not cone outer segments. δ subunit, added back to washed outer segment membranes, solubilizes a large fraction of the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, indicating that this subunit binds to the classical membrane associated phosphodiesterase. The subunit forms a tight complex with native, but not trypsin-released phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the isoprenylated carboxyl termini of the catalytic subunits may be involved in binding of the δ subunit to the phosphodiesterase holoenzyme.

Phototransduction in the retina involves a cascade of regulated biochemical processes (for recent reviews, see 1Pugh E.N.J. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Google Scholar and 2Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Google Scholar). Key components in this light-activated biochemical cascade are the retinal specific phosphodiesterases (PDE6s). 1The abbreviations used are: PDE3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesteraseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineTPCKN-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRTreverse transcriptasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). These phosphodiesterases catalyze the conversion of cGMP to 5′-GMP when activated by the G protein, transducin. The retinal phosphodiesterases are multimeric proteins composed of catalytic and inhibitory subunits. The large subunits of the rod and cone phosphodiesterases (the α and β subunits in rods and the α′ subunit in cones) dimerize to form the catalytic core of the isozymes. The smaller 11- and 13-kDa subunits (rod γ and cone γ) serve as inhibitors of the rod and cone phosphodiesterases, respectively (3Hamilton S.E. Prusti R.K. Bentley J.K. Beavo J.A. Hurley J.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 157-161Google Scholar, 4Hamilton S.E. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11259-11264Google Scholar, 5Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Proteins. 1986; 1: 90-99Google Scholar). Hurwitz et al. (6Hurwitz R.L. Bunt-Milam A.H. Chang M.L. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 568-573Google Scholar) identified a 17-kDa protein that immunoprecipitated with bovine retinal phosphodiesterases. Gillespie and Beavo (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Google Scholar) later demonstrated that a protein of this size co-purified with the isotonically soluble rod and cone phosphodiesterases, but not with the membrane-bound rod phosphodiesterase. A function for this 17-kDa protein subunit (also referred to as the δ or 15-kDa subunit) has not been described. 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase high performance liquid chromatography 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s). The rod membrane-bound phosphodiesterase is loosely associated with the membrane at least in part due to C-terminal isoprenyl and carboxymethyl post-translational modifications. Several investigators (9Qin N. Pittler S.J. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8458-8463Google Scholar, 10Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H.K. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the α subunit is modified by a farnesyl (C-15) group and the β subunit is modified by a geranylgeranyl (C-20) group on their carboxyl termini. In addition both COOH termini are methylated as reported by Swanson and Applebury (11Swanson R.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10599-10605Google Scholar) and others (12Ong O.C. Ota I.M. Clarke S. Fung B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9238-9242Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved cysteine residue to serine in the CAAX isoprenylation motif in the α and β subunits eliminated membrane binding of the expressed phosphodiesterase subunits (13Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Google Scholar). Gillespie et al. (8Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Google Scholar) speculated that the 17-kDa subunit might confer solubility on the membrane-associated phosphodiesterases since it co-purifies with the isotonically soluble forms of the type 6 phosphodiesterases. Due to the insoluble nature of the isolated δ subunit, it was not possible to test this hypothesis with δ subunit purified from bovine retinas. We report here the identification and expression of a clone encoding the rod-soluble δ subunit protein. Recombinant δ subunit solubilizes rod membrane-bound phosphodiesterase presumably by binding to one or both of the catalytic subunits' isoprenylated COOH termini. Localization studies confirm its presence in rod outer segments as well as its possible presence in nonretinal tissues. Frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas were purchased from Hormel.

Gel filtration grade blue dextran, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and RNase A standards were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or J. T. Baker Inc. Purification of rod-soluble phosphodiesterase δ subunit was accomplished as described by Gillespie et al. (8Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Google Scholar). For chymotryptic digestion, 200 pmol of rod-soluble 17-kDa subunit was incubated in 2% (w/w) α-chymotrypsin in trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile, neutralized to a pH of 8.0 with ammonium bicarbonate. Proteolyzed samples were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described below. For cyanogen bromide digestion, rod-soluble 17-kDa subunit protein was dried under vacuum. The sample was reconstituted in ammonium bicarbonate buffer and incubated in 77 mM triethylammonium acetate, 0.077% tributylphosphine and 1.5% 4-vinylpyridine for 2 h at a pH of 9.5 at 37°C under argon (14Andrews P.C.

The sample was dried and reconstituted in 88% formic acid, diluted to 70% formic acid, and incubated with cyanogen bromide under argon at room temperature for 24 h. The proteolyzed sample was lyophilized twice and resuspended in 70% formic acid. After incubating for 2 h, the sample was diluted to 9% formic acid and injected onto a C-8 reverse phase column. Chymotryptic fragments were separated by injecting the samples onto a 1.5 mm × 100-mm octyl (C-8) reverse phase column (Brownlee) on an HP 1090 HPLC. The HPLC buffers were 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC buffer A) and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile (HPLC buffer B). The fragments were separated using a 0-70% gradient of HPLC buffer B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Cyanogen bromide fragments were separated by the same procedure except the reverse-phase gradient was a 0-80% gradient of HPLC buffer B. Edman degradation sequencing was performed on a Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer attached in line to a model 120A HPLC as described by Trong et al. (17Trong H.L. Beier N. Sonnenburg W.K. Stroop S.D. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Charbonneau H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10280-10288Google Scholar). Approximately 40 μg of recombinant δ subunit protein was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The subunit was concentrated to approximately 20% of the original volume in a Speedvac concentrator at room temperature, then used for mass spectrum analysis. The sample was injected into a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer, model Voyager Elite BioSpectrometry Research Station (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). This mass spectrometer employs a nitrogen laser at a wavelength of 337 nm. An α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was used. The spectrum was acquired in linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 30,000, a grid voltage set at 90.0%, and a guide wire voltage set at 0.300%. A positive ion spectra was collected. The data were externally calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1%. The mass reported is an average of two sample injections measured as doubly charged (M2+) and singly charged (M1+) molecular ions. Each mass measurement is the result of 100 scans. A bovine retinal cDNA library (18Li T.S. Volpp K. Applebury M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 293-297Google Scholar) was screened with the following redundant oligonucleotides: TGNGCNGGCATCATYTGN(G/C)RYTC (17NO1) and C(G/T)RAAYTTYTCCATYTGYTCNGC (17NO-2B) (19Sambrook J.

BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 678-680Google Scholar) was modified by annealing template DNA and sequencing oligonucleotide on ice for 5-10 min in place of the annealing step at 37°C. 2J. K. Bentley and C. H. Sherbert, unpublished observations. One region of the full-length 17-kDa clones consistently resulted in band compressions using our standard sequencing procedure, therefore several other sequencing methods were employed (22Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 165-170Google Scholar, 23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Google Scholar, 24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl.

Roskey M. Sutherland E. Slatko B.E. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 626-633Google Scholar) to sequence this “GC”-rich region. Messenger RNA was isolated using Invitrogen's FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (version 3.1) and quantitated (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the methods of Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was electrophoresed in a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Nucleic acids were transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane overnight. Immediately after cross-linking, the membrane was stained (28Herrin D.L. Schmidt G.W. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 196-197Google Scholar), then incubated with random prime labeled cDNA probes (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar, 30Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized and then washed under increasingly stringent conditions (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The most stringent wash conditions were at 55-60°C in 0.25 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for at least 20 min. Approximately 0.7 μg of poly(A)-selected mRNA isolated as described above was reverse transcribed with Thermus thermophilus (Tth) DNA polymerase (31Myers T.W. Gelfand D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7661-7666Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used for the reverse transcription reaction was 17K-AS6: 5′-CCTTGCCAAAGTATCTTCCC-3′. The oligonucleotides used for the first set of PCR reactions were 17K-S5 (5′-AGCGGGAGCTGAGGGGAG-3′) and 17K-AS6. Southern analysis was performed (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar) using a 350-bp XhoI DNA fragment from clone 17K-11 random prime labeled with [α-32P]dATP (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar, 30Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Google Scholar). Control reactions contained no template DNA or mRNA. To further select for a 17-kDa-specific DNA, a nested amplification reaction was performed on the RT-PCR products using the oligonucleotides, 17K-S5, 17K-AS8 (5′-CTCAGCATCCCGAAGGTTC-3′), and Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase. Control reactions contained either no DNA template, 17K-10 DNA (identical to clone 17K-11) in place of RT-PCR product, or substituted the oligonucleotide T7-24 (5′-CGACGGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACG-3′) for the oligonucleotide 17K-S5. A 220-bp DNA product was isolated and subcloned into the vector, pCR II, using standard techniques. The following peptides: EKFRLEQKVYFKGQV (17K-I) and RDAETGKILWQGTEDLSVP (17K-II), were synthesized for producing 17-kDa subunitspecific anti-peptide antibodies. The sequence, RSQILMWSANKVFEELTDVE, was synthesized for producing a type 6 phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit-specific anti-peptide antibody (18Li T.S. Volpp K. Applebury M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 293-297Google Scholar, 32Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 288-292Google Scholar). The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the presence of 20 mM glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. After addition of diluted RIBI adjuvant, approximately 1.6 ml of the final conjugated peptide sample was injected into each rabbit. The rabbits were boosted 26 days after the first injection with freshly conjugated peptide. Serums were tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For Western analysis, proteins were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar, 34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-peptide antibody 17K-I was affinity-purified against the δ subunit from 60 μg of rod-soluble phosphodiesterase bound to nitrocellulose (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The δ-bound antibody was eluted from the nitrocellulose with 500 μl of 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized by addition of 50 μl of 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Monoclonal antibody ROS1 was purified over a protein A column under high salt conditions at pH 9.0 (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified ROS1 antibody was approximately 6 mg/ml. Bovine eyes were obtained at a local slaughterhouse and stored on ice until dissection (approximately 1-2 h). Dissection was performed under normal room illumination. Tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for approximately 2 h on ice (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar, 35Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt M.A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Google Scholar). After rinsing in PBS, pH 7.4, the eye cups were floated in 30% sucrose, 130 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, for 2-18 h, then embedded in O.C.T. compound on a dry ice block. Twenty-micrometer sections were cut on a Tissue-Tek II Cryostat set at −18 to −20°C (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2% (v/v) goat serum, 2% (v/v) bovine serum diluted into PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A-purified monoclonal antibody ROS1 and affinity-purified 17K-I were diluted 1:500 and 1:10, respectively, in antibody diluent (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) goat serum, 1% (v/v) bovine serum in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated for longer than 1 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in rinse solution (PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.3), sections were incubated in a 1:50 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate). After rinsing three times for 5 min each, sections were mounted in Vectashield®. Signals were visualized and recorded on a Leitz Dialux 20 microscope equipped with a 100-watt high pressure mercury lamp and a Leitz vario-orthomat camera. Alternatively, data were collected on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser scanning microscope utilizing a krypton/argon laser with emissions at 488 and 568 nm. Sf9 cells were grown on plates or in spinner flasks in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate and 10% fetal calf serum (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar, 36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp.

To infect cells for protein production, spinner flasks were infected at cell densities of 1-3 × 106 cells/ml; plates were infected at cell densities that were 60-80% confluent (36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555. 1987; : 1-57Google Scholar, 37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Titers were conducted using the end point dilution procedure of O'Reilly et al. (37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar) and Reed and Muench (38Reed L. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Most infections were done at a multiplicity of infection of 10 or greater. The EcoRV-BamHI fragment of the 17-kDa cDNA clone, 17K-11, was subcloned into the SmaI and BglII sites of the baculovirus vector, pVL1393 (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Five μg of the resulting transfer plasmid, pVL17-17, and 5 μl of Bsu36I-digested BacPAK6 DNA (Clontech) were combined with 500 μl of Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml (39Kitts P.A. Possee R.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 810-817Google Scholar). After electroporation, 1.5 ml of complete TNM-FH medium was added, and cells were plated in a 35-mm dish. Following incubation for 4 days at 27°C, extracellular virus particles were collected and immediately subjected to agarose overlays (36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555. 1987; : 1-57Google Scholar). Viral plaques were screened (40Malitschek B. Schartl M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 177-178Google Scholar) and the identity of the expressed protein was confirmed by Western analysis. Viral stocks were amplified according to the procedures of Summers and Smith (36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555. 1987; : 1-57Google Scholar) and O'Reilly et al. (37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The δ subunit was overexpressed in Sf9 cells (36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555. 1987; : 1-57Google Scholar, 37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). After 3 days, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g and 22°C for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 14 mM benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After repelleting, the cells were homogenized in low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with the same protease inhibitors and dithiothreitol. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to separate the supernatant fraction from the pellet fraction. The supernatant was added to DEAE anion exchange resin (DE52) preequilibrated with low salt buffer, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 3-10 mg of protein/ml of resin. After incubating for 1-3 h at 4°C with constant rotation, the resin was loaded into a 1.5 cm × 13.5-cm column (bed height was approximately 6 cm). The column was washed with 2-3 volumes of low salt buffer. A linear gradient was run from 20 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, to 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of approximately 14 ml/h at 4°C. The total gradient volume was approximately six times the bed volume. Approximately 400-μl fractions were collected and assayed for δ subunit using Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The fractions containing δ subunit were pooled. For a larger scale procedure, the method was essentially the same except that a 2.5 cm × 22-cm column was used, and approximately 1.1-ml fractions were collected. The pooled DEAE fractions were sequentially filtered through Amicon Centricon 100 and 50 concentrators prerinsed with ROS buffer (60 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2), as follows. The Centricon 100 concentrators were centrifuged for 30-60 min at 1000 × g. The filtrates containing approximately 99% of the partially purified δ subunit were collected and loaded onto Amicon Centricon 50 concentrators. The Centricon 50 concentrators were centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 × g. The filtrates were collected and concentrated on Amicon Centricon 10 concentrators for 60-120 min at 5000 × g. To increase recovery of the 17-kDa subunit protein, the Centricon 50 retentates were diluted with 2 ml of ROS buffer, pH 7.2, and centrifuged again. Purified expressed δ subunit was stored at 4°C. For larger scale purification, Amicon Centriprep concentrators were used. For assay of δ subunit activity, purified rod outer segments were isolated from 50 frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas as described by Papermaster and Dreyer (41Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Google Scholar) with modification by Uhl et al. (42Uhl R. Desel H. Ryba N. Wagner R. J. Biochem. Biophys Methods. 1987; 14: 127-138Google Scholar). This procedure releases nearly all of the endogenous δ-bound rod and cone phosphodiesterase, but not the rod membrane-bound phosphodiesterase. The rod outer segment membranes were resuspended in ROS buffer, aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice, and stored at −70°C. Protein concentration was determined either with the Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) assay or by measuring its absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of the visual pigment, rhodopsin, was determined spectrophotometrically (44Wilden U. Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Google Scholar). To calculate phosphodiesterase concentration in rod outer segments, we assumed that 67% of the total protein was rhodopsin and that phosphodiesterase was present at ≈1/100 the rhodopsin concentration (45Dumke C.L. Arshavsky V.Y. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. Pugh E.N.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 1071-1098Google Scholar). The value obtained using this calculation is within 2-fold the value obtained by back calculating from phosphodiesterase activity assuming a cGMP hydrolytic rate of 2000 μmol of cGMP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein (data not shown). Expressed δ subunit was combined with rod outer segment membranes diluted in ROS buffer, pH 7.2, and incubated for the times and temperatures indicated. The samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 16,000 × g to separate rod outer segment membranes and supernatants. The membranes were resuspended in ROS buffer, pH 7.2, or hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) as indicated. Each fraction was assayed for phosphodiesterase activity using either the phosphate release assay (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Google Scholar, 8Gillespie P.G. Prusti R.K. Apel E.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12187-12193Google Scholar) or the [3H]cGMP assay (46Beavo J.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5649-5655Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterase was activated by preincubating samples with 0.02 mg/ml TPCK-trypsin for 8-10 min on ice followed by addition of 0.125 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor on ice. The dose-response curves were analyzed using the program, SigmaPlot. They were fit with a rectangular hyperbole. Purified recombinant δ subunit protein was incubated with rod outer segment membranes as described above or with hypotonically extracted rod outer segment protein (47Catty P. Pfister C. Bruckert F. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19489-19493Google Scholar), or trypsin-released rod outer segment protein (5Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Proteins. 1986; 1: 90-99Google Scholar). Fifty μM Pefabloc® was included in all experiments except those requiring trypsin treatment. Each sample was loaded onto a Sephadex G100 gel filtration column (1 cm × 26 cm), then eluted with 200 mM NaCl buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 8-9 ml/h at 8°C. Fractions were pooled and concentrated on Amicon Centricon 10 concentrators, and equal volumes were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie (48Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Google Scholar) or silver (7Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Google Scholar)"

Second, the R-loop can be assembled by annealing presynthesized RNA and supercoiled DNA template in the presence of formamide. R-loop formation by either method is dependent on specific template sequences. The reconstituted R-loop is exceptionally stable and exhibits an unexpected structure. Structural studies indicate that the RNA strand is organized within the RNA-DNA base-paired region, suggesting that the heteroduplex interaction occurs through a specific conformation.

The knowledge of its regulation is essential to understand the control of these phenomena. Several proteins activating PLD have been described in the last years. In this report, we chromatographed bovine brain cytosolic proteins to identify fodrin, the non-erythroid spectrin, as the first described inhibitor of PLD. A cytosolic fraction with an inhibitory effect on PLD activity loses its capacity after immunoprecipitation of fodrin. Moreover, at 1 nM, purified fodrin blocks fully and quickly PLD activity, whatever the stimuli used. In contrast, fodrin has no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. Fodrin-analogous proteins like dimeric or tetrameric erythroid spectrin have the same inhibitory effect on PLD, at higher concentrations. Other cytoskeletal proteins, actin and vimentin, are inefficient on PLD inhibition. The mechanisms implicated in PLD modulation such as post-translational modifications of fodrin and the role of small G-proteins on the cytoskeleton regulation are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2061077150,"Defects in mismatch repair are associated with several types of cancer. It is also generally believed that environmental carcinogens are responsible for the initiation of cancers by the induction of mutations in critical genes. Prior genetic studies have suggested that the mismatch repair system can also recognize certain forms of DNA damage such as O6-methylguanine and UV photoproducts, and, therefore, mismatch repair may play a role in environmental agent-induced carcinogenesis. To examine this hypothesis, hMutSα, a heterodimer which consists of hMSH2 and GTBP and participates in strand-specific mismatch repair, was tested for its ability to recognize DNA containing a site-specific C8-guanine adduct of aminofluorene (AF) or N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF). We show here that hMutSα specifically binds to both AF and AAF adducts. This binding requires both hMSH2 and GTBP. Results from competition and titration experiments indicate that the binding efficiency of hMutSα to AF and AAF is about 60% of that to a G-T mismatch, but is at least 10-fold that to an otherwise identical homoduplex DNA without the chemical modification. The specific binding of AF and AAF adducts by hMutSα suggests that strand-specific mismatch repair is involved in processing DNA damage induced by environmental carcinogens.

It is generally accepted that mutations are the primary cause of human cancer and that these can result from errors in DNA metabolism or from DNA damage induced by environmental carcinogens. To safeguard the fidelity of genetic information, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess mutation avoidance systems to remove these premutagenic lesions before a somatic mutation is induced. Methyl-directed, MutHLS-dependent mismatch repair in Escherichia coli is believed to be responsible for the fidelity of DNA replication or recombination (1Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Google Scholar). Recently, human mismatch repair has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in cancer avoidance (extensively reviewed in 2Kolodner R.D. Trends Biochem.

Further evidence that a mismatch repair defect contributes to genetic instability has been provided recently by the studies of PMS2 or MSH2 knockout mice in which the knockout animals acquire a hypermutable phenotype in microsatellite repeat sequences and are predisposed to cancer (15Baker S.M.

Most chemical carcinogens are known to covalently react with DNA to form carcinogen-DNA adducts (19Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 19Google Scholar). Presumably, these adducts play an active role in human tumorigenesis by the induction of mutations in genes critical for control of cellular growth. The association of numerous human cancers with environmental carcinogen exposure and microsatellite instability suggests a role of mismatch repair in the processing of DNA damage caused by carcinogens. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that mismatch repair proteins may be involved in repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers (20Feng W.Y. Lee E.H. Hays J.B.

To explore the possibility that environmental carcinogen adducts are processed by mismatch repair, we tested hMutSα, a human mismatch recognition protein (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar), for its ability to bind to oligonucleotides containing a site-specific dG adduct of either 2-aminofluorene (AF) or N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF). AF and AAF are members of tumorigenic aromatic amines that widely exist in the environment as products of tobacco smoke, fuel combustion, dyes, and cooked meat. Therefore, these compounds have become model molecules for mechanistic studies of cancer induction by aromatic amines. Activated AF and AAF react with DNA in a high degree of specificity at the C8 position of guanine, forming major adducts of N-(2′-deoxyguanosine-8-yl)- 2-aminofluorene (dG-AF) and N-(2′-deoxyguanosine-8-yl)-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (dG-AAF) (see Fig. 1), respectively (reviewed in 25Heflich R.H. Neft R. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 73-174Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that both AF and AAF adducts induce base substitution and frameshift mutations (25Heflich R.H. Neft R. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 73-174Google Scholar and 26Thomas D.C. Veaute X. Kunkel T.A. Fuchs R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7752-7756Google Scholar and references therein). We report here that similar to the interactions observed for mispairs, hMutSα specifically binds to DNA containing AF and AAF adducts, suggesting that mismatch repair may be involved in the processing of DNA damage caused by these carcinogens. HeLa S3 cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN. Lymphoblastoid line MT1 (a gift from P. Modrich, Duke University, Durham, NC) was grown in RPM1 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (HyClone) as described (24Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.H. Longley M.J. Li G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Google Scholar). LoVo cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Nuclear extracts from all cell lines were prepared as described (9Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Google Scholar, 27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Google Scholar). The dodecamer 5′-d(GTGATG(AAF)ATAAGT)-3′ containing a site-specific dG-AAF adduct at the sixth G was synthesized as described (28Zhou Y. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14043-14052Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides containing AF adduct were derived from AAF-containing substrates by treatment with 0.1 M NaOH in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol as described (29Shibutani A. Gentles R. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 813-818Google Scholar) followed by high performance liquid chromatography purification. The AF- and AAF-12-mers were annealed to 5′-d(CAGGTCAGGCATGGCACTCACTTATCATCAC)-3′ and elongated to a 31-mer (duplex I in Fig. 1) by primer extension using Klenow fragment, [α-32P]dATP, and the other three dNTPs. An oligonucleotide G-C homoduplex and a G-T heteroduplex were also constructed in the same manner (see Fig. 1). Purification of hMutSα were performed at 0-4°C as described (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, the samples used for hMutSα purification were precipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts between 30% and 65% ammonium sulfate saturation. After chromatography through a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column (0.57 cm2× 3.5 cm) and 1.0-ml Pharmacia HR 5/5 Mono Q column as described (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar), the purified hMutSα was immediately supplemented with 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10% (w/v) sucrose, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80°C. Purified hMutSα retained full activity under these storage conditions for at least 3 months. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the purified protein is near homogeneity (>99% purity) and contained only two polypeptides, 160-kDa GTBP and 105-kDa hMSH2, based on Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (data not shown). Unless otherwise specified, band shift assays were performed in 25-μl reactions containing 0.5 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplexes, 66 ng (about 0.25 pmol) of purified hMutSα, or 10 μg of crude nuclear extracts, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 110 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4% glycerol. Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min followed by addition of 5 μl of 50% sucrose (w/v). The samples were then fractionated at room temperature through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 6.7 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA with buffer recirculation. Bands were detected by autoradiography. Human MutSα is a heterodimer comprised of hMSH2 and GTBP polypeptides. This heterodimer is capable of binding to both base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion mispairs and participates in human strand-specific mismatch repair (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar, 30Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Google Scholar). To explore the role of mismatch repair in chemical carcinogenesis, purified hMutSα was examined for its ability to recognize a 31-mer oligonucleotide duplex containing either a site-specific AF or AAF adduct using a band shift assay. Most spectral and theoretical studies suggest that even though the AF and AAF adducts (Fig. 1) produce distortion in the DNA helix, oligonucleotide duplexes containing these adducts form a stable structure in solution (31O'Handley S. Sanford D. Xu R. Lester C. Hingerty B. Broyde S. Krugh T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2481-2497Google Scholar, 32Norman D. Abuaf P. Hingerty B. Live D. Grunberger D. Broyde S. Patel D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7462-7476Google Scholar, 33Milhe C. Dhalluin C. Fuchs R.P. Lefevre J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4646-4652Google Scholar). Since hMutSα binds efficiently to 31-mer oligonucleotide duplexes containing mispairs (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar), the adduct-containing 12-mers were elongated to 31-mers by primer extension (see “Materials and Methods”). The AF- and AAF-modified 31-mers migrate as if they were 32-mers in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (data not shown), consistent with previous observations that AAF 12-mer behaves as a 13-mer because of the bulky adduct (28Zhou Y. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14043-14052Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, purified hMutSα binds to oligonucleotide duplexes containing either AF adduct or AAF adduct (duplex I in Fig. 1) to a similar extent as it binds a oligonucleotide heteroduplex containing a G-T mismatch (duplex III in Fig. 1). This binding is at least 10-fold more than the nonspecific binding observed with an otherwise identical G-C homoduplex not containing an adduct (duplex II in Fig. 1). The binding of hMutSα to AF and AAF adducts was inhibited when 1 mM ATP was present in the reaction. ATP was also found to block the interactions of hMutSα with the G-T mismatch (Fig. 2) and other mispairs (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar). The findings suggest that mismatches and the chemical adducts are recognized by hMutSα through a similar mechanism. To determine the binding efficiency of hMutSα to the modified DNA, increasing amounts of purified hMutSα were allowed to bind to the G-T mismatch and AAF-modified heteroduplexes. As expected, the bound fractions in each case increase proportionally as the concentration of hMutSα increases (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the amount bound for the AAF-modified duplex is approximately half that observed for the G-T mismatch (Fig. 3B), indicating that the binding affinity of hMutSα to a G-T mispair is higher than that to AAF adducts. In the case of G-T mismatch, 0.5 pmol and 1.0 pmol of hMutSα was required to shift 0.25 and 0.5 pmol of substrate (Fig. 3B), respectively, suggesting a molar ratio of hMutSα:G-T mismatch at 2:1. Interestingly, when high concentrations of hMutSα were used to interact with AAF, a second band (complex II, Fig. 3A) was observed which was smaller than the standard hMutSα-heteroduplex complex (complex I). Although this complex was observed for the G-T mismatch, it is much stronger for the AAF substrate (Fig. 3A). Since the similar bands were also observed in the interaction of recombinant hMSH2 with insertion/deletion mispairs (34Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Google Scholar), we performed a Western analysis to determine if the hMSH2 subunit of hMutSα is responsible for the activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, antibodies against hMSH2 recognize only complex I but not complex II, and, therefore, hMSH2 is not the protein causing this faster moving band. Whether or not this band shift is due to the binding of the GTBP subunit is unknown. Finally, results similar to that obtained for the AAF adduct were obtained when AF substrate was titrated with hMutSα (data not shown). To further test the specificity of hMutSα to AF and AAF adducts, we performed competition studies in which either an unlabeled G-T heteroduplex or an unlabeled A-T homoduplex was included in the band shift assays. This unlabeled G-T heteroduplex contained a mismatch located in the middle of the sequence (duplex IV in Fig. 1), which has previously been shown to be bound by hMutSα with a high efficiency (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar). As expected, the level of bound DNA for all the substrates decreased as the concentration of the cold G-T mispair was increased. When an equimole (0.5 pmol) of the competitor was present, approximately 40% of the complex remained while a 2-fold excess resulted in a 6-fold (for G-T substrate) or more (for AF and AAF substrates) reduction (Fig. 4A). Theoretically, such a 2:1 ratio should give a 67% reduction if both heteroduplexes possess identical affinities for hMutSα. These results indicate that a mismatch in the middle of the sequence is a better substrate for hMutSα than a heteroduplex which contains a mismatch near the terminus. Fig. 4B shows competition using an A-T homoduplex (duplex V in Fig. 1). As expected, in the presence of 0.5 pmol of cold A-T homoduplex, the bound complex of 32P-labeled G-C homoduplexes was reduced by 50%, but there was no significant change in labeled AAF, AF, or G-T heteroduplex complexes. A 50% inhibition of the bound 32P-labeled heteroduplexes required the addition of an approximately 20-fold excess of cold homoduplex (Fig. 4B). Finally, addition of a 20-fold (10 pmol) excess of cold G-T mismatch almost eliminates the interaction of hMutSα with all 32P-labeled substrates (Fig. 4A), whereas even a 100-fold excess of A-T homoduplex could not completely eliminate binding to the AAF, AF, or G-T heteroduplexes (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that the AAF and AF adducts are specifically recognized by hMutSα as heteroduplexes. Recombinant hMSH2 (34Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Google Scholar, 35Fishel R. Ewel A. Lescoe M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5539-5542Google Scholar) and hMutSα (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar, 30Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to both base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion mispairs. However, nuclear extracts derived from GTBP-deficient MT1 (36Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Liu B. Parsons R.E. Palombo F. D'Arrigo A. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Kinzler K. Jiricny J. Vogelstein B. Science. 1995; 268: 1914-1917Google Scholar) are proficient in repair of 2-4 nucleotide insertion/deletion mispairs, but are deficient in processing base-base and single nucleotide insertion/deletion mispairs (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of LoVo cells, harboring defects in both alleles of the hMSH2 gene, are defective in repair of all heteroduplexes tested (10Umar A. Boyer J.C. Thomas D.C. Nguyen D.C. Risinger J.I. Boyd J. Ionov Y. Perucho M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14367-14370Google Scholar, 12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hMSH2 plays a crucial role in recognition of all mispairs while GTBP is largely responsible for identifying base-base mismatches. To test if duplexes containing the AAF or AF adduct can be recognized by individual subunits of hMutSα, band shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts derived from mismatch repair mutant lines LoVo and MT1 as well as the repair-proficient HeLa line. As shown in Fig. 5, several common bands are observed in all three nuclear extracts following reaction with AAF and AF adducts and with a G-T mismatch. Unlike the binding of hMutSα to mispairs, the binding of these proteins to the heteroduplex is not influenced by the presence of ATP. Western blots indicate that none of the bands detected in nuclear extracts of MT1 and LoVo are due to binding by hMSH2 (data not shown). In fact, the common bands shown in all three extracts are nonspecific because these proteins also bind to a G-C homoduplex (data not shown). However, the band corresponding to the complex of heteroduplex and hMutSα (right two lanes in Fig. 5) was observed in the HeLa nuclear extract, but apparently not observed in the two mutant extracts (Fig. 5). Also, in the HeLa extract, this band disappears when 1 mM ATP was added to the reaction (Fig. 5). Finally, Western analysis indicates that hMSH2 antibodies recognize this band (data not shown), confirming that it is the complex of hMutSα and adduct-containing oligonucleotides. These results suggest that recognition of AF and AAF adducts requires both subunits of the hMutSα. Environmental carcinogen exposure has been known for decades to be associated with a variety of types of human cancer. It is generally believed that these carcinogens exert their carcinogenic effects by covalently modifying genomic DNA to form DNA adducts that induce mutations to initiate carcinogenesis. Fortunately, cells possess DNA repair systems to remove these premutagenic lesions. One of the first systems identified to process bulky DNA adduct is the nucleotide excision repair pathway that removes a variety of DNA adducts including UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and chemical carcinogen-induced DNA lesions (37Hanawalt P. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Google Scholar, 38Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Google Scholar). Since carcinogen adducts play an active role in carcinogenesis, one would expect that defects in nucleotide excision repair would result in cancer predisposition. Among cancer syndromes, at present only xeroderma pigmentosum has been found to be associated with a defect in nucleotide excision repair (37Hanawalt P. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Google Scholar, 38Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Google Scholar), suggesting that genetic defects in other repair pathways may also be involved in tumorigenesis. Defects in mismatch repair have clearly been demonstrated to be associated with cancer syndromes (39Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Google Scholar). Although direct evidence has been lacking, implication of mismatch repair in the processing of certain types of DNA damage has been previously documented. Mellon and co-workers (21Mellon I. Champe G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 22Mellon I. Rajpal D. Koi M. Boland R. Champe G. Science. 1996; 272: 557-560Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that cells defective in MutS or MutL function are also defective in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, where UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are preferentially removed from transcribed strands of active genes. Feng et al. (20Feng W.Y. Lee E.H. Hays J.B. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1007-1020Google Scholar) showed that UV-stimulated recombinant frequencies were about twice as high in mismatch repair mutant cells as observed in wild type cells. Since MutS and MutL proteins block RecA-mediated strand transfer between DNAs with divergent sequences (40Worth Jr., L. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Google Scholar), the low frequency of UV-stimulated recombination in wild-type cells may be attributed to the inhibition of the process by mismatch repair components. Finally, mismatch repair has been postulated to play a role in the removal of alkylated DNA adducts such as O6-meG (reviewed in 23Karran P. Bignami M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2933-2940Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that mismatch repair is not only responsible for correcting mismatches derived from errors in DNA metabolism, but is also involved in the processing of DNA adducts induced by environmental carcinogens. Our results here show that hMutSα is capable of recognizing deoxyguanosine adducts of AAF and AF in duplex DNA. The interaction between hMutSα and the DNA adducts is inhibited by ATP, which is similar to the interaction of hMutSα with mispairs (12Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Google Scholar). The ATP inhibition suggests that the protein binds to mispairs and to the carcinogen adducts through a similar mechanism. It is generally believed that all mispairs (including base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion mispairs) adopt polymorphic (at least two) conformations which more or less destabilize DNA structure depending on different mispairs and their neighboring bases (reviewed in 41Fazakerley G.V. Boulard Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 145-163Google Scholar). Similar to the mismatches, the dG-AF and dG-AAF adducts have been suggested to exist in at least two conformations, with the fluorene ring either inserted into the helix (base displacement) or located on the exterior of the helix although the AF structure (see Fig. 1A) produces less distortion in the DNA helix than the closely related AAF adduct (reviewed in 25Heflich R.H. Neft R. Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 73-174Google Scholar). The extent of DNA distortion by these adducts is also dependent on the sequence within which the adduct is located. Therefore, it is possible that one or all of these structures may mimic structures caused by a base-base mismatch or an insertion/deletion mispair and that it is these common features in these structures that are recognized by the MutS homologs. It is known that mismatch recognition by MutS or its homologs is the initiation step of the mismatch repair pathway, which leads to the correction of base-base mismatches or small insertion/deletion mispairs by the system in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Therefore, the binding of hMutSα to AF and AAF adducts in duplex DNA supports direct participation of human mismatch repair in the processing of DNA damage caused by chemical carcinogens, although further biochemical as well as biological studies are required to address this question.

https://openalex.org/W2000232064,"We have shown that bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase (EC), purified to homogeneity, is a multifunctional enzyme. A time-dependent formation of cADPR from NAD+ that did not exceed 1.5-2% of the reaction products was measurable. The cyclase activity of this enzyme was, however, best evidenced by its transformation of NGD+ into cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR). The formation of the cyclic compound could be monitored spectroscopically (UV and fluorescence) and by high-performance liquid chromatography; the product ratio of cGDPR/GDP-ribose was 2:1. Bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is also able to hydrolyze cADPR (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al.

INTRODUCTIONCyclic ADP-ribose, which was originally discovered in sea urchin eggs, is thought to be the endogenous regulator of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process mediated by the ryanodine receptors (reviewed in 18Lee H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 229-235Google Scholar et al., 1994). In invertebrates, this new metabolite is the exclusive reaction product obtained from NAD+ by an ADP-ribosyl cyclase (19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Google Scholar and Aarhus, 1991; 11Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Google Scholar and Strumwasser, 1991). In mammalian tissues no equivalent enzyme could be detected; however, a high sequence homology was found between the cyclase from Aplysia californica and CD38, a human lymphocyte cell surface antigen, for which no biological activity was hitherto known (34States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Google Scholar et al., 1992). CD38 revealed itself to be a multifunctional enzyme; i.e. in addition to catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of NAD+ into ADP-ribose, it was also able to produce cADPR, 1The abbreviations used are: cADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNGD+nicotinamide guanine dinucleotidecGDPRcyclic GDP-riboseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propane-sulfonateHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatography. albeit in small amounts (less than 2-3% of reaction products), and to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.F. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar et al., 1993). Similar catalytic activity had previously been established for a canine spleen enzyme that had the characteristics of a NAD+ glycohydrolase (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a). The low yield of cADPR production by these mammalian systems was attributed to their multifunctionality: the cyclic metabolite does not accumulate because it is turned over by the same enzyme that produces it (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a; 18Lee H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 229-235Google Scholar, 1994; 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 354-355Google Scholar et al., 1995). In apparent agreement with this hypothesis, it was established by 7Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Google Scholar et al. (1994) that NGD+, an analogue of NAD+, is converted in high yield by CD38 into cyclic GDP-ribose, a metabolite that cannot be further transformed.Since the occurrence of CD38 was originally thought to be restricted to B and T lymphocytes (23Malavasi F. Funaro A. Roggero S. Horenstein A. Calosso L. Mehta K. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 95-97Google Scholar et al., 1994; 22Lund F. Solvason N. Grimaldi J.C. Parkhouse R.M.E. Howard M. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 469-473Google Scholar et al., 1995) and erythrocytes (39Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida U. Benatti A. Bargellesi A. Malavasi F. Lee H.C. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1459-1465Google Scholar et al., 1993), it was of interest to broaden the issue of the biosynthesis of cADPR in mammalian systems by investigating the possible contribution of the classical NAD(P)+ glycohydrolases (EC and 3.2.2.6). These enzymes have been known for several decades and they have a wider tissular and cellular distribution than CD38 (28Price S.R. Pekala P.H. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. Vol 2B. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 513Google Scholar and Pekala, 1987). We have been engaged for many years in the study of the molecular mechanism of bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase and have shown conclusively that this enzyme catalyzes a dissociative mechanism; i.e. the nicotinamide-ribose bond is cleaved to generate an enzyme-stabilized oxocarbenium ion-type intermediate that reacts in a non-rate-limiting step with acceptors such as water (hydrolysis), methanol (methanolysis), or pyridines (transglycosidation) (32Schuber F. Travo P. Pascal M. Bioorg. Chem. 1979; 8: 83-90Google Scholar et al., 1979; 35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987; 36Tarnus C. Muller H.M. Schuber F.

Recently we have also shown that this enzyme was able to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose; the measured kinetic parameters, however, excluded the possibility that cADPR is a kinetically competent reaction intermediate in the conversion of NAD+ into ADP-ribose (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994).In the present study we provide evidence that bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase can cyclize NGD+ into cGDPR in high yields and that the low net conversion of NAD+ into cADPR is not due to a fast turnover that prevents it from accumulating but to a lesser reactivity of the adenine ring, compared to guanine, with the intermediary oxocarbenium ion.DISCUSSIONThe mode of formation of cyclic ADP-ribose by mammalian systems and its relevance to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is still under intense study (20Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Vol 48. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 199Google Scholar et al., 1994). In this communication, we have shown that the “classical” bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is able to catalyze the transformation of NAD+ into ADP-ribose (its classical hydrolytic reaction) and into a small fraction of cADPR (less than 2%). The cyclase activity of this enzyme was much better evidenced when using NGD+ as substrate, where cGDPR represented the major reaction product. Moreover, as shown previously, this NAD+ glycohydrolase is also able to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), but in contrast does not readily convert cGDPR into GDP-ribose. Altogether, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase shares with CD38 (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.F. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar et al., 1993) and a recently described canine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a) the different catalytic activities that are involved in the metabolism of cADPR. Such a result, of course, raises the question of the identity and/or the differences in tissular localization and functions between CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolases. Although it recently became apparent that the distribution of CD38 is somewhat wider than was previously believed (6Funaro A. Horenstein A.L. Malavasi F. Fundam. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 3: 101-113Google Scholar et al., 1995), it should be emphasized that NAD+ glycohydrolases are found associated with cells such as Kupffer cells in liver (1Amar-Costesec A. Prado-Figueroa M. Beaufay H. Nagelkerke J.F. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 189-197Google Scholar et al., 1985) and microglial cells (4Bocchini V. Rebel G. Massarelli R. Schuber F. Muller C.D. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1988; 6: 525-534Google Scholar et al., 1988) and with organelles such as mitochondria (24Masmoudi A. Mandel P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1965-1969Google Scholar and Mandel, 1987), where no CD38 has been reported so far.An important issue is the very low production of cADPR by the mammalian enzymes, as compared to the invertebrate ADP-ribosyl cyclases. This was attributed to the absence of accumulation of the cyclic metabolite because of its fast hydrolysis by the very same enzyme that produces it. Several mechanisms have been published to explain that point (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a; 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 354-355Google Scholar et al., 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996), and since the outcome of the reaction catalyzed by NAD+ glycohydrolases is that of an ADP-ribosyl cyclase coupled to an cADPR hydrolase, it has been proposed that these enzymes, for which no physiological roles had been found so far, were similar to CD38; i.e. enzymes whose multifunctionality had been overlooked. If from our studies it seems obvious that classical mammalian NAD+ glycohydrolases are indeed multifunctional, their very low production of cADPR from NAD+ cannot be attributed to a fast hydrolysis of this cyclic metabolite into ADP-ribose. On the contrary, as shown in this study, the very limited capacity of calf spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase to generate cADPR is a direct consequence of the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. We have conclusively demonstrated that the cyclization reactions, which involve the N-1-position of adenine and the N-7-position of guanine in NAD+ and NGD+, respectively, are in competition with the nucleophilic attack of a common intermediary oxocarbenium ion by a water molecule that yields A(G)DP-ribose (Fig. 4). A question is raised about the origin of such a marked difference in the extent of cADPR and cGDPR formation. It is well known that in adenine the most nucleophilic position is N-1, whereas in guanine it is N-7 (14Jones J.W. Robins R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 193-201Google Scholar and Robins, 1963; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975); it is therefore probably not a coincidence that the cyclic compounds that are formed are precisely the ones that involve these nucleophilic centers in the purine rings. Moreover, the fact that 1,N6-etheno-NAD+, whose N-1 is masked, is also cyclized at position N-7 (38Zhang F.-J. Sih C.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 9289-9292Google Scholar and Sih, 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996) indicates that in the active site of these enzymes, the purine rings do not have a fixed binding pattern. It appears therefore that the differences in the formation in cADPR and cGDPR in this intramolecular cyclization reaction might reflect the differences in nucleophilicity of the two nitrogens in the active site of the enzyme; indeed, it is well known that in many reactions involving the alkylation of bases, N-7 of the guanine ring is more nucleophilic than N-1 of adenine (5Brown D.M. Ts'o P.O.P. Basic Principles in Nucleic Acid Chemistry. Vol 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 1Google Scholar, 1974; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975; 3Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar et al., 1980). Interestingly, a high sensitivity of NAD+ glycohydrolases to the nucleophilicity of attacking pyridines, which yield by transglycosidation pyridinium analogues of NAD+, has been noted before (37Yost D.A. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3075-3080Google Scholar and Anderson, 1983; 35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987).Since the hydrolysis of the cyclic compounds by NAD+ glycohydrolase is also expected to yield an intermediary oxocarbenium ion (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), the observation that cADPR is hydrolyzed much better than cGDPR is, on the first analysis, in good agreement with our previous studies, which demonstrated a very high dependence of the rate of such reactions on the pKa of the leaving group (βlg = −0.9) and an excellent correlation with the chemical stability of the pyridinium-ribose bond (35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987). Under unimolecular hydrolysis conditions (pH 6.0), however, the half-life of cGDPR is only about 5-fold higher than that of cADPR, indicating that the difference in energy of their scissile bonds is not as important as anticipated from their behavior as substrates of NAD+ glycohydrolase. It seems, therefore, that other factors are of importance in explaining such differences, which might be related to e.g. the mode of binding of cADPR and cGDPR to the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, since the energy of the ribose-nitrogen bonds in cA(G)DPR also reflects the nucleophilicity of the N-1 and N-7 positions in the adenine and guanine moieties during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization reactions, the much favored formation of cGDPR might also indicate the occurrence of additional factors, such as e.g. a better positioning, within the active site, of the guanine with respect to the reaction with the oxocarbenium ion (Fig. 4). Interestingly, during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization step, the attacking purine rings must adopt opposite configurations, i.e. syn and anti for cADPR and cGDPR, respectively, which are the less favored in solution.The fact that NAD+ glycohydrolase is an efficient GDP-ribosyl cyclase and hydrolyzes cADPR is also an important indication with regard to the conformation of the substrates when bound to its active site. In contrast to toxins (2Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Google Scholar and Eisenberg, 1996) and to oxidoreductases having a “Rossmann fold” 30Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 61-102Google Scholar et al., 1975), where NAD+ is bond in an extended conformation (i.e. the adenine and nicotinamide moieties are apart), in the present case the substrates must adopt a more “closed” conformation, i.e. a nicotinamide-adenine stacked conformation, reminiscent of the form that is found in solution (29Reisbig R.R. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1974-1984Google Scholar and Woody, 1978; 27Oppenheimer N.J. Everse J. Anderson B. You K.-S. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, New York1982: 51Google Scholar, 1982). Such a conformation might even be more compact on binding to the active site, inducing some strain, resulting for example in unfavorable nonbonded interactions in the NMN+ moiety, which could be released when going to the transition state and thus explain some of the catalysis in the N-glycosidic bond destabilization.In conclusion, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is a multifunctional enzyme that, similarly to CD38, is involved in the metabolism of cADPR. The low proportion of cADPR formed from NAD+ might be nevertheless high enough to be of physiological significance in Ca2+ signaling (9Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359Google Scholar et al., 1995). Importantly, the mechanism we propose for the formation of the cyclic metabolite, which is based on the partitioning of the oxocarbenium reaction intermediate between an intramolecular attack by the N-1 position of adenine and an intermolecular reaction by a water molecule, predicts that small changes in the conformation of the active site of the enzyme might have dramatic consequences on the extent of cyclization. Thus, a nonbonded interaction (“cross-talk”) with a neighboring protein (dimerization or with another receptor) of this ectoenzyme might change the topology of its active site and favor the cyclization reaction. INTRODUCTIONCyclic ADP-ribose, which was originally discovered in sea urchin eggs, is thought to be the endogenous regulator of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process mediated by the ryanodine receptors (reviewed in 18Lee H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 229-235Google Scholar et al., 1994). In invertebrates, this new metabolite is the exclusive reaction product obtained from NAD+ by an ADP-ribosyl cyclase (19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Google Scholar and Aarhus, 1991; 11Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Google Scholar and Strumwasser, 1991). In mammalian tissues no equivalent enzyme could be detected; however, a high sequence homology was found between the cyclase from Aplysia californica and CD38, a human lymphocyte cell surface antigen, for which no biological activity was hitherto known (34States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Google Scholar et al., 1992). CD38 revealed itself to be a multifunctional enzyme; i.e. in addition to catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of NAD+ into ADP-ribose, it was also able to produce cADPR, 1The abbreviations used are: cADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNGD+nicotinamide guanine dinucleotidecGDPRcyclic GDP-riboseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propane-sulfonateHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatography. albeit in small amounts (less than 2-3% of reaction products), and to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.F. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar et al., 1993). Similar catalytic activity had previously been established for a canine spleen enzyme that had the characteristics of a NAD+ glycohydrolase (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a). The low yield of cADPR production by these mammalian systems was attributed to their multifunctionality: the cyclic metabolite does not accumulate because it is turned over by the same enzyme that produces it (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a; 18Lee H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 229-235Google Scholar, 1994; 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F.

Commun. 1993; 196: 1459-1465Google Scholar et al., 1993), it was of interest to broaden the issue of the biosynthesis of cADPR in mammalian systems by investigating the possible contribution of the classical NAD(P)+ glycohydrolases (EC and 3.2.2.6). These enzymes have been known for several decades and they have a wider tissular and cellular distribution than CD38 (28Price S.R. Pekala P.H. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. Vol 2B. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 513Google Scholar and Pekala, 1987). We have been engaged for many years in the study of the molecular mechanism of bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase and have shown conclusively that this enzyme catalyzes a dissociative mechanism; i.e. the nicotinamide-ribose bond is cleaved to generate an enzyme-stabilized oxocarbenium ion-type intermediate that reacts in a non-rate-limiting step with acceptors such as water (hydrolysis), methanol (methanolysis), or pyridines (transglycosidation) (32Schuber F.

Recently we have also shown that this enzyme was able to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose; the measured kinetic parameters, however, excluded the possibility that cADPR is a kinetically competent reaction intermediate in the conversion of NAD+ into ADP-ribose (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994).In the present study we provide evidence that bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase can cyclize NGD+ into cGDPR in high yields and that the low net conversion of NAD+ into cADPR is not due to a fast turnover that prevents it from accumulating but to a lesser reactivity of the adenine ring, compared to guanine, with the intermediary oxocarbenium ion.

In the present study we provide evidence that bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase can cyclize NGD+ into cGDPR in high yields and that the low net conversion of NAD+ into cADPR is not due to a fast turnover that prevents it from accumulating but to a lesser reactivity of the adenine ring, compared to guanine, with the intermediary oxocarbenium ion. DISCUSSIONThe mode of formation of cyclic ADP-ribose by mammalian systems and its relevance to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is still under intense study (20Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Vol 48. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 199Google Scholar et al., 1994). In this communication, we have shown that the “classical” bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is able to catalyze the transformation of NAD+ into ADP-ribose (its classical hydrolytic reaction) and into a small fraction of cADPR (less than 2%). The cyclase activity of this enzyme was much better evidenced when using NGD+ as substrate, where cGDPR represented the major reaction product. Moreover, as shown previously, this NAD+ glycohydrolase is also able to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), but in contrast does not readily convert cGDPR into GDP-ribose. Altogether, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase shares with CD38 (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.F. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar et al., 1993) and a recently described canine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a) the different catalytic activities that are involved in the metabolism of cADPR. Such a result, of course, raises the question of the identity and/or the differences in tissular localization and functions between CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolases. Although it recently became apparent that the distribution of CD38 is somewhat wider than was previously believed (6Funaro A. Horenstein A.L. Malavasi F. Fundam. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 3: 101-113Google Scholar et al., 1995), it should be emphasized that NAD+ glycohydrolases are found associated with cells such as Kupffer cells in liver (1Amar-Costesec A. Prado-Figueroa M. Beaufay H. Nagelkerke J.F. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 189-197Google Scholar et al., 1985) and microglial cells (4Bocchini V. Rebel G. Massarelli R. Schuber F. Muller C.D. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1988; 6: 525-534Google Scholar et al., 1988) and with organelles such as mitochondria (24Masmoudi A. Mandel P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1965-1969Google Scholar and Mandel, 1987), where no CD38 has been reported so far.An important issue is the very low production of cADPR by the mammalian enzymes, as compared to the invertebrate ADP-ribosyl cyclases. This was attributed to the absence of accumulation of the cyclic metabolite because of its fast hydrolysis by the very same enzyme that produces it. Several mechanisms have been published to explain that point (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a; 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 354-355Google Scholar et al., 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996), and since the outcome of the reaction catalyzed by NAD+ glycohydrolases is that of an ADP-ribosyl cyclase coupled to an cADPR hydrolase, it has been proposed that these enzymes, for which no physiological roles had been found so far, were similar to CD38; i.e. enzymes whose multifunctionality had been overlooked. If from our studies it seems obvious that classical mammalian NAD+ glycohydrolases are indeed multifunctional, their very low production of cADPR from NAD+ cannot be attributed to a fast hydrolysis of this cyclic metabolite into ADP-ribose. On the contrary, as shown in this study, the very limited capacity of calf spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase to generate cADPR is a direct consequence of the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. We have conclusively demonstrated that the cyclization reactions, which involve the N-1-position of adenine and the N-7-position of guanine in NAD+ and NGD+, respectively, are in competition with the nucleophilic attack of a common intermediary oxocarbenium ion by a water molecule that yields A(G)DP-ribose (Fig. 4). A question is raised about the origin of such a marked difference in the extent of cADPR and cGDPR formation. It is well known that in adenine the most nucleophilic position is N-1, whereas in guanine it is N-7 (14Jones J.W. Robins R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 193-201Google Scholar and Robins, 1963; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975); it is therefore probably not a coincidence that the cyclic compounds that are formed are precisely the ones that involve these nucleophilic centers in the purine rings. Moreover, the fact that 1,N6-etheno-NAD+, whose N-1 is masked, is also cyclized at position N-7 (38Zhang F.-J. Sih C.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 9289-9292Google Scholar and Sih, 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996) indicates that in the active site of these enzymes, the purine rings do not have a fixed binding pattern. It appears therefore that the differences in the formation in cADPR and cGDPR in this intramolecular cyclization reaction might reflect the differences in nucleophilicity of the two nitrogens in the active site of the enzyme; indeed, it is well known that in many reactions involving the alkylation of bases, N-7 of the guanine ring is more nucleophilic than N-1 of adenine (5Brown D.M. Ts'o P.O.P. Basic Principles in Nucleic Acid Chemistry. Vol 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 1Google Scholar, 1974; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975; 3Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar et al., 1980). Interestingly, a high sensitivity of NAD+ glycohydrolases to the nucleophilicity of attacking pyridines, which yield by transglycosidation pyridinium analogues of NAD+, has been noted before (37Yost D.A. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3075-3080Google Scholar and Anderson, 1983; 35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987).Since the hydrolysis of the cyclic compounds by NAD+ glycohydrolase is also expected to yield an intermediary oxocarbenium ion (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), the observation that cADPR is hydrolyzed much better than cGDPR is, on the first analysis, in good agreement with our previous studies, which demonstrated a very high dependence of the rate of such reactions on the pKa of the leaving group (βlg = −0.9) and an excellent correlation with the chemical stability of the pyridinium-ribose bond (35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987). Under unimolecular hydrolysis conditions (pH 6.0), however, the half-life of cGDPR is only about 5-fold higher than that of cADPR, indicating that the difference in energy of their scissile bonds is not as important as anticipated from their behavior as substrates of NAD+ glycohydrolase. It seems, therefore, that other factors are of importance in explaining such differences, which might be related to e.g. the mode of binding of cADPR and cGDPR to the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, since the energy of the ribose-nitrogen bonds in cA(G)DPR also reflects the nucleophilicity of the N-1 and N-7 positions in the adenine and guanine moieties during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization reactions, the much favored formation of cGDPR might also indicate the occurrence of additional factors, such as e.g. a better positioning, within the active site, of the guanine with respect to the reaction with the oxocarbenium ion (Fig. 4). Interestingly, during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization step, the attacking purine rings must adopt opposite configurations, i.e. syn and anti for cADPR and cGDPR, respectively, which are the less favored in solution.The fact that NAD+ glycohydrolase is an efficient GDP-ribosyl cyclase and hydrolyzes cADPR is also an important indication with regard to the conformation of the substrates when bound to its active site. In contrast to toxins (2Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Google Scholar and Eisenberg, 1996) and to oxidoreductases having a “Rossmann fold” 30Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 61-102Google Scholar et al., 1975), where NAD+ is bond in an extended conformation (i.e. the adenine and nicotinamide moieties are apart), in the present case the substrates must adopt a more “closed” conformation, i.e. a nicotinamide-adenine stacked conformation, reminiscent of the form that is found in solution (29Reisbig R.R.

Such a conformation might even be more compact on binding to the active site, inducing some strain, resulting for example in unfavorable nonbonded interactions in the NMN+ moiety, which could be released when going to the transition state and thus explain some of the catalysis in the N-glycosidic bond destabilization.In conclusion, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is a multifunctional enzyme that, similarly to CD38, is involved in the metabolism of cADPR. The low proportion of cADPR formed from NAD+ might be nevertheless high enough to be of physiological significance in Ca2+ signaling (9Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359Google Scholar et al., 1995). Importantly, the mechanism we propose for the formation of the cyclic metabolite, which is based on the partitioning of the oxocarbenium reaction intermediate between an intramolecular attack by the N-1 position of adenine and an intermolecular reaction by a water molecule, predicts that small changes in the conformation of the active site of the enzyme might have dramatic consequences on the extent of cyclization. Thus, a nonbonded interaction (“cross-talk”) with a neighboring protein (dimerization or with another receptor) of this ectoenzyme might change the topology of its active site and favor the cyclization reaction. The mode of formation of cyclic ADP-ribose by mammalian systems and its relevance to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ is still under intense study (20Lee H.C. Galione A. Walseth T.F. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Vol 48. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 199Google Scholar et al., 1994). In this communication, we have shown that the “classical” bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is able to catalyze the transformation of NAD+ into ADP-ribose (its classical hydrolytic reaction) and into a small fraction of cADPR (less than 2%). The cyclase activity of this enzyme was much better evidenced when using NGD+ as substrate, where cGDPR represented the major reaction product. Moreover, as shown previously, this NAD+ glycohydrolase is also able to hydrolyze cADPR into ADP-ribose (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), but in contrast does not readily convert cGDPR into GDP-ribose. Altogether, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase shares with CD38 (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.F. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Google Scholar et al., 1993) and a recently described canine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a) the different catalytic activities that are involved in the metabolism of cADPR. Such a result, of course, raises the question of the identity and/or the differences in tissular localization and functions between CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolases. Although it recently became apparent that the distribution of CD38 is somewhat wider than was previously believed (6Funaro A. Horenstein A.L. Malavasi F. Fundam. Clin. Immunol. 1995; 3: 101-113Google Scholar et al., 1995), it should be emphasized that NAD+ glycohydrolases are found associated with cells such as Kupffer cells in liver (1Amar-Costesec A. Prado-Figueroa M. Beaufay H. Nagelkerke J.F. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 189-197Google Scholar et al., 1985) and microglial cells (4Bocchini V. Rebel G. Massarelli R. Schuber F. Muller C.D. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1988; 6: 525-534Google Scholar et al., 1988) and with organelles such as mitochondria (24Masmoudi A. Mandel P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1965-1969Google Scholar and Mandel, 1987), where no CD38 has been reported so far. An important issue is the very low production of cADPR by the mammalian enzymes, as compared to the invertebrate ADP-ribosyl cyclases. This was attributed to the absence of accumulation of the cyclic metabolite because of its fast hydrolysis by the very same enzyme that produces it. Several mechanisms have been published to explain that point (15Kim H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Science. 1993; 261: 1330-1333Google Scholar et al., 1993a; 21Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 354-355Google Scholar et al., 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996), and since the outcome of the reaction catalyzed by NAD+ glycohydrolases is that of an ADP-ribosyl cyclase coupled to an cADPR hydrolase, it has been proposed that these enzymes, for which no physiological roles had been found so far, were similar to CD38; i.e. enzymes whose multifunctionality had been overlooked. If from our studies it seems obvious that classical mammalian NAD+ glycohydrolases are indeed multifunctional, their very low production of cADPR from NAD+ cannot be attributed to a fast hydrolysis of this cyclic metabolite into ADP-ribose. On the contrary, as shown in this study, the very limited capacity of calf spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase to generate cADPR is a direct consequence of the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. We have conclusively demonstrated that the cyclization reactions, which involve the N-1-position of adenine and the N-7-position of guanine in NAD+ and NGD+, respectively, are in competition with the nucleophilic attack of a common intermediary oxocarbenium ion by a water molecule that yields A(G)DP-ribose (Fig. 4). A question is raised about the origin of such a marked difference in the extent of cADPR and cGDPR formation. It is well known that in adenine the most nucleophilic position is N-1, whereas in guanine it is N-7 (14Jones J.W. Robins R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 193-201Google Scholar and Robins, 1963; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975); it is therefore probably not a coincidence that the cyclic compounds that are formed are precisely the ones that involve these nucleophilic centers in the purine rings. Moreover, the fact that 1,N6-etheno-NAD+, whose N-1 is masked, is also cyclized at position N-7 (38Zhang F.-J. Sih C.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 9289-9292Google Scholar and Sih, 1995; 8Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Google Scholar et al., 1996) indicates that in the active site of these enzymes, the purine rings do not have a fixed binding pattern. It appears therefore that the differences in the formation in cADPR and cGDPR in this intramolecular cyclization reaction might reflect the differences in nucleophilicity of the two nitrogens in the active site of the enzyme; indeed, it is well known that in many reactions involving the alkylation of bases, N-7 of the guanine ring is more nucleophilic than N-1 of adenine (5Brown D.M. Ts'o P.O.P. Basic Principles in Nucleic Acid Chemistry. Vol 2. Academic Press, New York1974: 1Google Scholar, 1974; 33Singer B. Cohen W.E. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Vol 15. Academic Press, New York1975: 219Google Scholar, 1975; 3Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Google Scholar et al., 1980). Interestingly, a high sensitivity of NAD+ glycohydrolases to the nucleophilicity of attacking pyridines, which yield by transglycosidation pyridinium analogues of NAD+, has been noted before (37Yost D.A. Anderson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3075-3080Google Scholar and Anderson, 1983; 35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987). Since the hydrolysis of the cyclic compounds by NAD+ glycohydrolase is also expected to yield an intermediary oxocarbenium ion (26Muller-Steffner H. Muzard M. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1279-1285Google Scholar et al., 1994), the observation that cADPR is hydrolyzed much better than cGDPR is, on the first analysis, in good agreement with our previous studies, which demonstrated a very high dependence of the rate of such reactions on the pKa of the leaving group (βlg = −0.9) and an excellent correlation with the chemical stability of the pyridinium-ribose bond (35Tarnus C. Schuber F. Bioorg. Chem. 1987; 15: 31-42Google Scholar and Schuber, 1987). Under unimolecular hydrolysis conditions (pH 6.0), however, the half-life of cGDPR is only about 5-fold higher than that of cADPR, indicating that the difference in energy of their scissile bonds is not as important as anticipated from their behavior as substrates of NAD+ glycohydrolase. It seems, therefore, that other factors are of importance in explaining such differences, which might be related to e.g. the mode of binding of cADPR and cGDPR to the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, since the energy of the ribose-nitrogen bonds in cA(G)DPR also reflects the nucleophilicity of the N-1 and N-7 positions in the adenine and guanine moieties during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization reactions, the much favored formation of cGDPR might also indicate the occurrence of additional factors, such as e.g. a better positioning, within the active site, of the guanine with respect to the reaction with the oxocarbenium ion (Fig. 4). Interestingly, during the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization step, the attacking purine rings must adopt opposite configurations, i.e. syn and anti for cADPR and cGDPR, respectively, which are the less favored in solution. The fact that NAD+ glycohydrolase is an efficient GDP-ribosyl cyclase and hydrolyzes cADPR is also an important indication with regard to the conformation of the substrates when bound to its active site. In contrast to toxins (2Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Google Scholar and Eisenberg, 1996) and to oxidoreductases having a “Rossmann fold” 30Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 61-102Google Scholar et al., 1975), where NAD+ is bond in an extended conformation (i.e. the adenine and nicotinamide moieties are apart), in the present case the substrates must adopt a more “closed” conformation, i.e. a nicotinamide-adenine stacked conformation, reminiscent of the form that is found in solution (29Reisbig R.R. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1974-1984Google Scholar and Woody, 1978; 27Oppenheimer N.J. Everse J. Anderson B. You K.-S. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, New York1982: 51Google Scholar, 1982). Such a conformation might even be more compact on binding to the active site, inducing some strain, resulting for example in unfavorable nonbonded interactions in the NMN+ moiety, which could be released when going to the transition state and thus explain some of the catalysis in the N-glycosidic bond destabilization. In conclusion, bovine spleen NAD+ glycohydrolase is a multifunctional enzyme that, similarly to CD38, is involved in the metabolism of cADPR. The low proportion of cADPR formed from NAD+ might be nevertheless high enough to be of physiological significance in Ca2+ signaling (9Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Emmrich F. Ashamu G.A. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3353-3359Google Scholar et al., 1995).

Thus, a nonbonded interaction (“cross-talk”) with a neighboring protein (dimerization or with another receptor) of this ectoenzyme might change the topology of its active site and favor the cyclization reaction.

The suppressors function through heterodimerization with the death promoters, Bax and related proteins, thus establishing a set point within the cell that determines whether or not apoptosis is executed in response to a death signal. Sequence similarities between 19K and Bcl-2 are largely restricted to short Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains that mediate interaction with Bax. The BH1 sequence in 19K is degenerate but nevertheless contains a conserved glycine residue found in all family members that when mutated to alanine in Bcl-2 results in loss of Bcl-2 function and ability to dimerize with Bax (Yin, X.-M., Oltvai, Z. N., and Korsmeyer, S. J. (1994) Nature 369, 321-323). Here, we show that the analogous mutation in BH1 of 19K also abrogates the anti-apoptotic properties of 19K and its ability to interact with Bax, thus establishing the critical importance of this residue within BH1 and the likely similarity of Bcl-2 and 19K function. In distinct contrast to Bcl-2, however, 19K interaction was not detected with Bad, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL dimerizing protein that can potentially regulate a Bax·Bcl-2/Bcl-XL survival set point and reinstate susceptibility to a death signal. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic function of 19K was not overcome by enforced expression of Bad in transfected cells. This feature of 19K may provide adenovirus with a selective advantage in evading premature induction of apoptosis by the host cell.

This feature of 19K may provide adenovirus with a selective advantage in evading premature induction of apoptosis by the host cell. Apoptotic cell death is essential for tissue modeling and homeostasis in metazoans and provides the organism with the ability to selectively remove cells that are targets of various types of growth deregulating events (1Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet... 1995; 11: 101-105Google Scholar, 2Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Examples of such events include activation of oncogene expression and viral infection (3White E. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Although the demise of the cell is initially triggered upon receipt of a specific death signal, execution of the apoptotic pathway occurs only upon activation of critical Ced-3/ICE cysteine proteases, which cleave and inactivate/activate specific target molecules (4Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Kumar S. Harvey M.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Whyte M. Evan G. Nature. 1995; 376: 17-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whether or not the Ced-3/ICE pathway is activated by a death signal, however, depends on the status of various cellular regulators of apoptosis (1Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5752) Google Scholar). Together, the heterodimerizing partners establish a set point within the cell that determines whether or not the cell will ultimately respond to a death signal. Homo- and heterodimerization is dependent upon short Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BHBcl-2 homology19K19-kDa protein encoded by adenovirus serotype 5 early region 1BHAinfluenza virus hemagglutinin epitopePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. domains within the polypeptides, one of which (BH1) is critical for Bax·Bcl-2 heterodimerization but not Bcl-2 homodimerization (14Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Bad, a more distantly related protein that contains BH domains, is a direct regulator of the set point (15Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). It heterodimerizes with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL but does not interact with itself or with Bax. Thus, it has the potential to readjust a Bax·Bcl-2/Bcl-XL set point that would otherwise specify cell survival following a death signal to one that specifies apoptosis (15Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Although it is not presently known how the set point controls whether or not the cell will engage the apoptotic program, recent studies have shown that Bcl-2/Bcl-XL operates either at or upstream of processing of pro-CPP32/apopain/Yama (16Boulakia C.A.

In the case of Bcl-2, a relatively conservative mutation within the BH1 domain, which changes glycine at position 145 to alanine, abrogates the death suppressor function and ability of Bcl-2 to interact with Bax (14Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Although the corresponding 19K BH1 domain is relatively degenerate compared with other family members, it contains the analogous glycine. We show here that mutation of this glycine to alanine has the same detrimental effect on 19K, which implicates this highly conserved amino acid position within all known BH1 domains as critically important for function. Of note, however, we also find that in distinct contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, interaction of 19K with Bad was not detected. This has particular significance because it suggests that the polypeptide sequence of 19K has evolved to avoid negative regulation by Bad, a feature that may provide adenovirus with a selective advantage in evading premature killing of the host cell. Standard recombinant polymerase chain reaction methodology was employed to insert oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope, (M)AYPDYVPDYAV, at the 3′-end and 5′-end, respectively, of the protein-coding sequence of E1B 19K and BCL-2 cDNA (25Nguyen M.

The authenticity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The vectors were transfected into CHO LR73 cells, as described previously (30Chen G. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 55-59Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and stable transfectants obtained by selection in G418 or hygromycin B and identified by Western blot analysis. Cell lines expressing various levels of the individual proteins were isolated. To establish co-expressing lines, cellular clones that had been selected in one drug were subsequently transfected and selected in the other drug and characterized by Western blotting. Cells were grown to ∼80% confluency in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Puromycin (50 μg/ml) or staurosporin (6.0 μM) were added, total cells subsequently were collected at various times, and the percentage of the cells that excluded trypan blue was determined in two independent experiments, and the results were averaged as described (25Nguyen M.

Cell Res. 1995; 221: 55-59Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted 3-5 times and yielded results very similar to those presented. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with P-9 rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bax, 12CA5 mouse monoclonal anti-HA, 6C8 hamster monoclonal anti-Bcl-2, rabbit polyclonal anti-19K, or rabbit polyclonal sc-943 anti-Bad. Following incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, color was developed with NBT/BCIP (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines containing equivalent amounts of HA-Bcl-2, HA-19K, or neither protein (neo controls) were grown to ∼80% confluency, collected following trypsinization, and washed, and the cells were homogenized at 4°C in medium containing 2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis-(β-aminoethylether)N,N′-tetraacetate, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]Bax or [35S]Bad transcription-translation product (34Nguyen M. Miller D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gradually diluted with 4.5 volumes of homogenization medium lacking detergent, and incubated for 1 h at 4°C prior to addition of 12CA5 anti-HA. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Because Bcl-2 functions as a heterodimerizing partner with Bax (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5752) Google Scholar), the ratio of the two proteins, rather than absolute levels, is an important determinant of the final outcome for a cell that receives a death signal (1Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet... 1995; 11: 101-105Google Scholar, 10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5752) Google Scholar). This is also true for other Bax-interacting members of the Bcl-2 family (15Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar, 31Subramanian T. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2403-2409PubMed Google Scholar, 32Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To study the ability of enforced expression of Bax to overcome the activity of a death suppressor, therefore, it is important to compare these co-expressing cells with ones that express the same level of the death suppressor in the absence of Bax. To that end, stable CHO LR73 cell lines were established that express equivalent levels of 19K plus or minus Bax (Fig. 1, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2) or equivalent levels of Bcl-2 plus or minus Bax (Fig. 1, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5), as judged by Western blot analysis. Cell lines were also generated that contain Bax alone, at levels that are equivalent to the level of Bax in the co-expressing cell lines (Fig. 1, lower panel, compare lane 2 with lane 3 and lane 5 with lane 6). A number of such cell lines were created and each gave relative responses to death signals that were comparable with those described below. The stable cell lines that were analyzed in Fig. 1 by Western blotting were also examined for their susceptibility to a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death, puromycin (35Kochi S.K. Collier R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In common with other systems (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5752) Google Scholar), enforced expression of BAX alone had only a slight enhancing effect on the rate of cell death in response to the drug relative to neo control cells but overcame the otherwise protective effect against the drug that was conferred by Bcl-2 (Fig. 2, upper graph). Whereas cells expressing neo, either alone or together with BAX, were almost all killed by 48 h after receiving 50 μg/ml of the drug, approximately 85% of the cells that express BCL-2 remained viable during this period. Co-expression of BAX with BCL-2, however, reduced the cell survival level to 30-35% at 48 h after receiving puromycin, and this was reduced to the level of neo controls by 72 h. A very similar pattern and extent of protection against puromycin and abrogation of this protection by Bax were also observed for E1B 19K (Fig. 2, lower panel). Fig. 3 shows the sequences of BH1 domains in various Bcl-2 family members (from 1Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet... 1995; 11: 101-105Google Scholar) and aligns these regions to a sequence in adenovirus serotype 5 E1B 19K (37Gingeras T.R. Sciaky D. Gelinas R.E. Bing-Dong J. Yen C.E. Kelly M.M. Bullock P.A. Parsons B.L. O'Neil K.E. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13475-13491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from amino acid 85 to 96 that shows similarity to the BH1 domains in these other proteins. The similarity, however, is relatively weak and in fact is less than that observed for the evolutionarily distant Bcl-2 homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans, Ced-9 (14Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 33Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, this predicted BH1 domain of 19K contains the highly conserved GR, which is present in all family members and whose glycine moiety is important for function. A relatively conservative change of this glycine to alanine at residue 145 of Bcl-2 results in loss of both Bcl-2 function and its ability to heterodimerize with Bax (14Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine if the predicted BH1 domain of 19K is of functional significance, the same mutation was introduced at residue 87 of 19K (designated 19K G87A) (Fig. 3). Several cell lines were created in CHO LR73 that express various levels of the mutant 19K protein, and in all cases, the G87A mutation was found to result in loss of 19K protection against puromycin treatment compared with an equivalent level of wild-type 19K. An example of such an analysis is shown in Fig. 4A, in which the level of HA 19K G87A was similar to or even greater than wild-type HA 19K as judged by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4A, inset). The 19K wild-type and G87A cell lines described in Fig. 4 were also examined for their susceptibility to staurosporin, a protein kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in many cell types (38Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar, 39Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Again, 19K G87A exhibited a significant loss in the ability to prevent cell death compared with wild-type 19K (Fig. 5). Consistent with the loss of death suppressing activity resulting from the G87A mutation of 19K, the mutant 19K in these cells exhibited a corresponding reduction in its ability to interact with Bax, relative to equivalent levels of wild-type 19K, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay in vitro (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Bad competes with Bax for heterodimerization with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and therefore has the potential to adjust a survival control set point to one that permits apoptosis to occur (15Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). In co-expressing cells, Bad overcomes the protective effects of Bcl-XL (15Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). However, despite repeated attempts, we have found that enforced expression of Bad does not overcome the death suppressor activity of E1B 19K (not shown). In distinct contrast to Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, interaction between 19K and Bad was not observed in a co-immunoprecipitation assay that readily detected interaction between Bcl-2 and Bad (Fig. 6, right panel, compare lanes 3 and 4) and interaction between 19K and Bax (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 6, cell extracts were employed that contained equivalent levels of HA Bcl-2 and HA 19K, as judged by Western blot analysis with 12CA5 anti-HA (Fig. 6, left panel). Similar results were obtained using different cell lines and cell types (CHO LR73 and human KB). The findings strongly suggest, therefore, that E1B 19K is not susceptible to regulation by Bad. The early events of adenovirus infection require that the cytotoxic consequences of E1A expression are countered by negative regulators of apoptosis. To ensure this outcome, the virus encodes its own general suppressor of apoptosis, E1B 19K. The major role of 19K during viral infection is to block p53-dependent apoptosis induced by E1A (22Rao L.

Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar) and p53-independent cell death that would otherwise be induced by an E4 viral gene product that is regulated by E1A (29Teodoro J.G. Shore G.C. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). Based on evidence presented here and elsewhere (31Subramanian T. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2403-2409PubMed Google Scholar, 32Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), 19K is both a structural and functional homolog of Bcl-2. Moreover, like Bcl-2, 19K appears to function within a signaling pathway that prevents processing and activation of pro-CPP32 in response to a death stimulus (16Boulakia C.A. Chen G. Ng F.W.H. Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Poirier G.G. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar). Because similarities between the two proteins are restricted to limited regions within the molecules, including BH1 and BH3 (31Subramanian T. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2403-2409PubMed Google Scholar, 32Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), comparisons between the two proteins provide an opportunity to correlate function with domain structure. Regions of sequence conservation and divergence within BH1 of Bcl-2 and 19K, for example, coupled with the deleterious mutation of the common glycine within this motif, help to define the essential features of this domain. Of particular relevance, however, we did not detect interaction between 19K and Bad, under conditions where 19K-Bax and Bcl-2-Bad interactions are readily observed. This has obvious evolutionary implications for the ability of the virus to evade potential host defense mechanisms, because it permits 19K to target Bax while at the same time avoiding disruption of this interaction and re-instatement of the apoptotic program by Bad."

The existence of ICAM-3 was inferred by the observation that anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) completely inhibited the PMA-stimulated homotypic aggregation of a T cell line, whereas a combination of blocking anti-ICAM-1 and anti-ICAM-2 mAb only partially inhibited aggregation (5de Fougerolles A.R.

Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 339: 61-64Google Scholar). ICAM-3 contains a 25-residue transmembrane region and a 456-residue mature extracellular domain comprising five immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains. ICAM-3 is 52% identical to ICAM-1 and 37% identical to ICAM-2 in the corresponding regions.In previous studies of ICAM-1, domain transfer and deletion mutagenesis revealed that the LFA-1 binding site was located within the amino-terminal two IgSF domains (17Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Google Scholar, 18Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg K. Cell. 1992; 68: 71-81Google Scholar). Expression of IgSF domain 1 or domain 2 of ICAM-1 in the absence of one another has not been achieved, and point mutations that disrupt conformation suggest that these two domains are conformationally interdependent. Point mutations were identified within domains 1 and 2 that affected binding of transfected cells to purified LFA-1, although the E34A and Q73H mutations within domain 1 had the greatest effect (17Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Google Scholar). The epitopes of mAb that blocked ICAM-1-dependent binding to purified LFA-1 were mapped within domain 1 (e.g. RR1/1) or domain 2 (e.g. R6.5) (17Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Google Scholar). Studies with synthetic peptides of ICAM-2 found that a 22-mer oligopeptide derived from the sequence of domain 1 of ICAM-2, residues Gly21 through Ser42 inclusive, could inhibit by 50% the binding of endothelial cells to purified LFA-1 at a concentration of 15 μM (19Li R. Nortamo P. Valmu L. Tolvanen M. Huuskonen J. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17513-17518Google Scholar). Peptides shortened from either end were significantly less active. The corresponding peptide based on the ICAM-1 sequence was 10-fold less active. Others have reported inhibitory function for peptides derived from the second domain of ICAM-2 (20Seth R. Salcedo R. Patarroyo M. Makgoba M.W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 193-196Google Scholar), the second domain of ICAM-1 (21Ross L. Hassman F. Molony L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8537-8543Google Scholar), and the fourth domain of ICAM-1 (22Fecondo J.V. Kent S.B.H. Boyd A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2879-2882Google Scholar). Domain deletion, point mutagenesis, and epitope mapping studies of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (23Vonderheide R.H. Tedder T.F. Springer T.A. Staunton D.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124(4): 601-608Google Scholar), an IgSF member that binds to the β-1 integrin VLA-4, found two distinct homologous binding sites, in IgSF domains 1 and 4, and the existence of a 5-residue motif important for the binding of CAMs to integrins in both of these domains was proposed (23Vonderheide R.H. Tedder T.F. Springer T.A. Staunton D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 215-222Google Scholar, 24Osborn L. Vassallo C. Browning B.G. Tizard R. Haskard D.O. Benjamin C.D. Douglas I. Kirchhausen T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124(4): 601-608Google Scholar).In this study of ICAM-3, in contrast to what has been reported for ICAM-1, we demonstrate that IgSF domain 1 of ICAM-3 is sufficient for functional expression of the LFA-1 binding site. Furthermore, in contrast to what has been reported for VCAM-1 and ICAM-2, ICAM-3 does not contain a linear sequence centered around Glu37 (corresponding to residue Glu34 of ICAM-1, residue Asp40 of VCAM-1, and residue Glu40 of ICAM-2) that is necessary for binding to LFA-1, although Glu37 itself is essential. Mutation of five noncontiguous residues within domain 1 of ICAM-3 disrupts binding to LFA-1 without affecting mAb epitopes in domain 1. These residues are predicted to localize at two distinct regions on the three-dimensional model of IgSF domain 1 of ICAM-3.RESULTSOligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to create a panel of four IgSF domain deletions (Fig. 1). All four deletion mutants directed the expression in transfected COS cells of antigenic ICAM-3 at comparable levels (Table I). COS cell transfectants were assayed for binding to purified LFA-1 on plastic (Fig. 1). The construct, ΔD1, in which domain 1 was deleted, did not direct binding of transfected COS cells to purified LFA-1. In contrast, the constructions lacking domains 2, 3, or 4 directed binding to purified LFA-1 at near wild type levels (Fig. 1). All ICAM-3-mediated binding was inhibitable by pretreating the coated plates with an LFA-1-specific mAb, confirming the specificity of the assay.Table IMonoclonal antibody epitope localization by immunofluorescent flow cytometry of COS cell transfectants analyzedmAb nameVector controlICAM-3ΔD1ΔD2ΔD3ΔD4CBR-IC2/233 (7Klickstein L.B.

To determine whether domain 1 of ICAM-3 was able to mediate specific binding to purified LFA-1 out of the context of adjacent IgSF domains, sequences encoding domain 1 of ICAM-3, domains 1 and 2, or domains 1, 2, and 3 were transferred to the sequence encoding the amino-terminal end of short consensus repeat 3 of CD21 (Fig. 2). The short consensus repeat sequences comprising the entire extracellular region of CD21 have no homology with IgSF members and are independent structural units (27Lowell C.A. Klickstein L.B. Carter R.H. Mitchell J.A. Fearon D.T. Ahearn J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1931-1946Google Scholar). COS cells transiently expressing the chimeric proteins displayed the CD21 epitope for the HB-5 mAb and the expected ICAM-3 mAb epitopes (data not shown). COS cells expressing wild type ICAM-3 but not COS cells transfected with the AprM9 vector alone or with a cDNA encoding the full-length CD21 bound to purified LFA-1 (Fig. 2). COS cells expressing the CD21 chimeras containing domain 1 of ICAM-3, domains 1 and 2, and domains 1, 2, and 3 bound to LFA-1 at 50-78% of wild type levels (Fig. 2). The lower binding of the chimeras with respect to wild type ICAM-3 is likely accounted for by the lower expression levels of the chimeras on COS cells observed in all five experiments (not shown). These results demonstrate that an LFA-1 binding site is wholly contained within domain 1 of ICAM-3.Fig. 2Binding of COS cells expressing ICAM-3-CD21 chimeras to purified LFA-1 on plastic. The structures of the chimeras and the parent molecules are shown in the upper panel. The large ovals represent IgSF domains, and the smaller, shaded ovals represent the short consensus repeats (SCRs) comprising the CD21 extracellular domain.

Four mAb groups were identified (Table I). Nine mAb failed to bind to cells expressing the mutant lacking domain 1 but bound well to cells expressing all the other domain deletions, suggesting that the epitope(s) for these mAb are within domain 1 of ICAM-3 (Table I). Three mAb failed to bind to cells expressing the mutant lacking domain 2 but bound well to cells expressing all the other domain deletions, suggesting that the epitope(s) for these mAb are within domain 2 of ICAM-3 (Table I). Two mAb required the presence of both domains 1 and 2 for expression of their epitopes. Three mAb required the presence of domain 4 but not domains 1, 2, or 3 for epitope expression (Table I). Similar results were obtained with stably transfected L cells (data not shown).The 17 anti-ICAM-3 mAb were assayed in the presence of mAb to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 for the ability to inhibit binding of fluorescently labeled Jurkat T cells to purified LFA-1 adsorbed to plastic. Four mAb with epitopes that mapped to domain 1 of ICAM-3 completely blocked binding of Jurkat cells to purified LFA-1 (Fig. 3). The five other mAb to domain 1 of ICAM-3 inhibited by approximately 50% the binding of Jurkat cells to purified LFA-1, and all other mAb did not significantly inhibit binding (Fig. 3). These data confirm that domain 1 of ICAM-3 is necessary for binding to LFA-1 and support the finding that the other ICAM-3 domains do not contribute to the binding site. Furthermore, unlike ICAM-1 (17Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Google Scholar, 18Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K.

Jurkat cells labeled with the fluorescent dye BCECF were preincubated with RR1/1 + IC2/2 mAb to block ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, respectively, and with the indicated anti-ICAM-3 antibody and then added to the wells of a 96-well plate coated with purified LFA-1. The percentage of binding was determined by analysis with a fluorescence concentration analyzer before and after washing.

All residues conserved among the CAMs, except for the four invariant cysteines, and residues conserved among ICAMs but not among VCAMs or mucosal addressin CAM were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Additionally, residues previously suggested to be important in interactions with integrins and all five potential N-linked glycosylation sites were changed (Fig. 4). In general, residues were substituted with alanine, except alanine and valine were substituted with serine. Mutants were named with the one-letter code, with a slash separating the wild type and mutated residues.

https://openalex.org/W2087377176,"The Syk protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) is expressed in many hematopoietic cells and is involved in signaling from various receptors for antigen and Fc portions of IgG and IgE. Upon cross-linking of these receptors, Syk is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and enzymatically activated. We and others have found that the Lck kinase, a member of the Src family of PTKs, binds through its Src homology (SH) 2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated Syk and to the related Zap kinase. Here we report that this interaction is direct and identify the two tandem tyrosines at the autophosphorylation site of Syk, Tyr<sup>518</sup>, and Tyr<sup>519</sup>, as the binding site for the SH2 domain of Lck. Mutation of either or both tyrosines to phenylalanines abrogated binding, while mutation of a second repetition of the motif at Tyr<sup>539</sup> and Tyr<sup>540</sup>, or of the three tyrosines in the C terminus of Syk, did not. The SH2 domain of Lck bound the autophosphorylation site only when both Tyr<sup>518</sup> and Tyr<sup>519</sup> were phosphorylated. In intact cells the binding of the SH2 domain of Lck correlated with the ability of Syk to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins."

Mutation of mouse meprin α Cys-320 to Ala in the MAM domain (an extracellular domain found in meprin, A-5 protein, and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ) resulted in expression of a monomeric form of meprin, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The monomeric subunits were considerably more vulnerable to proteolytic degradation and heat inactivation in vitro compared with the oligomeric form of the enzyme. Proteolytic activity of the monomeric meprin using a bradykinin analog or aminobenzoyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-nitroanilide as substrate was similar to that of disulfide-linked oligomeric meprin; however, activity against azocasein was markedly decreased. Mutation of another cysteine residue in the MAM domain (C289A), predicted to be involved in intrasubunit disulfide bridging, resulted in disulfide-linked oligomers and monomers. These results indicated that this mutant was capable of forming intersubunit disulfide bonds but less efficiently than wild-type meprin subunits.

Meprin A (EC) from mouse and rat kidneys is the most thoroughly investigated isoform; it hydrolyzes a variety of biologically active peptides such as bradykinin, angiotensins, glucagon, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, parathyroid and melanocyte-stimulating hormone and is implicated in the processing and degradation of membrane-bound and matrix proteins (7Jiang W.

They are dimers of disulfide-linked dimers that are highly glycosylated and can exist as homo- or heterooligomers (13Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 549-553Google Scholar, 14Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Google Scholar). The oligomers are composed of α and/or β subunits where the β subunits are type I integral membrane proteins, and the α subunits are associated with α or β subunits through disulfide bridges or noncovalent associations (14Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Google Scholar, 15Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Google Scholar).

They predict similar domains for α and β including, from the NH2 terminus, signal and prosequences and protease, MAM, X, EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorBK+bradykinin analog 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH where Dnp is dinitrophenylABz-AAF-pNAaminobenzoyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-nitroanilidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisX domainunknown domainMAMmeprin/A-5 protein/receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase μI domaininserted domain. -like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (2Jiang W.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21035-21043Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, top, for diagram of α subunit domains). The MAM domain consists of 170 amino acids; it was identified by computer analyses of protein sequences and termed MAM (an acronym for meprin, A-5 protein and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase ¼) for the proteins originally found to contain this sequence (16Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Google Scholar). The α subunit contains an I (inserted) domain, between the X and EGF-like domain, not present in the β subunit. In spite of the similarities, α and β have different substrate specificities; they undergo different posttranslational modifications during biosynthesis, and their tissue-specific expression is regulated independently. For example, meprin A (isoforms containing the α subunit) has activity against peptides such as bradykinin and synthetic arylamides, whereas meprin B (the homooligomer of β subunits; EC) has no activity against these substrates (1Kounnas M.Z. Wolz R.L. Gorbea C.M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 17350-17357Google Scholar, 8Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Google Scholar). Mouse kidney meprin β subunits retain their COOH-terminal transmembrane domain, whereas α subunits are totally extracellular as a consequence of proteolytic processing during biosynthesis at or near the I domain (15Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Google Scholar). Many mouse strains express both α and β subunits in kidney proximal tubule cells, whereas some inbred strains express only β in adult kidney (2Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Google Scholar, 3Gorbea C.M. Marchand P. Jiang W. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21035-21043Google Scholar). Thus meprin isoforms are regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels differentially.The related crayfish protease astacin (EC), which in its mature form is comprised of only the protease domain, is a monomeric enzyme (17Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-166Google Scholar). In contrast, all mature secreted and membrane-associated forms of the meprin α subunit contain the protease, MAM, and X domains. The functions of the latter two domains are unknown, and no matching sequences for the X domain have been identified in the data banks. MAM domains, however, are found in otherwise unrelated proteins, such as enteropeptidase, tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ, and A5 protein and have been suggested to serve as “adhesion” domains (16Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Google Scholar, 18Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Google Scholar, 19Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Google Scholar, 20Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Google Scholar). There is some evidence that indicates that MAM domains can mediate specific noncovalent interactions between the tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ receptors (21Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.-P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Google Scholar). Comparisons of MAM domains of the different proteins indicate that they contain four conserved cysteine residues. Meprin MAM domains contain a fifth cysteine residue not present in the MAM domains of the other proteins. On the basis of these comparisons and other considerations, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that the fifth cysteine of the MAM domain is involved in covalent interactions between the meprin subunits; this proposition is tested by mutational analyses herein.The unusual oligomeric structure of meprins evokes questions of the necessity of oligomers and disulfide bridges for the function and structure of the enzymes. Does the oligomeric structure affect activity? What is the role of the disulfide bonds? Is covalent or noncovalent oligomerization a prerequisite for intracellular transport? Do the interactions of the COOH-terminal domains of the mosaic proteins affect the activity or stability of the enzyme? The present work indicates that oligomerization (covalent or noncovalent) does not affect the secretion or specific activity of meprin α subunits against peptides but greatly affects vulnerability of the subunits to proteolytic degradation and heat inactivation and activity against protein substrates.DISCUSSIONThis work demonstrates that the structure of the MAM domain and/or the oligomeric state of the meprin A is critical for stability of the meprin protein and for activity of the enzyme against proteins. The results support the hypothesis that Cys-320 of the MAM domain is essential for covalent interactions of the subunits; mutation of this residue to an alanine completely eliminated the formation of dimers. The fact that mutation of another cysteine (C289A) in the MAM domain, which is likely involved in the conserved structure of this domain, allowed formation of some dimers but also resulted in dramatic effects on oligomerization, activity, and stability of the subunit indicates that MAM domain structure is a critical determinant of the physical/chemical characteristics of the enzyme. It is not possible to determine at this point whether the MAM domain structure itself or the state of oligomerization of the protein affects the stability and activity of the protease domain because changes in one are coupled to the other.The work clearly shows that MAM domain cysteine mutations resulted in significant structural changes in the meprin protein. However, the fact that activity of the enzyme against the peptide substrate was not affected and that the amount of protein synthesized, COOH-terminally processed, transported, and secreted by cells was not significantly altered indicates that the protein was folded to some extent and transported as its wild-type counterpart. The protein was not degraded by endoplasmic reticulum or other subcellular compartment proteases as many unfolded or inappropriately assembled proteins are (30Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Google Scholar). This is consistent with the concept that domains of mosaic proteins form modules that fold independently. The contrast of the in vivo stability with in vitro instability may reflect different environments and interactions with other proteins. The folding of monomers in vivo is likely accompanied by interactions with chaperones and transport molecules. In vitro the protein seems to depend more on interactions with like molecules to form oligomers. It is of interest that wild-type meprin α subunits form very high molecular weight complexes and that meprin A isolated from kidney forms tetramers and higher order complexes. The latter finding was observed previously in ultracentrifugation studies of purified preparations of meprin A where the protein behaved mainly as a tetramer but also associated into higher oligomeric forms (14Marchand P. Tang J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15388-15393Google Scholar). The cysteine mutants do not form higher oligomers, indicating that structural alterations of the MAM domain disrupt noncovalent subunit interactions as well as covalent bridges. It is possible that the covalent intersubunit disulfide bridges stabilize units to allow noncovalent interactions of the subunits or domain swapping (31Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, it is clear that the MAM domain acts as an adhesion domain and stabilizes subunit interactions, protein structure, and the function of the enzyme. The role of the disulfide interactions between subunits may be to stabilize subunit interactions so that higher oligomeric forms are favored.MAM domains have been identified recently as distinct protein modules in several proteins, and one study has specifically addressed the role of this domain in protein structure and function. Zondag et al. (21Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.-P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MAM domains of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ are essential for mediating specific homophilic cell-cell interactions in transfected nonadherent insect cells. The present study provides an example where the MAM domain mediates specific homooligomeric interactions of a secreted protein. In vivo, MAM domain interactions result in the concentration of meprin α subunits at the cell surface in association with integral membrane β proteins.The effect of MAM domain cysteine mutations on the ability of meprin to hydrolyze azocasein implicates complex domain or subunit interactions for this activity. It is possible that there are interactions between subunit active sites for protein hydrolysis or that there is a different conformation of the active site in monomers and oligomers. There has been no indication of cooperative interactions between subunits in kinetic studies of meprin A (8Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Google Scholar). However, studies with inhibitors have yielded unexpected results that may indicate complex interactions at the active sites. For example, the inhibitor actinonin is a simple competitive inhibitor of astacin but shows complex inhibition patterns with meprin A (competitive/noncompetitive), and products of bradykinin hydrolysis that would be predicted to be simple competitive inhibitors show mixed inhibition patterns for meprin A.The differences in the glycosylation of the mutants and wild-type meprin subunits could contribute to differences in resistance to proteases and oligomerization. There is at least one N-linked glycosylation site in the MAM domain near Cys-320; the Cys mutations could affect the interaction of that site with cellular glycosidases, which could in turn expose normally protected peptide bonds to proteases. Oligomerization to high molecular weight complexes may also confer increased proteolytic resistance by protecting areas of the protein that are vulnerable to proteases. Native forms of meprin are quite resistant to proteases; for example, functionally intact meprin can be solubilized from membranes by treatment with high concentrations of papain or trypsin/toluene. Many brush border enzymes exist as oligomers, and a standard treatment for solubilization of the bulk of these enzymes is to incubate membranes with proteases. Intracellular enzymes may also be stabilized by oligomerization, as in the case of cathepsin E. The latter aspartic proteinase is a homodimer in which the subunits are linked by a disulfide bond. Mutation of a specific cysteine residue resulted in a monomeric, active enzyme with decreased thermal stability (32Fowler S.D. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Tatnell P.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 72-74Google Scholar). The function of the oligomerization for many enzymes may be to allow survival of active enzymes in a protease-rich environment. While meprin structures are unique for known proteases, they may serve as excellent models for other mosaic, multimeric proteins.

Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-166Google Scholar). In contrast, all mature secreted and membrane-associated forms of the meprin α subunit contain the protease, MAM, and X domains. The functions of the latter two domains are unknown, and no matching sequences for the X domain have been identified in the data banks. MAM domains, however, are found in otherwise unrelated proteins, such as enteropeptidase, tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ, and A5 protein and have been suggested to serve as “adhesion” domains (16Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Google Scholar, 18Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Google Scholar, 19Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Google Scholar, 20Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Google Scholar). There is some evidence that indicates that MAM domains can mediate specific noncovalent interactions between the tyrosine phosphatase μ and κ receptors (21Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.-P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Google Scholar). Comparisons of MAM domains of the different proteins indicate that they contain four conserved cysteine residues. Meprin MAM domains contain a fifth cysteine residue not present in the MAM domains of the other proteins. On the basis of these comparisons and other considerations, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that the fifth cysteine of the MAM domain is involved in covalent interactions between the meprin subunits; this proposition is tested by mutational analyses herein.The unusual oligomeric structure of meprins evokes questions of the necessity of oligomers and disulfide bridges for the function and structure of the enzymes. Does the oligomeric structure affect activity? What is the role of the disulfide bonds? Is covalent or noncovalent oligomerization a prerequisite for intracellular transport? Do the interactions of the COOH-terminal domains of the mosaic proteins affect the activity or stability of the enzyme? The present work indicates that oligomerization (covalent or noncovalent) does not affect the secretion or specific activity of meprin α subunits against peptides but greatly affects vulnerability of the subunits to proteolytic degradation and heat inactivation and activity against protein substrates."

It is composed of three pairs of nonidentical polypeptide chains, organized into a central E and two peripheral D domains (3Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). A cell-cell interaction that is critically dependent on fg is platelet aggregation (4Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which involves the binding of fg to platelet integrin, αIIbβ3 (5Peerschke E.I. Semin. Hematol. 1985; 22: 241-259PubMed Google Scholar). The extreme COOH-terminal aspect of the γ chain, γ-406-411, is involved in the recognition of fg by αIIbβ3 (6Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Thromb. Res. 1983; 29: 249-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). fg also interacts with other integrins, including αvβ3 and αMβ2 (7Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging to indicate that the interaction of fg with αMβ2 (Mac-1) may also be important for cell-cell interactions. fg bound to αMβ2 on leukocytes can facilitate the bridging of these cells to EC (1Languino L.R.

ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like superfamily which includes several other adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3. ICAM-1 (95 kDa) contains five Ig-like motifs of 80-90-amino acids which are held together by disulfide bonds (2Springer T.A.

Each Ig-like motif consists of seven antiparallel strands folded to form two beta sheets (12Giranda V.L. Chapman M.S. Rossmann M.G. Proteins Struct. Funct.

ICAM-1 is present on many cell types including EC, epithelial cells, lymphocytes and macrophages (2Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5725) Google Scholar). On EC, ICAM-1 becomes expressed on stimulation with cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1, and the bacterial product, lipopolysaccharide. ICAM-1 is a ligand for leukocyte integrins αLβ2 (LFA-1) and αMβ2 (15Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 16Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Recognition by αLβ2 involves the first two Ig-like domains of ICAM-1, whereas αMβ2 binds to the third Ig-like repeat (17Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). These interactions with ICAM-1 facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration of these cells through the endothelium (18Xu H. Gonzalo J.A. Pierre St., Y. Williams I.R. Kupper T.S. Cotran R.S. Springer T.A. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Recently, a direct interaction between fg and ICAM-1 has been demonstrated (1Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A mechanism can be envisioned in which fg bound to αMβ2 on leukocytes bridges to ICAM-1 on EC, thus mediating adhesion between the two cell types. This interaction has been implicated in leukocyte transmigration through endothelium (19Languino L.R. Duperray A. Joganic K.J. Fornaro M. Thornton G.B. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As fg-ICAM-1 interactions may have important pathophysiological ramifications, we have sought to define the molecular basis for their recognition. In this study, we describe the identification of a small sequence within ICAM-1 that is critical for its interaction with fg, specifically with γ-117-133 of fg. Furth"
https://openalex.org/W1974337780,"Pig kidney dopa decarboxylase (DDC) expressed in Escherichia coli is a homodimeric enzyme containing one catalytically active pyridoxal 5′-phosphate active site per subunit. In addition to catalyzing the decarboxylation of L-aromatic amino acids, DDC also reacts with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), converting it to 5-hydroxyindolacetaldehyde and ammonia. These products have been identified by means of the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, together with high performance liquid chromatographic and mass spectroscopic analysis. The Kcat and Km values of this reaction were determined to be 0.48 min−1 and 0.47 mM, respectively. The NaBH4-reduced enzyme does not catalyze this reaction. Concurrent with this reaction, 5-HT inactivates DDC in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner and exhibits saturation of the rate of inactivation at high concentrations, with Ki and Kinact values of 0.40 mM and 0.023 min−1, respectively. Protection from inactivation by 5-HT was observed in the presence of the active site-directed inhibitor 3,4-dihydroxy-D-phenylalanine. Inactivation with [2-14C]5-HT results in the incorporation of 1 mol of label/enzyme subunit. Taken together, these findings indicate that 5-HT is both a substrate and a mechanism-based inactivator with a partition ratio for product formation versus inactivation of 21. The absorbance, CD, and fluorometric features of 5-HT-inactivated DDC have also been characterized.

However, like many other pyridoxal phosphate enzymes, the enzyme also catalyses a “minor” reaction, referred to as decarboxylation-dependent transamination, which in fact was first observed by studying the effects of pig kidney DDC on α-methyl Dopa (1Borri Voltattorni C. Minelli A. Turano C. FEBS Lett. 1971; 17: 231-235Google Scholar). A similar phenomena has been described for DDC when it acts on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) and m-tyrosine and their α-methyl derivatives (2O'Leary M.H. Baughn R.L. Nature. 1975; 253: 52-53Google Scholar, 3O'Leary M.H. Baughn R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7168-7173Google Scholar), D-5-hydroxytryptophan and D-tryptophan (4Borri Voltattorni C. Minelli A. Dominici P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2249-2254Google Scholar), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) (5Borri Voltattorni C. Minelli A. Bull. Mol. Biol. Med. 1980; 5: 52-60Google Scholar); with all of the above substrates a progressive loss of decarboxylase activity is observed as a consequence of their interaction with the enzyme. The occurrence of abortive decarboxylation-transamination reactions is not uncommon among PLP-dependent α-decarboxylases (6Huntley T.E. Metzler D.E. Yamada K. Katunuma N. Wada H.

Nature. 1975; 253: 52-53Google Scholar, 3O'Leary M.H. Baughn R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7168-7173Google Scholar) explained this minor pathway by proposing that the carbanion-quinonoid intermediate formed after elimination of the carboxyl group may be protonated either at the α-carbon atom (from which the carboxy group was eliminated) to give the amine or at the 4′-carbon of the coenzyme to give the corresponding aldehyde or ketone and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). Nevertheless, when this abortive reaction was more closely investigated, it was found that it cannot be solely explained by the simple model that was proposed. In fact, the reaction of pig kidney DDC with α-methyl Dopa or 5-HT leads to the production of dihydroxyphenylacetone or 5-hydroxyindolacetaldehyde (5-HIA), respectively, in amounts far exceeding on molar basis that of the coenzyme PLP (10Barboni E.

The above described abortive reaction has been examined in greater detail using 5-HT as the substrate. Being devoid of decarboxylation events, 5-HT yields a simple model and may also provide some physiological significance, as it is an important neurotransmitter. For these studies, recombinant pig kidney DDC was used, which has been recently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (11Moore P.S. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 249-256Google Scholar). This protein possesses two catalytically active coenzyme binding sites per enzyme dimer in contrast to the enzyme purified from tissue, which has 1 mol of PLP/dimer (12Borri Voltattorni C. Minelli A. Vecchini P. Fiori A. Turano C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 93: 181-188Google Scholar). In the latter, the remaining coenzyme is found as an inactive, covalently bound adduct. In this report, an extensive characterization of the reaction and concomitant inactivation of DDC by 5-HT is presented. These results indicate that a mechanism-based inactivation is responsible for the observed loss of decarboxylase activity in the presence of 5-HT. A putative mechanism to explain these events is described herein. L-Dopa, L-5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT chlorohydrate, 5-hydroxyindole ethyl alcohol (5-HIP, 5-hydroxytryptophol), Hepes, α-ketoglutarate, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (EC), yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC), bovine liver L-glutamic dehydrogenase (EC), NAD+ and NADH, protease inhibitors, dithiothreitol, octanesulfonic acid, and PLP were obtained from Sigma. [2-14C]5-HT oxalate was a product of DuPont. All other chemicals were the highest grade commercially available. Data for the determination of Km, Vmax, Kinact, and Ki were fit to lines with the program Enzfitter. Recombinant DDC was purified to homogeneity as described previously (11Moore P.S. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 249-256Google Scholar), except that DEAE-Biogel chromatography was substituted with DEAE-Sepharose FF fast protein liquid chromatography. Briefly, at room temperature crude extract was loaded on a XK 26/10 column previously equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.01 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 6 ml/min and washed with the same buffer. A linear gradient was then inserted (0-100%, 120 min) with the same buffer containing 150 mM potassium phosphate. Active fractions were pooled and further processed as described. Dopa decarboxylase activity was measured as described by Sherald et al. (13Sherald A.F. Sparrow J.C. Wright T.R.F. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 300-305Google Scholar), using the modification of Charteris and John (14Charteris A. John R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 365-371Google Scholar). One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of protein that catalyzes the production of 1 nmol amine/min. The enzyme concentration was determined using an EM of 1.3 × 10−5M−1 cm−1 (15Dominici P. Moore P.S. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 493-500Google Scholar). DDC (10 μM) was incubated with various concentrations of 5-HT in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, at 25°C. At various times, aliquots were removed and diluted (usually 100-fold) into a normal assay mixture containing 2.2 mML-Dopa, and residual enzymatic activity was determined as described above. In protection experiments, the indicated substrate analog was included prior to the addition of 5-HT. Aldehyde formation during the reaction of DDC with 5-HT was assayed by coupling the aldehyde produced to the NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction. Routinely, a 0.3-ml reaction mixture contained 10 μM DDC, 96 μg of alcohol dehydrogenase, and 300 μM NADH in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 24 μl of 50 mM 5-HT. The amount of aldehyde produced during the course of the reaction was measured by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+. Assays with aldehyde dehydrogenase were also performed. In these experiments, the reaction mixture contained 10 μM DDC, 8 μg of aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 200 μM NAD+ in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 0.3 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 24 μl of 50 mM 5-HT, and the increase in absorbance at 340 due to NAD+ reduction was monitored. All measurements were made at 25°C. Production of ammonia by the reaction of DDC with 5-HT was determined by a spectroscopic assay using glutamate dehydrogenase, which forms glutamate from α-ketoglutarate and ammonia with the concomitant conversion of NADH to NAD+. A 0.3-ml reaction mixture contained 10 μM DDC, 140 μg glutamate dehydrogenase, 1 mMα-ketoglutarate, and 300 μM NADH in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, at 25°C. The reaction was initiated with 24 μl of 50 mM 5-HT and monitored at 340 nm. Calibration was performed with standard ammonia solutions from Sigma. H2O2 was assayed by measuring the oxidation of 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)sulfonate (ΔE414nm, 23 mM−1 cm−1) in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (16Szutowicz A. Kobes R.D. Orsulak P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 86-94Google Scholar). Calibration was performed with a standard solution of H2O2. Determination of PMP after reaction with 5-HT was performed according to the method of Bossa and Barra (17Bossa F. Barra D. Ital. J. Biochem. 1968; 17: 285-291Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by reduction with NaBH4 followed by heat denaturation. DDC (10 μM) was incubated with 4 mM [2-14C]5-HT (1.95 × 106 cpm/μmol) in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, at 25°C in a final volume of 1.4 ml. At intervals, 350-μl aliquots were withdrawn; after removal of excess reagents by PD-10 gel filtration followed by extensive conventional dialysis, the samples were counted for residual radioactivity in 2 ml of Beckman Instruments Ready Gel liquid scintillation mixture in a Beckman Instruments LS 1801 liquid scintillator counter. All separations were done isocratically on an LKB instrument equipped with a 5-μm Lichrospher 100 RP-18 column. Two different solvent conditions were used: H2O/methanol/acetic acid (75:24:1) (v/v/v) containing 6 mM octanesulfonic acid or 5% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid with 1 mM tetrabutyl ammonium phosphate. For both systems, the flow rate was 1 ml/min, and detection was at 280 nm. After incubation of 10 μM DDC with 4 mM 5-HT for 5-180 min in 50 mM Hepes at 25°C in the absence or presence of alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH, the reaction was stopped by heating for 2 min at 100°C and then centrifuged to remove the precipitated protein. The supernatants and appropriate blanks were run. Analysis of 5-HIP and the unknown sample were made by combined liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with direct liquid introduction. The mass spectrometer (HP 5988; Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA) was coupled with a Particle-Beam introduction system (electron energy 70, eV; ion source, 250°). Absorption measurements were carried out using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were taken with a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorometer using 5-nm bandwidths on both sides at a protein concentration of 0.6 μM. CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco 710 spectropolarometer at a protein concentration of 0.8-1 mg/ml using a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Routinely, five spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm/min using a bandwidth of 2 nm and averaged automatically. Fig. 1 shows the change in the visible spectrum of DDC versus time during its interaction with 5-HT. Addition of 5-HT to DDC at pH 7.5 causes the immediate appearance of an absorption band at 385 nm and a decrease of the absorbance at 335 nm. The 385-nm peak then decreases in a time-dependent fashion, concomitant with the increase of absorption in the region around 340 nm. A more precise description of the spectral events occurring in the region below 350 nm is hampered by the large absorbance of the indolic compound at 280 nm. Addition of 4 mML-5-hydroxytryptophan to DDC results in the immediate appearance of the absorption at 420 nm and a slight decrease at 335 nm. After the time required for complete decarboxylation, the 420-nm band disappears, and a 385-nm absorption peak appears, which decreases in time-dependent fashion similar to that described for 5-HT (data not shown). Reaction of pig kidney holo-DDC with 5-HT causes the concomitant production of aldehyde and ammonia, as revealed by coupled assay systems using alcohol dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively (Fig. 2). The initial velocity is directly dependent on DDC concentration and dependent on 5-HT concentration according to saturation kinetics (data not shown). The Km for 5-HT was determined to be 0.47 ± 0.01 mM, with a Vmax of 0.48 ± 0.02 nmol of aldehyde or ammonia/min/nmol of dimeric enzyme; thus, the calculated Kcat/Km was found to be 1.02 mM−1 min−1. No aldehyde formation is observed when reaction of DDC with 5-HT is coupled with aldehyde dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+, suggesting that the aldehyde formed is not acetaldehyde or an aliphatic aldehyde but an aromatic aldehyde, possibly 5-HIA. The production of 5-HIA from 5-HT by DDC was corroborated by high performance liquid chromatographic and mass spectroscopic analysis. DDC was incubated with 5-HT in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH; under these conditions, the unstable 5-HIA was converted in situ into the more stable compound 5-HIP. Aliquots were removed at time intervals and heat inactivated. Fractionation of the supernatants was then performed on a reversed-phase column by high performance liquid chromatography. In addition to 5-HT, another peak absorbing at 280 nm was found. This peak, the height of which linearly increases up to 30 min of the reaction, is radioactive when the experiment is carried out using [2-14C]5-HT and is a substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase, which oxidizes 5-HIP to 5-HIA by reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Finally, analysis by mass spectroscopy of this compound shows the fragment peaks at m/z 177 (M+) and 146 (M+-CH2OH), corresponding to the molecular ion peaks of a 5-HIP standard (data not shown). From the above, this compound has been conclusively identified as 5-HIP. To confirm the PLP active site-directed nature of this reaction, a sample was reduced with sodium borohydride before the addition of 5-HT in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase or glutamate dehydrogenase. No appreciable amounts of 5-HIA and ammonia were observed. Additionally, 10 μM PLP was incubated at 25°C with 4 mM 5-HT in the presence of NADH and alcohol dehydrogenase or glutamate dehydrogenase. No detectable decrease of 340-nm absorbance was observed with either of the above auxiliary enzymes, indicating that 5-HIA and ammonia are not formed nonenzymatically. The kinetics of formation of 5-HIA and ammonia (measured by the auxiliary enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively) during the reaction of holo-DDC with L-5-hydroxytryptophan does not parallel the formation of the normal product of decarboxylation, 5-HT. This finding is consistent with a mechanism in which the decarboxylation product undergoes a further reaction in a subsequent step. After a 2-h incubation of DDC with 5-HT, less than 5% of the original coenzyme content was found as PMP. Last, no production of H2O2 was observed during the reaction of DDC with 5-HT. 5-HT inactivates DDC in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The rate of inactivation saturates at high concentration of 5-HT, with an apparent Ki of 0.40 ± 0.01 mM and is consistent with the formation of a Michaelis complex between the enzyme and 5-HT (Fig. 3, inset). At saturating levels of 5-HT, the Kinact was found to be 0.023 ± 0.001 min−1. This rate of inactivation is significantly slower than the rate of 5-HIA or ammonia formation from 5-HT of 0.48 min−1. The partition ratio (catalytic turnover versus enzyme inactivation) was calculated from the ratio of Kcat to Kinact and found to be 21; at different concentrations of 5-HT a similar partition ratio is observed. Inactivation is not prevented if 5-HIA or ammonia is continuously removed from the incubation mixture by addition of NADH and alcohol dehydrogenase or glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively. Protection from inactivation by 5-HT, however, was observed when the reaction is carried out in the presence of the active site-directed inhibitor D-Dopa (4Borri Voltattorni C. Minelli A. Dominici P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2249-2254Google Scholar and Fig. 3). After 3 h the enzyme is completely (>95%) and irreversibly inactivated. There is no observable return of activity when 5-HT is removed by either dialysis or gel filtration. Incubation of the inactivated enzyme with PLP after the removal of 5-HT does not result in a return of decarboxylase activity, indicating that loss of the coenzyme is not responsible for the inactivation. There is no discernible change in the observed apparent subunit molecular weight, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; thus, gross modification of the enzyme due to covalent cross-linking of subunits can be excluded. During inactivation of DDC by 5-HT, there is a progressive incorporation of [2-14C]5-HT into the protein that parallels the loss of enzymatic activity. After almost complete inactivation by a 3-h reaction of DDC with [2-14C]5-HT and passage on a desalting column, 3.6 nmol of the label was incorporated per nmol of dimeric enzyme. This material was then divided in two portions. One was dialyzed against 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, or 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. The other was first reduced with NaBH4 and then dialyzed against 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, or 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. In all cases, the same result was obtained; i.e. about 45% of radioactivity was released. The remaining bound label was found to be 1.94 mol/mol of dimeric enzyme. In a separate experiment, a 50% inactivated enzyme shows 1.09 mol of 14C adduct covalently bound per dimer. Thus, inactivation of DDC by 5-HT involves the incorporation of one molecule of inhibitor per enzyme subunit. This stoichiometry is consistent with the presence of one PLP active site per monomer for recombinant DDC, a point recently ascertained (11Moore P.S. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 249-256Google Scholar). After gel filtration, the 5-HT inactivated enzyme is characterized by an absorption band at 340 nm (Fig. 4A) associated with a positive dichroic signal at the same wavelength (Fig. 4B). The positive signals in the aromatic region remain unaltered with respect to the native protein (11Moore P.S. Dominici P. Borri Voltattorni C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 249-256Google Scholar and Fig. 4B). This adduct absorbing at 340 nm does not appear to be related to compounds previously described for other PLP-dependent enzymes (18Martinez del Pozo A. Yoshimura T. Bathia M.B. Futaki S. Manning J.M. Ringe D. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6018-6023Google Scholar, 19Likos J.J. Ueno H. Feldhaus R.W. Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4377-4386Google Scholar), since treatment at pH 5 or 11 did not restore either the native spectral properties or enzymatic activity. The 340-nm absorbing peak remains unaltered after denaturation in 5 M guanidine chlorohydrate and passage over a gel-filtration column equilibrated with denaturant (data not shown). When excited at 340 nm, the inactive enzyme has an emission fluorescence at 385 nm, significantly higher than that of the native enzyme excited at the same wavelength (Fig. 4C). The first notable finding of these studies is that 5-HT, produced by decarboxylation of L-5-HTP by pig kidney DDC, undergoes a PLP-assisted reaction catalyzed by the same enzyme, which results in the loss of decarboxylase activity. 5-HT, directly added to DDC or formed at the active site of the enzyme following decarboxylation of L-5-HTP, immediately induces a spectral modification of the enzyme-bound coenzyme, which is followed by further time-dependent changes. This behavior strongly suggests an active site-directed event and the occurrence of a reaction between 5-HT and DDC. By means of the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, together with high performance liquid chromatographic and mass spectroscopic analysis, the products of this reaction have been identified as 5-HIA and ammonia. Kinetic data of the reaction of DDC with 5-HT show that: 1) 5-HT inactivates in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and saturates at high concentrations of amine; 2) protection of inactivation by 5-HT is exerted by D-Dopa; 3) inactivation occurs at a rate no faster than the rate of 5-HT consumption; 4) there is irreversible covalent bond formation, with no return of activity after removal of 5-HT and addition of coenzyme; and 5) since no lag time is observed during the inactivation reaction, it seems unlikely that there is release of an activated species prior to enzyme inactivation. Taken together, these results indicate that 5-HT is both a substrate and a mechanism-based inactivator of DDC. Studies have been undertaken to identify and characterize a peptide containing the modified residue. Although elucidation of the precise pathway of mechanism-based inactivation of DDC by 5-HT will require structural characterization of the 340-nm adduct, all the observations reported here are consistent with the mechanism shown in Scheme I. 5-HT is accepted by the active site of DDC, where it forms an external Schiff's base with PLP (I). Subsequent deprotonation at α-C generates a quinonoid intermediate (II). The α,β-unsaturated intermediate (III) may be formed by transfer of a proton from β-C of 5-HT to 4-C of the coenzyme (intramolecular process) or by a protonation and deprotonation at 4-C of the coenzyme and at β-C of 5-HT, respectively (intermolecular process, as shown in Scheme I), assisted by amino acid residues of the enzyme. The next step in the pathway, III → IV, requires an oxidation, which could be carried out by molecular oxygen, a yet unidentified oxidizing group of the enzyme, or some other oxidizing species generated during the course of the reaction. Addition of the active site lysyl ϵ-NH2 group, K 303 (20Maras B. Dominici P. Barra D. Bossa F. Borri Voltattorni C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 385-391Google Scholar), to the pyridoxaldimine carbon of structure IV and protonation of 5-HT β-C by a general acid produces the imine complex (V). The 5-HT imine (VI) eliminated from complex V by decomposition of the tetrahedral adduct at the C-4′ of PLP, then undergoes hydrolysis to 5-HIA and ammonia. It can be hypothesized that inactivation occurs by attack of a nucleophile in the enzyme on V to yield Va. This structure is consistent with our observation that 5-HT-inactivated DDC contains both the coenzyme spectroscopic (absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism) features and the radiolabel. The mechanism proposed here does not appear to proceed by any of the known pathways for the principal types of PLP-catalyzed reactions. The oxidative step introduced in this mechanism requires a more detailed investigation. In this regard, it must be kept in mind that although the presence of a second cofactor, pyrroloquinoline quinone, has been claimed (21Groen B.G. Van der Meer R.A. Duine J.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 237: 98-102Google Scholar), no such cofactor could be detected during determination of the complete primary structure of the tissue-purified enzyme by Edman degradation (20Maras B. Dominici P. Barra D. Bossa F. Borri Voltattorni C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 385-391Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that a modified (or reactive) aromatic amino acid residue behaving as a cofactor (22Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 271-284Google Scholar) and therefore responsible for the oxidation step escaped detection during protein sequence analysis. Although the small percentage of PMP found after reaction with 5-HT may in fact be due to a half-transamination reaction, this pathway can be ruled out as the major route of inactivation on the basis of the molar ratio of product/coenzyme and the lack of reactivation on the addition of PLP. Although it is possible that transaminating events do occur, they would appear to be quite infrequent. The finding that 5-HT behaves as a mechanism-based inactivator of DDC may be useful in the design of DDC-directed inhibitors that demonstrate exclusive selectivity of their target. This could be relevant for therapy of diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, which are characterized by an aberrant production of catecholamines. For a productive structural guide to design new DDC enzyme-activated inhibitors, detailed knowledge of this minor catalytic function of DDC may be required. In particular, since this “minor” reaction may not have the same substrate specificity as the major catalytic activity of the enzyme, studies using other catecholic and indolic compounds have been undertaken. Moreover, inactivation events of the type described here may have some physiological relevance. As has been already described for inactivation of D-amino acid transaminase by substrates (19Likos J.J. Ueno H. Feldhaus R.W. Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4377-4386Google Scholar, 23Bhatia M.B. Martinez del Pozo A. Ringe D. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17687-17694Google Scholar), inactivation of DDC by 5-HT could not be detected under conditions usually used for kinetic assays of decarboxylase activity, i.e. a short incubation time with dilute enzyme concentrations. However, DDC slowly loses activity when relatively high concentrations of the enzyme are exposed to 5-HT for relatively long periods of time. Since DDC in the cell may be at a concentration of the same order of magnitude as that used in the present study and may exist together with 5-HT and/or other decarboxylation products for an extended period, the possible 5-HT-induced loss in the catalytic efficiency of DDC in the cell could provide the basis of a control mechanism. We are very grateful to Prof. Marzia Galli (University of Milan) for mass spectroscopy analysis and Prof. Marcello Tiecco (University of Perugia) for helpful discussions relating to the proposed mechanism of inactivation."

Fibroblast-type collagenase (MMP-1) is a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseAPMA4-aminophenylmercuric acetateFIB-CLhuman gingival fibroblast-type collagenaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinasesMSCmodel selection criterion. zinc-dependent endopeptidases, which play a major role in extracellular matrix remodeling as it occurs in health and disease (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Fibroblast-type collagenase is the prototype for several structural features shared by the MMPs, which include a series of distinct and highly conserved domains that include (i) a hydrophobic signal peptide that is cleaved off during secretion followed by (ii) a propeptide sequence that is removed during activation, (iii) a catalytic domain containing the active zinc binding site joined by (iv) a proline-rich hinge region to (v) a hemopexin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that possibly plays a role in substrate specificity.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Google Scholar). TIMPs are thought to act as biological regulators of the turnover of extracellular matrix, a process that occurs in normal tissues during development and wound healing, as well as in inflamed tissues during rheumatoid arthritis and during tumor invasion and metastasis (5Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 556-557Google Scholar). The inhibition of gelatinase by TIMP-1 (28 kDa) has been characterized as a slow, tight-binding inhibition (6Willenbrock F. Crabe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Google Scholar). The dissociation of the stromelysin-TIMP-1 complex into active TIMP-1 demonstrates the noncovalent nature of the binding (7Murphy G. Koklitis P. Carne A.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 1031-1034Google Scholar). The results below indicate that the inhibition of collagenase by TIMP-1 falls into the same kinetic classification. Willenbrock et al. (6Willenbrock F. Crabe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Google Scholar) and Nguyen et al. (8Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Google Scholar) concluded from kinetic data that TIMP-1 inhibits gelatinase and stromelysin according to a single-step mechanism, on the basis of graphic analysis. Although the data were analyzed according to a competitive mechanism, the alternatives were not tested and the hypothesis by these workers did not include this as part of the mechanism. However, since Welgus et al. (9Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Roswit W.T. Stricklin G.P. Collagen Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 167-189Google Scholar) produced evidence to indicate that TIMP-1 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of collagenase, these other mechanisms must also be considered. Kinetic data from experiments involving other examples of this class of inhibitors have been analyzed according to the schemes reviewed and described by Morrison and Walsh (10Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar) and by Williams and Morrison (11Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Google Scholar). Data that are most generally useful are from experiments in which the appearance of product (P) is measured as a function of time, after either the addition of enzyme to a mixture of substrate (A) and inhibitor (I) or the addition of substrate to an equilibrium mixture of enzyme and inhibitor. Data from the former experiments is then fit to Equation 1 and values are estimated for the initial reaction velocity (ve), the reaction velocity (vs) after maximum inhibition, and the apparent first-order rate constant (kobs) for the transition between the two. The values of these parameters from a series of experiments in which only the concentration of inhibitor is varied are then subjected to graphic analysis by several methods to exclude certain mechanisms and to estimate the values for the putative reaction parameters. However, one of the approximations in the development of Equation 1, that the concentration of inhibitor does not change significantly during the course of the reaction, limits the possible experiments to those done with the inhibitor concentration much higher than the enzyme concentration. This approximation makes the estimation of the koff and the KI almost impossible. Furthermore, graphic analysis of this data is subject to the same anomalies of statistical weighting and uncertainty about goodness of fit as is graphic analysis of steady-state enzyme kinetic data (12Wilkins G.B. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Google Scholar). Therefore, data analysis by nonlinear regression with the analytically integrated equation for each mechanism would seem to be preferable. Although a published integrated equation for a simple competitive mechanism circumvents these difficulties (11Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Google Scholar), analytically integrated expressions for modeling more complex mechanisms have been very few, presumably because the time and effort involved in analytic integration of a separate equation for each mechanism has been somewhat daunting. Alternatively, numeric integration of the differential equations has been used to simulate the mechanism for a boronic acid inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (13Gutheil W.G. Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8723-8731Google Scholar), and have been suggested specifically for experiments in which the concentration of both inhibitor and substrate change appreciably during the reaction course (11Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Google Scholar, 14Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 195-200Google Scholar). Furthermore numeric integration in combination with nonlinear regression has been used for the analysis of pre-steady-state data (15Chandler J.P. Hill D.E. Spivey H.O. Comp. Biomed. Res. 1972; 5: 515-534Google Scholar). A comparison of these methods of data analysis for the same data and mechanism is presented below. Among the schemes that describe data from kinetic experiments with slow, tight-binding inhibitors are those in which the binding of inhibitor occurs in a single slow step (Scheme 1) (16Morgenstern K.A. Spricher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar), and those in which binding occurs in two steps (Scheme 2). In the latter mechanism, a fast, reversible collision complex slowly reacts to form a tight complex (10Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar). Moreover, since practically all of the inhibitors investigated to date have been substrate analogs, the kinetic data have been analyzed as competitive inhibition. Additional kinetic mechanisms are tested below.Scheme IIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fibroblast-type collagenase was isolated from human gingival fibroblast conditioned media by affinity chromatography as described previously by Windsor et al. (17Windsor L.J. Bodden M.K. Birkedal-Hansen B. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26201-26207Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was passed over an affinity column prepared by coupling 28 mg of anti-collagenase monoclonal antibody VI3 to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The bound material was eluted with 6 M urea in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 1 μM ZnCl2) and dialyzed against the buffer to remove the urea. Truncated fibroblast-type collagenase (mini-CL) lacking the hemopexin-like domain was expressed in Escherichia coli and extracted by 6 M urea as described by Windsor et al. (37Windsor L.J. Steele D.L. LeBlanc S.B. Taylor K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The mini-CL 6 M urea extract was passed over a Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 6 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 1 μM ZnCl2. Peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 1 μM ZnCl2) and passed over the anti-collagenase monoclonal antibody VI3 affinity column as described above. Native TIMP-1 was purified from human fetal lung cells by heparin-Sepharose chromatography followed by C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously by Bodden et al. (18Bodden M.K. Harber G.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C.M. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18943-18952Google Scholar). Recombinant human TIMP-1 was purified from culture medium of HeLa cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the human TIMP-1 gene 2N. C. M. Caterina, L. J. Windsor, M. K. Bodden, A.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method as described by the supplier (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. TIMP-1 protein (50 μg) was labeled with 125I by Bolton-Hunter reagent as described by the manufacturer (DuPont NEN) and resulted in a specific activity of 0.1 μCi/μg. Fibroblast-type collagenase (4.8 nM), activated with APMA, was incubated with and without unlabeled TIMP-1 (4.6 nM) for 30 min at 23°C. Radioactive 125I-labeled TIMP-1 (53.5 nM) was then added and incubated at 23°C for indicated times before addition of sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS (20DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.-D. Lu H.S. Ting J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Google Scholar) to terminate the reaction. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the methods of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the radioactive bands on the dried gel were identified and quantitated with a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In experiments in which the substrate was added last APMA-activated FIB-CL (6 nM) was incubated at 23°C for 20 min with various concentrations of TIMP-1 in 1 ml of buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 1 μM ZnCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 ml of the substrate, the coumarinyl peptide derivative MCA-P-L-G-L-Dpa-A-R (22Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Google Scholar); (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) in the same buffer to give a final concentration of 15 μM. The emergence of fluorescence due to the cleavage of the peptide substrate was monitored using an SLM Aminco SPJ-500C Spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength 328 nm; emission wavelength 393 nm). The data were collected for 1,000 s by storage of an emission reading every second in a computer data file according to the instructions provided by the instrument manufacturer. In experiments in which the enzyme was added last, the coumarinyl peptide derivative described above (2.5 μM) was incubated in the buffer described above in the absence or in the presence of various concentrations of TIMP-1. The reaction was initiated by the addition of APMA-activated FIB-CL, 3 nM final concentration. The fluorescence was monitored as described above. The data from the time-course experiments in which enzyme was added last were averaged over each subsequent group of four points, corrected for quenching, and converted to units of product concentration in a spreadsheet program. The resulting data were then analyzed by one or more of three methods: nonlinear regression (Equation 1) followed by graphic analysis of the parameter values; nonlinear regression with a model-specific, integrated equation; and nonlinear regression with numeric integration of the differential equations for the model (all with the Scientist program, MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The model selection criterion (MSC), calculated by the computer program (23MicroMath Scientific Software, (1993) Scientist Handbook, Rev. 7F51, pp. 207–208, MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT.Google Scholar), is a modification of the Akaike information criterion (24Akaike H. Math. Sci. 1976; 14: 5-9Google Scholar) and is proportional to the goodness of fit of the model. It is the natural logarithm of the sum of the residuals, normalized for the magnitude of the data and adjusted for the number of unknown parameters in the model. Numeric integration, in those models in which it was used, was done by the episode method (25Byrne, G., Hindmarsh, A., (1976) EPISODE: An experimental package for the integration of systems of ordinary differential equations with banded Jacobians, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Report UCID-30132, Livermore, CA.Google Scholar). Subsequent trials with other methods for numeric integration gave identical results as with the same data set and the same model with the former method. Labeled 125I-TIMP-1 was added to the unlabeled complexes, made in an incubation of fibroblast-type collagenase with unlabeled TIMP-1, and samples were analyzed for radioactivity in the collagenase-TIMP-1 complex at various times. The results (Fig. 1) show that radioactive TIMP-1 was exchanged into the TIMP·FIB-CL complex in a time-dependent manner. Thus, these results demonstrate that the TIMP·FIB-CL complex is a tight but reversible one. Evidence for competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms of slow, tight-binding inhibitors has resulted from experiments in which an equilibrium mixture of enzyme and inhibitor are diluted into a solution with a high concentration of substrate (26Bakker A.V. Jung S. Spencer R.W. Vinick F.J. Faraci W.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 559-562Google Scholar). If the shape of the time-course curve is concave upward, the substrate is displacing the inhibitor from the enzyme. In time-course experiments in which a stoichiometric equilibrium mixture of FIB-CL and TIMP-1 was added to substrate (15 μM), the rate of the reaction was constant with time (Fig. 2). This rate (5.83 × 10−5μM/s) was within 6% of the final steady-state rate (6.14 × 10−5μM/s) measured, when the same concentration of enzyme was added last to a mixture of substrate and TIMP-1 at the same concentrations. These results suggest that substrate does not displace TIMP-1 from the enzyme and the TIMP-1 must bind to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex in a noncompetitive mechanism. Although similar results would be seen if only a fraction of the TIMP were active and participated in irreversible binding to the enzyme, the reversibility of TIMP-1 binding to the enzyme was demonstrated above. Furthermore, the binding of substrate at the concentration used may be insufficient to demonstrate a difference. Additional kinetic evidence for a noncompetitive mechanism is presented below. The time-course data, from experiments in which enzyme was added last to mixtures of substrate and various concentrations of TIMP-1, at least 10 times that of enzyme, were fit to Equation 1, and the values of ve and kobs were each estimated. The observation that the initial velocity, ve, decreases with increasing TIMP-1 concentration indicates that an inactive complex is formed rapidly before data collection begins (Scheme 2). Furthermore, the plot of 1/ve versus TIMP-1 concentration should be linear with a positive slope for a two-step mechanism such as Scheme 2 (10Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar). Accordingly, the data (Fig. 3) are consistent with a mechanism in which TIMP-1 binds to fibroblast-type collagenase in a two-step mechanism. The dissociation constant, KD, for the reversible complex calculated from the straight line is 19.5 nM (Table I). The two-step mechanism (Scheme 2) results in equations for kobs that predict a hyperbolic relationship versus TIMP-1 concentration (Equation 4), whereas a one-step mechanism predicts a linear plot. A plot of kobs versus TIMP-1 clearly shows a hyperbolic relationship (Fig. 4).Table I.Parameter values associated with the equations derived from the mechanism (Scheme II) that best fits time-course data for the inhibition of fibroblast-type collagenase by TIMP-1ParameterAnalytical methodGraphic analysisNonlinear regressionNumeric integrationkcat (s−1)N.D.aNot determined.0.1370.14(1.2 × 10−4)(1.1 × 10−4)KD (M)19.5 × 10−920.9 × 10−920.3 × 10−9(1.22 × 10−9)(1.0 × 10−9)k1 (M−1 s−1)IDbIndeterminant.3.68 × 1063.62 × 106(0.00034)(0.00028)k2 (s−1)IDbIndeterminant.7.5 × 10−57.5 × 10−5(3.8 × 10−5)(3.3 × 10−5)a Not determined.b Indeterminant. Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Plot of the time constant (kobs) of inhibition versus the concentration of TIMP-1. The reaction was carried out in a cuvette (3 ml total volume) containing substrate (2.5 M), and various concentrations of TIMP-1 (0-150 nM) in buffer. It was initiated by the addition of collagenase (3 nM, final concentration). The time-course data from each experiment were fit to Equation 1 for the estimation of kobs. The triangles denote data from reactions with full-length, fibroblast-type collagenase, whereas the diamonds denote data from reactions with mini-collagenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to test further the hypothesis that the initial reversible binding of TIMP-1 is fast and noncompetitive, the time course of the reaction was measured in the absence of TIMP-1 and at low TIMP-1 concentration (6 nM) at various concentrations of substrate (2.5-15 μM). The initial velocity of the experiments without TIMP-1 was measured as the slope of the initial linear segment of the curve, whereas the initial velocity of the experiments in the presence of TIMP-1 (Ve) was determined from nonlinear regression of the time-course data with Equation 1. A plot of the reciprocal of the initial velocities versus the reciprocal substrate concentration (Fig. 5) appears to demonstrate further that the inhibition is noncompetitive. However, Morrison (27Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Google Scholar) showed that such plots of fast, reversible tight-binding inhibitors are nonlinear (concave down). Nonlinear regression analysis of the data for initial velocity, substrate, and inhibitor concentrations with equations for steady-state inhibition by such inhibitors 3The equations, derived according to Morrison (26Bakker A.V. Jung S. Spencer R.W. Vinick F.J. Faraci W.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 559-562Google Scholar), appear in the Appendix. fit the noncompetitive model better than the competitive (model selection criterion: 4.1 versus 3.4). Although the estimates of the adjustable parameters were poor, presumably because of the paucity of experimental points, the value for the Km for substrate (11.6 μM) indicates that a significant effect of substrate (32%) on inhibition by a strictly competitive mechanism should have been detected at the highest substrate concentration. Thus, the data support the hypothesis that under the present experimental conditions TIMP-1 binds to either free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex to form an initial, reversible, inhibited complex. The fit by nonlinear regression to the same time-course data from experiments at high TIMP-1 concentration (30 nM) that were analyzed graphically above, but with equations from analytic integration of the differential equations associated with either Scheme 1 or Scheme 2, was better for the latter mechanism (MSC = 6.64 versus 6.28). From the fit to the equations associated with Scheme 2 (Equations 1, 2, 3, 4), P=vst+(ve−vs)(1−ekobst)/kobs(Eq. 1) ve=Etotkcat(1+KmA)(1+ItotKD)(Eq. 2) vs=Etotkcat(1+KmA)(1+ItotKD)(Eq. 3) kobs=k1(1+KDItot)+k2(Eq. 4) the values for KD and k1 (Table I) are estimated with some precision and the value of KD agrees very well with that estimated by graphic analysis. The fact that k2 is estimated poorly is a consequence of the required high TIMP-1 concentration in the experiments, which results in very little demonstrable reverse reaction. Therefore, the calculated value of the global dissociation constant, K*D, will also be imprecise, and these same considerations call into question the precision with which the latter parameter was estimated by graphic analysis. Thus, the limitations imposed by the necessity for data gathering at high concentrations of TIMP-1 and the consequent limitations on graphic analysis and this method of nonlinear regression become apparent. The fit of the same time-course data to the equation systems containing the differential equations from Scheme II, Scheme II, 4The differential models (Schemes 3-6) are available upon request. (Equation 5 and Equation 6) plus a conservation equation for enzyme (Equation 7) was also somewhat better for the latter mechanism (MSC = 6.64 versus 6.41). d(EIt)dt=k1(EIr)−k2(EIt)(Eq. 5) dPdt=EfkcatA(A+Km)(Eq. 6) Etot=Ef+EIr+EIt(Eq. 7) The estimated values of the reaction parameters for the latter mechanism, KD and k1 (Table I) are the same as those estimated by the previous methods. However, as with the previous methods, the limitations on the experimental conditions result in a poor estimate of the value of k2. However, the good agreement of both the model selection and the parameter values with the previous methods of data analysis demonstrate the validity of numeric integration. Fits of six additional data sets from experiments with both low (1.5-30 nM) TIMP-1 and high TIMP-1 concentrations, 60-150 nM, to the two models described above (Scheme I, Scheme II) by nonlinear regression with numeric integration of a system of the differential equations plus the conservation equations for TIMP-1 (Equation 8) and substrate (Equation 9), as well as one for enzyme were indistinguishable from each other. Itot=I+EIr+EIt(Eq. 8) Atot=A+P(Eq. 9) Therefore, fits of one or more of the data sets were attempted to the corresponding system of equations from at least five additional mechanisms. These included: Scheme 3 (a slow enzyme conformation change followed by rapid binding to TIMP-1), Scheme 4 (a slow TIMP-1 conformation change followed by rapid binding to enzyme), Scheme 5 (a rapidly formed enzyme-TIMP-1 complex followed by slowly formed enzyme-TIMP-1 and enzyme-TIMP-TIMP complexes), Scheme 6 (a two-step binding of TIMP-1 to enzyme (Scheme 2) in competition with the rapid dimerization of TIMP-1), and Scheme 7 (a two-step binding of TIMP-1 to enzyme (Scheme 2) in which the rate of breakdown of the tight complex (EI*) is proportional to free TIMP-1).4 Of these mechanistic models, one or the other of the last two fit each of the data sets clearly better than any of the others. Consequently the average MSC is clearly higher for these models than for any of the others (Table II). Furthermore, the MSC is clearly higher for both of these models with each of the individual data sets. However, the dimerization model is less attractive because the very low values of the regression analysis estimates of the dissociation constant for the rapid, reversible binding of TIMP-1 to enzyme (10−4 nM) are inconsistent with the rough estimates above (e.g. 10 nM) by graphic analysis and analytic integration. Furthermore, the very low estimates of the dissociation constant for the TIMP-1 dimer (10−7 nM) would predict that TIMP-1 exists only as a very stable dimer. Although TIMP-1 dimers have been demonstrated (30Mercer E. Cawston T.E. De Silva M. Hazelman B.L. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 505-510Google Scholar), their stability is much lower than predicted by the dissociation constant above. Therefore, the most feasible model of those tested to date is that in which the dissociation of the enzyme-TIMP-1 complex requires the participation of a molecule of free TIMP-1. It is hypothesized that the free TIMP-1 forms a dimer with the bound TIMP-1 and causes its release from the enzyme, and that the dimer subsequently is in equilibrium with TIMP-1 monomers.Table IIThe fit of the experimental data from the inhibition of collagenase by TIMP-1 to the equations derived from various mechanismsModelMSC averageOne-step (Scheme 1)4.59Two-step sequence (Scheme 2)4.85A slow enzyme conformation change followed by"

https://openalex.org/W1988819058,"Transcriptional repression of the murine vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene in fibroblasts results from the interaction of two sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding activities (VACssBF1 and VACssBF2) with opposite strands of an essential transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) element (Sun, S., Stoflet, E. S., Cogan, J. G., Strauch, A. R., and Getz, M. J. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2429-2436). Here, we identify a sequence element located within a protein-coding exon of the gene that bears structural similarity with the TEF-1 enhancer. This includes a 30-base pair region of purine-pyrimidine asymmetry encompassing a perfect 6-base pair GGAATG TEF-1 recognition motif. Unlike the enhancer, however, the exon sequence exhibits no TEF-1 binding activity nor does the pyrimidine-rich strand bind VACssBF1. However, VACssBF2 interacts equally well with the purine-rich strand of both the enhancer and the exon sequence. To test the ability of VACssBF2 to independently repress transcription, the exon sequence was placed upstream of a deletionally activated promoter containing an intact TEF-1 binding site. The exon sequence repressed promoter activity, whereas a mutant deficient in VACssBF2 binding did not. Moreover, VACssBF2 similarly repressed activator protein-1-dependent transcription of a heterologous tissue factor promoter. These results suggest that VACssBF2 possesses an intrinsic ability to disrupt enhancer function independently of the enhancer-binding proteins involved.

The cell- and tissue-specific transcription of eukaryotic genes is regulated by cis-acting elements that are generally localized outside of the RNA/protein coding region of the gene. These regulatory elements, known commonly as enhancers or silencers, are DNA sequences that influence gene transcription in either a positive or negative fashion by virtue of their ability to bind specific proteins that, in turn, regulate the assembly of a basal transcriptional complex. Although these DNA elements are commonly found upstream of the transcription start site, cis-acting silencing elements have also been localized within introns and the protein-coding sequences of a number of genes (1Frenkel B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29677-29687Google Scholar). Promoter activation, site-directed mutagenesis, and DNA-binding studies have led to the hypothesis that VACssBFs function by stabilizing a local single-stranded DNA conformation within the 30-bp promoter element (PE) which precludes TEF-1 binding and hence transcriptional activation (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar). Interestingly, amino acids 44-53 of VSM α-actin are encoded by a DNA sequence that is structurally similar to the 5′ PE. This intragenic sequence element or coding element (CE) lies immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of intron 2 and is positionally conserved in all vertebrate actin genes (21Miwa T. Manabe Y. Kurokawa K. Kamada S. Kanda N. Bruns G. Ueyama H. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3296-3306Google Scholar). The coding element (CE) and promoter element (PE) each possess a core GGAATG consensus TEF-1 binding motif centered within an asymmetric polypurine-polypyrimidine tract. The present study illustrates that VACssBF2, but not VACssBF1, interacts with the CE in a sequence- and single strand-specific manner. The identification of this promoter-independent VACssBF2 binding site permitted a more rigorous evaluation of the ssDNA-binding properties, subunit composition, and functional activity of VACssBF2. VACssBF2 is shown to consist of multiple distinct polypeptide species of differing apparent molecular weights and ssDNA binding specificity. Functional analysis of the VACssBF2-CE interaction conducted within the context of homologous and heterologous promoters suggests that VACssBF2 can repress enhancer-dependent transcription independently of both VACssBF1 and the dsDNA-binding protein governing enhancer activity. Mouse embryo-derived AKR-2B fibroblasts were maintained in culture and transfected as described previously (22Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Google Scholar, 23Felts S.J. Stoflet E.S. Eggers C.T. Getz M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12355-12362Google Scholar). Transfected cells were allowed to recover in McCoys 5A medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 18-24 h. The cells were then washed twice and rendered quiescent by incubating an additional 48 h in serum-free MCDB402 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Quiescent cells were stimulated for 6 h with MCDB402 medium and 20% fetal bovine serum or for 4 h with the same medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Serum- and cycloheximide-stimulated cells were washed twice and subjected to a 2-h washout in medium lacking cycloheximide to allow for the recovery of CAT protein synthesis (24Elder P.K. French C.L. Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 480-485Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and cellular extracts were prepared by repeated freeze-thawing. Protein concentration was determined by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter protein was measured in cell lysates using an immunoassay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The deletionally activated VSM α-actin promoter construct pC3VSMP4 (VSMP4) (25Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Google Scholar) was modified by insertion of a synthetic copy of a 33-base pair segment of DNA encoding the intron 2/exon 3 splice site and amino acids 44-53 of VSM α-actin (Table I) both 3′ and 5′ of the transcription start site. Complementary oligonucleotides possessing the appropriate sticky ends as well as an internal BclI restriction site (underlined) of the form 5′-AGCTTTGATCAXnG-3′ and 5′-TCGACXRnTGATCAA-3′ or 5′-GATCCTGATCAXn-3′ and 5′-TCGATGATCAXRnG-3′ where Xn is 5′- CAGGGAGTAATGGTTGGAATGGGCCAAAAAGAC-3′(wt), XRn is 5′-GTCTTTTTGGCCCATTCCAACCATTACTCCCTG-3′ (wt) or Xn is 5′-CAttGAGTAcTGGTTttccgtGGCCAAccAGAC3′(mu2), XRn is 5′-GTCTggTTGGCCacggaaAACCAgTACTCaaTG3′(mu2) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA) and gel-filtered over a NAP-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) in distilled water. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into either HindIII and SalI (5′ construct) or BamHI and XhoI (3′ construct) cut, and phosphatase-treated VSMP4 to create P4/CE(5′) and P4/CE(3′) constructs, respectively. The CE(3′) plasmids were constructed such that the VSM α-actin coding sequence element and the CAT coding sequence are in reading frame. The CE was similarly cloned into a heterologous tissue factor promoter construct (AP1TF60CAT) upstream of two AP-1 elements (23Felts S.J. Stoflet E.S. Eggers C.T. Getz M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12355-12362Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides possessing 5′ HindIII and 3′ XbaI sticky ends, to create TF/CE(5′). Plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 cells using standard CaCl2 techniques. All plasmid DNA used in transfection experiments was purified by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. The fidelity of all cloned sequences described in this paper was confirmed by automated dideoxy DNA sequencing.Table I.Oligonucleotide band shift and Southwestern blot probes used in this studyDesignationSequenceaUnderlined letters denote transversion mutations.PE-PrMss5″-GGAGCAGAACAGAGGAATGCAGTGGAAGAG-3′(coding strand)CE-PrMss5″-GGGAGTAATGGTTGGAATGGGCCAAAAAGA-3′(coding strand)CE-PrMmu25′-TTGAGTACTTCCGTGGCCAACCAGA-3′(coding strand mutant)PE-MCATss5″-CTCTTCCACTGCATTCCTCTGTTCTGCTCC-3′(noncoding strand)CE-MCATss5″-TCTTTTTGGCCCATTCCAACCATTACTCCC-3′(noncoding strand)a Underlined letters denote transversion mutations. Open table in a new tab Transcriptional activity of promoter constructs was assessed by analysis of correctly initiated CAT transcripts via primer extension using a CAT coding sequence-specific primer (24Elder P.K. French C.L. Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 480-485Google Scholar). AKR-2B cells were cotransfected (in quadruplicate) as described above with 10 μg of VSM α-actin promoter plasmid along with 5 μg of p99βAc-CAT as an internal control (22Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Google Scholar). Following 6 h stimulation with 20% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, total RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ mRNA was subsequently isolated using a PolyATtract mRNA isolation system III kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Lyophilized poly(A)+ mRNA (1.0 μg) was resuspended in 12 μl of nuclease-free water containing 3 ng (∼250,000 cpm) of 32P-end-labeled primer complementary to nucleotides 29-61 of the CAT coding sequence (24Elder P.K. French C.L. Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 480-485Google Scholar). The primer was annealed to its complementary mRNA by sequential 10-min incubations at 70, 65, 60, 55, and 4°C. The reaction mixtures were then supplemented with cDNA synthesis buffer components (7 μl) to a final concentration of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 500 μM dNTPs. The primer was then extended to the transcriptional initiation site by addition of 200 units of reverse transcriptase (1 μl) (Superscript RT, Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubation for 1 h at 42°C. Extension products were resolved by denaturing electrophoresis on a 0.75-mm thick 10% acrylamide (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 M urea gel in TBE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM borate, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.3)). Following electrophoresis, the gels were wrapped in plastic and exposed to x-ray film (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak) at −70°C in a Kodak X-Omat film cassette with intensifying screens for 18-36 h. Wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides (30 base) corresponding to either the promoter element (PE, nucleotide −194 to −165) or coding element (CE, G/nucleotide +201 to +229) (Fig. 1, Table I) were synthesized and purified as described above. Whole cell protein extract of rapidly growing AKR-2B fibroblasts was prepared by hypertonic lysis as described previously (13Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Google Scholar). Cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared from rapidly growing AKR-2B and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts according to the mini-extraction method of deGroot and co-workers (26deGroot R.P. Auwerx J. Bourouis M. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 841-847Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein-DNA interactions were analyzed by band shift assay using AKR-2B fibroblast protein extracts and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) and purified using S-200 HR microspin columns (Pharmacia). Annealed double-stranded 30-bp DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dNTP (A and C) (Amersham Corp.) and Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) and purified as described for the single-stranded oligonucleotides. EMSA reaction mixtures typically contained 0.5-5 μg of whole cell protein, 0.6 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1-5 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50-150 mM NaCl, 2.5-5% v/v glycerol, and 15,000-20,000 cpm (∼10-100 fmol) of 32P- labeled DNA probe in a volume of 20 μl. In competitive EMSAs, reaction mixtures containing excess unlabeled competitor were incubated for 5 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated for a total of 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis for 90 min at 200 V in TGE (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.3)) on a 1.5-mm thick 6% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed as described above. Apparent molecular weights of proteins bound to [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide in EMSAs were determined by UV cross-linking and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (13Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of protein from whole cell, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts was resolved by denaturing electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus at 150 V for 90 min. Separated proteins were then electrotransferred to rehydrated PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 4°C for 90 min (300 mA) in transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine (pH 8.3), and 20% methanol. After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in TNE buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) overnight at 4°C. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Prior to addition of probe, the PVDF membranes were preequilibrated in binding buffer (1% nonfat dry milk-TNE) for 30 min. 32P-End-labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide probe, 2 × 106 cpm in 5 ml of binding buffer containing 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), was then added, and the membranes were incubated for 3 h with continuous agitation. The membranes were washed three times, 10 min each with TNE containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then one final time with TNE alone. After air drying, the membranes were wrapped in plastic, placed in a x-ray cassette, and autoradiographed at −70°C for 1-3 days as described above. Apparent molecular weights were calculated from a plot of log molecular weight versus relative mobility of pre-stained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) using a linear least squares regression fit. In previous studies transcriptional regulation of the murine VSM α-actin gene in fibroblasts and myoblasts was shown to be mediated, in part, by both positive and negative elements residing in a 30-bp asymmetric polypurine-polypyrimidine tract within the 5′ promoter (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar, 13Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

Promoter activation and DNA-binding experiments suggested a model in which repression of this TEF-1-dependent enhancer element is maintained by disruption of base pairing via the interaction of two sequence-specific ssDNA binding proteins, VACssBF1 and VACssBF2, that bind opposite stands of the DNA helix encompassing the TEF-1 recognition sequence (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar, 13Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Google Scholar). Interestingly, a search of the cDNA sequence (28Min B.H. Strauch A.R. Foster D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10374Google Scholar) revealed that a protein coding exon of the gene contains another, perfect, consensus TEF-1 recognition motif (GGAATG) centered within a purine-rich tract. As shown in Fig. 1, this protein-coding element or CE which encodes the intron 2/exon 3 splice site and amino acids 44-53 (29Min B. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16667-16675Google Scholar) also exhibits additional nucleotide sequence similarity (Fig. 1, bold letters) to the negatively regulated TEF-1 enhancer, termed the promoter element (PE). It is noteworthy that the intragenic positioning of the CE at the intron 2/exon 3 boundary is conserved in all isoforms of mammalian actin genes characterized thus far (21Miwa T. Manabe Y. Kurokawa K. Kamada S. Kanda N. Bruns G. Ueyama H. Kakunaga T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3296-3306Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequence encoded by the CE is identical among the different actin isoforms, although the nucleotide sequence differs due to multiple third position codon changes (Table II (28Min B.H.

Open table in a new tab Direct and competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with wild-type and mutant 30 base oligonucleotides (Table I) and AKR-2B cellular extract were performed to delineate the protein-binding properties of the CE in comparison to the PE. The double-stranded form of the PE has been previously shown to interact with a protein that is related with, and likely identical to, TEF-1 (13Cogan J.G. Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11310-11321Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a GGAATG motif in both elements, only the double-stranded form of the PE exhibited detectable affinity for TEF-1 (data not shown). Similar results were obtained on examination of VACssBF1 binding affinity. As shown in Fig. 2, the pyrimidine-rich, noncoding strand of the CE (CE-MCATss) did not compete for binding of VACssBF1 to 32P-PE-MCATss (lanes 6-10), whereas competition was readily observed by the homologous PE-MCATss sequence (lanes 1-5). Direct binding EMSAs also indicated that VACssBF1 had little or no detectable affinity for 32P-CE-MCATss (data not shown). In marked contrast to both TEF-1 and VACssBF1, the previously described, electrophoretically distinct band-shifted components of VACssBF2 (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar) were clearly resolved when either the PE (PE-PrMss) or CE (CE-PrMss) sense strands were used as probes (Fig. 3). The ability of excess, unlabeled CE-PrMss and PE-PrMss to independently compete for binding of VACssBF2 to 32P-CE-PrMss (Fig. 4, lanes 2-6 and 14-18) confirmed that these ssDNA probes likely interact with the identical protein(s). Importantly, as illustrated by the competitive properties of CE-PrMmu2 (Fig. 4, lanes 8-12), mutation of nucleotides that are positionally conserved in both the PE and CE (Fig. 1, bold letters) significantly reduces the affinity of the CE for the more rapidly migrating VACssBF2 doublet. The binding of the more slowly migrating VACssBF2 component was not affected by these mutations implying that this species has a weaker affinity for ssDNA or, alternatively, a different sequence specificity (see “Discussion”) than that of the VACssBF2 doublet. These data are consistent with previous mutagenesis experiments conducted with the homologous PE sense strand which indicated that binding activity of the VACssBF2 doublet is impaired by select purine to pyrimidine transversions introduced either within the GGAATG motif or toward the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ssDNA (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar).Fig. 4Effect of wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides on VACssBF2 binding to CE coding strand DNA. 32P-Labeled ss oligonucleotide corresponding to the coding strand of the CE (CE-PrMss) was incubated with AKR-2B whole cell extract protein (3.6 μg) in the presence of the indicated molar excess of either homologous oligonucleotide (CE-PrMss, lanes 2-6), mutant CE coding strand oligonucleotide (CE-PrMmu2, lanes 8-12), or the PE wild-type coding strand oligonucleotide (PE-PrMss, lanes 14-18).

FP, free probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding site mutagenesis studies presented above (Fig. 4) as well as those reported previously (12Sun S. Stoflet E.S. Cogan J.G. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2429-2436Google Scholar) indicate that the effect of tested mutations within either the PE or CE is exclusively restricted to the more rapidly migrating VACssBF2 doublet, implying that VACssBF2 is not a homogeneous ssDNA-binding entity. Therefore, an analysis of the individual VACssBF2 band shift species was undertaken. Single-stranded DNA-protein complexes were first resolved in nondenaturing EMSA gels following incubation of AKR-2B whole cell protein extract with a coding strand-specific oligonucleotide probe (32P-PE-PrM). The protein-DNA complexes were irreversibly cross-linked by exposure of the wet gels to 254 nm UV light and then excised and subjected to denaturing electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fig. 5 illustrates that VACssBF2 consists of multiple distinct polypeptide species. Relative apparent molecular weights of the individual species were calculated after correcting for the contribution of the DNA component (35Gray T.A. Gumucio D.L. Collins F.S. Technique (Phila.). 1990; 2: 147-154Google Scholar). The two bands of the rapidly migrating doublet were independently excised following UV cross-linking and analyzed separately. As shown in Fig. 5 (lanes 2 and 3), the individually cross-linked components of the VACssBF2 doublet migrated somewhat differently with corrected apparent molecular weights of 52,000 and 49,000, respectively. The more slowly migrating component (Fig. 5, lane 1) resolved as two components, a major Mr∼ 84,000 species and a faint Mr∼ 30,000 species. Given the relative difference in intensity of the two bands, the Mr∼ 30,000 species is likely only a minor component of the more slowly migrating VACssBF2 complex. Southwestern blotting experiments were also performed with 30 base CE ssDNA probes to validate the conclusion that VACssBF2 consists of multiple distinct polypeptide species.

Its three members, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, in Escherichia coli work synergistically to promote protein protection, disaggregation, and import into the various organelles. In the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae the three corresponding members are designated as Ssc1p, Mdj1p, and Mge1p, respectively. The MGE1 gene was previously cloned by us and others, and its product has been shown to be absolutely essential for protein transport into mitochondria and hence cell viability. To better understand its biological role, we have proceeded to overexpress and purify the mature Mge1p in E. coli through the construction of the appropriate vector clone. Mge1p has been shown to functionally substitute for its E. coli GrpE counterpart in a variety of its biological functions, including suppression of the bacterial temperature-sensitive phenotype of the grpE280 mutation, formation of a stable complex with DnaK, stimulation of DnaK's ATPase activity, and the refolding of denatured luciferase by the DnaK/DnaJ chaperone proteins. Thus, the function of the GrpE homologues appears to be highly conserved across the biological kingdoms.

https://openalex.org/W2024771447,"The binding of low molecular weight type II phospholipase A2 (EC) to membrane surfaces and hydrolysis of phospholipid are thought to involve the formation of a hydrophobic channel into which a single substrate molecule diffuses before cleavage. The floor and right side of the channel are provided by hydrophobic residues 2, 5, and 9 of an amphipathic amino-terminal helix. The channel is postulated to form via a conformational change in this helix and inward movement of a hydrophobic flap (residue 69 side chain). We show that the amino-terminal tryptic peptide of human type II phospholipase A2 forms a noncovalent complex with the tryptic peptide from residues 70-74 of the enzyme. Further, the 70-74-peptide sequence (FLSYK) dose-dependently inhibits phospholipid hydrolysis in a mixed micelle assay. This native peptide inhibition also occurred with type II enzymes from Crotalus durissus and Crotalus atrox, which have different amino acid sequences at the amino terminus as well as different 70-74 regions of the molecules. Despite significant conservation of tertiary structure among the enzymes, inhibition by each peptide is specific to the enzyme from which the peptide sequence is derived. We propose that these native peptides inhibit enzyme activity via a sequence-specific, noncovalent interaction with the amino-terminal residues of the enzyme, thereby preventing the conformational change on binding to the micelle interface. These experiments demonstrate a new method for specific inhibition of phospholipase A2 which, in principle, would be applicable to other biologically active polypeptides and proteins. The binding of low molecular weight type II phospholipase A2 (EC) to membrane surfaces and hydrolysis of phospholipid are thought to involve the formation of a hydrophobic channel into which a single substrate molecule diffuses before cleavage. The floor and right side of the channel are provided by hydrophobic residues 2, 5, and 9 of an amphipathic amino-terminal helix. The channel is postulated to form via a conformational change in this helix and inward movement of a hydrophobic flap (residue 69 side chain). We show that the amino-terminal tryptic peptide of human type II phospholipase A2 forms a noncovalent complex with the tryptic peptide from residues 70-74 of the enzyme. Further, the 70-74-peptide sequence (FLSYK) dose-dependently inhibits phospholipid hydrolysis in a mixed micelle assay. This native peptide inhibition also occurred with type II enzymes from Crotalus durissus and Crotalus atrox, which have different amino acid sequences at the amino terminus as well as different 70-74 regions of the molecules.

For example, the AT minor groove-binding drug distamycin A inhibited the binding of proteins such as OTF-1, NEF-1, and antennapedia homeodomain to their AT-rich regulatory elements (8Broggini M.

Recently, our laboratory undertook to identify characteristics of DNA-binding drugs that were required for inhibition of TF·DNA complex formation (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). Individual TFs that recognized DNA sequences at AT- or GC-rich sites were used to test the specificity of drugs. A number of drugs were evaluated for their ability to block the association of the general transcription factor TBP to its AT-rich binding site in the DNA minor groove. AT minor groove-binding agents such as distamycin A were very effective at both preventing and disrupting TBP·DNA complexes (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar). In a subsequent study, we examined the ability of a wide variety of drugs including intercalators and minor groove-binding agents to interfere with the binding of EGR1, a nuclear phosphoprotein with three zinc fingers binding to the DNA major groove, and a panel of other TFs to their consensus DNA binding sites (13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar, 14Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Google Scholar, 15Cao X.

The most potent inhibitors at EGR1·DNA complex formation were nogalamycin, hedamycin, and chromomycin A3, which shared a preference for the GC-rich binding site of EGR1. To further understand how a drug might specifically affect TFs binding to their consensus binding sites, it would be useful to evaluate drug inhibition of TFs using a DNA fragment composed of multiple factor-binding sites. Recent studies by Tatarowicz et al. 2W. A. Tatarowicz, A. S. Pekosz, S. L. Madden, F. J. Rauscher III, S.-Y. Chiang, T. A. Beerman, and N. W. Fraser, manuscript in preparation. identified a DNA sequence of 5′-TATAAAAGCGGGGG that contained adjacent regulatory binding sites for EGR1 and TBP, on the herpes simplex virus latency (HSVL) promoter. Our laboratory wished to examine whether AT- and GC-binding drugs could specifically interfere with either EGR1 or TBP or both when they were bound to adjacent sites on the HSVL promoter. Based upon their DNA sequence preference and mode of binding (e.g. minor or major groove and intercalation), nogalamycin, hedamycin, chromomycin A3, and distamycin A were chosen for comparative study of their ability to inhibit single or multiple TF·DNA complex formation. Results presented here confirmed that EGR1 prevented TBP from binding to an adjacent site on the HSVL promoter, and subsequent data showed that TBP, in the presence of TFIIA, could interfere with EGR1·DNA complex formation. Mobility shift assays examined the effect of AT- and GC-binding drugs on the DNA complex formation of individual TFs (i.e. TBP and EGR1) that recognize either AT- or GC-rich DNA binding sites. Certain DNA-binding drugs selectively interfered with one or the other of these TFs that bound to adjacent sites on the HSVL promoter. Chromomycin A3 purchased from Sigma was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Distamycin A from Sigma was made in distilled water. Hedamycin (NCI, National Institutes of Health) was dissolved in 0.1 N HCl and then neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH and further diluted with distilled water. Nogalamycin was generously provided by Upjohn Pharmaceuticals (Kalamazoo, MI) and diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide. All drugs were stored at −20°C. The structures of drugs are shown in Fig. 1. A 30-mer oligonucleotide with a DNA sequence 5′-TCAGCCTTTATAAAAGCGGGGGCGCGGCCG, derived from the HSVL promoter, and its complementary strand were prepared at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were further gel-purified and annealed together as described (16Lee D.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1241-1250Google Scholar). End labeling of double-stranded oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP by means of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was described previously (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar). The preparation of proteins, EGR1, TBP, and TFIIA was described previously (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). Briefly, EGR1, a 13.5-kDa truncated form of the full-length protein, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and purified through a nickel-chelate affinity column. After elution with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, EGR1 was dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 μM ZnSO4, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. A similar procedure was used for TBP preparation, in which bacteria were transformed with plasmid pDS56-hTBP, a gift from T. Kerpolla and T. Curran (Roche Institute of Molecular Biology). Expressed TBP fused to six histidine residues at the NH2 terminus of the protein was purified through a nickel column, dialyzed with 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 or 0.1 M guanidine hydrochloride and then in the same buffer without guanidine hydrochloride. The TFIIA was a gift from M. Schmidt (University of Pittsburgh Medical School). The purity of proteins determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Coomassie Blue staining was greater than 90%. The quantity of proteins was measured by using Bio-Rad protein assay. Gel mobility shift assays were utilized to measure the ability of proteins to bind to DNA that contained the protein consensus binding sites. Based upon previous studies, 3 ng of EGR1 and 5 ng of TBP were used in assays (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). The equilibrium binding of either protein to the HSVL oligonucleotides was performed at 30°C. Formation of the protein-DNA complex was examined at intervals of 1-120 min. The results showed that protein-DNA complex reached equilibrium by 5-10 min after incubation at 30°C and stayed consistent for 30 or 120 min for TBP and EGR1·DNA complexes, respectively. Moreover, for optimizing assay conditions, radioisotope-labeled probe was titrated in the presence of constant amounts of EGR1 or TBP to maximize DNA-protein complex formation. Experimentally, both 3 ng of EGR1 and 5 ng of TBP prepared in the binding buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.8 mM spermidine, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40) were incubated at 30°C for 30 min with labeled probe (DNA containing the consensus binding sites for both TFs at the final concentration of 0.5-1.0 nM). Samples were electrophoresed in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel at room temperature with a running buffer of 45 mM Tris-base, 45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA. Autoradiography was performed by exposing dried gels to Kodak film, and results were quantitated by a computing laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In the competition test, EGR1 and TBP were preincubated with 8 nM unlabeled DNA (HSVL oligonucleotides) at 30°C for 30 min, prior to adding the radiolabeled probe. With TFIIA, a modified assay condition was designed, in which a mixture of 3 ng of TBP and 0.2 μg of TFIIA was first incubated with 1 nM radiolabeled probe. After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, 0.3 ng of EGR1 was added to the reaction for an additional 30 min. Electrophoresis, autoradiography, and quantitation were carried out as described above. For chromomycin A3, hedamycin, and nogalamycin, drug at the indicated dilution was incubated with labeled probe prior to the addition of a mixture of EGR1 and TBP. All samples were analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. Results were quantitated by a densitometer and expressed as the percentage of inhibition of EGR1 and increase of TBP complexes compared with controls that included each individual TF without drug treatment. Alternatively, when TFIIA was used in the assay, constituents in the assay were added in a different order. First, labeled probe was incubated with TBP·TFIIA and followed by treatment with distamycin A and then EGR1. All incubations were at 30°C for 30 min. Similarly, after electrophoresis and autoradiography, the formation of TF·DNA complex was quantitated and expressed as the percentage of inhibition of TBP·TFIIA and restoration of EGR1 complexes compared with the reaction containing all three proteins. Certain drugs have been previously shown to interfere with formation of either EGR1 or TBP·DNA complexes (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate how these drugs specifically interfere with EGR1 or TBP binding to adjacent sites on the HSVL promoter. Prior to examining the ability of drugs to inhibit the binding of TFs to HSVL promoter, characterization of each TF·DNA complex was undertaken. With the simultaneous addition of both EGR1 and TBP, the TBP complex formation was reduced dramatically compared to that with TBP alone (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, the EGR1 complexes were similar in the presence or absence of TBP (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). A ternary complex of EGR1·TBP·DNA (i.e. both proteins simultaneously binding to adjacent sites at HSVL promoter) was not formed, nor did EGR1·DNA and TBP·DNA complexes exist concomitantly under a saturating assay condition. The binding activities of the two TFs in combination were further examined by incubating a serial dilution of EGR1 and a fixed amount of TBP with unlabeled DNA prior to adding labeled probe. If the DNA binding activities of EGR1 were stronger than that of TBP, it might be possible to bind EGR1 to an unlabeled DNA, resulting in free radiolabeled probe for TBP binding. As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence of unlabeled DNA, the radiolabeled EGR1·DNA complex was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner, and the DNA binding of TBP was observed (lanes 4, 6, and 8). In contrast, in reactions without unlabeled DNA, 3 and 1.5 ng of EGR1 complexed to the DNA, whereas no TBP complex was formed (lanes 3 and 5). When less EGR1 (0.75 ng) was used, both individual EGR1·DNA and TBP·DNA complexes were present (lane 7). This result indicated that the stronger DNA binding activity of EGR1 precluded TBP complex formation. If the binding activity of TBP could be strengthened, it might be possible to obtain DNA complexes with both EGR1 and TBP or to inhibit EGR1 binding. It is known that TFIIA, while not binding directly to DNA, enhances TBP association with DNA (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 17Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Google Scholar, 18Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 352-361Google Scholar, 19Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Google Scholar). When TFIIA and TBP were incubated with DNA prior to the addition of EGR1, more TBP·DNA complex was formed (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). Quantitative assessment of the TF·DNA complex revealed that concomitantly with the enhancement of the TBP·DNA complex by TFIIA, the EGR1·DNA complex was reduced by 50% (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the TFIIA-enhanced TBP binding competes with EGR1 for association with DNA. It is assumed that a ternary complex of EGR1·TBP·DNA is not formed, since a third band is not observed (Fig. 4, lane 6). Schemes to depict the interaction of EGR1 and TBP·TFIIA with the HSVL promoter are presented in Fig. 5. Schemes I and II present models of individual TFs, EGR1 and TBP, binding to their consensus GC- and AT-rich binding sites, respectively. Scheme III represents the motif of both DNA-binding proteins on the HSVL promoter and shows that EGR1 binding to its GC-rich sequences prevents TBP binding to its adjacent AT-rich binding site. Scheme IV shows that TBP can compete with EGR1 for DNA binding in the presence of TFIIA. Based upon the patterns of TF binding to the HSVL promoter represented in Fig. 5, schemes III and IV, a study was initiated to examine the specificity of drugs as inhibitors of TF·DNA complex formation. One question, for example, is whether GC-binding drugs might prevent the binding of EGR1 and allow the binding of TBP or, alternatively, inhibit complex formation of both TFs. This model system also provided an opportunity to study whether AT-binding drugs could specifically disrupt the TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex and concomitantly allow EGR1 binding. Previous studies showed that DNA-binding drugs interfered with a single TF binding to DNA. For example, the GC intercalators nogalamycin and hedamycin, as well as a minor groove binder, chromomycin A3, inhibited the DNA binding of EGR1 and TBP to their individual consensus DNA binding sites (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). The following analyses examined how these drugs affected the ability of EGR1 and TBP to bind to the HSVL promoter when both proteins were added simultaneously. Nogalamycin, a GC intercalator that strongly affected the formation of either EGR1 or TBP·DNA complexes, was studied to determine whether it would be an equally effective inhibitor of the binding of TFs to adjacent sites on the HSVL promoter (13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar, 20Williams L.D. Egli M. Gao Q. Bash P. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Frederick C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

DNA was treated with nogalamycin prior to the addition of both proteins. A representative mobility shift assay was shown in Fig. 6. As represented in Fig. 5, scheme III, when both proteins were added to the labeled probe, only the EGR1·DNA complex was observed. Upon the addition of 10 μM drug, the formation of the EGR1·DNA complex was inhibited completely, and the TBP·DNA complex became evident (Fig. 6, lane 5). With lower concentrations of nogalamycin (5 and 2.5 μM), both EGR1·DNA and TBP·DNA complexes were observed (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7). Reducing drug concentrations to 0.5 and 0.05 μM allowed formation of the EGR1·DNA complex with no evidence of the TBP·DNA complex (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 9), which was similar to the pattern found in untreated sample (Fig. 6, lane 4). The drug response curves for both complexes demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of EGR1 accompanied by an appearance of the TBP·DNA complexes (Fig. 7). Approximately 2.6 μM of nogalamycin inhibited the formation of EGR1·DNA complex by 50%, and 10 μM of drug reduced the complex about 90%, while within the same dose range, a 3-6-fold increase in the complex formation of TBP was observed. Like nogalamycin, hedamycin is a GC intercalator, but it also alkylates DNA at deoxyguanosine residues (22Sun D. Hansen M. Clement J.J. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8068-8074Google Scholar, 23Jernigan Jr., H.M. Irvie J.L. White J.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4232-4239Google Scholar, 24Bennett G.N. Nucleic Acid Res. 1982; 10: 4581-4594Google Scholar). Previous results have shown it to be a strong inhibitor of both EGR1 and TBP complex formation (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). The pattern of hedamycin inhibition of EGR1 and TBP binding to the HSVL promoter was tested. As shown in Fig. 8, a hedamycin concentration of 0.58 μM was sufficient to inhibit EGR1·DNA complex formation by 50% and increased the TBP·DNA complex by 2-fold. Doses of 1 μM prevented the EGR1·DNA complex by 60%, but rather than allowing further TBP binding to DNA they also blocked TBP complex formation. At higher drug concentrations, EGR1·DNA complex formation was reduced by more than 90%, and the TBP·DNA complex formation also was undetectable. Chromomycin A3 is a GC minor groove binder that was found to be effective at preventing EGR1 and Wilms' tumor supressor protein-1 binding to the GC-rich sites and preventing the negative regulator of interleukin-2, NIL2A, from binding to its mixed sequence site (13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar, 25van Dyke M.W. Dervan P.B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2373-2377Google Scholar, 26Liu C. Chen F.-M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1419-1424Google Scholar). Chromomycin A3 is also an inhibitor of TBP·DNA complex formation. We found that chromomycin A3, like nogalamycin, inhibited the complex formation of EGR1, resulting in a dose-dependent increase of TBP·DNA complex formation (Fig. 9). For example, a 50% reduction of the EGR1·DNA complex with 3.1 μM chromomycin A3 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the TBP complex formation. Using 14 μM drug, the EGR1·DNA complex was inhibited by 85%, and the TBP·DNA complex formation was increased to 4-fold. The data to this point have demonstrated how GC-binding drugs with different interactive mechanisms disrupted the EGR1·DNA complex and resulted in various degrees of increase of TBP binding. An alternative situation where an AT-binding drug targeting the TBP binding site might enhance EGR1 binding also was addressed. Previous findings demonstrated that distamycin A inhibited preformed TBP and TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex formation with the adenovirus-2 major late promoter (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar). In addition, Welch et al. (13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar) showed that distamycin A had no effect on DNA complex formation for EGR1 added alone. The next series of experiments examined whether distamycin A could inhibit TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex formation and allow EGR1 binding to the HSVL promoter. We first determined the effectiveness of distamycin A at disrupting preformed TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex. Interference with complex formation by distamycin A occurred in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.25 μM distamycin A, complex formation was inhibited by 50%, whereas 1 and 2.5 μM of distamycin A disrupted 83 and 92% of the complex, respectively (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 4, TBP and TFIIA bound to the DNA, resulting in a reduction of EGR1·DNA complex by 50%. In subsequent assays, preformed TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex was treated with distamycin A, and then EGR1 was added. Under conditions where distamycin A disrupted the TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex, the EGR1·DNA complex formation was increased. For example, 0.25 μM distamycin A, which inhibited TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex to 50% of control, increased the EGR1 complex formation from 50 to 67% of control. A 92% inhibition of TBP·DNA complex formation by distamycin resulted in an increase to 80% of the EGR1·DNA complex (Fig. 10). In the present study, we have used the HSVL promoter as a model system to evaluate whether DNA-binding drugs can selectively interfere with the binding of TFs. First, we confirmed that under conditions where EGR1 and TBP could bind to the HSVL promoter only the EGR1·DNA complex was observed. Preincubation of EGR1 and TBP with unlabeled DNA resulted in a reduced amount of radiolabeled EGR1·DNA complex with a concomitant increase in radiolabeled TBP·DNA complex formation. These data were in agreement with the report of Tatarowicz et al.2 and showed that complex formation by one protein excluded the other. We found no ternary complex of EGR1·TBP·DNA when both proteins were added simultaneously to the DNA, suggesting that EGR1's presence sterically prevented TBP from binding to its cognate site. The reverse was not true, that the addition of EGR1 resulted in dissociation of preformed TBP·DNA complex (data not shown). Thus, EGR1 bound the HSVL promoter with higher affinity than TBP. A further confirmation that the prevalence of the EGR1·DNA complex was due to the higher binding affinity of EGR1 compared with TBP came from studies in which TFIIA was included. Our previous results and the results of others have shown that TFIIA stabilizes TBP binding to DNA (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 17Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Google Scholar, 18Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 352-361Google Scholar, 19Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Google Scholar). In the presence of TFIIA, TBP competed with EGR1 for DNA binding, resulting in reduced EGR1·DNA complex formation (Fig. 4). Schemes for describing the binding relationships of EGR1, TBP, and TFIIA on the HSVL promoter are provided in Fig. 5. The present work differs from previous studies in which drugs were evaluated as inhibitors of single TFs binding to their consensus binding sites (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar, 13Welch J.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31051-31058Google Scholar). Having confirmed binding patterns of EGR1 and TBP in the HSVL promoter (Fig. 5), we further examined the effect of drugs on both proteins binding to adjacent sites. We found that the GC intercalator nogalamycin selectively inhibited the EGR1·DNA complex formation (Fig. 6). The finding of Williams et al. (20Williams L.D. Egli M. Gao Q. Bash P. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Frederick C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2225-2229Google Scholar) that nogalamycin unwound the DNA by 11° at the site of intercalation suggested that the drug could induce localized unwinding on the HSVL promoter. The lack of drug effect on the DNA conformation of flanking sequences (e.g. AT-rich region) might account for the fact that a dose-dependent inhibition of the EGR1·DNA complex by nogalamycin resulted in a concomitant appearance of TBP·DNA complex. Hedamycin affected EGR1 and TBP complex formation differently from nogalamycin. Although both drugs preferentially bound to GC-rich sites through a mechanism of threading intercalation, hedamycin was more effective than nogalamycin at inhibiting formation of the EGR1·DNA complex. It has been demonstrated that hedamycin alkylates the N-7 of guanine within the major groove to form an irreversible drug-DNA complex (23Jernigan Jr., H.M. Irvie J.L. White J.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4232-4239Google Scholar, 24Bennett G.N. Nucleic Acid Res. 1982; 10: 4581-4594Google Scholar, 27Hansen M. Hurley L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2421-2429Google Scholar, 28Prakash A.S. Moore A.G. Murray V. Matias C. McFadyen W.D. Wickham G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1995; 95: 17-28Google Scholar, 29Wickham G. Iannitti P. Boschenok J. Sheil M.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 231-234Google Scholar), and this irreversible drug-DNA complex might account for stronger inhibition of TFs binding by hedamycin compared with nogalamycin. Similarly, CC-1065, an AT minor groove binder that formed an irreversible complex by bonding to the N-3 of adenine, was shown earlier to be almost 200-fold more potent compared with other reversible minor groove-binding drugs at inhibiting TBP binding to the adenovirus-2 major late promoter (12Chiang S.-Y. Welch J. Rauscher III, F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Google Scholar). Hedamycin resulted in a 2-fold increase of the TBP·DNA complex at drug concentrations that inhibited the EGR1·DNA complex by <50%. At higher concentrations (2-10 μM), TBP·DNA complexes were suppressed completely. In contrast, further suppression of the EGR1·DNA complex by increasing concentrations of nogalamycin resulted in a 3-6-fold increase in the TBP·DNA complex (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). One explanation for the difference between these drugs with regard to TBP·DNA complex formation on the HSVL promoter was that hedamycin binding to GC-rich sequence might alter DNA conformation within the adjacent AT site such that TBP could not recognize its consensus binding site. Another possibility for the interference of hedamycin in TBP binding to DNA was suggested in the report of Daekyu and Hurley (30Sun D. Hurley L.H. Chem. & Biol. 1995; 2: 457-469Google Scholar), which showed that hedamycin interacted with guanine adjacent to the 3′-end of TBP binding sequence (5′-TATAAAA) and prevented TBP from interacting with the ApG site. Although chromomycin A3 and nogalamycin interact with DNA via different mechanisms (minor groove-binding and intercalating interaction), they yield similar patterns of inhibition of EGR1 and TBP·DNA complex formation. That the increase of TBP·DNA complex formation with chromomycin A3 was smaller than with nogalamycin (i.e. 4-fold versus 6-fold at the highest drug concentrations) implied that the former drug influenced the binding of TBP because of modification of the DNA structure. This observation was consistent with evidence from Fox and Howarth (31Fox K.R. Howarth N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8695-8714Google Scholar) indicating that the binding of chromomycin A3 altered DNA conformation at sites flanking its binding site. Although both chromomycin A3 and hedamycin caused DNA conformational changes, their effects on inhibition and increase of complex formation were quite different (32Gao X.L. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10940-10956Google Scholar, 33Gao X.L. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 751-762Google Scholar). For example, at a concentration of 2 μM, hedamycin almost completely inhibited EGR1·DNA complex formation, whereas chromomycin A3 blocked complex formation less than 50%. At this concentration, hedamycin also prevented TBP binding, whereas the TBP·DNA complex was observable after treatment with chromomycin A3. Bending of the DNA caused by hedamycin through a mechanism of threading intercalation and alkylation may contribute effectiveness as an inhibitor of formation of both TF·DNA complexes (data not shown). By comparison, chromomycin A3 and distamycin A bind to DNA minor groove but with different sequence preferences at GC and AT sites, respectively (34Waring M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 159-192Google Scholar, 35Kopka M.L. Yoon C. Goodsell D. Pjura P. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1376-1380Google Scholar, 36Portugal J. Waring M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 167: 281-289Google Scholar). We found that a preformed TBP·TFIIA·DNA complex was disrupted by distamycin A in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by parallel formation of the EGR1·DNA complex. In contrast, chromomycin A3 inhibited the formation of EGR1·DNA complex to allow TBP·DNA complex formation. These data demonstrated the importance of sequence preferences concerning the specificity of drugs as inhibitors of TF·DNA complexes. Moreover, our results indicated that drugs affected TFs binding to their individual binding sites differently from that to adjacent sites, suggesting that the modes of drug interaction with DNA played a role in determining the activity and specificity of drugs. This work can be viewed as a model to study sequence-specific DNA-binding drugs for their ability to selectively effect binding of TFs. Additionally, the results provide a guide for development of future drugs as potent and specific inhibitors of TF·DNA complexes. We thank Dr. Nigel W. Fraser for providing the HSVL promoter sequence. We also greatly appreciate the assistance of Drs. Raymond Baker, Debora Kramer, and Mary McHugh in manuscript preparation."

It is possible that the I chain encodes additional localization signals elsewhere within the molecule. The four different forms of the human I chain (p33, p35, p41, and p43) may regulate the localization of class II molecules in distinct endocytic compartments (26O'Sullivan D.M. Noonan D. Quaranta V.

Once αβ·I complexes reach late endocytic compartments, the I chain is degraded through a series of proteolytic steps in which cathepsins B and D have been implicated (29Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc.

After removal of the I chain, αβ dimers are capable of binding processed peptides and of being transported to the cell surface. A nested set of I chain peptides, from amino acid residues 81 to 104 in the human system, can be found associated with both human and mouse class II molecules (33Riberdy J.M. Newcomb J.R. Surman M.J.

This is the CLIP region of the I chain, which seems to be important for initial assembly of αβ·I complexes (37Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We initiated these experiments to determine how the I chain interacts with αβ dimers and what regions are important in forming the nonameric αβ·I structure. We have previously demonstrated that αβ·I complexes remain nonameric until and even during endosomal proteolytic degradation of the I chain (42Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4153-4163Google Scholar). To further characterize sites within the I chain that are important for contact with the class II αβ dimer, we have analyzed additional I chain fragments formed in vivo and in vitro. The results suggest that at least two sites along the length of the I chain molecule contact αβ dimers and that fragments containing either of them can maintain the nonameric complex. The human B-lymphoblastoid cell line Pala (HLA-DR3) was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For generation of αβ·I complexes, Pala cells (5 × 106) were radiolabeled with 0.25 mCi of [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) in 1 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h at 37°C in the presence of 10 μM monensin (Boehringer Mannheim). In some experiments, cells were labeled in the presence of 1 mM leupeptin (Sigma). For generation of αβ·p12 complexes, Pala cells were first starved in methionine-free medium, pulse-labeled as described above for 30 min in methionine-free medium, and then chased in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine for 3 h. The hybridoma cell line L243 (anti-DR mAb) (43Lampson L.A. Levy R. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 293-299Google Scholar) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). DA6.147 (anti-DR α chain mAb) (44Guy K. Van Heyningen V. Cohen B.B. Dean D.L. Steel C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1982; 12: 942-948Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. V. van Heyningen (Medical Research Council Clinical and Population Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland). BU45 (anti-invariant chain C-terminal mAb) was obtained from Binding Site, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The anti-peptide mAb PIN.1.1 was developed in this laboratory by immunization with a peptide representing amino acids 12-28 of the I chain. The rabbit antiserum R.I.EQLP was generated against the same peptide. Rabbit anti-invariant chain serum to the CLIP region (amino acids 81-104) was developed by immunization with this peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. It was affinity-purified using the immunizing peptide coupled to ω-aminobutyl-agarose (Sigma). For immunoaffinity columns, purified Ig from mAb-containing ascites was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Bio-Gel A-15m resin (Bio-Rad) (45Porath J. Aspergerg K. Drevin H. Axen R. J. Chromatogr. 1973; 86: 53-58Google Scholar) at 2-3 mg/ml of resin. Pala cells labeled as described above in monensin to generate a large pool of αβ·I complexes were lysed in TS buffer (0.01 M Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl) containing 2% C12E9 (polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether, Sigma) with protease inhibitors (0.2 mM Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM iodoacetamide). The clarified lysate was then passed over tandem immunoaffinity columns of normal mouse immunoglobulin, L243, and DA6.147, respectively. αβ·I complexes were eluted at high pH from the DA6.147 column as described (6Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol... 1993; 150: 499-507Google Scholar) and then neutralized. Purified αβ·I was digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) for 90 min at 0°C to generate αβ·K3. For [35S]Met radioactive sequencing, αβ·K3 complexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The band corresponding to the 18-kDa K3 fragment was visualized by autoradiography, cut out, and subjected to in situ N-terminal Edman degradation. Edman degradation was performed at the Keck Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility of the Yale University School of Medicine. Each cycle product was eluted with n-butyl chloride, dried onto a membrane, resuspended with 15% acetonitrile, and analyzed for [35S]Met by scintillation counting. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were lysed at 5 × 106/ml in TS buffer containing 2% C12E9 and protease inhibitors for 45 min at 4°C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Lysates were then incubated with mAb-containing ascites (3 μl) or rabbit antiserum (10 μl) for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala) and rotation at 4°C for 1 h. Sepharose beads were washed twice in TS buffer containing 0.1% C12E9 and once in H2O prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. For HPSEC separation, [35S]methionine-labeled cells (5 × 106; treated as indicated) were lysed in 125 μl of TS buffer containing 2% C12E9 as described above, and the clarified lysates were equilibrated in either 1% n-octyl glucoside or 0.6% CHAPS as indicated. Cell lysates were then injected over tandem KW-804 columns (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing either 1% n-octyl glucoside or 0.6% CHAPS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected at the times and volumes indicated and then immunoprecipitated as described above. In some experiments, fractions were chemically cross-linked before immunoprecipitation by the addition of 4.5 μl of 1 M Bicine/NaOH, pH 12.9, to bring the pH to 8.2 and then by the addition of 0.2 mg/ml 3,3′-dithiobis(propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (DTSP) (Sigma) for 30 min at 4°C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 20 mM. The I chain or fragments were analyzed for the presence of O-linked glycans by immunoprecipitation with the PIN.1.1 monoclonal antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins, bound to protein G-Sepharose, were then washed in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 9 mM CaCl2. Proteins were treated with 25 milliunits of neuraminidase (Calbiochem) for 3 h at 37°C. Desialylated proteins were then washed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% C12E9. These proteins were treated with 2 milliunits of O-glycanase (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight at 37°C. Deglycosylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as indicated. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-PAGE (12 or 13% acrylamide) as indicated. Radioactivity was visualized by fluorography using Enlightning (DuPont NEN) and Eastman Kodak X-Omat AR film. In some experiments, radioactive protein bands were quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and expressed in arbitrary PhosphorImager units. Previous studies (46Marks M.S. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 136: 2519-2525Google Scholar) demonstrated that limited digestion of purified αβ·I complexes with proteinase K yielded a distinct luminal I chain fragment of ∼18 kDa referred to as K3 (Fig. 1). The K3 fragment of the I chain remained associated with MHC class II αβ dimers. This fragment contains the N-linked glycans at positions 114 and 120, but not O-linked glycan. The data showed that a short segment of the C terminus was also removed (46Marks M.S. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 136: 2519-2525Google Scholar). These results suggested that the N terminus of the K3 fragment was near or within the CLIP region (amino acids 81-104) of the I chain. To precisely define the N terminus of K3, metabolically labeled αβ·I complexes were purified from the HLA-DR3 homozygous B-lymphoblastoid cell line Pala and digested with proteinase K (Fig. 2). At 10 μg/ml proteinase K, digestion yields a single I chain fragment of ∼18 kDa that remains associated with αβ dimers. The α and β chains are unaffected by proteinase K at this concentration. N-terminal sequencing of the K3 fragment, after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, gave the results shown in Fig. 3. [35S]Methionine peaks were detected at cycles 3, 12, and 18 that aligned with only one region in the I chain sequence and mapped the N terminus of the K3 fragment to the glycine residue at position 110. From the known N terminus of K3 and from the fact that it has lost a C-terminal segment of the I chain, at least 8 of the 14 methionine residues present in the intact I chain are absent from K3. This accounts for the reduced intensity of K3 compared with the I chain in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Generation of αβ·K3 complexes. αβ·I complexes were purified from metabolically labeled Pala cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Purified αβ·I was treated with (+) or without (−) proteinase K (10 μg/ml) for 90 min at 0°C. After immunoprecipitation with purified BU45 ascites and protein G-Sepharose, the material was dissolved in reducing sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated in kilodaltons to the right of the gel. The positions of class II α and β chains, the I chain, and the K3 fragment are indicated to the left of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Identification of the K3 N terminus by [35S]Met sequencing. Metabolically labeled αβ·K3 complexes were generated and separated by SDS-PAGE as described for Fig. 2. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the K3 band was visualized by autoradiography and cut out of the membrane. Sequencing was carried out by in situ N-terminal Edman degradation for 20 cycles, and the product of each cycle was analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter for 35S cpm. The N terminus was determined to be at position 110 by aligning the radioactive peaks with Met residues in the I chain sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Purified αβ·I exists as a nonameric complex (14Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Google Scholar). To determine whether αβ·K3 complexes retain the nonameric structure, purified αβ·I was digested with proteinase K and injected over a HPSEC column in the detergent CHAPS. Fractions were then immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody BU45, specific for a luminal epitope within the I chain. The results shown in Fig. 4 show that αβ·K3 complexes elute in a broad peak at ∼17.5-ml elution volume (Ve). This Ve is only slightly greater than that determined for αβ·I complexes in CHAPS (17.25 ml) and suggests that the K3 fragment of the I chain can retain the nonameric association with αβ dimers. The peak at 19.75 ml represents free K3 fragment, no longer associated with αβ dimers. To further demonstrate that the material eluting at 17.5 ml represents a nonameric complex of three αβ dimers and three K3 fragments, proteinase K-digested material was separated by HPSEC and treated with the chemical cross-linker DTSP prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5). Following cross-linking, the material eluting at 17.5 ml has an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa by SDS-PAGE. This is consistent with αβ·K3 existing as a nonameric complex. It should be noted that αβ·K3 cross-links extremely efficiently, as does αβ·I (14Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Google Scholar). K3 trimers, however, cross-link poorly compared with I chain trimers (47Marks M.S. Blum J.S. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 839-855Google Scholar). Thus, the regions of the I chain lost from K3 are important for efficient cross-linking to itself, but not to α and β chains.Fig. 5Cross-linking of HPSEC-purified αβ·K3 complexes. αβ·K3 complexes were fractionated by HPSEC as described for Fig. 4. Each fraction was chemically cross-linked with DTSP prior to immunoprecipitation with BU45. The position of cross-linked αβ·K3 is indicated to the left of the gel. The molecular mass standards are indicated in kilodaltons to the right of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Evidence suggests that once αβ·I complexes reach the appropriate endosomal/lysosomal compartment, the I chain is proteolytically digested in a stepwise fashion (29Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Google Scholar, 48Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Google Scholar). Human B-lymphoblastoid cells grown in the presence of the sulfhydryl protease inhibitor leupeptin accumulate a partial proteolytic fragment of the I chain called LIP (29Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Google Scholar). This fragment is ∼21 kDa and includes the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the I chain as well as a portion of the luminal region including the N-linked glycans at positions 114 and 120 (29Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Google Scholar, 30Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO. J. 1992; 11: 411-416Google Scholar, 31Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3150-3154Google Scholar, 32Reyes V.E. Lu S. Humphreys R.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3877-3880Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis of untreated melanoma cells suggests that the class II-associated LIP fragment is subsequently cleaved by a leupeptin-sensitive protease to a 12-kDa fragment called p12 (49Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Google Scholar). To confirm this result in the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line, the HLA-DR3 homozygous Pala cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and then chased for 3 h. Immunoprecipitation of detergent-solubilized cell lysate (Fig. 6) demonstrates that anti-I chain antibodies (PIN.1.1 and R.I.EQLP) precipitate αβ dimers in association with the intact I chain. In addition, these antibodies both recognize two smaller fragments of the I chain of ∼12 and 10 kDa. Immunoprecipitation with the anti-DR monoclonal antibody L243, which recognizes a combinatorial epitope of the α and β chains, demonstrates that only the 12-kDa (p12) fragment of the I chain is associated with MHC class II αβ dimers. L243 does not recognize αβ dimers in association with the intact I chain. HPSEC was performed to determine whether αβ·p12 complexes, like αβ·LIP and αβ·K3, remain associated with αβ dimers in a nonameric complex. Pala cells were pulsed and chased to enrich for αβ·p12 as described, and then detergent lysates were injected over HPSEC columns in CHAPS. Fractions were collected and immunoprecipitated with L243. The results in Fig. 7 show a large peak eluting at 18.75 ml that contains α and β chains and represents mature αβ dimers. In addition, L243 immunoprecipitated a smaller peak of αβ dimers associated with the p12 I chain fragment, which eluted at 17.5 ml. This Ve is only slightly larger than that reported for αβ·I in CHAPS, suggesting that the p12 fragment retains higher order nonameric complexes with αβ dimers. To examine this further, the same experiment was performed using the detergent n-octyl glucoside for HPSEC. In octyl glucoside, αβ·LIP complexes have been shown to dissociate from nonamers into trimeric complexes containing one α, one β, and one LIP molecule (42Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4153-4163Google Scholar). HPSEC of αβ·p12 complexes in octyl glucoside (Fig. 8) showed that these complexes also dissociate from higher order nonamers (Ve = 18 ml) into complexes eluting at 19.5 ml, which probably represent αβ·p12 trimers.Fig. 8HPSEC of αβ·p12 in octyl glucoside. Pala cells were labeled and lysed as described for Fig. 6, and then the lysate was equilibrated in 1% octyl glucoside. The lysate was injected over HPSEC columns equilibrated in 1% octyl glucoside and fractionated by Ve (indicated across the top of the gel). Each fraction was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-DR αβ chain mAb L243. The immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Shown beneath the gel are traces of α chain, β chain, and p12 signals in each lane of the gel generated by PhosphorImager analysis and reported in arbitrary units. The positions of the α chain, β chain, and p12 fragment are indicated to the left of the gel. The positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated in kilodaltons to the right of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous data (46Marks M.S. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 136: 2519-2525Google Scholar) showed that the K3 fragment does not contain the O-linked glycan characteristic of the I chain. To assess whether the p12 fragment contains O-linked glycans, detergent lysates of Pala cells, labeled to enrich for αβ·p12 complexes, were immunoprecipitated with PIN.1.1, and the precipitated material was treated with neuraminidase and then with O-glycanase to remove O-linked glycans. The results in Fig. 9A demonstrate that although the intact I chain drops slightly in molecular mass after O-glycanase treatment, the p12 fragment does not. The two left lanes are a longer exposure of the two right lanes in order to visualize the p12 fragment. The two right lanes are a shorter exposure to visualize the drop in molecular mass of the intact I chain. These data indicate that the p12 fragment does not contain O-linked glycan. The LIP fragment of the I chain was analyzed in the same fashion as p12. The C terminus of the LIP fragment is C-terminal to the N-linked glycosylation site at position 120 (see Fig. 1). Pala cells labeled in the presence of leupeptin were lysed and immunoprecipitated with PIN.1.1. Immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with neuraminidase followed by O-glycanase. The results in Fig. 9B show a slight drop in molecular mass of the LIP fragment after removal of sialic acid, but no further reduction after treatment with O-glycanase. The reduction in molecular mass after neuraminidase treatment is attributable to removal of sialic acid residues from the N-linked glycans present on the LIP fragment at positions 114 and 120. As a control, CD45 was immunoprecipitated from the same cell lysate and treated with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase. This heavily O-glycosylated protein showed a large drop in molecular mass after treatment (data not shown). These data demonstrate that, at least in human B cells, little or no I chain is modified by O-glycosylation in proximity to the plasma membrane. Combined with the earlier data, this argues that the O-linked glycan(s) of the I chain are close to the C terminus, within the region cleaved from the K3 fragment. The data presented here demonstrate that at least two sites along the length of the I chain interact with the MHC class II αβ dimer. Analysis of natural and in vitro generated fragments of the I chain also reveals that these fragments remain associated with class II molecules in higher order multimers analogous to nonameric αβ·I complexes. In vitro digestion of purified αβ·I with proteinase K yields an 18-kDa I chain fragment (K3) containing most of the C-terminal luminal portion of the I chain (46Marks M.S. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 136: 2519-2525Google Scholar). The N terminus of this fragment was mapped to amino acid 110. Size exclusion (Fig. 4) and cross-linking (Fig. 5) analyses suggest that the K3 fragment remains associated with DR molecules in a nonameric complex. With its N terminus at position 110, the K3 fragment does not include the CLIP region of the I chain extending from positions 81 to 104. Nested sets of I chain peptides from this region have been isolated from mature class II molecules in mouse and human cells (33Riberdy J.M. Newcomb J.R. Surman M.J. Barbosa J.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1992; 360: 474-477Google Scholar, 34Sette A. Ceman S. Kubo R.T. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Hunt D.F. Davis T.A. Michel H. Shabanowitz J. Rudersdord R. Grey H.M. DeMars R.

Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Vignali D.A.A. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Google Scholar). Evidence suggesting that CLIP is bound in the class II peptide-binding groove (11Avva R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 763-774Google Scholar, 12Bangia N. Watts T.H. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1585-1591Google Scholar) has been confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analysis (13Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 457-462Google Scholar), and the CLIP region has recently been shown by deletion analysis to be critical for initial assembly of αβ and I chains (37Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9703-9706Google Scholar, 38Bijlmakers M.J.E. Benaroch P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 623-629Google Scholar). However, it is clear from the data presented here that once the αβ·I complex is formed, a site distal to the CLIP region can maintain the interaction with class II molecules. It should be noted that αβ·K3 complexes are isolated from monensin-treated cells and therefore have immature N-linked glycans. It is conceivable that this may contribute to the stability of the nonameric αβ·K3 complex. A second site of I chain interaction with class II molecules is present in the p12 fragment. This is a 12-kDa fragment that is transiently generated within a class II-expressing cell during proteolytic degradation of the I chain (49Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Google Scholar). It includes the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and, based on its apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE, the transmembrane region. The precise C terminus of p12 is not known, but its apparent size on SDS-PAGE leads to a predicted C terminus around amino acids 100-110, consistent with its lack of N-linked glycans. If this prediction is correct, then the p12 fragment should include at least a part of the CLIP region (amino acids 81-104) of the I chain. It is possible, however, that because this fragment is relatively small and includes the transmembrane segment, it might bind an aberrant number of SDS molecules, disrupting the charge/mass ratio. An anti-CLIP antiserum failed to react detectably with p12 (data not shown), but the same serum reacted only weakly with the intact I chain, and the presence or absence of all or part of the CLIP sequence in p12 remains unknown. If the CLIP region is associated with the peptide-binding groove of class II molecules, it is likely to be protected from proteolysis. It is therefore tempting to speculate that p12 contains CLIP, while p10, which fails to bind class II molecules (Fig. 6), does not. This report, in combination with data on the LIP fragment of the I chain (42Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4153-4163Google Scholar), has detailed the analysis of fragments that cover nearly the entire length of the I chain. p12 represents a small N-terminal fragment. LIP is also an N-terminal fragment, but includes a portion of the luminal domain including the CLIP region. Finally, K3 is a C-terminal fragment that overlaps LIP, but does not include the CLIP region. None of these fragments contain the O-linked glycan(s) characteristic of the intact I chain. Based on the proposed N and C termini of all the fragments (Fig. 1), it seems likely that the O-linked glycan is close to the C terminus of the intact I chain, a portion of which is lacking in K3 (46Marks M.S. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1985; 136: 2519-2525Google Scholar). All three of the I chain fragments remain associated with MHC class II molecules in a nonameric structure similar to that reported for αβ·I complexes (14Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Google Scholar). Recombinant I chain constructs that include the C-terminal region have previously been shown to be trimeric (50Park S.-J. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11289-11293Google Scholar). The data presented here and elsewhere (19Amigorena S. Drake J.R. Webster P. Mellman I. Nature. 1994; 369: 113-120Google Scholar) argue that the N-terminal regions of the I chain also interact to form a trimeric structure. This interaction appears to be variably stable in solution depending upon the detergent used. Thus, both αβ·LIP and αβ·p12 retain a nonameric structure in CHAPS, but appear to dissociate into simple trimers in n-octyl glucoside (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8) (6Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol... 1993; 150: 499-507Google Scholar). This suggests a possible interaction of the I chain transmembrane regions. The requirement for C-terminal interactions to maintain a stable I chain trimer in conventional detergents may explain the observations of a number of groups that C-terminally truncated I chain constructs fail to trimerize, as detected by chemical cross-linking, when expressed in vivo (38Bijlmakers M.J.E. Benaroch P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 623-629Google Scholar, 51Bertolino P. Staschewski M. Trescol-Biémont M.-C. Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Chrétien I. Forquet F. Gerlier D. Rabourdin-Combe C. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5620-5629Google Scholar). Alternatively, the C-terminal region may be a primary site for efficient cross-linking. Data from Wiley and co-workers (50Park S.-J. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11289-11293Google Scholar, 52Jasanoff A. Park S.-J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9900-9904Google Scholar) indicate, based on NMR analysis, that the region of the I chain between the membrane and position 118 is extended and that this region is highly susceptible to proteolysis. Thus, a picture is emerging where the I chain interacts at both the N and C termini to generate a trimeric structure, and a class II αβ dimer interacts with each component of the trimer at the CLIP region via the peptide-binding groove and in an unknown fashion with the C-terminal region (53Cresswell P. Cell. 1996; 84: 505-507Google Scholar). Whether additional interactions between the class II molecules and the I chain exist, perhaps via the transmembrane region or the cytoplasmic domains, remains unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2030544876,"Dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (C1INH)-Ta is a naturally occurring mutant from a patient with type II hereditary angioedema. This mutant has a deletion of the codon for Lys-251, which is located in the connecting strand between helix F and strand 3A, overlying β sheet A. Deletion of this Lys modifies the amino acid sequence at this position from Asn-Lys-Ile-Ser to Asn-Ile-Ser and creates a new glycosylation site. To further characterize the mechanism of dysfunction, we have analyzed the recombinant normal and Ta proteins expressed by COS cells in addition to the proteins in serum and isolated from serum. Recombinant C1INH-Ta revealed an intermediate thermal stability in comparison with the intact and reactive center cleaved normal proteins. Analysis of the reactivity of this recombinant protein with target proteases demonstrated no complex formation with C1s, C1r, or kallikrein. Inefficient complex formation was, however, clearly detectable with β-factor XIIa. Each protease produced partial cleavage of the recombinant mutant inhibitor. Recombinant C1INH-Ta, on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by size fractionation on Superose 12, showed a higher molecular weight fraction that was compatible in size with dimer formation. However, no multimerization of C1INH-Ta isolated from serum or of C1INH-Ta in serum, was observed. The C1INH-Ta dimer expressed the epitopes that normally are expressed only on the protease complexed or the cleaved inhibitor. These epitopes were not expressed on the monomeric inhibitor. The data suggest that the mutation in C1INH-Ta results in a folding abnormality that behaves as if it consists of two populations of molecules, one of which is susceptible to multimerization and one of which is converted to a substrate, but which retains residual inhibitory activity. Dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (C1INH)-Ta is a naturally occurring mutant from a patient with type II hereditary angioedema. This mutant has a deletion of the codon for Lys-251, which is located in the connecting strand between helix F and strand 3A, overlying β sheet A. Deletion of this Lys modifies the amino acid sequence at this position from Asn-Lys-Ile-Ser to Asn-Ile-Ser and creates a new glycosylation site. To further characterize the mechanism of dysfunction, we have analyzed the recombinant normal and Ta proteins expressed by COS cells in addition to the proteins in serum and isolated from serum. Recombinant C1INH-Ta revealed an intermediate thermal stability in comparison with the intact and reactive center cleaved normal proteins. Analysis of the reactivity of this recombinant protein with target proteases demonstrated no complex formation with C1s, C1r, or kallikrein. Inefficient complex formation was, however, clearly detectable with β-factor XIIa. Each protease produced partial cleavage of the recombinant mutant inhibitor. Recombinant C1INH-Ta, on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by size fractionation on Superose 12, showed a higher molecular weight fraction that was compatible in size with dimer formation. However, no multimerization of C1INH-Ta isolated from serum or of C1INH-Ta in serum, was observed. The C1INH-Ta dimer expressed the epitopes that normally are expressed only on the protease complexed or the cleaved inhibitor. These epitopes were not expressed on the monomeric inhibitor. The data suggest that the mutation in C1INH-Ta results in a folding abnormality that behaves as if it consists of two populations of molecules, one of which is susceptible to multimerization and one of which is converted to a substrate, but which retains residual inhibitory activity. C1 inhibitor (C1INH) 1The abbreviations used are: C1INHC1 inhibitorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. belongs to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors or serpins. It is the sole inhibitor of the complement proteases C1s and C1r and is the major inhibitor of plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XIIa (1Schapira M. de Agostini A. Schifferti J.A. Colman R.W. Curr. Issues Complement. 1985; 2: 111-126Google Scholar, 2Davis III, A.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 595-628Google Scholar). Deficiency of C1INH or inheritance of a dysfunctional mutant molecule results in hereditary angioedema. Inhibition by serpins involves a region of the molecule termed the reactive center loop. Amino acids within this region mimic the substrate of the protease. However, following recognition of the reactive center residue, rather than cleavage, a stable, equimolar inhibitor-protease complex results. Amino acid substitutions within this region either cause loss of inhibitory activity or alter target protease specificity. Approximately 70% of dysfunctional C1INH proteins result from reactive center P1 (Arg-444) mutations (3Aulak K.S. Pemberton P.A. Rosen F.S. Carrell R.W. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 615-618Google Scholar, 4Aulak K.S. Lachmann P.J. Rosen F.S. Harrison R.A. Complement Inflammation. 1989; 6: 310Google Scholar). The role of this region in specificity determination is well known. Several non-reactive center mutations have been described. As expected from analyses of other mutant serpins, replacement of the P2 residue modifies target protease specificity (5Schapira M. Ramus M.A. Jallat S. Carvallo D. Courtney M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 635-637Google Scholar, 6Zahedi R. Bissler J.J. Davis III, A.E. Andreadis C. Wisneski J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 95: 1299-1305Google Scholar, 7York J.D. Li P. Cardell S.J. J. Biol.

Dysfunctional C1INH-Ta, a naturally occurring mutant from a patient with hereditary angioedema, does not inhibit C1s and C1r (14Parad R.B. Kramer J. Strunk R.C. Rosen F.S. Davis III, A.E. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 88: 6786-6790Google Scholar). It has deletion of Lys-251, which is widely separated, in linear sequence, from the reactive center loop. This residue is located in the connecting strand between helix F and strand 3A, and overlies β sheet A. Deletion of Lys-251 modifies the amino acid sequence at this position from Asn-Asn-Lys-Ile-Ser to Asn-Asn-Ile-Ser, which creates a new glycosylation site. The additional carbohydrate together with the deletion resulted in a slightly higher molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE and an altered electrophoretic mobility on agarose gel electrophoresis in comparison with the normal inhibitor. Enzymatic deglycosylation reduced the normal and Ta mutant inhibitors to the same size but did not restore activity of the mutant Ta inhibitor. C1 inhibitor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In order to further characterize the potential role of the additional carbohydrate and to analyze the mechanism of dysfunction, we transfected COS-1 cells with expression vectors containing the cDNA for C1INH-Ta and the wild type C1INH and expressed the recombinant proteins in the presence or absence of tunicamycin. We also expressed a new mutant in which Lys-251 was replaced with a Thr; this results in glycosylation at Asn-249. Functional and structural analysis of the recombinant inhibitors indicate that the dysfunction of C1INH-Ta results from the deletion of Lys-251 and not from the additional carbohydrate. Furthermore, the data suggest that this mutant inhibitor behaves as if it consists of two conformers, one of which is converted primarily to a substrate, and one of which is susceptible to multimerization. A polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously was performed (6Zahedi R. Bissler J.J. Davis III, A.E. Andreadis C. Wisneski J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 95: 1299-1305Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primer used has the following sequence, K251T (GAA CAC CAA CAA CAC GAT CAG CC GG CTG CTAGA), which corresponds to nucleotides 8443-8475, with A → C transversion at position 8457. This point mutation results in replacement of Lys-251 by a Thr. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. COS cells were transfected with expression vectors (pSVL) containing cDNA of normal C1INH, mutant C1INH-Ta, and mutant K251T C1INH. Transfection was performed using a modified DEAE-dextran technique (15Eldering E. Huijbregts C.C.M. Lubbers Y.T.P. Longstaff C. Hack C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7013-7020Google Scholar). Newly synthesized protein is metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]Met (Amersham Life Sciences). Medium was harvested 72 h after transfection and dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (9.6 mM K/NaPO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) (PBS). Radiolabeled recombinant C1INH wild type and Ta were incubated alone or with C1s, C1r, β-factor XIIa, and kallikrein for 1 h at 37°C. C1r and C1s were generous gifts from Dr. David Bing, Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA. Factor XII and kallikrein were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Elkhart, IN. The reactions were then stopped by 1 μl of 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X-100 (0.5%), deoxycholic acid (0.25%), SDS (0.5%), and EDTA (5 mM) were added to each sample. Rabbit anti-human C1INH antibody (3 μl) was then added, and samples were incubated at 4°C overnight. A suspension of 6 μl of fixed Staphylococcus aureus (IgG sorb, Enzyme Center, Boston, MA), sonicated and washed three times (with 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 0.02 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4), was added to each sample and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The pellets (14,000 g for 3 min) were washed once with the above washing solution and three times with a washing solution lacking bovine serum albumin. Each precipitate was then dissolved in SDS non-reducing buffer (15 μl) (4.2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.5, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), vortexed, boiled for 3 min, centrifuged briefly, and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70°C. The heat stability of the recombinant C1INH was determined as described by Stein et al. (16Stein P.E. Tewkesburg D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Google Scholar). COS-1 cell supernatants (100 μl) containing normal or C1INH-Ta were incubated at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80°C for 120 min and then were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The residual antigen in the supernatant was quantified by an ELISA technique as described by Aulak et al. (12Aulak K.S. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Lubbers Y.P.T. Harrison R.A. Mast A. Cicardi M. Davis III, A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18088-18094Google Scholar). Size fractionation of normal serum and serum from Ta, of C1INH protein purified from each serum, and of each recombinant protein was performed on Superose 12 using an FPLC system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was equilibrated in PBS. Fractions of 300 μl were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. C1INH antigen was detected using an ELISA technique. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with goat polyclonal anti-human C1INH diluted 1/1000 in PBS (from Atlantic Antibodies) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubation in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 23°C. The bound antigen was then detected with a rabbit polyclonal antihuman C1INH (DAKO) diluted 1/1000 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. These polyclonal antisera recognize all forms of C1INH: native, protease-complexed, and reactive center cleaved. Duplicate samples of bound antigen also were analyzed using two different mouse monoclonal antibodies (4C3 and KOK12) that react only with complexed or cleaved normal C1INH, but do not react with the intact molecule (17de Agostini A. Patston P.A. Marottoli V. Carrel S. Marpel P.C. Schapira M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 700-705Google Scholar, 18Nuijens J.H. Huijbregts C.C.M. Eerenberg-Belmer A.J.M. Abbink J.J.

Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to detect binding of the anti-C1INH antibodies, the color was developed using O-phenylenediamine dehydrochloride (Sigma) and H2O2, and the optical density was read at 492 nm. ELISA using the monoclonal antibody KII, which reacts only with reactive center cleaved C1INH, as the catching antibody was done as described previously (19de Smet B.J.G.L. de Boer J.-P. Agterberg J. Rigter G. Bleeker W.K. Hack C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 81: 56-61Google Scholar, 20Nuijens J.H. Eerenberg-Belmer A.J.M. Huijbregts C.C.M. Schreuder W.O. Felt-Bersma R.J.F. Abbink J.J. Thijs L.G. Hac C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 443-450Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg/ml KII in PBS overnight at 4°C. Blocking was with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30-45 min at room temperature. Culture supernatants (100 μl) were incubated for 90 min at room temperature, and plates were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Adsorbed C1INH was detected with biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-C1INH antibody, followed by 30 min with streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase, both diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin. Development was with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, and reactions were stopped after 5-10 min with 2 M H2SO4. Previous experiments using enzymatic deglycosylation indicated that the additional carbohydrate was not simply blocking access to the reactive center (14Parad R.B. Kramer J. Strunk R.C. Rosen F.S. Davis III, A.E. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 88: 6786-6790Google Scholar). However, glycosidases do not restore the asparagine residue, which could be responsible for the inability to regenerate function. With peptide:N-glycosidase F, an aspartic acid is produced from deglycosylation, while with endoglycosidase F, one N-acetylglucosamine residue remains linked to the asparagine residue. Normal and dysfunctional C1INH were synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin to prevent glycosylation. This had no effect on the function of either protein; normal C1INH remained fully functional, and C1INH-Ta did not complex with C1r or C1s (data not shown). Lys-251 was replaced with a Thr, using polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (6Zahedi R. Bissler J.J. Davis III, A.E. Andreadis C. Wisneski J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 95: 1299-1305Google Scholar). Replacement of Lys by Thr creates a new glycosylation site on Asn-249 (Asn249-Asn-Lys-Ile-Ser → Asn-Asn-Thr-Ile-Ser). The resulting recombinant protein was slightly larger than the wild type recombinant protein, which suggests that this site was glycosylated. It was identical to the wild type inhibitor in its reactivity with target proteases (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of recombinant C1INH-Ta on SDS-PAGE after incubation for 1 h at 37°C with C1s, C1r, or kallikrein revealed no complex formation, but approximately 40-70% cleavage (Fig. 1, A and B). Cleavage was observed in all experiments, but the precise proportion varied from one experiment to another. In all lanes containing C1INH-Ta, a portion of protein was present with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa. This is consistent in size with a dimer of C1INH-Ta. This high molecular mass band was present and unchanged after incubation with C1r, C1s, β-factor XIIa, and kallikrein. As opposed to the reactions with the other target proteases, with β-factor XIIa, a minor but reproducible band was observed that corresponded in size to that of the inhibitor-protease complex (Fig. 1B). Time-course analysis of the interaction of the Ta protein with β-factor XIIa revealed complex formation, which was visible by 15 min and appeared to reach a maximum after approximately 1 h (Fig. 2, A and B). In comparison with the β-factor XIIa reaction with wild type C1INH, therefore, C1INH-Ta reacts much more slowly. In addition, only a portion of the inhibitor appears capable of participating in complex formation. Time-course analysis of C1INH-Ta with C1s showed maximal cleavage within 30 s (Fig. 2C). This amount did not appear to change over an incubation period of 1 h at 37°C, and no complex formation was observed. Thermal stability of serpins is a measure of their conformation. Natural intact serpins multimerize at 50-60°C. This multimerization is accompanied by decreased antigenicity. Serpins cleaved near the reactive center are stable (remain monomeric and retain antigenicity) at elevated temperatures (80-90°C) (21Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Google Scholar, 22Pemberton P.A. Harrison R.A. Lachmann P.J. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 58: 193-198Google Scholar). The recombinant Ta molecule with an intact reactive center loop is more stable at elevated temperatures than the wild type protein, but it is not as stable as the reactive center cleaved molecule (Fig. 3). Cleavage of the reactive center loop with trypsin increases the thermal stability of both the wild type and Ta proteins, indicating that the cleaved mutant molecule undergoes the normal conformational rearrangement specific to serpins. The observation that reactive center loop cleavage of C1INH-Ta enhanced reactivity with the monoclonal antibody KII, which reacts with cleaved but not with native or with complexed C1INH, was consistent with this interpretation (Fig. 4). Reactive center loop cleavage was confirmed in both experiments by SDS-PAGE (data not shown).Fig. 4Analysis of the conformational rearrangement in recombinant wild type C1INH and C1INH-Ta using the monoclonal antibody KII. COS-7 cell supernatants (100 μl) were incubated in the presence and absence of trypsin (5 μg/ml) and tested in serial dilution using an ELISA. The monoclonal antibody KII reacts only with the reactive center cleaved C1INH as described under “Materials and Methods.”∘, C1INH-Ta; ▪, wild type C1INH; •, C1INH-Ta + trypsin; □, wild type C1INH + trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to further analyze the apparent dimer formation observed on SDS-PAGE, the recombinant WT and Ta proteins were size-fractionated on Superose 12 (Fig. 5). As pointed out previously, because of its highly glycosylated nature, normal monomeric C1INH elutes earlier than expected on gel filtration, at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of nearly 400 kDa (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) (23Eldering E. Verpy E. Romes D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Google Scholar, 24Lewin M.F. Harpel P.C. Kaplan A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6415-6421Google Scholar). When fractions were analyzed with the polyclonal anti-C1INH antibody, recombinant C1INH-Ta eluted in two peaks, one of which corresponded to the elution position of normal C1INH (Fig. 5). The earlier, smaller peak eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 800 kDa. It is, therefore, possible that this peak represents a dimer of the Ta protein. The thermal stability of the protein within each peak was analyzed and each gave a profile the same as that shown in Fig. 3 for C1INH-Ta (data not shown). Antithrombin Rouen VI, with a mutation within helix F, and thus at a position near that of C1INH-Ta, undergoes spontaneous multimerization and also forms a stable inactive monomeric form after prolonged storage at 4°C or incubation at 41°C (25Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Google Scholar). This monomeric form probably is equivalent to the L-form of antithrombin or the latent form of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Therefore, we attempted to enhance these conformational changes in the Ta protein by incubation for 24 h at 37 and 41°C. No change in the interaction with any of the proteases was observed (data not shown), nor was there any change in the quantity of high molecular weight C1INH-Ta (on either gel filtration or SDS-PAGE analysis). Gel filtration of the mutant Ta protein and the wild type protein in serum or purified from serum showed identical elution profiles, using the polyclonal antiserum as a probe (Fig. 6). Only one peak was observed with C1INH-Ta, and this peak corresponded to the size of the monomer, which was identical in its elution position to the native normal C1INH.Fig. 6Gel filtration of C1INH from normal serum and Ta serum. Purified normal C1INH (0.7 mg/ml) and C1INH purified from Ta serum (0.6 mg/ml) were diluted 1:200 in PBS. Each purified protein (100 μ l) from serum was applied to a Superose 12 column using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and C1INH was detected using an ELISA with a polyclonal anti-C1INH antiserum that recognizes all forms of C1INH. □, wild type; •, C1INH-Ta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to clarify the conformation of recombinant C1INH-Ta and wild type C1INH, reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies 4C3 and KOK12 was analyzed. Only the experiments with KOK12 are illustrated; the reactivities with 4C3 differed in intensity, but otherwise the results were identical to those with KOK12. These monoclonal antibodies detect C1INH that has undergone structural rearrangement due either to cleavage, complex formation, or loop-sheet polymerization (12Aulak K.S. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Lubbers Y.P.T. Harrison R.A. Mast A. Cicardi M. Davis III, A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18088-18094Google Scholar, 17de Agostini A. Patston P.A. Marottoli V. Carrel S. Marpel P.C. Schapira M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 700-705Google Scholar). Both monoclonal antibodies reacted with the higher molecular weight form of the recombinant C1INH-Ta (Fig. 7B). The reaction of each with the monomeric C1INH-Ta, like the reaction with the normal inhibitor, was minimal. This was true even though the amount of monomer present greatly exceeded the amount of the higher molecular weight form, as shown by the reactivity with the polyclonal antiserum. These data indicated that the dimer expresses the epitope that is expressed on complexed normal C1INH. The reactivity of the C1INH-Ta monomer with the monoclonal antibodies, like that of the wild type C1INH, was strikingly increased following cleavage at the reactive center with trypsin (Fig. 7, A and B). The naturally occurring dysfunctional mutant serpins provide a starting point to help understand the structural requirements and the inhibitory mechanism used by these inhibitors. In this paper, we have characterized several aspects of the mechanism of dysfunction in a variant of C1INH that has deletion of Lys-251, which is situated outside the reactive center region. While the recombinant mutant protein did not form an SDS-stable complex with the target proteases C1s, C1r, and kallikrein, it demonstrated partial susceptibility to cleavage by target proteases. The intermediate thermal stability of the Ta protein together with the presence of a high molecular mass band on SDS-PAGE led to an analysis of potential multimer formation. Multimers were, in fact, detected, and both the monomer and multimer revealed intermediate thermal stability. Multimerization has been observed with several different dysfunctional serpins with mutations in several distinct regions. The mutant Z α1-antitrypsin, with replacement of Glu-342 by a Lys, undergoes spontaneous loop-sheet polymerization (26Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Google Scholar). This replacement disrupts a critical salt bridge between Glu-342 and Lys-290 at the junction between strand 5A and the proximal end of the reactive center loop. The result therefore probably is to open the gap in β sheet A between strands 3 and 5. Initially, it was suggested that this gap provided a receptor site for the reactive center loop of a second antitrypsin molecule. Data from more recent mutants and from a crystallized antithrombin dimer suggest that overinsertion of the reactive center loop may result, and that this disrupts strand 1C (27Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-111Google Scholar). The reactive center loop of a second molecule then inserts into the gap in sheet C. Another example is mutant C1INH-Mo with replacement of Ala-436 by a Thr (12Aulak K.S. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Lubbers Y.P.T. Harrison R.A. Mast A. Cicardi M. Davis III, A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18088-18094Google Scholar). This mutation is located within the hinge region amino-terminal to the reactive center and appears to interfere with the movement of the reactive center loop. The presence of Thr at this position apparently favors stable insertion of the reactive center loop into the A sheet with resulting distortion of either the A or C sheets culminating in loop-sheet polymerization. Another group of mutants that lead to multimerization are those with replacements near the carboxyl terminus, which have been described in antithrombin, α1-antitrypsin, and C1INH (23Eldering E. Verpy E. Romes D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Google Scholar, 27Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-111Google Scholar). These mutations very likely disrupt the anchoring of the carboxyl-terminal end of the reactive center loop, resulting in overinsertion of the amino-terminal end of the loop into sheet A. Loop-sheet polymerization then follows. Prolonged incubation of antithrombin Rouen VI at 4°C or incubation at 41°C enhances formation of an inactive uncleaved molecule (the latent form) accompanied with dimer, trimer, or tetramer formation (21Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Google Scholar). The mutation in antithrombin Rouen VI results in replacement of the conserved Asn-187 with an Asp. This Asn residue is within helix F and is hydrogen-bonded to a carbonyl group within the peptide loop that connects the F helix to strand 3A. The amino acids in this peptide loop make a number of hydrophobic interactions with residues in strand 5A of β sheet A. Therefore, this loop contributes to stabilizing the five-stranded sheet A. In this antithrombin mutant, the link between the F helix and the connecting peptide loop is broken, allowing movement of strands 1A, 2A, and 3A, resulting in opening of the A sheet between S3A and S5A, permitting multimerization. C1INH-Ta has deletion of Lys-251, which creates a new glycosylation signal. This residue is located within the connecting loop between helix F and strand 3A and is hydrogen-bonded to other conserved residues within helix F and strand 5A. Our results indicate that glycosylation is not directly involved in the dysfunction of the Ta molecule. This is in agreement with previous data using enzymatically deglycosylated protein isolated from plasma and our results with the Lys-251 → Thr substitution mutant. It is likely that the deletion of this Lys disrupts, directly or indirectly (via helix F), the structure of β sheet A. This probably results in some degree of overinsertion of the reactive center loop, but not to as great an extent as the P10 Ala → Thr mutant or the C1INH mutants with substitutions distal to the reactive center loop (14Parad R.B. Kramer J. Strunk R.C. Rosen F.S. Davis III, A.E. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 88: 6786-6790Google Scholar, 23Eldering E. Verpy E. Romes D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Google Scholar). The small amount of dimer formation, the intermediate thermal stability, the susceptibility to cleavage by target proteases, and the lack of expression on the C1INH-Ta monomer of the neoepitope present on the complexed inhibitor are all consistent with this interpretation. Dimer formation was less extensive than with most of the other above described mutants and was not enhanced by incubation at either 37°C or 41°C. In addition, larger multimers were not observed. No multimers were detected in plasma from a patient with this mutation. There are several potential explanations for this apparent absence. It is possible that the multimers in plasma are simply below the detection limits of the ELISA. However, this seems unlikely because the plasma used contained similar amounts of mutant and normal protein (14Parad R.B. Kramer J. Strunk R.C. Rosen F.S. Davis III, A.E. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 88: 6786-6790Google Scholar). It seems most likely that the multimers are rapidly cleared from the circulation in vivo. C1INH-protease complexes have a rapid in vivo clearance rate (28de Smet B.J.G.L. de Boer J.P. Agterberg J. Rigter G. Bleeker W.K. Hack C.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 56-61Google Scholar, 29Malek R. Aulak K.S. Davis III, A.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 191-197Google Scholar). Since the C1INH-Ta multimer shares several characteristics with the inhibitor-protease complex, it may be rapidly cleared by a similar mechanism. It also is possible that multimers form intracellularly in vivo and, unlike with COS cells, are not secreted or that some other undefined mechanism in plasma prevents formation of the multimer. It also is theoretically possible that the multimers represent an artifact of expression of C1INH-Ta in COS cells. However, if this is true, it is specific for this mutant and therefore indicates that its conformation is different from that of the wild type protein. Thermal denaturation analysis showed that the mutant protein was more stable at elevated temperature than the wild type. However, it was not as stable as the P10 Ala → Thr mutant or as reactive center cleaved wild type C1INH. Cleavage of the reactive center loop with trypsin increases the thermal stability of C1INH-Ta to a degree similar to that of the cleaved wild type protein. This further indicates that the cleavage of the mutant inhibitor results in complete insertion of the released reactive center loop. This susceptibility to cleavage by trypsin and by target proteases contrasts with the lack of susceptibility of the P10 Ala → Thr mutant, of antithrombin Rouen and of latent plasminogen activator inhibitor (12Aulak K.S. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Lubbers Y.P.T. Harrison R.A. Mast A. Cicardi M. Davis III, A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18088-18094Google Scholar, 25Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Google Scholar, 30Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Georghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). Therefore, the reactive center must be exposed in the Lys-251 deletion mutant as it is in the wild type inhibitor and in the P12 Ala → Glu and P14 Val → Glu mutant monomer. Finally, the lack of expression of the neoepitope on the monomer indicates the lack of complete insertion. Appearance of the neoepitope on the cleaved molecule confirms that the mutant is able to undergo the normal conformational rearrangement. The fact that C1INH-Ta complexed with β-factor XIIa indicates that the molecule has a reactive center that can be recognized by protease and is capable of forming a complex, albeit inefficiently. Both the rate and extent of complex formation were considerably diminished compared with the β-factor XIIa-wild type C1INH reaction. C1INH-Ta, therefore, clearly is capable of undergoing the conformational rearrangements required for complex formation. It also can be concluded that the functional changes in C1INH-Ta are more subtle than in many of the other mutants that lead to loop-sheet polymerization and/or conversion of the inhibitor to a substrate. The only other mutant of this type that retains significant activity is antithrombin Rouen VI, which has a mutation within helix F, very near the site of the deletion in C1INH-Ta. However, the minimal activity retained by C1INH-Ta almost certainly is not physiologically relevant. Patients with hereditary angioedema express one normal C1INH gene. The small amount of activity contributed by this dysfunctional mutant would be insignificant in comparison with that contributed by the product of the normal allele. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that deletion of Lys-251 results in aberrant folding of the mutant molecule that results in two populations of molecules. One of these is probably characterized by loop overinsertion to the extent that it resembles a latent form. This form is susceptible to multimerization and is not recognized by target proteases. It also, at least in the dimerized form, expresses epitopes normally present on the complexed form of the protein. The other form remains in a conformation recognized by target proteases and by trypsin. This is probably the form capable of complexing with β-factor XIIa. It does not express the epitopes present on the protease-complexed normal molecule. Although there may be some degree of loop insertion, appropriate insertion to allow efficient complex formation appears to be prevented, or the rate of loop insertion may be slowed. This combination of characteristics (substrate-like behavior, multimerization, and retention of residual ability to complex) is unusual and perhaps unique. The analysis of this inhibitor illustrates the fine line between function and dysfunction among the serpins."
https://openalex.org/W2093218432,"In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of beta cells with carbachol and glucose causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein concurrently with increased insulin secretion. The effect was observed in two different insulin-secreting cell lines and in rat pancreatic islets. Tyrosine phosphorylation was largely calcium independent and occurred within 2 min after stimulation of beta cells with glucose and the muscarinic agonist carbachol. In islets, the effect of glucose was greatly diminished by the addition of mannoheptulose, a seven-carbon sugar that inhibits glucokinase, suggesting that glucose metabolism is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein to occur. Neither insulin nor insulin-like growth factor I significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein, suggesting that it was not an autocrine effect. Depolarization of beta cells with glyburide or 50 mM potassium dramatically increased insulin secretion but had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. Addition of phorbol ester caused a less than 2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the calcium ionophore A23187 had no effect. Among the various fuel secretagogues tested, only D-glucose stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, both alone and in combination with carbachol. Finally, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG879 inhibited both tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of a novel signaling pathway in glucose-induced insulin secretion: tyrosine phosphorylation of beta cell p125, which is a proximal step in insulin secretion. Our current working hypothesis is that glucose stimulation of beta cell p125 tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step for insulin secretion.

Our current working hypothesis is that glucose stimulation of beta cell p125 tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step for insulin secretion. Insulin secretion from beta cells can be stimulated by different types of secretagogues (1Ashcroft S.J. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). D-Glucose, a fuel secretagogue, is the major physiological stimulus (2Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 373-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glucose-induced insulin release is incompletely understood, although glucose oxidation is essential (3Malaisse W.J. Sener A. Herchuelz A. Hutton J.C.

Glucokinase is thought to act as a glucose sensor, with phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate serving as the rate-limiting step in glucose oxidation (7Matschinsky F. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Froguel P. Velho G. Cohen D. Permutt M.A. Tanizawa Y. Jetton T.L. Niswender K. Magnuson M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2092-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although inhibition of glucose oxidation inhibits insulin release, the details of the mechanism coupling glucose oxidation to insulin secretion are less clear. It is widely believed that oxidation of fuel secretagogues increases intracellular levels of ATP (8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although this view has been challenged by some groups (9MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An increased ATP/ADP ratio is believed to close K+ATP channels at the plasma membrane, resulting in decreased K+ efflux and subsequent depolarization of the beta cell (10Misler S. Falke L.C.

Depolarization activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, causing an influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the beta cell and increased intracellular Ca2+ (6Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 13Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently shown that nutrient secretagogues increase beta cell malonyl-CoA levels, leading to increased cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA esters that positively modulate insulin secretion (14Corkey B.E.

Although increased intracellular Ca2+ activates protein kinases such as the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (17Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. Prog.

Because of these questions, the search for additional beta cell-specific pathways that result in insulin exocytosis has continued. It appears that other intracellular factors are also involved in regulating insulin release. These include arachidonate, guanine nucleotides, small monomeric GTP-binding proteins such as rab3A, and the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gαi (22Olszewski S. Deeney J.T. Schuppin G.T.

In other secretory cell types, protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to be important in modulating secretion (27Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9031-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The role that tyrosine phosphorylation plays in insulin secretion is unknown. Tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to participate in interleukin 1β-induced nitric oxide synthase accumulation in beta cells (31Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. Rodi C.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Rothenberg et al. (32Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in late passage β-TC3 cells glucose-induced insulin secretion activates the beta cell insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and its intracellular signal transduction pathway (32Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, exogenous insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor ITPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. and agents that resulted in insulin release such as K+ caused the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the 97-kDa β subunit of the insulin receptor. Currently, the physiological significance of these findings with respect to glucose-induced insulin secretion is unknown. insulin-like growth factor I 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In this report, we show that stimulation of beta cells with glucose, carbachol, and various fuel secretagogues causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein. Neither insulin nor IGF-I significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein, demonstrating that insulin secreted from the beta cell is not responsible for the effect. Importantly, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG879 dose-dependently inhibited both insulin release and 125-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein may be an essential step in insulin secretion. β-TC3 cells (passage 34) were obtained through the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center from Dr. D. Hanahan (University of California, San Francisco, CA). β-TC3 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes in the presence of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (75 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 2 mML-glutamine as described (23Konrad R.J. Young R.A. Record R.D. Smith R.M. Butkerait P. Manning D. Jarett L. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12869-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12209-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and subcloned weekly. Media were changed twice weekly and on the day prior to an experiment. Insulin secretory capacity of the β-TC3 cells in response to glucose and carbachol was regularly monitored. Cells were used exclusively between passages 40 and 55. β-TC3 cells in 10-cm dishes were washed three times with 10 ml of Krebs'-HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.40, 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were preincubated in the same buffer for 30 min at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. The preincubation buffer was aspirated, and cells were incubated for 2-30 min at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 with 10 ml of fresh buffer supplemented with appropriate secretagogues. At the end of the incubation period, the supernatant was removed for insulin measurement by radioimmunoassay (26Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were processed for subsequent immunoprecipitation. All immunoprecipitation steps were performed at 4°C. After removal of the supernatant, β-TC3 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.40. Following the second wash, phosphate-buffered saline was aspirated, and 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.40, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 20 mM NaF, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM NaVO4, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) was added to each dish. Cells were scraped, transferred into 1.5-ml screw-cap Eppendorf tubes, vortexed for 30 s to achieve complete lysis, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 s. The supernatant was transferred to a second tube, and phosphotyrosyl proteins were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of mouse monoclonal antiphosphotyrosyl antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 2 h on a rocker. After 2 h, 20 μl of protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce) preadsorbed with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) were added to the tubes, and the incubation continued for an additional 1 h. At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed once with Wash Buffer I (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.40, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) and once with Wash Buffer II (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.40, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). Twenty-five microliters of 2 × sample buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.80, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10 mg/liter bromphenol blue) was added to each tube. Samples were vortexed for 30 s, boiled for 3 min, and stored at −20°C prior to analysis. Samples were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Colored rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) were run on each gel. Proteins were separated for 1 h at 175 V at room temperature using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II dual slab cell. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Hybond C; Amersham) for 2 h (100 V, 4°C). Nitrocellulose blots were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (1% ovalbumin, 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.40, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% sodium azide) at 4°C. The next day, blots were probed with PY20 (1 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed twice with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.40, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% sodium azide (TNA) for 10 min, once with TNA supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min, and twice more with TNA for 10 min. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-mouse antibody for 1 h (1 μg/ml), washed, and incubated with 5 μCi of 125I-protein A (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Blots were washed, air dried, and exposed on a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics) overnight. The following day, radioactivity bound to the blot was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. In each experiment, the amount of radioactivity in the control sample was set at 100%, and all other results were expressed as percentages of control. Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats using collagenase digestion and Ficoll purification as described previously (26Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Typically, this procedure provided 350-400 islets/rat. Islets were washed three times in Krebs‘-HEPES buffer supplemented with 3 mM glucose. Islets (1000/condition) were incubated in 1 ml of the same buffer in silanized 13 × 100-mm round bottom tubes at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2. The preincubation buffer was aspirated, and islets were incubated for 5-30 min with Krebs‘-HEPES buffer supplemented with the appropriate secretagogues at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% 02/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation period, the supernatant was removed for insulin measurement by radioimmunoassay (26Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer was added to each tube, and islets were homogenized on ice. Islet lysates were vortexed for 1 min and transferred to new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and processed for subsequent immunoprecipitation as described above. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using version 6.0 of SSPS for Windows. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparisons between means using the least significant difference test. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first examined the effect of glucose and carbachol on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in β-TC3 cells. β-TC3 cells were incubated with either 0 mM glucose or 15 mM glucose and 0.5 mM carbachol. After incubation, cells were lysed and phosphotyrosyl proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting. Fig. 1 shows that stimulation of β-TC3 cells with 15 mM glucose and 0.5 mM carbachol markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of one protein of 125 kDa (p < 0.05 versus control). As early as 2 min after glucose and carbachol stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by 260.2 ± 30.5%. Tyrosine phosphorylation continued to increase with time and was maximal (482.6 ± 122.3%) at 30 min (p < 0.05 versus control). Addition of insulin or IGF-I had no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in β-TC3 cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that secreted insulin was not responsible for the effect. IGF-I had no significant effect on insulin secretion from the β-TC3 cells. As a further control, when phosphotyrosine was added to the cell lysates, immunoprecipitation of the 125-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein was completely inhibited. Furthermore, treatment of the immunoprecipitates with λ-phosphatase decreased recognition of the 125-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein by the PY20 antibody. These observations strongly suggest that p125 is a phosphotyrosine-containing protein. We next performed similar experiments in islets. Stimulation of islets with 28 mM glucose and 0.5 mM carbachol resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein. As with β-TC3 cells, no other proteins underwent increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein was increased by 192.5 ± 16.3% at 5 min (p < 0.05 versus control) and 184.1 ± 14.6% at 30 min (p < 0.05 versus control, n = 3). Insulin secretion was increased by 326.7 ± 160.5% at 5 min and 1247.5 ± 622.7% at 30 min (n = 3). As shown in Fig. 3, tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein was also stimulated with glucose alone in islets. At 5 min, 20 mM glucose increased tyrosine phosphorylation by 223.8 ± 31.0%. The addition of mannoheptulose (an inhibitor of glucokinase that inhibits islet beta cell glucose metabolism) completely inhibited glucose-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin secretion. These data suggest that glucose metabolism may be important for tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein. This concept was supported by the fact that the nonmetabolizable glucose analogs L-glucose and 2-deoxyglucose had no significant effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in β-TC3 cells (n = 4, data not shown). As an additional control, the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined in another insulin secreting beta cell line, β-HC9 cells (34Radvanyi F. Christgau S. Baekkeskov S. Jolicoeur C. Hanahan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 4). Stimulation of β-HC9 cells with 15 mM glucose and 0.5 mM carbachol for 30 min resulted in a 265.4 ± 33.2% increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein and a concomitant increase (325.4 ± 47.5%) in insulin secretion. The above experiments showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein correlated with insulin secretion in islets as well as clonal beta cells. To determine Ca2+ dependence of tyrosine phosphorylation, β-TC3 cells were stimulated with glucose and carbachol in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5). In the presence of Ca2+, glucose and carbachol increased 125-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation by 349.7 ± 42.3% (p < 0.05 versus control). In the absence of Ca2+, glucose and carbachol were still able to increase tyrosine phosphorylation by 263.0 ± 28.1% (p < 0.05 versus control). At the same time, in the absence of Ca2+, stimulated insulin secretion was completely abolished, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein occurs independently of an increase in beta cell intracellular calcium. Stimulation of β-TC3 cells with the sulfonylurea glyburide or 50 mM extracellular potassium increased insulin secretion by 607.0 ± 80.0% (p < 0.05 versus control) and 1395.4 ± 197.7% (p < 0.05 versus control), respectively (Fig. 6). Increased insulin secretion occurs because these agents cause the beta cell to become depolarized, increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein, however, was not significantly increased with either agent. This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein is a proximal event in insulin exocytosis and not the result of depolarization or increased intracellular Ca2+. Further support of this idea is provided by the data shown in Fig. 7. When β-TC3 cells were treated with A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, there was a 1022.5 ± 107.9% increase in insulin secretion. No increased tyrosine phosphorylation was observed, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein is not an event mediated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+. When β-TC3 cells were stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C, insulin secretion was increased by 389.9 ± 48.3%. In contrast to A23187, TPA also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein by 193.3 ± 39.4%, suggesting that its phosphorylation may occur partly through the action of protein kinase C. TPA, however, did not cause as great an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein as did glucose and carbachol (354.4 ± 15.9%, p < 0.05 versus control). The effect of other secretagogues was next examined. As shown in Fig. 8, 15 mM glucose increased tyrosine phosphorylation 203.2 ± 18.5%, and 0.5 mM carbachol increased phosphorylation 270.1 ± 37.9%. A maximal increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was obtained when the β-TC3 cells were stimulated with both glucose and carbachol (467.5 ± 76.9%; p < 0.05 versus control). This also corresponded to the greatest increase in insulin secretion (605.0 ± 105.9%). Fructose, a metabolizable six-carbon sugar, did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein to as great an extent as did glucose (163.1 ± 1.4%). The combination of fructose and carbachol did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein to as great an extent as did glucose and carbachol (327.3 ± 51.4%). The effect of additional fuel secretagogues on tyrosine phosphorylation in β-TC3 cells was also examined. Leucine did not significantly increase tyrosine phosphorylation. Glyceraldehyde and α-ketoisocaproic acid increased phosphorylation to 150.4 ± 16.6 and 139.9 ± 11.6% of control, respectively. Addition of carbachol significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of α-ketoisocaproic acid but not glyceraldehyde or leucine. Of all agents tested, only glucose in combination with carbachol produced a significant increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin secretion. The above data suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein present in the beta cell may be an important event in insulin secretion. In the final series of experiments, the effect of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG879, on insulin secretion and tyrosine phosphorylation was examined. AG879 had no effect on basal insulin secretion or protein tyrosine phosphorylation at concentrations as high as 50 μM (n = 4). AG879, however, dose-dependently inhibited glucose- and carbachol-induced increases in insulin secretion and tyrosine phosphorylation, with almost complete inhibition at 10 μM (Fig. 9). In contrast, a structurally similar but inactive analogue, tyrphostin I, had no effect on either basal or stimulated insulin secretion or tyrosine phosphorylation at concentrations as high as 100 μM (n = 6). These data demonstrated that inhibition of 125-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with inhibition of insulin release, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein is an important event in this process. We have demonstrated that stimulation of beta cells with glucose causes a 125-kDa protein present in beta cells to undergo markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation. When phosphorylation was inhibited with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG879, insulin secretion was also inhibited, suggesting that this may be an important step in insulin release. Tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to be an important signal transduction mechanism in many different types of cells (27Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21601-21606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.-J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M.

For example, phospholipase Cγ1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following binding of various growth factors to different cell types (35Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernández-Sotomayor S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Phospholipase Cγ1 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to produce two important second messengers: diacylglycerol and myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (35Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernández-Sotomayor S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Another well known example of tyrosine phosphorylation is that of the insulin receptor, which becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in cells following addition of insulin (36Sun X.J. Rothenberg P.

The insulin receptor in turn phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 on multiple tyrosine residues; tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 then acts as a docking protein for numerous other proteins with SH2 domains that specifically bind phosphotyrosyl residues (37Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a previous study, we demonstrated the presence of the insulin receptor 97-kDa β subunit in β-TC3 cells (32Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous insulin, as well as endogenous insulin released by glucose, and IGF-I caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the 97-kDa protein. Glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In the present study, neither insulin nor IGF-I increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein, indicating that insulin secretion from the beta cell is not responsible for this effect. Furthermore, glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein was calcium-independent. In these experiments, we could not document tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in β-TC3 cells. The main difference between the two studies is the β-TC3 passage number: in the current study β-TC3 cells were used exclusively between passages 40 and 55, whereas in the former study β-TC3 cells were used at passages greater than 55. To test this possibility, we have reexamined the expression of the insulin receptor in beta β-TC3 cells as a function of passage number. Under our experimental conditions, we clearly detect glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 97-kDa β subunit of the insulin receptor only in β-TC3 cells at a passage greater than 60 (data not shown). Glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein was seen in at least two insulin-secreting transformed beta cell lines (β-TC3 and β-HC9) as well as in isolated pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The advantage of using beta cell lines is that they provide a pure population of beta cells without any other endocrine or passenger cells. A disadvantage is that many beta cell lines have glucose dose-response curves for insulin secretion that are shifted to the left compared with rat or mouse isolated islets. However, the β-HC9 line secretes insulin in response to glucose in a physiological fashion (34Radvanyi F. Christgau S. Baekkeskov S. Jolicoeur C. Hanahan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa protein is observed in pure beta cell lines as well as in islets of Langerhans is strong evidence in favor of its localization to the beta cell. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 in beta cells was stimulated by glucose. This effect was specific for D-glucose and was dependent on glucose metabolism, since mannoheptulose blocked glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125. Our data suggest that glucose-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 is an early step in the signal transduction pathway of glucose-induced insulin secretion for the following reasons: 1) most of the fuel secretagogues tested had a modest or no effect on p125 tyrosine phosphorylation compared with that obtained with glucose alone; 2) glucose-induced p125 tyrosine phosphorylation did not require extracellular calcium; 3) agonists that stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium, such as calcium ionophores, depolarizing agents, and sulfonylureas, did not affect p125 tyrosine phosphorylation, even though they caused robust insulin secretion; and 4) the muscarinic agonist carbachol, which stimulates phospholipase Cβ, also stimulated p125 tyrosine phosphorylation. Although these findings are consistent with a proximal localization of p125 tyrosine phosphorylation in the cascade of events resulting in insulin secretion, the identity of the coupling signal(s) between beta cell glucose recognition and p125 tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown. The identity of beta cell p125 is unknown. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody demonstrates one single band. Preliminary experiments using commercially available antibodies to known phosphotyrosine proteins with a similar molecular weight show that beta cell p125 is not Fak, Jak1, Jak2, or Cbl (42Meisner H. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25332-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 43Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Studies are ongoing to purify beta cell p125. The role of glucose-induced p125 tyrosine phosphorylation in insulin secretion remains to be fully determined. The experiments with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG879 suggest that p125 tyrosine phosphorylation may be required for insulin secretion, since inhibition of p125 tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with inhibition of insulin secretion. Furthermore, tyrphostin 1, an inactive analogue, had no effect on insulin secretion and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, since it is likely that AG879 inhibits all beta cell tyrosine kinase activities, these findings should be interpreted with caution in the absence of a selective inhibition of beta cell p125 function. In summary, we have shown that glucose stimulation of insulin-secreting beta cells and isolated pancreatic islets results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a beta cell protein, p125, which is proximal in the signaling pathway resulting in insulin secretion. Our current working hypothesis is that glucose stimulation of beta cell p125 tyrosine phosphorylation is a novel and essential step for insulin secretion.

TRα1 and TRβ1 mRNAs are found in many tissues, whereas mRNA for the N-terminal TRβ2 variant derived from the β locus is readily detectable only in the pituitary gland and derived cell sources such as GH3 somatotropes and TtT-97 thyrotropes. We previously isolated the genomic region governing expression of the TRβ2 isoform in thyrotropes and showed that transcription arose from multiple origins within a 400-base pair (bp) region. We now report that the region extending 500 bp upstream of the putative AUG codon (A is +1) contains six areas of interaction with the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1. In addition there are separate areas that bind other factors present in thyrotrope cells. Promoter deletions revealed that removal of regions containing the Pit-1 sites at −456 to −432, −149 to −127, and −124 to −102 progressively decreased TRβ2 promoter activity in thyrotropes. A more proximal footprinted area from −65 to −19, which accounted for the remaining promoter activity, contained sites that interacted with recombinant Pit-1; however, extracts of TtT-97 thyrotropes, which express Pit-1, footprinted this proximal region with a pattern of protection that differed from that produced by Pit-1. A comparative deletional analysis demonstrated that a shorter region extending only 204 bp from the AUG was sufficient to support TRβ2 promoter activity in GH3 somatotropes. The more proximal Pit-1 sites, including the area from −53 to −19, whose pattern differed from Pit-1 in thyrotrope extracts, showed protection patterns with GH3 extracts that were indistinguishable from recombinant Pit-1. Site-directed mutagenesis that abrogated binding of both recombinant Pit-1 and Pit-1-containing nuclear extracts revealed that the two Pit-1 sites between −149 and −102 were important for TRβ2 promoter activity with the more proximal being most critical. Finally, we showed that TRβ2 promoter activity in α-TSH cells, which do not transcribe the endogenous TRβ2 locus or produce Pit-1 protein, could be reconstituted to a level approaching that seen in expressing TtT-97 thyrotropes by cotransfecting a Pit-1 expression vector. Activation by Pit-1 was dependent on the same Pit-1 sites shown to be important for basal TRβ2 promoter activity in thyrotropes as constructs lacking them by deletion or mutation were not stimulated by Pit-1.

https://openalex.org/W2148836983,"cADP-ribose (cADPr) has recently been shown to release Ca2+ from an intracellular store of permeabilized T lymphocyte cell lines (Guse, A. H., da Silva, C. P., Emmrich, F., Ashamu, G. A., Potter, B. V. L., and Mayr, G. W. (1995) J. Immunol. 155, 3353-3359). Using permeabilized Jurkat and HPB.ALL T lymphocytes, the effects of varying concentrations of inorganic phosphate and Mg2+ on cADPr-induced Ca2+ release were investigated. cADPr-induced Ca2+ release was dependent on the concentration of inorganic phosphate, showing very low Ca2+ release activity between 0.5 and 2 mM inorganic phosphate. At 4 to 5 mM inorganic phosphate, the cADPr-induced Ca2+ release was much more pronounced, reaching maximal values at 10 mM inorganic phosphate. The underlying mechanism for this stimulatory effect was an increased loading of the cADPr-sensitive Ca2+ store, which was demonstrated by enhanced resequestration of Ca2+ selectively into the cADPr-sensitive Ca2+ store. The free Mg2+ concentration also influenced cADPr-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells: at 0 and 8.58 mM the release was nearly completely abolished, whereas at 1.06 mM maximal Ca2+ release by cADPr was observed. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of exogenously added cADPr revealed that the catabolism of cADPr at varying Mg2+ and Pi concentrations had only minor relevance for the modulatory effects observed.To correlate the effects of inorganic phosphate and Mg2+ on cADPr-induced Ca2+ release observed in the permeabilized cell preparations, measurements of these ions in intact Jurkat T lymphocytes were carried out. Intact Jurkat T cells stimulated via the T cell receptor·CD3 complex did not respond with significant elevation of the free intracellular Mg2+ concentration. In contrast, stimulation via the T cell receptor·CD3 complex resulted in an increase in the intracellular inorganic phosphate concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2015503536,"We investigated the binding of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to a stem-loop structure corresponding to the mini-exon sequence of the protozoan parasite Leishmania amazonensis. This oligomer was designed to anneal to the single-stranded region adjacent to the bottom of the hairpin and to fold back on itself, giving rise to a “double-hairpin” complex that involved a local triplex. This imposed the recognition, by the third strand, of a “purine” strand containing 6 interspersed pyrimidines out of 15 nucleic acid bases. The sequence of the complementary oligonucleotide was derived from the so-called pyrimidine motif; the third strand of the anti-mini-exon oligomer was parallel to the purine strand of the target. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and footprinting studies demonstrated that such an antisense oligomer was able to bind to both the DNA and RNA versions of the Leishmania hairpin. These double hairpin complexes allowed the formation at pH 6.0 of a triple-stranded structure, despite the presence of 4 A:T*G and 2 G:C*T triplets out of 15.

The common feature of messenger RNAs from trypanosomatids is the presence at their 5′ end of a short sequence named “mini-exon” acquired during maturation of premessenger RNAs through a trans-splicing mechanism (1Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Google Scholar). This mini-exon motif, which is absolutely required for translation, is therefore a very attractive target for the design of antisense oligonucleotides as anti-parasitic agents (2Hélène C. Toulmé J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Google Scholar). Potentially, a single complementary sequence will prevent the synthesis of all parasitic proteins. Indeed, oligonucleotides targeted to the mini-exon sequence of Trypanosoma brucei (3Cornelissen A.W.C.A. Verspieren P. Toulmé J.J. Swinkels B.W. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5605-5614Google Scholar, 4Walder J.A. Eder P.S. Engman D.M. Brentano S.T. Walder R.Y. Knutzon D.S. Dorfman D.M. Donelson J.E.

Biochimie. 1993; 75: 43-47Google Scholar) were shown to inhibit in vitro translation in cell-free extracts. Moreover, an acridine-linked 9-mer, complementary to the 5′ end of T. brucei mRNAs specifically killed cultured procyclic forms of this parasite in vitro (6Verspieren P. Cornelissen A.W.C.A. Thuong N.T. Hélène C. Toulmé J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 307-315Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that an anti-mini-exon phosphorothioate 16-mer, either free or associated to low density lipoproteins, displayed leishmanicidal properties against amastigotes of L. amazonensis grown in murine macrophages (7Ramazeilles C. Mishra R.K. Moreau S. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7859-7863Google Scholar, 8Mishra R.K. Moreau C. Ramazeilles C. Moreau S. Bonnet J. Toulmé J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 229-237Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the mini-exon sequence of L. amazonensis could fold into a hairpin secondary structure (9Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Google Scholar), which weakened the binding of antisense oligonucleotides (10Pascolo E. Hudrisier D. Sproat B. Thuong N.T. Toulmé J.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 98-106Google Scholar). Rather than competing with the intramolecular hairpin, we considered the possibility to bind an oligomer to the folded structure. This can be achieved in different ways: (i) binding to the stem via a triple-stranded structure (11Baumann U. Frank R. Blöcker H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 986-991Google Scholar) or to the loop, leading to half pseudoknot structure (12Ecker D.J. Vickers T.A. Bruice T.W. Freier S.M. Jenison R.D. Manoharan M. Zounes M. Science. 1993; 257: 958-961Google Scholar), (ii) using an oligonucleotide that bridges the single-stranded parts, upstream and downstream of the stem (13Richardson P.L. Schepartz A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5109-5111Google Scholar, 14Cload S.T. Schepartz A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6324-6326Google Scholar), or (iii) selecting oligomers from a random population that recognize the folded target (15Cload S.T. Schepartz A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 437-442Google Scholar, 16Mishra R.K. Toulmé J.J. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Life Sci. 1994; 317: 977-982Google Scholar, 17Mishra R.K. Le Tinévez R. Toulmé J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The resulting complexes might actually stabilize the hairpin and interfere with mRNA translation. Alternatively, we previously described a strategy that allows accommodation of a stem-loop structure into a so-called “double hairpin” complex (18Brossalina E. Toulmé J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 796-797Google Scholar, 19Brossalina E. Pascolo E. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5616-5622Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide forms a short Watson-Crick duplex with a single-stranded sequence at the bottom of the hairpin and then folds back to give rise to a triple-stranded structure with both this short duplex and the stem of the hairpin. This approach was demonstrated using a model stem-loop purposefully designed to promote a triple helical structure; an antisense oligopyrimidine was targeted to a hairpin made exclusively of purines on the 5′ side and consequently of pyrimidines on the 3′ side, thus leading to the formation of canonical T:A*T and C:G*C+ triplets (where the colon denotes Watson-Crick base pairing and the asterisk denotes Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding with the third strand). The resulting complex involved 16-base triplets in which the two pyrimidine strands were connected by a (T)4 loop. The formation of triple helices is restricted to homopurine homopyridine sequences (2Hélène C. Toulmé J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Google Scholar). Unfortunately, nucleic acid bases are not appropriately distributed for triplex formation in the hairpin derived from the L. amazonensis mini-exon. Therefore we had to design an oligonucleotide that aimed at forming a double hairpin complex involving a triple-stranded structure with a target sequence comprising all four bases. In particular two Cs of two G-C pairs should be read by the third strand. We demonstrated that an antisense oligomer composed of the four bases was able to bind to either a DNA or a RNA folded hairpin corresponding to the L. amazonensis mini-exon sequence through the formation of G:C*T and A:T(U)*G triplets, in addition to the canonical ones. The oligonucleotides used throughout this study (see sequences in Fig. 1) were prepared “trityl on” using conventional phosphoramidite chemistry. They were purified in one step by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography; an acetonitrile gradient in a 100 mM triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) was used for elution. Purity was evaluated by electrophoresis of radiolabeled oligonucleotides on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, using [γ-32P]ATP (37.5 MBq/mmol from DuPont NEN). The oligoribonucleotide 35rLa was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (20Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Google Scholar). Radiolabeled mini-exon oligonucleotide 35La or 35rLa (0.1 μM) was incubated with a complementary oligonucleotide (2 μM) for 24 h at 4°C in a 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.0), containing 10 mM magnesium acetate. The samples were then mixed (v/v) with the dye solution (10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and loaded on a 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Overnight migration (4°C) was achieved at 0.75 mA/cm in the above buffer. Complementary oligonucleotides (0.5 μM) were incubated for 14 h at 0°C in a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 30 mM magnesium acetate in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The temperature was then increased at a rate of 0.5°C/min, while the UV absorption was monitored at 260 and 320 nm on a UVIKON 940 spectrophotometer. For chemical footprinting 32P 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated for 14 h at 4°C in a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 30 mM magnesium acetate, either in the absence or in the presence of the desired complementary oligonucleotide, to allow the formation of complexes prior to the addition of 22.8 mg/ml potassium permanganate. At the end of a 30-min incubation at +4°C, samples were ethanol precipitated and dissolved in 1 M piperidine (20 μl). Hydrolysis was performed by 30 min heating at 90°C. Samples were then analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. S1 mapping experiment were carried out in the enzyme buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.7, containing 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM ZnCl2, and 5% glycerol). Oligonucleotides were incubated at 4°C for 4 h in the presence of 200 units of S1 nuclease. After precipitation by ethanol the samples were analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Complexes formed with 35rLa RNA were characterized by digestion with Escherichia coli RNase H. After preincubating 32P-labeled 35rLa (2 nM) with a complementary oligonucleotide (1 μM) at 4°C for 24 h in a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 150 mM sodium chloride, RNase H (0.15 u/μl) was added, and the reaction was allowed for 30 min at 10°C. Samples were then analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. We studied the interaction between a 35-nucleotide-long sequence, corresponding to the mini-exon region of L. amazonensis, which can fold into a hairpin structure, and several complementary oligomers (Fig. 1). The mini-exon oligonucleotide, available either as DNA (35La) or RNA (35rLa) was used as a target for a 29-mer (29DE), whose 5′ end constituted an anchor complementary to the single-stranded part located at the bottom of the stem of the folded mini-exon, leading to a 10-base pair duplex. The sequence of the 3′ part of 29DE was chosen to optimize the formation of a triple helical structure, 15 triplets long. Although the 5′ end of 35La contained 6 pyrimidines, we considered it as the “purine strand” for the putative triple helical complex. We had to accommodate 6 purine-pyrimidine pairs, two G-Cs, and four A-Ts interspersed within pyrimidine-purine pairs. This was achieved by G reading A-T and T reading G-C, which led to the least disturbing triplets A:T*G (21Griffin L.C. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 967-971Google Scholar, 22Mergny J.L. Sun J.S.

This design resulted in parallel orientations of the target purine strand and of the hypothetical third strand of the anti-mini-exon sequence. We also synthesized a control 29-mer (29Cont) with the same 10-nucleotide anchor as 29DE in the 5′ part but a different 3′ sequence, which was chosen to minimize the number of canonical triplets (Fig. 1). We first investigated the binding of oligonucleotides to the 35-mer 35La corresponding to the DNA version of the L. amazonensis mini-exon sequence using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As previously reported (9Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Google Scholar), this oligomer migrates as two bands on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, corresponding to the minor linear form and to the major folded form (Fig. 2a). Upon the addition of the oligonucleotide 29DE, a band of intermediate mobility appears to the expense of the two bands characteristic of 35La. This revealed the formation of a 35La-29DE complex. Neither the oligonucleotides 10Cont, nor 29Cont, which can form 10 base pairs with 35La, gave rise to such a distinct retarded band; no modification of the electrophoretic profile was seen in the presence of 10Cont (not shown), whereas a smear was observed with 29Cont, indicating a weaker association than that of 29DE. Therefore, the binding of the latter oligonucleotide to the target hairpin involves more than 10 Watson-Crick base pairs, suggesting a contribution of the 3′ part of 29DE to the interaction between the two oligomers. As previously reported (9Verspieren P. Loreau N. Thuong N.T. Shire D. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4711-4717Google Scholar), the UV-monitored melting of 35La displayed a cooperative transition related to the unfolding of the hairpin characterized by a Tm value of 48°C under our experimental conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). The addition of a stoechiometric amount of 29DE led to a broad transition, indicative of a loose complex with poorly cooperative interactions (not shown). A similar melting curve was obtained with the control 29-mer. Therefore Tm measurement did not allow to discriminate between the two types of complexes, 35La-29DE and 35La-29Cont. We investigated the structure of the 35La-29DE complex with chemical (KMnO4) or enzymatic probes (S1 nuclease). The complex was labeled either on the target (35La) or on the anti-mini-exon strand (29DE). Footprinting performed with potassium permanganate showed a high reactivity of thymines 9-15 of 29DE in the complex, compared with 29DE alone (Fig. 3a). In contrast, T residues from positions 18-26 were significantly less susceptible to modification. This indicates that the 3′ part of the oligonucleotide 29DE is protected through interaction with the target, whereas the T stretch is highly accessible. This might correspond to a loop structure, as confirmed by S1 mapping. Whereas this nuclease specific for single-stranded nucleic acids gave an all or nothing pattern of cleavage for 29DE alone, this oligonucleotide was specifically cleaved in the region corresponding to nucleotides 12-15 in the presence of 35La, i.e. in the T stretch that was highly reactive to KMnO4 (Fig. 3b). A similar experiment performed with the oligomer 29Cont did not show such a pattern; however, a slightly increased sensitivity of residues located 3′ to the anchor region was observed, indicative of a weak 35La-29Cont complex, in agreement with melting experiments (Fig. 3c). Drastic changes of the KMnO4 reactivity pattern were also observed for 35La upon addition of 29DE (Fig. 4). A reduced sensitivity of the T residues was generally observed in the anchor region; whereas TVI and TVIII were fully protected, TX was still available for the reaction. This latter residue faced the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the anti-mini-exon oligomer 29DE. This means that the 10-base pair duplex was actually formed in the 35La-29DE complex, but despite potential cooperative interaction between the stem structure of 35La and the double-stranded anchor site, the junction was prone to transient opening. The reactivity pattern of T residues located in the stem of 35La was also informative; TXIV was protected, whereas the sensitivity of TXVI was exacerbated (Fig. 4). Assuming that the 3′ part of 29DE constitutes the third strand of a triple-stranded complex, TXVI could be next to the triple strand-double strand junction. A previous study (18Brossalina E. Toulmé J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 796-797Google Scholar) performed with a model sequence, designed to generate a double hairpin complex, has shown hyper-reactivity of the G residue located at the duplex-triplex junction, indicative of a distorted structure. A similar effect was also described for a linear triplex made from three independent strands (25François J.F. Saison-Behmoaras T. Hélène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11431-11440Google Scholar, 26Chomilier J. Sun J.S. Collier D.A. Garestier T. Hélène C. Lavery R. Biophys. Chem. 1992; 45: 143-152Google Scholar). In the present case the junction coinciding with a bulge might potentiate the conformation change. An additional effect could also contribute as discussed below for 10Cont. The oligomer 10Cont, able to form a perfect duplex in the anchor region of 35La, yielded a different pattern of cleavage. As expected, this oligonucleotide protected TVI and TVIII, (slightly less than 29DE), whereas TX pairing with the 5′-terminal A of 10Cont was still reactive (Fig. 4). But TXIV, located in the stem remained accessible, in contrast to what was observed in the presence of 29DE. Surprisingly, TXVI was more reactive in the presence than in the absence of 10Cont, although it is located 6nt away from the 5′ end of the anti-mini-exon oligomer (Fig. 4). This might suggest a conformation change of the target hairpin upon hybridization of the 10-mer, as observed for other complexes involving stem-loop structures (53Brossalina E. Demchenko E. Demchenko Y. Vlassov V. Toulmé J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). S1 mapping of the target also revealed conformational changes upon binding of 29DE. In the absence of any added oligomer, 35La was cleaved by S1 nuclease at TXX, i.e. in the loop, and at TXXVI, which faces the bulge (Fig. 5). Both sites were protected in the presence of 29DE. Interestingly, the addition of 10Cont, which enhanced the reactivity of the bulged T to KMnO4, did not change the S1 sensitivity of the opposite strand at TXXVI. Neither was any change seen at TXX (Fig. 5). Therefore, 35La-29DE complex involves definitely more than the formation of 10 base pairs in the anchor domain. From the footprinting assays whose results are summarized in Scheme 1, it can be described as a double hairpin structure similar to the one reported previously for a model sequence (18Brossalina E. Toulmé J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 796-797Google Scholar); the 5′ end of 29DE is paired with the single-stranded region of 35La located at the bottom of the stem, whereas the 3′ moiety of the anti-mini-exon sequence forms the third strand of a triple-stranded structure, the T residues 11-14 being a connecting loop. Because in the antisense strategy RNA is the physiological target of complementary oligonucleotides, it was of interest to monitor the binding of 29DE to 35rLa, an RNA hairpin homologous to the 35La DNA. We first studied the formation of 35rLa-29DE complex by band shift assay on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The RNA hairpin migrates as two bands, the most prominent one corresponding to the folded form. The oligonucleotide 29DE induced the appearance of two bands, the major one moving between those corresponding to the linear and the folded forms of 35rLa (Fig. 2b). A weak band also appeared above the one corresponding to the linear 35rLa, suggesting the formation of a second type of complex that was not detected with the DNA target. No retarded bands were observed with either 10Cont or 29Cont (not shown). Therefore, as for the DNA target, the interaction between 35rLa and 29DE extends beyond a 10-base pair duplex formed by the 5′ end of 29DE and the complementary region of 35rLa. Ribonuclease H is able to cleave an RNA strand hybridized to a complementary DNA strand, but it is unable to digest RNA involved in a canonical pyrimidine-purine.primidine triple-stranded structure (27Crouch R.J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 771-777Google Scholar, 28Toulmé J.J. Tidd D. Crouch H.R.J. Toulmé J.J. Ribonucleases. John Libbey, Paris1996Google Scholar). 1R. Le Tinévez and J.-J. Toulmé, unpublished observations. We used E. coli RNase H to probe the complexes formed by 35rLa with either 10Cont or 29DE. The 10-mer, which forms a regular double-stranded heteroduplex, induced the cleavage of the RNA hairpin from Cv to Tx, with a marked preferential triad, AVII/TVIII/AIX, at pH 6.0 as well as at pH 7.3 (Fig. 6). In contrast, these cleavage sites were no longer detected in the presence of 29DE at pH 6.0 (Fig. 6b), indicating that the 3′ part of 29DE protected partially 35rLa from RNase H activity. This was likely related to the formation of a triple-stranded structure as raising the pH up to 7.3, conditions which are known to distabilize C:G*C+ triplets, restored the cleavage pattern characteristic of the 35rLa-10Cont double-strand (Fig. 6b). However, three unexpected cleavage sites were observed at pH 6.0 for the 35rLa-29DE complex, the two prominent ones being at CIII and CV (Fig. 6a). Assuming the likely formation of a triple-stranded complex under these conditions, these positions correspond to G:C*T triplets. In DNA triple helices these triplets are known to have a low stability (22Mergny J.L. Sun J.S. Rougée M. Montenay-Garestier T. Barcelo F. Chomilier J. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9791-9798Google Scholar, 23Yoon K. Hobbs C.A. Koch J. Sardaro M. Kutny R. Weis A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3840-3844Google Scholar, 24Best G.C. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1187-1193Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the noncanonical dG:rC*dT triplets adopt a partly open or a distorded structure that is detected by the enzyme. But, very likely the enzyme does not locally displace the third strand because this would have led to a cleavage pattern of the anchor binding site similar to that observed with the 10-mer 10Cont. Therefore, RNase H proved to be a very sensitive probe because the E. coli enzyme was able to recognize a single deoxyribo-ribo (D-R) pair (namely G-C “mismatched” with T) in a nonsubstrate surrounding, i.e. triple-stranded structures. Interestingly, human and bovine RNases HI have been shown to cleave in the vicinity of a single R-D pair comprised in double-stranded DNA (29Huang L. Kim Y. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25922-25927Google Scholar, 30Eder P.S. Walder J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6472-6479Google Scholar). Moreover, as the experiments were performed at 10°C, it means that the nonperfect triplex was stable under these conditions or that the enzyme stabilized it. In any case, RNase H was still able to bind to the complex, despite the presence of the third strand in the major groove. This indicates that the enzyme interacts in the minor groove of the heteroduplex, as usually observed for proteins that do not display sequence specificity. Triple helix formation can be achieved in two different modes termed the pyrimidine motif and the purine motif, depending on the third strand (31Thuong N.T. Hélène C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 666-690Google Scholar). Both are restricted to the recognition of duplexes made of purine in one strand and pyrimidine in the second one, leading to the formation of C:G*C+ and T:A*T triplets for the pyrimidine motif, of C:G*G and T:A*A (or T:A*T) triplets for the purine one. Up to now it was not possible to recognize every double-stranded sequence even though the use of modified nucleic acid bases (32Koh J.S. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1994563103,"We recently reported that the peptide substrate analog Arg-Lys-Arg-Cys-Leu-Arg-Arg-Leu (RKRCLRRL) irreversibly inactivates the protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes α, β, and γ in a dithiothreitol-sensitive manner by an active site-directed mechanism. We hypothesized that the inactivation mechanism entailed covalent complex formation between the PKC isozyme and the inactivator peptide. In this report, N-biotinylated analogs of RKRCLRRL that inactivate Ca2+-dependent PKC activity were designed and tested for their ability to covalently label PKC isozymes. A purified PKC isozyme mixture (α, β, γ, ϵ, ζ) was incubated with the N-biotinylated peptides and then subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for avidin-reactive species. The Ca2+-dependent PKC subfamily members PKC-α, -β, and -γ comigrated at 82 kDa and were distinguished by isozyme-specific immunoprecipitation. N-Biotinyl-RRRCLRRL covalently labeled all of the isozymes examined. When the isozymes were denatured prior to incubation with the N-biotinylated peptides, no labeling was observed. Inactivation of the Ca2+-dependent PKC subfamily by the N-biotinylated peptides was associated with covalent labeling of the 82-kDa PKC subspecies. The concentration dependence curves observed with N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL were similar for inactivation and covalent labeling. The rank order of potency of three N-biotinylated peptides was the same for the inactivation and covalent labeling. Both the inactivation and covalent labeling were dithiothreitol-sensitive, and they were each subject to protection by MgATP and a peptide substrate analog. The covalent label was mapped to the catalytic domain of PKC by limited proteolysis of the modified enzyme. These results provide evidence that the N-biotinylated inactivator peptides are active-site affinity labels of PKC. The inactivator peptides most likely function by S-thiolating the active-site Cys residue conserved in PKC. This is the first report to demonstrate covalent labeling of PKC by a peptide substrate analog.

Phorbol ester tumor promoters are potent and selective activators of PKC isozymes (3Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar). Overexpression of specific PKC isozymes in mammalian cells has been shown to disrupt growth control mechanisms and in some cases to produce a transformed phenotype, either spontaneously or in response to treatment of the cells with phorbol ester tumor promoters (4Housey G.M.

Thus, PKC is implicated as a key enzyme in the pathological process of tumor promotion (8Weinstein I.B. Nishizuka Y. Biology and Medicine of Signal Transduction. Raven Press, New York1990: 307Google Scholar). PKC may also contribute to multiple drug resistance in cancer (9Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). Active-site affinity labels of PKC could be valuable tools in the characterization of active-site residues and topology and in the elucidation of the catalytic mechanism (21Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Google Scholar). Active-site affinity labels of PKC that resemble the peptide substrate may also offer an approach to potent and selective inactivation of PKC isozymes (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar). The PKC family consists of Ca2+-dependent, phorbol ester-activated isozymes (α, β1, β2, γ), Ca2+-independent, phorbol ester-activated isozymes (δ, ϵ, η, Θ, μ), and Ca2+- and phorbol ester-independent isozymes (ζ, λ) (3Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar). PS dependence is universal among PKC isozymes (3Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar). We previously reported that the peptide substrate analog Arg-Lys-Arg-Cys-Leu-Arg-Arg-Leu (RKRCLRRL) irreversibly inactivates the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes α, β, and γ (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). The inactivated complex of PKC and RKRCLRRL was stable to dilution but not to exposure to the reducing thiol DTT (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). Protection against inactivation by substrates and substrate analogs provided evidence that the inactivator peptide was active site-directed (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inactivation mechanism entailed covalent modification of the PKC isozymes at the active site (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that N-biotinylated analogs of the inactivator peptide form covalent complexes with several PKC isozymes. We show that covalent modification of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes by the biotinylated peptides maps to the catalytic domain and is intimately associated with isozyme inactivation. The results provide evidence that N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL and related inactivator peptides are active-site affinity labels of PKC isozymes. The synthetic peptides employed in this study were synthesized using the Vega coupler 250 peptide synthesizer and purified to >98% purity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C4 column and acetonitrile gradient elution at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Synthetic Antigen Facility. Rat brain PKC was purified to near homogeneity according to silver-stained polyacrylamide gels by a previously described method (22O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 355-359Google Scholar, 23O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4278-4282Google Scholar). The histone kinase activity of the purified PKC preparation was stimulated 10-15-fold by 0.2 mM Ca2+ and 30 μg/ml PS but was unaffected by either Ca2+ or PS alone. Immunoblot analysis of the purified PKC isozyme mixture was done using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system as described previously (24Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 425-427Google Scholar) with the isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies anti-PKC-α, anti-PKC-β, anti-PKC-γ, anti-PKC-δ, anti-PKC-ϵ, anti-PKC-ζ, anti-PKC-Θ, anti-PKC-λ, and anti-PKC-μ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and polyclonal anti-PKC-η (Oxford Biochemicals, Oxford, MI). A catalytic domain fragment of PKC was generated from the purified PKC preparation by limited trypsinolysis with a yield of about 50%, as described previously (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar, 22O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 355-359Google Scholar). The catalytic domain fragment of the Ca2+-dependent PKC subfamily was detected by immunoblot analysis with the polyclonal antibody anti-pan-PKC, which recognizes the isozymes α, β, and γ and their catalytic domain fragments (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP, an ECL Western blotting detection system, and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig and donkey anti-rabbit Ig were purchased from Amersham Corp. Frozen rat brains were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Protein assay solution, avidin-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and SDS-PAGE reagents, including molecular weight markers, were obtained from Bio-Rad. Histone III-S, PS, ATP, G-25 Sephadex, DTT, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The Ca2+- and PS-dependent histone kinase activity of PKC was measured as described previously (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar, 22O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 355-359Google Scholar). The histone kinase reaction mixture (120 μl) contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 30 μg/ml PS (or none), 6 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5,000-8,000 cpm/pmol), 0.67 mg/ml histone III-S, and 5 ng of purified PKC. A 10-min histone kinase reaction period at 30°C, which yields linear kinetics (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar, 22O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 355-359Google Scholar), was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated on phosphocellulose paper, and histone phosphorylation was quantitated as described previously (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar, 22O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 355-359Google Scholar). In assays of synthetic peptide substrate phosphorylation, histone was replaced with the peptide substrate at concentrations indicated under “Results.” Using previously described methods, synthetic peptide substrate analogs were tested for their ability to function as DTT-sensitive PKC inactivators (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). In these experiments, β-mercaptoethanol was removed from the purified PKC preparation by gel filtration on a 2-ml G-25 Sephadex column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). To measure the antagonism of the histone kinase reaction of PKC by the synthetic peptide substrate analogs, β-mercaptoethanol-free PKC was preincubated with the indicated synthetic peptide substrate analog for 5 min at 30°C. The preincubation mixture was placed on ice, and then a 10-μl aliquot was added to the histone kinase reaction mixture (total volume, 120 μl). To ascertain the DTT sensitivity of the antagonism of the histone kinase reaction, control assays were done in which 2.0 mM DTT was included in the preincubation mixture. All histone kinase assays were performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean value ± S.D. To detect complexes of PKC isozymes and N-biotinylated inactivator peptides that were stable under denaturing conditions in the absence of reducing thiol, a preincubation mixture of the purified β-mercaptoethanol-free PKC isozyme mixture (25 ng) and the N-biotinylated inactivator peptide under investigation was prepared as described under “Protein Kinase Assay” and boiled for 90 s in β-mercaptoethanol-free SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). The samples were subjected to the procedures and conditions employed in immunoblot analysis of PKC isozymes (24Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 425-427Google Scholar), except that membranes were probed with avidin instead of antibody. Briefly, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and the protein was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating membranes in 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5) at 4°C for 15-18 h. The membrane was probed with avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) at the recommended working dilution of the commercial stock (1:3000) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TTBS) for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed several times with TTBS, and avidin-reactive bands were detected using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by computerized densitometry. To quantitate the 82-kDa PKC subspecies in each lane, blots were stripped by a 30-min incubation at room temperature in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS. Stripped blots were probed with polyclonal anti-pan-PKC (1 μg/ml), which recognizes PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ, using peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:300) as the secondary antibody and previously described methods (24Gravitt K.R. Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 425-427Google Scholar). The 82-kDa PKC subspecies was detected by ECL and quantitated with a computerized densitometer. The β-mercaptoethanol-free purified PKC preparation (25 ng) was incubated with N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL (1 μM) in the absence of DTT, as described above. Complexes of the peptide and PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ were immunoprecipitated from the isozyme mixture with isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies by previously described methods (9Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar, 10Gupta K.P. Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. Bergman P.J. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2102-2111Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-PKC-α (Transduction Laboratories), anti-PKC-β, or anti-PKC-γ (Seikagaku, Inc., Ijamsville, MD) by rotation for 2 h at 4°C. This was followed by further incubation in the presence of 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG by rotation for 30 min at 4°C. Next, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to the incubation mixture followed by rotation for 30 min at 4°C. The suspension was subjected three times successively to a 5-min spin in a microcentrifuge followed by washing of the Sepharose pellet. The wash buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, and 0.2 mM PMSF. Immune complexes were recovered from the beads by suspension of the pellet in 100 μl of 2 ×β-mercaptoethanol-free SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and avidin-reactive bands were detected by ECL, as described above. We previously demonstrated that the synthetic peptide substrate analog RKRCLRRL is a DTT-sensitive irreversible inactivator of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). The Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC subfamily members α, β, and γ were similarly susceptible to inactivation by RKRCLRRL (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). Based on our results, we hypothesized that the inactivation mechanism most likely involved formation of a disulfide linkage between the inactivator peptide and an active-site Cys residue of PKC (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to evaluate the sequence RKRCLRRL as a basis for the design of N-biotinylated active-site affinity labels of PKC isozymes. The first objective was to optimize the sequence for DTT-sensitive inactivation of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC subfamily. We previously reported that RKRCLRRL analogs that lacked a single basic residue were weak or inactive against Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC activity, indicating the importance of the basic residues in the inactivation potency (20Ward N.E. Gravitt K.R. O'Brian C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8056-8060Google Scholar). With this in mind, we synthesized RKRCLRRL analogs in which substitutions of Arg → Lys or Lys → Arg were made, or the positions of basic residues were changed. The RKRCLRRL analogs investigated for their ability to function as DTT-sensitive inactivators of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC were RRRCLRRL, KKKCLKKL, RKRCRRLL, and RRKCRRLL. The purified PKC preparation that we employed in these studies is a mixture of isozymes. Fig. 1 shows the results of immunoblot analysis of the PKC preparation with isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies. The PKC preparation contained PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ, which co-migrated at 82 kDa, and PKC-ϵ and PKC-ζ, which migrated at 90 and 73 kDa, respectively. The preparation did not contain detectable levels of PKC-δ, PKC-Θ, PKC-μ, PKC-η or PKC-λ (data not shown). Thus, the preparation contained at least one representative of each of the three PKC subfamilies. The Ca2+- dependent PKC subfamily members α, β, and γ have equivalent Km(app) values for histone III-S (25Burns D.J. Bloomenthal J. Lee M.-H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12044-12051Google Scholar). The histone kinase activity of the PKC preparation was stimulated by Ca2+ and PS by 10-15-fold and served as a sensitive assay of catalysis by the Ca2+-dependent PKC subfamily. Fig. 2A shows the concentration dependence of inactivation of the Ca2+ and PS-dependent histone kinase activity of PKC by the RKRCLRRL analogs. Peptides were preincubated with PKC in the absence of reducing thiol at the peptide concentration shown for 5 min at 30°C followed by 12-fold dilution of the preincubation mixtures into histone kinase assay mixtures, as described under “Materials and Methods.” None of the peptides inhibited the histone kinase activity when 2.0 mM DTT was included in the preincubation mixture (data not shown). RKRCLRRL (•), which is the Cys peptide analog that corresponds to the natural PKC substrate recognition sequence in the EGF receptor (-RKRTLRRL-) (26Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Google Scholar), was the most potent DTT-sensitive PKC inactivator of the peptides examined, but substantial inactivation of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC (30-50%) was also achieved by each of the other Arg-containing peptides at concentrations of ≤10 μM. In contrast, KKKCLKKL (▴) was inactive across the concentration range tested (Fig. 2A). Ideally, an active-site affinity label should resemble the substrate as closely as possible to optimally exploit the substrate selectivity of the enzyme. Because the objective of this study was to identify potential sequences for active-site affinity labels of PKC isozymes, it was important to determine whether inactivator peptide analogs containing Cys → Thr substitutions could serve as substrates. Fig. 2B shows that, of the five Cys peptides under investigation, only two corresponded to Thr analogs that served as substrates of the PKC preparation. RKRTLRRL (•), which is a known synthetic peptide substrate of PKC (Km(app) = 20 μM) (19Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Google Scholar) and RRRTLRRL (▪) were phosphorylated by the PKC preparation in a Ca2+- and PS-dependent manner. Stimulation of the phosphorylation of the peptides by Ca2+ and PS was 3.0-4.0-fold. Based on these results, we focused our investigation on the inactivator peptide sequences RKRCLRRL and RRRCLRRL, and we included the sequence KKKCLKKL in our study as a negative control. As an approach to allow detection of covalent complex formation between PKC isozymes and inactivating peptide substrate analogs, N-biotinylated peptides were prepared. We first determined the ability of N-biotinyl-RKRTLRRL, N-biotinyl-RRRTLRRL, and N-biotinyl-KKKTLKKL to serve as PKC substrates. N-biotinyl-RRRTLRRL (Km(app) = 4.7 ± 0.3 μM, Vmax = 9.0 ± 0.1 nmol/min/μg) and N-biotinyl-RKRTLRRL (Km(app) = 6.6 ± 1.0 μM, Vmax = 9.0 ± 0.4 nmol/min/μg) were both excellent substrates of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC, and N-biotinyl-KKKTLKKL (Km(app) = 82 ± 4 μM, Vmax = 10.2 ± 0.5 nmol/min/μg) was an order of magnitude weaker as a substrate, based on a comparison of Vmax/Km values. Stimulation of phosphorylation of the N-biotinylated peptides by Ca2+ and PS ranged from 3.0- to 4.0-fold. Having ascertained that the N-biotinylated peptides were recognized as substrates by the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC subfamily, we next prepared N-biotinylated analogs of the peptides RKRCLRRL, RRRCLRRL, and KKKCLKKL and determined their inactivation potencies against the histone kinase activity of PKC. Fig. 3 compares the concentration dependence of the N-biotinylated peptides with RKRCLRRL (▴) in the DTT-sensitive inactivation of Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC. None of the N-biotinylated peptide substrate analogs inhibited the histone kinase activity of PKC when PKC-peptide preincubation mixtures contained 2.0 mM DTT (data not shown). In the absence of DTT, N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL (♦) was the most potent PKC inactivator of the peptides examined, achieving 54 ± 3% inactivation at a concentration of 0.5 μM (Fig. 3). Both Arg-containing N-biotinylated peptides under investigation, N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL (♦) and N-biotinyl-RKRCLRRL (▵), effected potent inactivation (>75%) at concentrations of ≤ 5 μM (Fig. 3). In contrast, N-biotinyl-KKKCLKKL (▪), like its nonbiotinylated counterpart, was by comparison a very weak PKC inactivator (Fig. 3). This underscores the importance of Arg residues in the potency of the RKRCLRRL inactivator peptide series against Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC. These results show that the sequences N-biotinyl-RKRXLRRL and N-biotinyl-RRRXLRRL are comparably effective in producing excellent substrates (X representing T) and DTT-sensitive inactivators (X representing C) of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC subfamily and that the substrate and inactivator peptides corresponding to the sequence N-biotinyl-KKKXLKKL are relatively weak. To determine whether the N-biotinylated inactivator peptides formed covalent complexes with PKC isozymes, the PKC preparation was preincubated with the N-biotinylated peptides under the conditions employed in the inactivation experiment (Fig. 3), and an aliquot of the preincubation mixture was boiled in β-mercaptoethanol-free SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and avidin was employed for the detection of biotinylated species (27Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Google Scholar, 28Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 14-45Google Scholar), as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4A. Biotinylated species were detected at molecular masses corresponding to the PKC isozymes in the preparation (73, 82, and 90 kDa) in PKC samples that contained 1 μM N-biotinyl-RKRCLRRL (lane 5) and 1 μM N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL (lane 6) and to a lesser extent in the PKC sample containing the relatively weak PKC inactivator N-biotinyl-KKKCLKKL (1 μM) (lane 7). The 90- and 73-kDa bands are adjacent to the 82-kDa band, which is indicated by an arrow. Because the sample employed was a highly purified PKC isozyme mixture, the two relatively weak, lower molecular mass bands evident in lanes 5 and 6 at 62 and 66 kDa most likely represent copurifying proteolytic fragments of PKC isozymes. No bands were detected in PKC samples containing nonbiotinylated peptides (lanes 2-4) or PKC alone (lane 1). To determine whether there were differences in the amount of PKC per lane as a result of loading errors, we stripped the filter corresponding to the upper panel of Fig. 4A and subjected it to immunoblot analysis with anti-pan-PKC, which recognizes PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ (29Hagiwara M. Hachiya T. Watanabe M. Usuda N. Iida F. Tamai K. Hidaka H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5515-5519Google Scholar), i.e. the 82-kDa PKC subspecies. We detected similar amounts of the PKC subspecies, which migrated at 82 kDa, in each lane (Fig. 4A, lower panel). When blots were stripped and probed with anti-PKC-ϵ and anti-PKC-ζ subsequent to the detection of avidin-reactive species at 90, 82, and 73 kDa, 90- and 73-kDa bands were detected by anti-PKC-ϵ and anti-PKC-ζ, respectively (data not shown). These results show that the N-biotinylated inactivator peptides form complexes that are stable to denaturation with PKC-ϵ (90 kDa), PKC-ζ (73 kDa), and at least a subset of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes (α, β, γ) (82 kDa), i.e. with isozymes from each of the PKC subfamilies. The >90% inactivation of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent histone kinase activity of the PKC preparation achieved by both N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL and N-biotinyl-RKRCLRRL (Fig. 3) suggested that the inactivator peptides complex with each of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes in the preparation (α, β, γ). To determine whether this was the case, we complexed the PKC preparation with 1 μM N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL as described above and used isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies to immunoprecipitate PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ from the isozyme mixture (see “Materials and Methods”). Each immune complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed for avidin-reactive species. Fig. 4B shows that immunoprecipitated PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ each produced an 82-kDa avidin-reactive species, indicating that each of the Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC isozymes forms a complex with N-biotinyl-RRRCLRRL that is stable to denaturation. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the N-biotinylated inactivator peptides form complexes with PKC isozymes (α, β, γ, ϵ, ζ) that are stable to denaturing conditions. To test whether comple"
https://openalex.org/W1995599471,"Pyridoxal phosphate modification of adenovirus DNA polymerase results in loss of DNA polymerase activity, whereas the 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity is unaffected. Inhibition by pyridoxal phosphate is time-dependent, displays saturation kinetics, and is reversible in the presence of excess primary amine unless the pyridoxal phosphate-enzyme adduct is first reduced with NaBH4. Thus, inhibition is the consequence of Schiff base formation between the aldehyde moiety of pyridoxal phosphate and primary amino groups on the enzyme. In addition to inhibiting DNA polymerase activity, pyridoxal phosphate also inhibited the ability of the enzyme to initiate viral DNA replication, by transfer of dCMP onto the preterminal protein. Neither template-primer nor dNTP protect against pyridoxal phosphate inhibition, but the combination of template-primer and complementary substrate dNTP protected both initiation and DNA polymerase activities. Thus, it is likely that both the dCMP transfer activity required for initiation and DNA polymerase activity are carried out at the same site of the enzyme."

In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, NAD(P)H-nitrite reductase (EC) is an α2-type homodimer of Mr 290,000, which utilizes either NADPH or NADH as electron donor and possesses two iron-sulfur (Fe4S4) clusters, two siroheme cofactor groups, and two FAD molecules (5Lafferty M.A. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7555-7567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Prodouz K.N. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9711-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme requires three equivalents of NADH or NADPH to pass six electrons to the substrate nitrite, converting it to ammonia. Besides this native enzyme activity, N. crassa nitrite reductase catalyzes in vitro partial activities, which include an FAD-dependent NAD(P)H-cytochrome c reductase activity, and dithionite (S2O2−4)-nitrite reductase activity (5Lafferty M.A. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7555-7567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Prodouz K.N. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9711-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vega J.M.

The NAD(P)H-cytochrome c reductase activity appears to short cut the (Fe4S4)-siroheme-containing portion of the enzyme, while the dithionite-nitrite reductase activity bypasses the requirement for NAD(P)H and FAD. The electron flow within the enzyme complex has been deduced primarily through inhibition studies on the various activities of the enzyme (5Lafferty M.A. Garrett R.H. J. Biol.

Dithionite S2O42−↘3NAD(P)H→(−SH),FAD→Fe4S4→ siroheme →NO2− Cytochrome c↘SCHEME1 Deduced amino acid sequence data suggest that functional domains of fungal nitrite reductases as well as Escherichia coli NADH-nitrite reductase are laid out in a linear fashion along the polypeptide chain, beginning with the FAD- and NAD(P)H-dependent functions at the N-terminal end and ending with the nitrite-reducing functions at the C terminus (9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similarly, the functional domains of nitrate reductases from fungi and plants are laid down in a linear fashion along the protein, but in reverse order (9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the case of nitrate reductases, the domains are well defined. Hinge regions bridge the domains within the protein, as supported by the fact that proteolytic degradation of nitrate reductases yields polypeptide fragments with partial enzyme activities (2Crawford N.M. Campbell W.H. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 829-835Crossref Google Scholar, 9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, the domain structures of nitrite reductase are not well defined, and no hinge regions bridging putative domains have been identified through proteolysis (2Crawford N.M. Campbell W.H.

(10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported the nucleotide sequence of the nit-6 gene and the deduced amino acid sequence of the nit-6 product (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, putative functional domains and amino acid residues within the N. crassa NAD(P)H-nitrite reductase polypeptide were identified based on sequence conservation between the N. crassa nitrite reductase and the nitrite reductases from Aspergillus nidulans (a related ascomycete) and E. coli (9Campbell W.H.

Nicolson R. Cole J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two putative functional domains were identified within the N. crassa nitrite reductase: an FAD-/NAD-binding domain in the N-terminal portion and an (Fe4S4)-siroheme-binding domain in the C-terminal part of the polypeptide (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A conserved feature found within the FAD-/NAD-binding domain is a Cys residue at position 331 of N. crassa nitrite reductase (9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Cys residue is found within an 8-residue sequence, YAIGECAS, perfectly conserved in all three nitrite reductases mentioned above (9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Based on this conservation, this Cys residue has been postulated to be essential for enzyme function and NADH binding, in analogy with an essential Cys in nitrate reductase (9Campbell W.H. Kinghorn J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 315-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative (Fe4S4)-siroheme-binding domain is located in the C-terminal half of the N. crassa nitrite reductase polypeptide (residues 715-763 (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This domain was identified based on the presence of two conserved motifs, each of which includes a pair of cysteine residues (13Crane B.R Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Kinghorn J.R. Campbell E.I. Wray J.L. Kinghorn J.R. Molecular and Genetic Aspects of Nitrate Assimilation.

The sequences of nitrite reductases from E. coli, N. crassa, and A. nidulans have a conserved serine 2 residues away from the C-terminal cysteine motif (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xn−C−XXXXSX−C−Xn−S−X−C−XnSCHEME2 Other enzymes utilizing an (Fe4S4)-siroheme cluster, including nitrite reductase from spinach (16Back E. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Privalle L. Rothstein S. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all possess a Ser or Thr at the analogous position. The conservation of the amino acid side chain at this position led Exley et al. to speculate that this residue (Ser-755 in the N. crassa nitrite reductase) might be important to the functional integrity of the (Fe4S4)-siroheme cluster (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, an expression system in E. coli capable of yielding high levels of functional NAD(P)H-nitrite reductase is described. The results of a dissection of nit-6 gene segments encoding functional domains within N. crassa nitrite reductase are reported. Effects on native and partial enzyme activities due to the alteration of amino acid residues Cys-331, Ser-755, and/or Cys-757 through site-directed mutagenesis are also presented. N. crassa wild-type strain 74-OR23-1 A (stock number 987, Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Department of Microbiology, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS) was utilized in preparing mycelial cell-free extracts for controls in nitrite reductase enzymatic assays and immunoblotting studies. Cultures of mycelia were grown aerobically in 1 × Vogel's medium (20Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar) plus 3% sucrose at 30°C, with the modification that NH4NO3 was omitted. Instead, different nitrogen sources were added to the medium depending on the type of nitrogen nutrition desired. Mycelia routinely were grown for 18-24 h from conidial inocula in medium containing 20 mM glutamine and then harvested by filtration, washed with distilled water, and transferred into media containing either glutamine or sodium nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Mycelia were cultured for 6 h in media containing 20 mM NaNO3 to induce nitrate assimilation or 20 mM glutamine to repress it. Harvested mycelia were washed in distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Frozen pads of mycelia were homogenized on ice in 7-ml Ten Broeck homogenizers in approximately 4 volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 μM FAD; just before use, fresh dry cysteine was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, and dry phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml). The homogenates were immediately centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 0-4°C. Supernatants were decanted into fresh tubes and assayed for NADPH-nitrite reductase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and dithionite-nitrite reductase activity. E. coli strains and protein expression vectors used in this study are shown in Table I. E. coli colonies grown with appropriate antibiotic selection were picked from Luria broth (LB) 1The abbreviations used are: LBLuria brothIPTGisopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s). plates and used to inoculate overnight cultures grown at 37°C in LB containing the appropriate antibiotic. These cultures were grown to stationary phase and used to inoculate the liquid medium sustaining growth during heterologous protein expression (by inoculating fresh medium with (null)/1;250 volume of stationary culture). Minimal medium was prepared by making a 20 × salt solution containing 210 g of dibasic potassium phosphate, 90 g of monobasic potassium phosphate, and 20 g of ammonium sulfate per liter. This solution was diluted to give a final volume of 1 × after adding 0.25 ml of trace metal solution (20Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar) per liter and then sterilized. After cooling, the solution received 25 ml of a sterile 20% solution of glucose per liter (final volume) and 2 ml of 1 M magnesium sulfate per liter (final volume). The appropriate antibiotics were then added, followed by inoculation with the stationary culture. Luria broth isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s). Aerobic E. coli cultures were grown in 500 ml to 1 liter of medium in 2-liter shaker flasks at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick series 25 shaker incubator. Room temperature during aerobic growth was consistently 27 ± 1°C. Aerobic cultures were induced for protein expression when the cultures reached an A550 of 0.3-0.5 by adding isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.8 mM. For anaerobic growth, E. coli cells were propagated in large culture volumes of 8-10 liters in a New Brunswick Microferm fermentor. The air intake valve of the fermentor was attached to a tank of pure nitrogen. Medium was flushed with N2 for 1 min while mixing at 300 rpm, both prior to and after inoculating the media with starter culture and after adding IPTG. Room temperature during anaerobic growth was consistently at 22 ± 1°C. Induction of anaerobic cultures was carried out when the cultures reached an A550 of 0.1-0.2 (typically after 24 h of growth on minimal medium at room temperature) by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.8 mM. Maximal levels of NADPH-nitrite reductase were found in cells grown anaerobically in minimal medium, 15 h following IPTG induction. Therefore, these conditions were used for routine protein expression. E. coli cultures grown under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 15 min. The cell pellets were resuspended and washed in 0.5 times the original culture volume with 0.9% NaCl. The cells were again collected by centrifugation, and drained cell pellets were stored at −70°C. Frozen cell paste was thawed on ice, mixed with approximately 4-10 volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer, and sonicated at 70 mA for 50 s (Branson sonifier, Branson Sonic Power Co.) in ice-jacketed 50-ml stainless steel beakers. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were decanted into fresh tubes on ice and immediately assayed for NADPH-nitrite reductase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, and dithionite-nitrite reductase activities. NADPH-nitrite reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the nitrite-dependent oxidation of NADPH (6Prodouz K.N. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9711-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of cytochrome c, as described previously by Vega (7Vega J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 109: 237-242Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Dithionite-nitrite reductase activity was measured by following nitrite disappearance, essentially as described by Lafferty and Garrett (5Lafferty M.A. Garrett R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7555-7567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each cell-free extract was determined using the Protein Dye Concentrate system from Bio-Rad. Plasmid DNA was propagated in E. coli strain DH5α or JM109 with the appropriate antibiotic selection overnight. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified as described by Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by using DNA purification columns (Quiagen). DNA restriction fragments were purified from low melt gels using the GeneClean kit from Bio 101. Standard techniques were used in DNA subcloning (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (22Clackson T. Gussow D. Jones P.T. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 187-214Google Scholar) was used in constructing a full-length nit-6 cDNA (Fig. 1). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from nitrate-induced N. crassa wild-type mycelia as described previously (10Exley G.E. Colandene J.D. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three separate reverse transcription reactions were performed using three different oligomer primers designed to hybridize to nit-6 mRNA in the poly(A)+ RNA fraction. One μg of poly(A)+ RNA was combined with 10 pmol of primer (16 nucleotides in length) designed to hybridize downstream of introns 1 and 2, intron 3, and at the 3′ end of the nit-6 transcript. Reverse transcription reactions were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Upon completion of the reaction, 2 units of RNase H and 9 units of RNase T1 were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. This reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was then dissolved in 500 μl of TE (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). A 10-μl aliquot from each first-strand cDNA reaction was used as template for PCR to produce and amplify double-stranded DNA. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to hybridize adjacent to existing restriction sites in order to facilitate ligations and cloning (Fig. 1). Primers hybridizing to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the nit-6 cDNA were designed to introduce restriction sites (NdeI and BamHI) for subcloning into the expression vector pET11a. Each PCR reaction contained a 10-μl aliquot of first-strand cDNA diluted in TE, 60 pmol of primer, 100 μM dNTPs, in a total volume of 100 μl of 1× Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene). 1 unit of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was added, and then the reaction was covered with mineral oil and placed in a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler. Conditions were programmed to heat the solution to 95°C for 5 min and then to cycle it to 60°C for 1 min, 74°C for 1.5 min, and then 95°C for 1 min (for a total of 35 cycles), followed by a final incubation at 74°C for 10 min. The reactions were chloroform-extracted, and the amplified DNA was ethanol-precipitated. After washing in 70% ethanol and drying, the DNA was cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzymes using the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The DNA was then fractionated by gel electrophoresis on 2% low melt agarose gels, and the appropriate size band was excised and purified. The three restricted PCR products isolated consisted of a 0.83-kb SalI/NspV fragment, a 0.28-kb SunI/AatII fragment, and a 0.14-kb NheI/BamHI fragment. These fragments were ligated together with equimolar amounts of a 1.05-kb AatII/NheI restriction fragment from the nit-6 cDNA (pNiR-3), a 1.3-kb NspV/SunI restriction fragment of the nit-6 genomic clone (pnit-61), and the 3-kb vector pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) cleaved with SalI/BamHI. Restriction fragment analysis was used to identify a full-length nit-6 cDNA. Dideoxy sequencing was carried out over the PCR-derived portions and ligation boundaries to ensure no mutations had occurred. The resulting clone was designated pnit6.5, and the insert was named nit6.5. The full-length nit-6 cDNA (nit6.5) was subcloned as a single fragment from pnit6.5 into expression vector pET11a via NdeI/BamHI cleavage, yielding plasmid pETnit6.5. In this construct, the ATG translational start codon of nitrite reductase falls within the NdeI site, and the stop codon lies upstream from the BamHI site. Standard reaction conditions were used for PCR amplification of cloned DNA (22Clackson T. Gussow D. Jones P.T. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 187-214Google Scholar). These techniques were routinely used to alter flanking sequences and introduce novel restriction sites to facilitate subcloning or otherwise manipulate DNA. DNA containing the E. coli cysG gene was amplified by PCR from plasmid pRSM10 kindly provided by Nicholas Kredich of Duke University Medical Center (23Wu J.-Y. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using two oligomeric primers flanking the gene. One primer was designed to hybridize upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the cysG gene. This primer introduced a BamHI site. The other primer hybridized just downstream of the 3′ end of the gene. This primer introduced a SalI site and BamHI site. The resulting 1.8-kb product was cleaved with BamHI and isolated from a 1% low melt agarose gel following gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated into the BamHI site downstream of the nit6.5 insert in pETnit6.5 (Fig. 2). Restriction analysis was used to identify clones containing the cysG gene in the same orientation as the nit-6 cDNA. The resulting plasmid was designated pETnit6.5cysG, and the insert was named nit6.5cysG. The nit6.5cysG insert was also subcloned into vector pTRC99A for expression in E. coli strain JCB3878, a nirB− (deletion) strain lacking the gene encoding the E. coli NADH-nitrite reductase. Strain JCB3878 was kindly provided by Jeffrey Cole of the University of Birmingham (United Kingdom). Cloning into vector pTRC99A required a new restriction site at the 5′ end of nit6.5cysG in order to ligate the insert in the proper orientation and reading frame for protein expression. Using a primer designed to introduce an NcoI site that hybridized to the 5′ end of the nit-6 cDNA and a primer designed to hybridize downstream of the NspV site in the nit-6 cDNA, PCR was performed to amplify the intervening DNA between these sites within nit6.5cysG, creating an 0.84-kb fragment with an NcoI site at the 5′ end. After chloroform extraction of the reaction mixture, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated, dried, and dissolved in TE. The DNA was then digested with NcoI, followed by digestion with NspV. The digested DNA was fractionated by gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% low melt agarose gel, followed by excision and purification. The NcoI/NspV fragment was ligated together with an NspV/SalI fragment of pETnit6.5cysG (containing a 2.76-kb portion of the nit-6 cDNA and the entire cysG gene) into expression vector pTRC99A cleaved with NcoI and SalI. The resulting plasmid was designated pTRCnit6.5cysG. Partial constructs of the nit-6 cDNA were made in conjunction with restriction digest products of a single PCR reaction. Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized. One primer hybridized 0.38 kb downstream of the EclXI site within nit6.5. This primer was designed to introduce an early stop codon and BamHI site within the cDNA. Another primer was designed to introduce an NdeI site and translational start site about 80 nucleotides upstream of the EclXI site. The intervening sequence between the primers was amplified using PCR. The reaction mixture was chloroform-extracted, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in TE. Half of the product was digested with EclXI and BamHI. The other half was digested with EclXI and NdeI. The EclXI/BamHI-digested DNA was ligated to a 4.12-kb fragment of pETnit6.5 cleaved with EclXI and BamHI (this effectively removed more than half of the nit-6 cDNA at its 3′ end). The resulting plasmid was designated pET5N, for 5′ (N-terminal) construct. The NdeI/EclXI-digested PCR product was ligated to the 5.48-kb fragment of pETnit6.5 digested with NdeI and EclXI (thereby removing about 1.12 kb of DNA at the 5′ end of the nit-6 cDNA), producing the plasmid designated pET3C, for 3′ (C-terminal) construct. Fig. 2 displays a restriction map of the cDNA constructs. The sites shown are restriction sites exploited in DNA manipulations and subcloning. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the Altered Sites kit from Promega. The full-length nit-6 cDNA (nit6.5) was ligated into the vector pALTER-1 (supplied with the kit) via the BamHI and SalI site introduced at the ends of the cDNA during its construction (Fig. 1). Mutagenic DNA oligomeric primers were synthesized and purified, as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The design of these oligonucleotides is shown in Fig. 5. A 0.1-pmol aliquot of oligonucleotide was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, as recommended by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Mutagenesis was carried out as described in the Altered Sites manual. Mutagenized plasmid DNA was analyzed by direct nucleotide sequence determination or, where applicable, by restriction endonuclease analysis (see Fig. 5), followed by direct nucleotide sequence determination of the DNA in the region of the mutation. The DNA mutated within the region encoding the FAD-/NAD-binding domain of nitrite reductase was transferred to plasmid pTRCnit6.5cysG as a 0.3-kb fragment. This fragment was isolated by cleaving the DNA with restriction endon"
