https://openalex.org/W2049662429,The progressive constriction of the Mississippi for navigation since 1837 has caused bottom erosion in some stretches. In others the bottom oscillates up and down with time. The high stages rise much more rapidly. Constriction of the river channel causes flooding and makes floods higher; thus navigation works degrade the protection afforded by levees. The combination of navigation works and levees causes significant rises in the stages of floods. Additional channel constriction and levee building will cause further problems. The 1973 flood's record was man-made.

https://openalex.org/W2014312136,"So far as the presence of visible yellow pigment is concerned, there are two groups of domestic fowls. In the first group, represented by the Orpington breed, yellow is constantly absent from legs, beak and body fat. In the second group, represented by tthe Leghorns and the socalled American breeds, such as the Plymouth Rocks, Wyandottes and Rhode Island Reds, yellow, in the form of yellow fat,2 is present in varying amounts in the parts mentioned. In this latter group, individual birds may undergo considerable change in the amount of the yellow pigment visible. The standard of the show-room, however, demands yellow in the legs and beak in these breeds and, in consequence, birds that. have become pale in these parts are liable to be scored down by the professional poultry judge. The paling or yellowing of the legs in the breeds mentioned has been attributed by poultrymen to various environmental factors. Thus, good health and vitality, abundance of range and exercise, proper food such as meat, corn, gluten meal and  green food  are said to increase the amount of yellow pigment, while poor health, mounlting, confinement. with insufficient exercise, running on sandy soil and in mud, as well as climate and the mere aging of the bird, are held to be responsible for the paling of the legs in these varieties. Of recent years, some individual poultrymen have claimed that paling of the legs is due to heavy laying. This view has been maintained by J. E. Rice.3 Mr. Tom Barron,4 one of the most successful of the English poultrymen, in an address before the Connecticut Poultry"
