We have cloned, sequenced, and mapped a human gene homologous to TfR, termed TfR2. Two transcripts were expressed from this gene: α (∼2.9 kilobase pairs), and β (∼2.5 kilobase pairs). The predicted amino acid sequence revealed that the TfR2-α protein was a type II membrane protein and shared a 45% identity and 66% similarity in its extracellular domain with TfR. The TfR2-β protein lacked the amino-terminal portion of the TfR2-α protein including the putative transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the α transcript was predominantly expressed in the liver. In addition, high expression occurred in K562, an erythromegakaryocytic cell line. To analyze the function of TfR2, Chinese hamster ovary TfR-deficient cells (CHO-TRVb cells) were stably transfected with FLAG-tagged TfR2-α. These cells showed an increase in biotinylated Tf binding to the cell surface, which was competed by nonlabeled Tf, but not by lactoferrin. Also, these cells had a marked increase in Tf-bound 55Fe uptake. Taken together, TfR2-α may be a second transferrin receptor that can mediate cellular iron transport.

Iron is essential in a wide variety of cellular processes including oxidative phosphorylation and DNA synthesis. Our knowledge concerning cellular iron transport has been markedly advanced by the recent discoveries of several genes such as HFE, associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (1Feder J.N. Gnirke A.

One of the well-studied key molecules involved in iron uptake is transferrin receptor (TfR) 1The abbreviations used are: TfR, transferrin receptor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Tf, transferrin; Lf, lactoferrin; PSMA, prostate-specific membrane antigen; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IRP, iron regulatory protein; kb, kilobase pair(s) (reviewed in Refs. 4Richardson D.R.

On the cell membrane, the TfR homodimer binds to two diferric transferrin (Tf) molecules, resulting in internalization of the complex. In the endosome, iron is released from Tf in a pH-dependent manner and is transported into the cytosol by DMT1/Nramp2 (6Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The iron is utilized as a cofactor by heme, aconitase, cytochromes (reviewed in Ref. 7Lash A. Saleem A. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 25: 20-30PubMed Google Scholar), and ribonucleotide reductase (8Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Larsen I.K. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), or it may be stored in ferritin molecules. The affinity of diferric Tf to TfR is modulated by HFE (9Feder J.N. Penny D.M.

Although TfR-mediated endocytosis is the major pathway for cellular iron uptake, cells can also obtain iron through TfR-independent pathways from iron-bound Tf or from inorganic irons (10Trinder D.

These processes are thought to be through fluid-phase endocytosis, passive perfusion, or other membrane-based transport systems, and no other receptor for Tf has been reported to date. In this study, we describe the cloning of a new TfR-like family member, TfR2, which may mediate the cellular uptake of iron via a new pathway. ML-1, NB4, Kasumi 3 (myeloid leukemia), and both CHO-TRVb (TfR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary) and TRVb-1 (humanTfR stably transfected TRVb) cells were kindly provided by Drs. J. Minowada (14Fukuda M. Koeffler H.P. Minowada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), M. Lanotte (15Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), respectively. All of the other cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of a normal volunteer by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) gradient at 400 × g for 30 min. Informed consent was obtained from the individual. Complementary DNA libraries were constructed from TF-1 (erythroid leukemia) and HL60 (myeloid leukemia) cells using a commercial kit (Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and used for 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions to obtain a full-length cDNA clone. Primers A (Fig.1 B) and B (5′-CAGTTGCATCATCAGGCCTTCC-3′) were used for 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively. The products of RACE reactions were subcloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). We isolated two transcripts of 2.9 kb (α transcript) and 2.5 kb (β transcript) from the TF-1 and HL60 cDNA libraries, respectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from a human genomic library (Lambda FIX II Library; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a 2.2-kb fragment of the 3′-end of the TfR2cDNA as a probe (shown asProbe-1 in Fig. 1 A). After restriction enzyme mapping, a 3.85-kb fragment that included exons 4–6 was subcloned into the pBluescript II(+) plasmid (Stratagene). Complementary and genomic DNA sequences were determined using an ABI Prism 373 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid Panel, RH02 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was used to determine the chromosomal location of the TfR2gene as described previously (18Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). Primers A and C (Fig. 1 B) amplified a 178-base pair fragment located in exon 4. The polymerase chain reaction products were electrophoresed, Southern blotted, and hybridized with a32P-labeled probe of TfR2. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses were performed as described previously (18Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). Human tissue Northern blot membranes and cDNAs were purchased from OriGene (Rockville, MD). For Northern blot analysis, two TfR2cDNA fragments (Probe-1 and Probe-2shown in Fig. 1 A), a human β-actin cDNA fragment (OriGene), and an approximately 300-base pair TfR cDNA fragment were used as probes. For RT-PCR, the α form-specific primers (primers A and D) and the β form-specific primers (primers C and E) were used (Fig. 1 B). Conditions for amplification were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified in a separate reaction using primers, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ for 27 cycles. CHO-TRVb cells were maintained in F12-nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. An amino-terminal FLAG-tagged TfR2-α cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This plasmid (10 μg) was transfected into CHO-TRVb cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient expression, cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection. We also isolated a stably expressed clone using G418 (200 μg/ml) selection and a standard limiting dilution method. The protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG (M5) antibody (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Chumakov A.M. Grillier I. Chumakova E. Chih D. Slater J. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 105 cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml biotinylated human holo-Tf (Sigma) in 500 μl of minimum Eagle's medium α (Life Technologies, Inc.) in either the presence or absence of nonlabeled human holo-Tf (Sigma) or human lactoferrin (Lf) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 30 min on ice. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (DAKO). The cells were washed twice and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. 55Fe-Tf was prepared by the method described previously (20Eriksson L.C. Torndal U. Andersson G.N. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that we used 0.4 mCi of 55FeCl3 (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) instead of 0.1 mCi of 59FeCl3. A specific activity of 27,000 cpm/μg was obtained. Cells were incubated with 55Fe-Tf in minimum Eagle's medium α in either the presence or absence of a 200-fold excess of nonlabeled holo-Tf at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed with 0.1 nNaOH, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. During 5′-RACE, while attempting to isolate genes encoding new transcriptional factors, we serendipitously cloned an 831-base pair human cDNA fragment that had significant amino acid homology to the middle portion of the TfR protein from the TF-1 cDNA library. We obtained an approximately 2.9-kb cDNA sequence for TfR2from this library (α form; GenBankTMaccession number AF067864). A cDNA clone encompassing the putative full-length coding sequence was created by polymerase chain reaction using 5′ and 3′ gene-specific primers. When we used a HL60 cDNA library for cloning TfR2, the 5′-RACE products were shorter than those from the TF-1 library, and the sequences around the 5′-end were different (β form; Fig.1 B). According to the radiation hybrid panel analysis, TfR2mapped on chromosome 7q22, between the D7S651and WI-5853markers. The restriction enzyme mapping and partial sequencing of a 16-kb genomic DNA clone and comparison with the genomic sequence in GenBankTM (accession number AP053356) deposited by Gleockner et al. (21Gleockner G. Scherer S. Schattevoy R. Boright A. Weber J. Tsui L.C. Rosenthal A. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1060-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) revealed that the α form consisted of 18 exons (Fig. 1). However, some differences between their predicted exon-intron borders and ours were noted. Our DNA sequence of theTfR2-α transcript contained an additional 81 nucleotides in exon 8 (nucleotides 1053–1133 in the TfR2-α) and lacked 18 nucleotides in exon 18 (between nucleotides 2163 and 2164) as compared with their predicted mRNA sequence. This resulted in a 27-amino acid addition and a 6-amino acid deletion for our predicted TfR2-α protein. Also, our mRNA sequence contained an additional 298 nucleotides in the 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 2580–2877). The β form, which may be an alternative product of splicing or promoter usage, lacked exons 1, 2, and 3, and its first exon (exon 4 of the α form) had an additional 142 nucleotide bases at the 5′-end (Fig. 1). No typical iron-responsive element was present in the untranslated regions of either of the TfR2transcripts (22Leibold E.A. Laudano A. Yu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of TfR2-α is shown in Fig.2. The hydrophobic stretch of residues from 81 to 104 following a pair of arginines represents the predicted transmembrane domain. It is located close to the amino terminus, similar to the transmembrane domains of human TfR and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (shaded section in Fig. 2) (23Schneider C. Owen M.J. Banville D. Williams J.G. Nature. 1984; 311: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Israeli R.S. Powell T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to TfR and PSMA, TfR2-α probably is a type II membrane protein. Therefore, residues 1–80 of TfR2-α may be the cytoplasmic domain, and residues 105–801 may be the extracellular domain. In the extracellular domain, amino acid sequence homologies between TfR2-α and either TfR or PSMA were quite high. The extracellular domain of TfR2-α was 45% identical and 66% similar with that of TfR. With PSMA, the identity was 27%, and the similarity was 60%. The cysteines at positions 89 and 98 of TfR form disulfide bonds, resulting in homodimerization. Two cysteines at positions 108 and 111 in TfR2-α are located in an analogous region and may serve a similar function. In addition, TfR2-α contains the motif YQRV (amino acids 23–26) in the middle of the cytoplasmic domain, which may function as an internalization signal, similar to the YTRF motif in TfR (Fig. 2,double underlined) (25Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 83: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 26Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Johnson A.O. Ghosh R.N. Dunn K.W. Garippa R. Park J. Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1749-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The β transcript lacks exons 1–3, which encode the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as well as a part of the extracellular domain including the two cysteines at 108 and 111. The additional 142-nucleotide 5′-sequence in exon 4 does not contain an initiation codon. Translation probably starts at the ATG located at nucleotide 542, which is in frame with the α transcript open reading frame. The predicted initial methionine is shown in Fig. 1 B,Exon 4 and Fig. 2 as bold ATG andM, respectively. This ATG contains a G at positions −3 and +4, indicating that it is an ideal start site for translation (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Hence, the predicted protein product of the β transcript would lack both a transmembrane domain and signal peptide, resulting in a possible intracellular protein. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from human tissues showed that a 2.9-kb mRNA for TfR2was expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser degree in the stomach (Fig.3 A). This corresponded with the length of TfR2-α cDNA isolated from TF-1 cells. In addition, faint bands at 4 kb (stomach) and 1.7 kb (liver, lung, small intestine, stomach, testis, and placenta) were observed. These bands may reflect the presence of additional alternative forms of TfR2mRNA. Northern blot analysis of total RNA of various cell lines revealed high expression of TfR2-α in K562 cells (erythroleukemia) and HepG2 cells (hepatoblastoma) (Fig.3 B). The expression levels of TfR2-α were not always correlated with those of TfR (Fig. 3 B). No transcripts corresponding to TfR2-β (2.5 kb) were observed by Northern blot analysis. To compare the expression of the α and β transcripts, RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for each form. Using a human tissue cDNA panel as a template, the expression of the α form was limited to the liver, spleen, lung, muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, expression of the β form occurred in all of the tested human tissues. Human cancer cell lines from various tissues were studied for expression of the two transcripts. Most of the cell lines expressed both transcripts; however, two cell lines, SK-Hep1 (hepatoma) and ML-1 (myeloblast), lacked the β transcript (Fig. 4 B). To analyze the function of TfR2-α, we stably transfected CHO-TRVb cells, which lack functional TfR, with FLAG-tagged TfR2-α. The cell surface Tf binding was examined using biotinylated Tf and flow cytometry. Neomycin-resistant control cells were almost negative for the cell surface Tf binding (Fig. 5 A,left panels). TRVb-1, human TfR stably transfected cells, was positive for cell surface Tf binding, which was competed by nonlabeled Tf, but not by Lf (Fig. 5 A, center panels). In the CHO-TRVb cells stably expressing TfR2-α, the mean level of cell surface Tf binding was clearly higher than that of the control cells (Fig. 5 A, right panels, solid lines). In competition experiments, a 10-fold excess of nonlabeled Tf clearly inhibited the binding of biotinylated Tf, but even a 100-fold excess of Lf did not inhibit the binding (Fig.5 A, right panels, broken lines). Tf binding to the TfR2-α cells was also examined in a transient expression system using CHO-TRVb cells, and the levels of Tf binding to the cell surface were consistently as follows: TfR cells > TfR2-α cells > pcDNA3 cells (data not shown). Human TfR and TfR2-α stably transfected CHO-TRVb cells were incubated with 55Fe-Tf, and55Fe uptake was measured. Neomycin-resistant CHO-TRVb cells were used as controls. Tf-mediated 55Fe uptake by the TfR2-α cells was comparable to that by TfR cells, and both were clearly higher than that by control cells (Fig. 5 B). Competition by a 200-fold excess of nonlabeled Tf almost completely blocked 55Fe incorporation in these three cell lines after a 5-h incubation (Fig. 5 B). Despite the absence of functional TfR, Tf-mediated 55Fe uptake was also seen in the control TRVb cells to a slight extent, as reported previously by Chan et al. (12Chan R.Y.Y. Ponka P. Schulman H.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell lysates from the cells transiently transfected with the FLAG-tagged TfR2-α plasmid were examined by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.5 C). Two closely migrated bands of ∼105 kDa were observed under reducing conditions (lane 2). When 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample loading buffer, the doublet of ∼105 kDa decreased, but a protein of ∼215 kDa appeared (lane 3). Faint bands of ∼260 kDa and ∼125 kDa were also seen under nonreducing conditions (lane 3, arrows). The primary structure of the TfR2-α protein deduced from its mRNA is similar to that of TfR (see “Results”). Also, our results showed that TfR2-α had a similar function to TfR with respect to Tf binding and Tf-mediated iron uptake. However, the mechanisms that regulate expression of TfR2 and TfR may be different. Levels of the TfR protein are regulated post-transcriptionally through iron-responsive elements in its 3′-untranslated region, to which iron regulatory protein (IRP)-1 and IRP-2 can bind. In cells lacking sufficient iron, IRPs bind to iron-responsive elements of TfR mRNA and stabilize these transcripts. In the presence of excess intracellular iron, IRPs are released, leading to degradation of the TfRmRNA. In rapidly growing cells, the proto-oncogene c-mycrepresses H-ferritin and increases IRP-2. The latter may enhance TfR protein expression (29Wu K. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Neither the 3′- nor the 5′-untranslated regions of the TfR2mRNAs have a detectable iron-responsive element-like structure, suggesting that another mechanism(s) may regulate TfR2 expression. The size of the FLAG-tagged TfR2-α expressed in mammalian cells is ∼105 kDa in the presence of a reducing agent and is ∼215 kDa in the absence of a reducing agent (Fig. 5 C), indicating dimerization of TfR2-α through disulfide bonds. The size of FLAG-tagged TfR2-α monomer, ∼105 kDa, is larger than that calculated from the amino acid sequence (∼90 kDa). This may reflect post-translational modifications of the protein such as glycosylation. Four putative N-glycosylation sites (amino acids 240, 339, 540, and 754) occur in the TfR2-α protein. Hence, the double bands of ∼105 kDa shown in Fig. 5 C may be due to different states of glycosylation. In addition, faint bands of ∼260 kDa and ∼125 kDa just above the clear bands of ∼215 kDa and ∼105 kDa, respectively, were observed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5 C, lane 3). These faint bands may reflect the interaction of TfR2-α with a small protein (∼20 kDa) through disulfide bonds. Northern blot analysis using normal human tissue poly(A)+RNA showed that the liver was the only tissue tested that prominently expressed TfR2-α (Fig. 3 A). Also,TfR2-α was expressed highly in the K562 cell line, which is capable of hemoglobin synthesis (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that erythroid hematopoietic cells may express high levels of TfR2-α. The major product of red blood cells is hemoglobin, which contains abundant iron, and if TfR2-α is involved in iron transport, it would be expected to be strongly expressed in these cells. In erythroid cells, Cotner et al. (30Cotner T. Gupta A.D. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 1989; 73: 214-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) predicted the presence of an alternative form of TfR using a set of monoclonal antibodies against TfR. Their findings may be ascribed to TfR2-α. We cloned two different forms of transcripts from the TfR2gene: α and β. Two different transcripts are also expressed from the human PSMA/NAAG-peptidasegene (24Israeli R.S. Powell T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar, 31Carter R.E. Feldman A.R. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the only known homolog of TfR. Because the expression of PSMA is high in prostate cancer, the antibody against PSMA was approved for use as an imaging agent to detect prostate cancer metastasis (32Gregorakis A.K. Holmes E.H. Murphy G.P. Semin. Urol. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2-12PubMed Google Scholar). The shorter form of PSMA lacks the 5′-end encoding the transmembrane domain (33Su S.L. Huang I.P. Fair W.R. Powell C.T. Heston W.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1441-1443PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the β form of TfR2. Nearly a 100-fold difference in the ratio of expression of the longer and the shorter form of PSMA mRNA has been reported during progression of prostate cancer, with the shorter form predominant in normal cells, and the longer form predominant in the cancer cells (34Weissensteiner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 687PubMed Google Scholar). Using the extremely sensitive RT-PCR method, we could distinguish expression of the α and β forms of the TfR2gene. The expression of the α (longer) form was detected in the liver, spleen, lung, muscle, prostate, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and most human cancer cell lines from various tissues (Fig. 4). The β form was distributed more widely. All of the human tissues tested and most of the human cell lines expressed this β-transcript (Fig. 4). We mapped TfR2to chromosome 7q22. Deletion or loss of heterozygosity of this chromosomal region has been reported in several malignant diseases including myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, as well as breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (35Johnson E. Cotter F.E. Blood Rev. 1997; 11: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Liang H. Fairman J. Claxton D.F. Nowell P.C. Green E.D. Nagarajan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additional studies are required to determine whether TfR2 mutations occur in these cancers. To investigate the function of TfR2, both Tf and Lf were considered as candidate ligands of TfR2; Lf is another Tf family member. The CHO-TRVb cells transfected with FLAG-tagged TfR2-α showed higher levels of Tf binding to the cell surface than did the control cells (Fig. 5 A). This indicates that FLAG-tagged TfR2-α was expressed on the cell surface and was bound by Tf. This binding was effectively competed by nonlabeled Tf but not by Lf (Fig.5 A). This indicates that Tf can bind to TfR2-α more specifically than can Lf. In addition, Tf-mediated iron uptake byTfR2-α-transfected cells was obviously higher than that of control cells (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that TfR2 may be involved in another iron transport pathway, which is not identical to that of TfR. However, if the only ligand for TfR2-α is Tf, and the main function of TfR2-α is cellular iron uptake, why do the cells have two different receptors for Tf? TfR2-α may simply be another transferrin receptor with a different affinity. The fate of the Tf/TfR2-α complex on the cell surface may be different from that of the Tf/TfR complex. The putative internalization motif of TfR2-α is not identical to that of TfR, and even a minor difference of the internalization motif may result in different destinations of the endosomes (27Johnson A.O.

Still, the possibility exists that TfR2-α has another specific ligand other than Tf. We have identified the murine TfR2transcript from MEL cells, and found that it is highly homologous to human TfR2 in both nucleotide and protein sequences but clearly distinct from murineTfR. 2H.

Andrews N. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This indicates that murine TfR2 cannot fully compensate for the loss of the function of TfR. Does TfR2-α bind to HFE, which normally forms a complex with TfR on the cell membrane? Can TfR2-α form a heterodimer with TfR? Elucidation of the precise role of TfR2 may provide an important step for clarifying the mechanisms and the regulation of cellular iron uptake. We are extremely grateful to Dr. Timothy E. McGraw for providing CHO-TRVb and TRVb-1 cells."

In the current model of GDNF signaling, Ret delivers the intracellular signal but cannot bind ligand on its own, while GFRαs bind ligand but are thought not to signal in the absence of Ret. We have compared signaling pathways activated by GDNF in two neuronal cell lines expressing different complements of GDNF receptors. In a motorneuron-derived cell line expressing Ret and GFRαs, GDNF stimulated sustained activation of the Ras/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways, cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation, and increased c-fos expression. Unexpectedly, GDNF also promoted biochemical and biological responses in a line of conditionally immortalized neuronal precursors that express high levels of GFRαs but not Ret. GDNF treatment did not activate the Ras/ERK pathway in these cells, but stimulated a GFRα1-associated Src-like kinase activity in detergent-insoluble membrane compartments, rapid phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein, up-regulation of c-fos mRNA, and cell survival. Together, these results offer new insights into the dynamics of GDNF signaling in neuronal cells, and indicate the existence of novel signaling mechanisms directly or indirectly mediated by GFRα receptors acting in a cell-autonomous manner independently of Ret.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, much less is known about the intracellular signaling mechanisms triggered by the interaction of wild type Ret with GDNF and GFRα receptors in neuronal cells.The current model of GDNF signaling proposes a rather stringent division of labor between the Ret and GFRα receptor subunits. According to this view, Ret is the signaling receptor component but cannot bind ligand in the absence of GFRα receptors, while the latter do bind ligand with high affinity but, because they do not cross the lipid bilayer, they are believed not to signal in the absence of Ret. Although at face value this model would predict a high degree of co-localization of Ret and GFRα receptor subunits in vivo, GFRαs are in fact much more widely expressed than Ret in nervous tissue, an unexpected discrepancy that remains unsatisfactorily explained. Thus, for example, GFRα1 is highly expressed in the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, and hippocampus, all areas largely devoid of Ret expression (27Trupp M. Belluardo N. Funakoshi H. Ibáñez C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3554-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of other members of the GFRα family also show discrepancies with that of Ret. In adult rat brain, for example, GFRα2 is highly expressed in extensive regions of the cerebral cortex and septum which show no Ret expression (21Trupp M. Raynoschek C. Belluardo N. Ibáñez C.F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 28Yu T. Scully S. Yu Y.B. Fox G.M. Jing S.Q. Zhou R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4684-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells are a rich source of GDNF and GFRα1, particularly after nerve lesion (27Trupp M. Belluardo N. Funakoshi H. Ibáñez C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3554-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Naveilhan P. Elshamy V.M. Emfors P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), while they express no detectable levels of Ret or Ret-like GDNF-binding proteins (27Trupp M. Belluardo N. Funakoshi H. Ibáñez C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3554-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, and on the ability of GFRα receptors to bind ligand and activate Ret when provided exogenously in soluble form or immobilized on agarose beads (14Treanor J.J. Goodman L. de Sauvage F. Stone D.M. Poulsen K.T. Beck C.D. Gray C. Armanini M.P. Pollock R.A. Hefti F. Phillips H.S. Goddard A. Moore M.W. Buj-Bello A. Davies A.M. Asai N. Takahashi M. Vandlen R.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4684-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we and others have proposed that GFRα receptors might also function in a non-cell autonomous way to capture and concentrate diffusible GDNF family ligands from the extracellular space and then present these factors in trans to afferent Ret-expressing cells (27Trupp M. Belluardo N. Funakoshi H. Ibáñez C.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3554-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yu T. Scully S. Yu Y.B. Fox G.M. Jing S.Q. Zhou R.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4684-4696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that GFRα receptors may in addition have cell-autonomous signaling functions independently of Ret has not been explored.We have identified neuronal cell lines with endogenous expression of GDNF receptors which are therefore likely to also express natural downstream effectors of GDNF. In the work presented here, we compare the activation of intracellular signaling pathways by GDNF in two such lines expressing different complements of endogenous GDNF receptors. MN1 is a prototypic GDNF-responsive cell line (10Trupp M. Arenas E. Fainzilber M. Nilsson A.-S. Sieber B.A. Grigoriou M. Kilkenny C. Salazar-Grueso E. Pachnis V. Arumäe U. Sariola H. Saarma M. Ibáñez C.F. Nature. 1996; 381: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and expresses Ret as well as GFRα receptors. RN33B, on the other hand, expresses GFRα receptors but not Ret and is in this respect a representative of a large number of GFRα-expressing neurons in the nervous system. We find that GDNF elicits distinct signal transduction pathways in both these cell types and present evidence that supports a cell-autonomous signaling role for GFRα receptors independently of Ret.DISCUSSIONAlthough much effort has been devoted to understanding of the intracellular pathways activated by oncogenic forms of Ret, considerably less is known about the signaling mechanisms activated by its endogenous ligands and co-receptors in neuronal cells. We have investigated and compared the kinetics of activation of several signal transduction pathways in two cell lines of neuronal origin expressing different complements of endogenous GDNF receptors. We present evidence of at least two distinct signal transduction pathways for GDNF in neuronal cells (Fig. 11). Activation of Ret via complex formation with GDNF and GFRα1 in MN1 cells leads to a series of signaling events similar to those observed downstream of other neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases, including rapid recruitment and phosphorylation of adaptor and docking proteins, sustained activation of the Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ and the transcription factor CREB, and increased c-fos mRNA expression. On the other hand, in cells expressing high levels of GFRα receptors in the absence of Ret, such as RN33B, GDNF binding to GFRα1 stimulates the activation and/or recruitment of a receptor-associated Src-like kinase activity that triggers a signaling pathway leading to rapid phosphorylation of CREB and increased c-fos transcription independent of the Ras/ERK pathway.Several lines of evidence support the existence of GDNF signaling mechanisms that are independent of Ret in RN33B cells: (i) no Ret expression can be detected in these cells by either a sensitive RNase protection assay or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; (ii) no Ret-like receptor can be detected by affinity labeling of RN33B cell monolayers with 125I-GDNF; (iii) no affinity labeled GDNF receptor complexes in RN33B cells can be immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. While it is difficult to base an argument on the failure to detect a molecule, several other features of the intracellular signaling events seen in RN33B cells suggest that these are not the result of the activation of a Ret-like receptor tyrosine kinase. In particular, the fact that GDNF treatment does not result in activation of Ras, while still being able to increase c-fos mRNA levels in the presence of a MEK1 inhibitor, indicates that the mechanisms of GDNF signaling in RN33B cells are qualitatively different from those typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinases.Based on our results, we would instead argue that GDNF binding to GFRα1, and perhaps also GFRα2, on RN33B cells activates signaling pathways not unlike those seen after ligation of other GPI-linked receptors, such as Thy-1, the lipopolysaccharide receptor (CD14), FcγRIIIb (CD16), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (CD87), F3 and contactin (F11) (for recent reviews on GPI-anchored protein signaling, see Refs. 39Thomas S. Brugge J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar and 40Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). Despite some variability in the more downstream signaling events, one of the first components engaged by all GPI-linked receptors studied so far appears to be a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (39Thomas S. Brugge J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how GPI-anchored receptors may couple with Src-like kinases, as these two molecules are found on opposite sides of the lipid bilayer. One model proposes that a transmembrane co-receptor links GPI-anchored receptors and Src family kinases. A contactin-associated transmembrane protein, p190Caspr, has recently been identified which contains a proline-rich sequence in its cytoplasmic domain that could mediate coupling with Fyn through the Fyn SH3 domain (42Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M. Grumet M. Schilling J. Martinez R. Plowman G.D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the case of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, two integrins have been shown to associate with this complex along with Src family kinases (43Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A second model suggests that Src kinases colocalize with GPI-linked proteins via their N-terminal fatty acylation modifications, myristylation and palmitylation. Thus, rather than providing direct interaction, the lipid modification may colocalize Src family kinases and GPI-linked proteins in distinct glycoprotein-rich membrane domains. Detergent-resistant membranes containing both GPI-anchored proteins and Src family kinases can be isolated from several cells including neurons (44Zisch A.H. D'Alessandri L. Amrein K. Ranscht B. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Olive S. Dubois C. Schachner M. Rougon G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Membrane rafts that are formed or stabilized when GPI-anchored proteins are clustered may play an important role in signaling through GPI-linked receptors (37Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 46Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that proteins that are downstream of GPI-linked receptors in signaling might be concentrated and activated simply by partitioning into these rafts, without binding the GPI-anchored protein directly; rafts in the outer bilayer leaflet may somehow be coupled to rafts in the inner leaflet, possibly through monolayer coupling (40Brown D. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar).Our results do not exclude the existence of a transmembrane co-receptor linking GFRα molecules with Src family kinases. In fact, some of the phosphorylation substrates that co-immunoprecipitate with GFRα1 from detergent-insoluble membrane compartments could constitute good candidates for such function. The fact that both the increase in kinase activity as well as CREB phosphorylation can be prevented by treatment with the Src family inhibitor PP1 indicates that such kinases may be important components of the signaling pathway activated by GDNF in cells expressing GFRα receptors in the absence of Ret. Intriguingly, although MN1 cells also express GFRα receptors, all the c-fos mRNA response in these cells can be blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that in cells expressing GFRαs together with Ret, the pathways activated by the Ret tyrosine kinase are dominant over Ret-independent signaling mechanisms. It is worth noting, however, that MN1 cells express much lower levels of GFRα receptors than RN33B cells, suggesting that perhaps these receptors must be expressed above a certain level in order to signal independently of Ret. It is also possible that, upon ligand binding, Ret sequesters GFRα receptors away from the membrane compartments from which they normally signal.The pronounced discrepancies in the expression patterns of Ret and GFRα receptors have led to the proposal that these GPI-anchored proteins might also work as ligand-presenting molecules in a non-cell autonomous fashion. An alternative role for GFRα receptors expressed in the absence of Ret, which does not exclude non-cell autonomous functions, is suggested by the data presented here showing that these GPI-anchored molecules can directly or indirectly mediate a cell-autonomous response to ligand independently of Ret. Our observation of increased kinase activity in postmitotically differentiated RN33B cells treated with GDNF suggests that a similar pathway may also be operational in primary neurons. Biological responses that could be mediated by direct signaling from GFRα receptors include acute plasticity-related responses, changes in gene expression, and cell survival. Genes regulated by transcription factors of the CREB family could be primary targets of the GFRα signaling pathway. Interestingly, members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases have recently been shown to directly modulate the activity ofN-methyl-d-asparatate glutamate receptors in the hippocampus, a rich site of GFRα expression, and in this way regulate synaptic efficacy (47Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil G.N. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 48Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Local activation of Src family kinases by GDNF ligands could thus constitute a possible mechanism by which these factors influence synaptic transmission in the brain. Unfortunately, comparisons of the phenotypes of mutant mice generated by homologous recombination lacking expression of Ret, GDNF, or GFRα1 are not likely to be very useful in revealing possible roles of GFRα signaling in vivo as the early postnatal death of all these animals precludes the study of a mature nervous system (49Schuchardt A.

These findings considerably extend the range of target cells that could potentially be affected by GDNF family ligands.

We investigated the proposed roles of tryptophan and lysine side chains as “anchoring” residues of transmembrane proteins. Model systems were employed, consisting of phosphatidylcholine lipids and hydrophobic α-helical peptides, flanked either by tryptophans or lysines. Peptides were incorporated in bilayers of different thickness, and effects on lipid structure were analyzed. Induction of nonbilayer phases and also increases in bilayer thickness were observed that could be explained by a tendency of Trp as well as Lys residues to maintain interactions with the interfacial region. However, effects of the two peptides were remarkably different, indicating affinities of Trp and Lys for different sites at the interface. Our data support a model in which the Trp side chain has a specific affinity for a well defined site near the lipid carbonyl region, while the lysine side chain prefers to be located closer to the aqueous phase, near the lipid phosphate group. The information obtained in this study may further our understanding of the architecture of transmembrane proteins and may prove useful for refining prediction methods for transmembrane segments.

In biological membranes, a variety of interactions can occur between lipids and proteins that affect protein as well as lipid properties and in which both the hydrophobic membrane core and the more polar membrane interfaces can be involved (1Gil T. Ipsen J.H. Mouritsen O.G. Sabra M.C. Sperotto M.M. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Marsh D. Horváth L.I. Biochim. Biophys.

Membrane proteins are able to span the lipid bilayer through interactions of their exposed hydrophobic segments with the lipid hydrocarbon acyl chains. In general, the length of these hydrophobic segments will approximately match the membrane hydrophobic thickness. However, also amismatch between protein hydrophobic length and membrane hydrophobic thickness may occur. Such a mismatch can have considerable influence on membrane structure and function (reviewed in Ref. 4Killian J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and may, for example, be involved in protein sorting, microdomain formation, changes in protein activity, or changes in lipid structure and organization. In contrast to the hydrophobic core of a membrane, the membrane interface presents a complex and heterogeneous chemical environment, which accounts for a relatively large proportion of the total bilayer thickness (3White S.H. Wimley W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Specific interactions of membrane proteins with the interfacial region of the lipids may influence many functional processes, such as for instance membrane protein assembly, topology of membrane proteins, the mode of protein insertion into the membrane, and protein anchoring to the membrane. In addition, such interactions may play a determining role in hydrophobic mismatch (4Killian J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Analyses of the structure of transmembrane proteins suggest that two types of amino acids may be of special importance for interactions of membrane proteins with the interfacial region: aromatic amino acids, in particular tryptophans, which are enriched at both ends of transmembrane fragments (5Landolt-Marticorena C.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5746) Google Scholar) and appear to have a preferred interaction with the interface (10Killian J.A. Salemink I. De Planque M.R.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe II, R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and charged residues, which also are preferentially located near the membrane interfaces (11Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positively charged residues interact with negatively charged phospholipids and are predominantly positioned at the cytoplasmic side, according to the positive inside rule (11Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we aim to investigate the role of interfacially localized aromatic tryptophans and positively charged lysines in protein-membrane interfacial interactions by using a strategy that is based on hydrophobic mismatch effects. We shall employ artificial peptides of variable hydrophobic length, flanked by either tryptophan or lysine residues. These peptides will be incorporated in lipid bilayers of varying thickness, allowing a wide range of mismatch situations. Upon creating such a hydrophobic mismatch, it can be expected that the lipid structure will readjust if the residues flanking the hydrophobic segment of the peptide prefer to maintain interactions with the lipid head group region. Analysis of the effects on lipid organization will thus provide information on the interaction of these flanking residues with the interfacial region. Indeed, we have shown earlier, using simple model systems, that hydrophobic mismatch can result in complementary lipid conformational changes (10Killian J.A. Salemink I. De Planque M.R.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe II, R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the affinity of flanking tryptophan residues for the interface might be important in determining both the nature and extent of changes in lipid organization. In the present study, we compared the effect of tryptophan and lysine as flanking residues on lipid structure. Striking differences were observed between the membrane-associating and lipid-modulating properties of Lys- and Trp-flanked model peptides. The results suggest that tryptophan residues prefer to be located in a well defined region at the polar/apolar interface in phosphatidylcholine bilayers near the lipid carbonyls, while lysine residues prefer to be localized near the more polar region around the lipid phosphate group or more outward toward the aqueous phase.

The identity of the peptides was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry or electrospray mass spectrometry. The KALP peptides (Table I) were synthesized on an automatic ABI 433A peptide synthesizer using the ABI FastMoc 0.25 mmol protocols (49Applied Biosystems Applied Biosystems Model 433A Peptide Synthesizer User's Manual, Version 1.0.

Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives, activated in situ using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole andN,N′-diisopropylethylamine inN-methylpyrrolidinone, were used in the coupling steps. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment with 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.25 ml of H2O, and 0.25 ml of triisopropylsilane for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the peptide was precipitated in a methyl tert-butyl ether/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) solution. After this, the pellet was dissolved in tert-butanol/water (1:1, v/v) (∼60 ml) and lyophilized to obtain the crude peptide as a white fluffy solid, which was ≥90% pure according to analytical HPLC. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry or electrospray mass spectrometry. All of the phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Deuterium-depleted water was from Isotec Inc. (Miamisburg, OH).n-(N-Oxy-4,4-dimethyloxazolidin-2-yl) stearic acid (n-SASL) isomers were synthesized according to Hubbell and McConnell (15Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The procedure followed for WALP analogs is identical to methods used in earlier work (10Killian J.A. Salemink I. De Planque M.R.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe II, R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). WALP analogs, quantified by the absorbance of tryptophan at 280 nm, were predissolved in 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid/mg of peptide and were two times dissolved in 1 ml of trifluoroethanol, followed by drying in a rotary evaporator. Unless stated otherwise, the peptides were dissolved in 0.5 ml of trifluoroethanol and added, at temperatures above the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition, to 0.5 ml of a lipid suspension in distilled water, followed by the addition of 10 ml of water and immediate lyophilization. For some experiments, a mixed film method was used, in which the similarly treated peptide was added to 0.5 ml of a lipid suspension in methanol, followed by drying in a rotary evaporator and overnight incubation under high vacuum. Control experiments showed that both methods yielded identical results (data not shown). KALP peptides were quantified by their dry weight, and samples were prepared with the mixed film method. Further sample preparation depended on the kind of measurement (see below). Lipid/peptide mixtures with a 1:10 peptide/lipid molar ratio (containing 20 μmol of lipid) were hydrated in 1.5 ml of buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Samples were spun down at 30,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with buffer if the pH of the supernatant was below pH 6. 31P NMR spectra of the pellets were recorded on a Bruker MSL 300 spectrometer. The sample temperature was regulated using a Bruker B-VT1000 temperature controller. Proton-decoupled experiments were carried out at 121.5 MHz, with a 17-μs 90° pulse, a 1.3-s interpulse time, and gated proton-noise decoupling. A sweep width of 25 kHz, 1024 data points, and a 100-Hz line broadening were used, and approximately 15,000 scans were acquired. CD samples of pure peptide were prepared by adding 1 ml of buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris, pH 7.4) to 1 μmol of peptide powder and subsequent vortexing. CD spectra were recorded without any further sample processing. Samples containing lipids were prepared as described above and were hydrated in 1 ml of buffer that was diluted with distilled water (1:1, v/v), unless otherwise stated, to obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio. These samples were then sonicated for 5 min with a 50% duty cycle and with an input power of 40 watts, using a Branson 250 tip sonicator. To pellet down titanium particles and any residual multilamellar lipid structures, the sonicated samples were next centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Spectra of oriented peptide/lipid systems, hydrated with distilled water instead of buffer, were measured after spreading 40 μl of a sonicated sample on a quartz plate, followed by air drying. For all samples, CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, using a 0.2-mm path length cell, 1-nm bandwith, 0.2-nm resolution, 1-s response time, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Unless otherwise noted, spectra were recorded at room temperature. Samples containing peptide and 10 μmol of sn-2 perdeuterated 14:0-PC at a 1:30 molar ratio were hydrated in 1 ml of deuterium-depleted water. The samples were spun down at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with deuterium-depleted water if the pH of the supernatant was below pH 6.2H NMR spectra of the pellets were recorded on a Bruker MSL 300 spectrometer, using a high power probe with a 7.5-mm solenoidal sample coil. 2H NMR measurements were performed at 46.1 MHz, using a quadrupolar echo sequence (16Davis J.H. Jeffrey K.R. Bloom M. Valic M.I. Higgs T.P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 42: 390-394Crossref Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) with a 2.6-μs 90° pulse, a 50-μs pulse separation, a repetition rate of two acquisitions per second, and a spectral width of 417 kHz, with 2048 data points in the time domain. Approximately 80,000 scans were accumulated. The free induction decays were left-shifted to begin at the top of the echo, zero-filled to 8192 points, and multiplied with an exponential window function equivalent to a line broadening of 50 Hz. Spectra were recorded at 34 °C. 2H NMR powder spectra were dePaked as described earlier (12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This dePakeing procedure results in spectra that would be obtained for an aligned membrane with its bilayer normal parallel to the magnetic field. It enhances the resolution and results in doublets with splittings ΔνQ that relate to the segmental order parameter S(i). Order parameter profiles were obtained by assuming that the segmental order varies monotonically along the acyl chain. From these profiles, the effective length of the acyl chains was estimated as described (12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both KALP and WALP-containing samples were prepared by a mixed film method, as described earlier (12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Dried peptide/14:0-PC films (containing 1.5 μmol of lipid) with a 1:30 or 1:10 molar ratio, doped with 1 mol % of n-SASL, were hydrated in 40 μl of distilled water. Samples were spun down at 5000 × g for 15 min at room temperature in 1-mm inner diameter capillaries, which were flame-sealed after removal of the supernatant. ESR spectra were recorded on a Varian Century Line Series 9-GHz spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen gas flow temperature regulation system. Sample-containing capillaries were accommodated within standard 4-mm quartz ESR tubes containing light silicone oil for thermal stability. Temperature was measured by a fine wire thermocouple located at the top of the microwave cavity within the silicone oil. Conventional, in-phase ESR spectra were recorded at 34 °C, at a modulation amplitude of 1.6 G peak-to-peak and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz with a sweep width of the static field of 100 G. In a previous study, we showed that short tryptophan-flanked peptides have a pronounced effect on lipid conformation, inducing inverted hexagonal (HII) phases at high concentration in bilayer-preferring phosphatidylcholine lipids. To discover whether this behavior is a unique property of Trp-flanked peptides, we first compared the effect of the lysine-containing peptide KALP16 on the phase behavior of 18:1c-PC lipids with that of the tryptophan-containing peptide WALP16. 31P NMR spectra of these systems at a 1:10 peptide/lipid molar ratio are shown in Fig. 1. Pure 18:1c-PC gives a spectrum with a low field shoulder and a high field peak, typical for the preferred planar bilayer organization of this lipid in the liquid crystalline (Lα) phase (17Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 105-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 18Cullis P.R. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). WALP16 associates completely with the lipids and partially induces an HII phase, as characterized by the spectral component with inverted asymmetry and a 2-fold reduced residual chemical shift anisotropy compared with the Lα spectrum (17Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 105-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 18Cullis P.R. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Although KALP16 has the same backbone length as WALP16, it does not change the lamellar phase preference of this lipid. This strikingly different behavior suggests that the Lys-flanked peptides either are unable to induce nonbilayer phases in PC or do not incorporate in the membrane. It is possible that KALP16, which is less hydrophobic than WALP16, does not incorporate into the membrane because it is soluble in buffer. To investigate the behavior of KALP and WALP analogs in buffer solution, circular dichroism measurements were performed. CD spectra of dried peptide films, hydrated with buffer, are shown in Fig.2. A clear solution of WALP16 in buffer could not be achieved, and the CD signals obtained were equivalent to the background signal, indicating that all of the WALP had aggregated. A similar behavior was observed for WALP23 (data not shown). In contrast, both KALP16 and KALP19 formed clear solutions in buffer and gave well defined CD spectra corresponding to 15 and 40% α-helix, respectively, indicating that the longer peptide forms a more stable helix, as is commonly observed (e.g. Ref. 19Dieudonné D. Gericke G. Flach C.R. Jiang X. Farid R.S. Mendelsohn R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 792-799Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). KALP23 again did not give a clear solution, and only a very weak signal was observed, suggesting that this longer peptide is too hydrophobic to solubilize in the buffer solution. These results suggest that short KALP peptides prefer not to associate with the membrane because they are soluble in buffer solution. Indeed, spinning down the KALP16/18:1c-PC NMR sample yielded a supernatant with a CD spectrum (not shown) that was very similar to that of pure KALP16 in Fig. 2. Thus, longer KALP peptides are required to establish whether Lys-flanked peptides are capable of inducing nonbilayer phases and/or changes in lipid chain configuration in phosphatidylcholine membranes. The KALP23 analog has little structure in buffer solution but adopts an α-helical conformation in a lipid environment (see below), also in the presence of the longest lipids used in this study (data not shown). This indicates solubilization of (at least a large fraction of) KALP23 in a membrane environment under mismatch conditions (see also Refs. 20Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar and 21Webb R.J. East J.M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G.

To investigate the consequences of mismatch on lipid phase behavior, 20:1c-, 22:1c-, and 24:1c-PC were selected, which have a large bilayer thickness compared with the length of KALP23 and corresponding WALP analogs. The 31P NMR spectra of KALP23 and of WALP23, WALP21, and WALP19 at a 1:10 molar ratio of peptide to lipid are shown in Fig. 3. Spectra were recorded at both 30 and 60 °C to investigate the temperature dependence of the lipid phase modulation. In the absence of peptide, all lipids depicted are in the Lα phase. The spectrum of KALP23 in 24:1c-PC at 30 °C has components in the line shape that deviate from that of a bilayer phase but cannot be interpreted unambiguously in terms of nonbilayer phases. It does confirm, however, that the peptide is associated with the membrane. Raising the temperature to 60 °C results in a line shape that contains a component clearly representative of a HII phase. This has not previously been reported for Lys-based transmembrane peptides and indicates the ability of these peptides to induce HII phase formation in PC in response to mismatch. Also for KALP23 in the 20:1c and 22:1c-PC systems, a higher temperature is necessary to obtain resolution of the two spectral components, but in these systems an isotropic signal, most probably a cubic-like lipid phase (10Killian J.A. Salemink I. De Planque M.R.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe II, R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), is obtained, together with an Lα component. With even shorter lipids, spectra at both temperatures are representative of pure Lα phases (data not shown). This behavior is similar to that previously observed for short WALP peptides, which upon increasing the lipid length first induced an Lα → I transition and then, at larger mismatch, an I → HII transition. Both transitions are very sensitive to the exact length difference of the particular WALP/PC combination (10Killian J.A. Salemink I. De Planque M.R.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe II, R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects on phase behavior can be used as a tool to compare the effective hydrophobic length of KALP23 with that of corresponding WALP analogs. As shown in Fig. 3, the tryptophan peptide WALP23 behaves very differently from its corresponding Lys analog KALP23. WALP23 does not induce an HII phase and is much more efficient in inducing nonbilayer phases at lower temperature than is KALP23. Nearly or totally pure isotropic phases are formed already at room temperature in the three PC systems studied, and increasing the temperature has only a minor effect, in agreement with previous observations with shorter WALP analogs (22Morein S. Strandberg E. Killian J.A. Persson S. Arvidson G. Koeppe II, R.E. Lindblom G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3078-3088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fact that an almost pure isotropic phase is induced in 24:1c-PC suggests a smaller mismatch with this membrane than in the case of KALP23 (see “Discussion”). To obtain more information about this mismatch difference, WALP peptides with a shorter hydrophobic length were also employed. With WALP21 and WALP19 (Fig. 3) the I → HII transition occurs between 22:1c and 24:1c-PC and between 20:1c and 22:1c-PC, respectively. From these data, it can be concluded that KALP23 has the same effect on the I → HII transition as a shorter WALP peptide, approximately equal to WALP21 and certainly longer than WALP19. Thus, KALP23 behaves as if it has the same hydrophobic length as a shorter WALP peptide, indicating that the effective hydrophobic length of the peptides is related to the nature of the flanking residues. For studying mismatch-induced lipid deformation in situations where the peptide is relatively long with respect to the hydrophobic bilayer thickness, we investigated the ability of peptides to influence the molecular order of the lipid acyl chains, while the overall organization remains an Lα lipid phase. To this end, KALP23 and WALP23 were incorporated at a 1:30 peptide/lipid molar ratio into bilayers of 14:0-PC with perdeuteratedsn-2 chains. 31P NMR measurements confirmed that the lipids in these systems are in a bilayer organization, and the effects of the peptides on acyl chain order were characterized by2H NMR. Fig. 4 presents the 2H NMR spectra of 14:0-PC bilayer dispersions, with and without KALP23 or WALP23. Visual inspection of the spectrum representing the KALP23/14:0-PC system reveals a very small increase in quadrupolar splittings for the central methyl and the outer methylene peaks, relative to the pure 14:0-PC. These splittings are significantly larger for the WALP23 peptide, suggesting that the tryptophan-based peptides thicken the 14:0-PC membrane more than do their lysine-based counterparts. Segmental order parameters S(i) were derived, and from these the mean hydrophobic thicknesses of the different lipid/peptide systems were quantified, as described under “Methods.” The resulting values are presented in TableII, together with the data obtained previously for WALP16 and WALP19. For the pure 14:0-PC system, a value of 22.5 Å was obtained, which is in fairly good agreement (within 1 Å) with values based on x-ray measurements (23Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown for shorter WALP peptides that the 14:0-PC bilayer thickness increases with increasing peptide length, giving small but very systematic effects (12De Planque M.R.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schäfer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The longer WALP23 analog continues this trend, but the effect of the lysine-based KALP23 peptide is even smaller than that of the shortest WALP analog. Thus WALP peptides are more effective modulators of 14:0-PC bilayer thickness than are KALP analogs. However, direct comparison of the effects of WALP23 and KALP23 is only possible when these peptides incorporate in 14:0-PC membranes with the same efficiency, have similar orientations with respect to the bilayer normal, and are in a similar aggregation state. We therefore analyzed these systems by CD and by ESR. The latter technique additionally yields information about the influence of the peptides on lipid dynamics.Table IIChanges in mean hydrophobic thickness (Δd) relative to the pure sn-2 chain perdeuterated 14:0-PC, for systems at a 1:30 molar ratio of peptide to lipid and in anisotropy of the hyperfine splittings, Δ(Amax − Amin), of the 14-SASL spin label relative to 14:0-PC systems at a 1:10 peptide/lipid molar ratio.PeptideΔdΔ(A max −A min)ÅGWALP16+0.42-aValue obtained from De Planque et al.(12).+1.32-aValue obtained from De Planque et al.(12).WALP19+0.62-aValue obtained from De Planque et al.(12).+2.52-aValue obtained from De Planque et al.(12).WALP23+1.0+3.4KALP23+0.2+1.8Measurements were performed at 34 °C, 10 °C above the main phase transition temperature of the pure 14:0-PC.

These findings suggest that p21Ras may be an important mediator of ROS function.Previous studies have shown that c-Src is involved in signal events stimulated by ROS (5Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A.

It has been reported that Src family kinases and Ras are critical for ERK1/2 activation by H2O2 (10Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin.

The predominant pathway for ERK1/2 activation by angiotensin II and growth factors has also been proposed to involve Src-Ras-Raf-MEK1-ERK1/2 (12Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B.

Several groups have suggested that JAK2 activates the Ras/Raf/ERK-signaling pathway and is required for the proliferative response initiated by many cytokines (14Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Han et al. (15Han Y. Leaman D.W. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Groner B. Kerr I.M. Wood W.I. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5947-5952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have reported that JAK2 is required to couple growth hormone receptor to pathways involving Shc. Shc is thought to function as an adapter molecule to recruit Grb2·Sos complexes to the activated receptor, which promotes formation of Ras-GTP (16Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In Src-transformed cells, JAK1 and JAK2 are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated (17Campbell G.S. Yu C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggesting that H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation may be regulated by Src family kinases and JAK2.To determine the role of Src family kinases and JAK2 in H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation, we used specific JAK2 inhibitors and cells derived from animals deficient in c-Src and Fyn. We show here that activation of JAK2 by H2O2 is positively regulated by Fyn, but not by c-Src. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both Fyn and JAK2 are required for H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Ras. Thus, the Fyn-JAK2-Shc-Ras-signaling pathway described here may represent a new redox-sensitive mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are first that H2O2 stimulates JAK2 in a Fyn-dependent and Src-independent manner, and second that JAK2 mediates phosphorylation of Shc and activation of Ras by H2O2. Redox-sensitive regulation of JAK2/Shc/Ras is thus a new function for Fyn. Data that support an essential role for Fyn and JAK2 in H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation include the following findings. 1) In Fyn−/− fibroblasts, there was no JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2. In contrast, in Src−/− fibroblasts, H2O2-mediated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was not inhibited. 2) AG-490, a specific JAK2 inhibitor, prevented H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation. 3) Likewise, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation by H2O2 were inhibited in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, but not in Src−/− fibroblasts. 4) Expression of Fyn, but not Src, in Fyn−/− cells restored the response of Shc and JAK2 to H2O2. Our results are the first to show that Fyn, but not Src, is involved specifically in oxidative stress-mediated JAK2 activation, which also regulates a Shc/Ras signaling pathway.Based on this study as well as previous work from our lab (6Baas A.S.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar), we propose a scheme (Fig. 11) for ROS-mediated signal transduction leading to activation of Ras and ERK1/2. A novel aspect of this model is the specific role of Fyn, but not c-Src, to activate JAK2 and Ras. Previously we found that c-Src but not Fyn was required for H2O2-mediated BMK1/ERK5 activation in fibroblasts (9Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, in this study, we found that Fyn but not c-Src was required for H2O2-mediated JAK2 activation in fibroblasts. These results indicate that c-Src and Fyn have separate roles in ROS-mediated signal transduction. Campbell et al. (17Campbell G.S. Yu C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 (especially JAK1) are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in Src-transformed cells and suggested that JAK1, and possibly JAK2, are in an activated state in these cells. Furthermore, Uddin et al. (28Uddin S. Sher D.A. Alsayed Y. Pons S. Colamonici O.R. Fish E.N. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that interferon-γ causes the SH2 domain of Fyn to interact with the activated form of interferon-γ-dependent JAK2. Future studies will be required to define the precise nature of the downstream substrates for c-Src and Fyn.In addition to activation of JAK2 by Fyn, this study demonstrates that H2O2-mediated Ras activation is partially dependent on Fyn and JAK2. Previous investigators have suggested an important relationship between two pathways used by cytokines and growth hormones to activate cells: the JAK2/STAT and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (14Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A key convergence point of these pathways may be activation of Raf. Conversion of Ras to its GTP-bound form results in the binding of Raf to Ras, and this interaction with activated Ras localizes Raf to the plasma membrane and is often the first step in Raf activation. However, other investigators have reported that tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src kinase family and JAK2 phosphorylate Raf, thereby enhancing its activity. For example, Marrero et al. (24Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported that angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor induced JAK2·Raf complex formation, Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and ERK1/2 kinase activity, which were dependent on JAK2 activity. Based on this study, we propose that JAK2 is “upstream” of the adapter protein Shc and regulates H2O2-mediated Ras activation (Fig. 11).The results for ERK1/2 activation suggest that H2O2 might activate two pathways, only one of which is dependent on Fyn and JAK2 (Fig. 11). In vascular smooth muscle cells, AG-490 inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 in response to either angiotensin II or platelet-derived growth factor (24Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B.

We examined the role of JAK2 and Fyn in H2O2-mediated ERK1/2 activation with AG-490 treatment and in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, and found that treatment with AG-490 or the absence of Fyn induced a temporal shift in activation of ERK1/2. However, the magnitude and duration of ERK1/2 activation were not altered. Of interest, McKenzie et al. (29McKenzie F.R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have reported that pretreatment with prostaglandin E and isobutylmethylxanthine to elevate cAMP attenuated the ability of growth factors to stimulate ERK1/2, when measured 5 min after growth factor stimulation. However, similar to the effect of AG-490 and the absence of Fyn this inhibition was not apparent at late times and the magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was not decreased. Recently, York et al. (30York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) have found that Rap1 mediates sustained ERK1/2 kinase activity induced by cAMP, so Rap1 could be a candidate to regulate this late phase activation of ERK1/2. Future studies will be required to determine the role of Rap1 in ROS-mediated signal transduction to ERK1/2.In summary, we have shown that JAK2 is activated by ROS in a Fyn-dependent manner. The fact that H2O2-mediated activation of JAK2 required Fyn, but not c-Src, suggests that these two Src family kinases serve different intracellular functions with respect to oxidative stress. In addition, the demonstration that Fyn/JAK2 regulates H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation, suggests that Fyn/JAK2/Shc/Ras signaling pathway may involve novel intracellular mediators.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5947-5952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have reported that JAK2 is required to couple growth hormone receptor to pathways involving Shc. Shc is thought to function as an adapter molecule to recruit Grb2·Sos complexes to the activated receptor, which promotes formation of Ras-GTP (16Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In Src-transformed cells, JAK1 and JAK2 are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated (17Campbell G.S. Yu C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggesting that H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation may be regulated by Src family kinases and JAK2. To determine the role of Src family kinases and JAK2 in H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation, we used specific JAK2 inhibitors and cells derived from animals deficient in c-Src and Fyn. We show here that activation of JAK2 by H2O2 is positively regulated by Fyn, but not by c-Src. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both Fyn and JAK2 are required for H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Ras. Thus, the Fyn-JAK2-Shc-Ras-signaling pathway described here may represent a new redox-sensitive mechanism. DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are first that H2O2 stimulates JAK2 in a Fyn-dependent and Src-independent manner, and second that JAK2 mediates phosphorylation of Shc and activation of Ras by H2O2. Redox-sensitive regulation of JAK2/Shc/Ras is thus a new function for Fyn. Data that support an essential role for Fyn and JAK2 in H2O2-mediated Shc/Ras activation include the following findings. 1) In Fyn−/− fibroblasts, there was no JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2. In contrast, in Src−/− fibroblasts, H2O2-mediated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was not inhibited. 2) AG-490, a specific JAK2 inhibitor, prevented H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation. 3) Likewise, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation by H2O2 were inhibited in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, but not in Src−/− fibroblasts. 4) Expression of Fyn, but not Src, in Fyn−/− cells restored the response of Shc and JAK2 to H2O2. Our results are the first to show that Fyn, but not Src, is involved specifically in oxidative stress-mediated JAK2 activation, which also regulates a Shc/Ras signaling pathway.Based on this study as well as previous work from our lab (6Baas A.S.

A novel aspect of this model is the specific role of Fyn, but not c-Src, to activate JAK2 and Ras. Previously we found that c-Src but not Fyn was required for H2O2-mediated BMK1/ERK5 activation in fibroblasts (9Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, in this study, we found that Fyn but not c-Src was required for H2O2-mediated JAK2 activation in fibroblasts. These results indicate that c-Src and Fyn have separate roles in ROS-mediated signal transduction. Campbell et al. (17Campbell G.S. Yu C.L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 (especially JAK1) are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in Src-transformed cells and suggested that JAK1, and possibly JAK2, are in an activated state in these cells. Furthermore, Uddin et al. (28Uddin S. Sher D.A. Alsayed Y. Pons S. Colamonici O.R. Fish E.N. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that interferon-γ causes the SH2 domain of Fyn to interact with the activated form of interferon-γ-dependent JAK2. Future studies will be required to define the precise nature of the downstream substrates for c-Src and Fyn.In addition to activation of JAK2 by Fyn, this study demonstrates that H2O2-mediated Ras activation is partially dependent on Fyn and JAK2. Previous investigators have suggested an important relationship between two pathways used by cytokines and growth hormones to activate cells: the JAK2/STAT and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (14Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A key convergence point of these pathways may be activation of Raf. Conversion of Ras to its GTP-bound form results in the binding of Raf to Ras, and this interaction with activated Ras localizes Raf to the plasma membrane and is often the first step in Raf activation. However, other investigators have reported that tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src kinase family and JAK2 phosphorylate Raf, thereby enhancing its activity. For example, Marrero et al. (24Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported that angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor induced JAK2·Raf complex formation, Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and ERK1/2 kinase activity, which were dependent on JAK2 activity. Based on this study, we propose that JAK2 is “upstream” of the adapter protein Shc and regulates H2O2-mediated Ras activation (Fig. 11).The results for ERK1/2 activation suggest that H2O2 might activate two pathways, only one of which is dependent on Fyn and JAK2 (Fig. 11). In vascular smooth muscle cells, AG-490 inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 in response to either angiotensin II or platelet-derived growth factor (24Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B.

We examined the role of JAK2 and Fyn in H2O2-mediated ERK1/2 activation with AG-490 treatment and in Fyn−/− fibroblasts, and found that treatment with AG-490 or the absence of Fyn induced a temporal shift in activation of ERK1/2. However, the magnitude and duration of ERK1/2 activation were not altered. Of interest, McKenzie et al. (29McKenzie F.R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have reported that pretreatment with prostaglandin E and isobutylmethylxanthine to elevate cAMP attenuated the ability of growth factors to stimulate ERK1/2, when measured 5 min after growth factor stimulation. However, similar to the effect of AG-490 and the absence of Fyn this inhibition was not apparent at late times and the magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was not decreased. Recently, York et al. (30York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) have found that Rap1 mediates sustained ERK1/2 kinase activity induced by cAMP, so Rap1 could be a candidate to regulate this late phase activation of ERK1/2. Future studies will be required to determine the role of Rap1 in ROS-mediated signal transduction to ERK1/2.In summary, we have shown that JAK2 is activated by ROS in a Fyn-dependent manner. The fact that H2O2-mediated activation of JAK2 required Fyn, but not c-Src, suggests that these two Src family kinases serve different intracellular functions with respect to oxidative stress. In addition, the demonstration that Fyn/JAK2 regulates H2O2-mediated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Ras activation, suggests that Fyn/JAK2/Shc/Ras signaling pathway may involve novel intracellular mediators.

Both fluorescent and non-fluorescent protein adducts and cross-links are formed, many of which result from the advanced Maillard reaction. One of them, LM-1, is a blue fluorophore that was earlier tentatively identified as a cross-link involving lysine residues (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A two-step chromatographic system was used to unequivocally identify and quantitatively prepare a synthetic fluorescent cross-link with lysine residues that had identical UV, fluorescent, and chromatographic properties with both acetylated and non-acetylated LM-1. Proton, 13C NMR, and molecular mass of the synthetic compound were identical with vesperlysine A, a fluorescent cross-link discovered by Nakamura et al.(2Nakamura K. Nakzawa Y. Ienaga K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fragmentation patterns of vesperlysine A and LM-1 were identical as determined by NMR/mass spectrometry. Lenticular levels of vesperlysine A increase curvilinearly with age and reach 20 pmol/mg at 90 years. Levels correlate with degree of lens crystallin pigmentation and fluorescence and are increased in diabetes, in contrast toN ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine and pentosidine. Ascorbate, d-pentoses, andd-threose, but neither d-glucose under oxidative conditions, dl-glyceraldehyde, methylglyoxal, glyoxal, nor glycolaldehyde, are precursors. However, addition of C-2 compounds greatly catalyzes vesperlysine A formation from ribose. Thus, vesperlysine A/LM-1 is a novel product of the advanced Maillard reaction in vivo and a specific marker of a diabetic process in the lens that is different from glyco- and lipoxidation.

Thus, vesperlysine A/LM-1 is a novel product of the advanced Maillard reaction in vivo and a specific marker of a diabetic process in the lens that is different from glyco- and lipoxidation. LM-1 is a fluorescent protein modification that was originally discovered in and isolated from acid hydrolysate of human cataractous lens crystallins (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The blue fluorophore had excitation emission maxima at 370 and 440 nm. It was found to increase with age and levels correlated with the overall degree of lens pigmentation except for a decrease in so-called brunescent lenses, i.e. a rare form of advanced cataract characterized by extreme browning and cross-linking. LM-1 was also increased in diabetic lenses.Further studies showed a LM-1-like fluorescent compound could be synthesized from bovine serum albumin reacted with ascorbic acid or its oxidation products, or from ribose, but not glucose or fructose (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Considerable efforts in our laboratory were devoted toward obtaining sufficient quantities of LM-1 for structural identification. Unpublished data were suggestive of one or two lysine residues linked to a heterocyclic ring. However, further studies were hampered by our unexpected inability to prepare the compound from l-lysine and d-ribose and its presence in very low concentrations in the lens. In a more recent collaborative study with Graham and Nagaraj (3Graham L. Monnier V.M. Nagaraj R.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: S886PubMed Google Scholar), LM-1 was found to co-chromatograph, by RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; CML, N ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; WI, water-insoluble; WS, water-soluble1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; CML, N ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; WI, water-insoluble; WS, water-soluble and TLC, with a fluorescent cross-link synthesized from l-lysine andd-ribose that had been originally identified as pentodilysine in the “cross-linking region” of the chromatogram obtained with diphenylboronic acid derivatives. However, despite extensive spectroscopic data, unequivocal structural identification of pentodilysine was not achieved.The enormous efforts that had already gone into our attempts to elucidate the structure of LM-1 combined with the unknown intrinsic value of LM-1 as a marker of the advanced Maillard reaction in vivo would have made us abandon the project. However, when LM-1 was quantitated in lenses from dogs that had been diabetic for 5 years (4Nagaraj R.H. Kern T.S. Sell D.R. Fogarty J. Engerman R.L. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the surprising observation was made that LM-1 was elevated in dogs with moderate glycemic control, whereas pentosidine, a glycoxidation product, was elevated in only in lenses from poorly controlled animals. This suggested that LM-1 was a unique marker for a diabetic process reflecting mild hyperglycemia.This promising ability of LM-1 to reflect mild hyperglycemia in the lens, together with the availability of newer LC/MS instruments, such as the LCQ ion-trap instrument, led us to pursue the project further. We present below our approach and data that have led us to conclude that LM-1 is identical with vesperlysine A, a recently discovered lysine cross-link of the advanced Maillard reaction (2Nakamura K. Nakzawa Y. Ienaga K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Its mechanism of formation and relevance to the biochemistry of the aging lens in comparison to glycation and other advanced glycation products are described.RESULTSIsolation of Fluorescent Material from d-Ribose and Poly-l-lysine or Nα-Acetyl-l-lysineBased on previous experiments suggesting involvement ofl-lysine and d-ribose in LM-1 formation (3Graham L. Monnier V.M. Nagaraj R.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: S886PubMed Google Scholar), we incubated poly-l-lysine with d-ribose for 93 h and acid-hydrolyzed the reaction products. The mixture was passed over Dowex 50W, which was eluted with three different pyridine formate buffers. A major fluorescent material at 370/440 nm was eluted by HPLC reverse phase chromatography on C-18 column at 9–11 min (Fig.1). This material was found to elute from the Dowex column between fractions 100 and 120 (data not shown). A similar fluorescent peak was obtained fromN α-acetyl-l-lysine andd-ribose (Fig. 1, inset). In subsequent work, all studies were performed with the material prepared fromN α-acetyl-l-lysine.The fluorescent peak isolated fromN α-acetyl-l-lysine was rechromatographed on a smaller Dowex column and then sequentially chromatographed with semipreparative C-18 HPLC column, cation exchange column, and C-18 analytical column. Detection was carried out both at 370/440 nm for fluorescence and UV at 220 nm. From 15 g ofN α-acetyl-l-lysine hydrochloride, 500 μg of chromatographically pure fluorescent compound were obtained (yield 0.0033%).The chromatographic properties of the pure compound were compared with LM-1 from human lenses, isolated by a combination of C-18 as described by Nagaraj and Monnier (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and cation exchange chromatography. Co-chromatography between the synthetic and the native fluorophore was observed in both systems (Fig. 2,A and B).Figure 2Comparison of HPLC chromatograms of synthetic vesperlysine A and LM-1 from human lenses, and co-chromatography.Separations were performed on analytical C-18 reverse phase column (A) and cation exchange column (B).

The proton NMR (Fig.3 A) showed four single aromatic protons (a–d) at 8.31 (s), 8.12 (s), 7.97 (d), and 6.9 (d) ppm, two ε-carbon linked protons at 4.76 (t) and 4.41 (t) ppm (ε and ε′), two overlapping α-carbon-linked protons at 3.80 ppm (α and α′), and the aliphatic lysyl protons at 1.3–2.3 ppm. The13C spectrum showed 2 peaks between 170 and 180 ppm (attributed to two carboxylic groups), 7 peaks (2 of which are superimposed) between 90 and 160 ppm (from the aromatic ring), 1 water side band (at 40.4 ppm), and 10 peaks (including 4 × 2 superimposed peaks) between 20 and 60 ppm (from two aliphatic chains) (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these data suggested that the isolated compound was identical with vesperlysine A (Fig.4) described by Nakamura (6Nakamura K. Uga S. Miyata M. Kakimoto N. Maillard React. 1990; : 461Google Scholar). This was confirmed by both heterocorrelation analysis (Fig. 3 C), which showed which protons are linked to which carbon, and ES mass spectrometry using ion-trap methodology (LCQ), which revealedm/z at 393.4 with MS/MS Fragments at 376 (loss of OH), 348 (loss of 1 COOH), 264 (loss of 1 norleucine), and 219 (the 264 fragment with additional loss of 1 COOH) (Fig. 5,A and B).

From a pool of 22 lenses (Pirie pigmentation stage II–IV and brunescent; age range: 44–86 years), 2.6 and 4.6 μg (based on the extinction coefficient for vesperlysine A, see below) were obtained from the water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions, respectively. Fluorescence at various pHs and UV spectra are shown in Fig.6. The fluorescence spectra of synthetic and native LM-1 varied with the pH, confirming the presence of a titrable proton on the ring, and were identical for both the synthetic and native compound (Fig. 6, A and C). Vesperlysine A had two previously unreported UV maxima at 302 and 363 nm, which were identical with those of native LM-1 (Fig. 6,B and D) and those originally reported by Nagaraj and Monnier (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Extinction maxima calculated for the synthetic vesperlysine A were 1841 and 1812 mol−1·liter·cm−1, respectively.Figure 6Fluorescence (at pH 1.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 12.6) and absorption spectra of vesperlysine A (A andB) and LM-1 (C andD) isolated from the incubation ofN α -acetyl-l-lysine and d-ribose and from human lenses, respectively.Fluorescence excitation was set at 380 nm for the emission spectra, and emission was set at 440 nm for the excitation spectra.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further strengthen the possible homology between vesperlysine A and LM-1, the preparations were analyzed by ES mass spectrometry using direct injection into the LCQ mass spectrometer. The full spectrum for LM-1 shows a m/z signal at 393.3 (Fig. 5 C). The MS/MS of m/z 393.3 shows the identical fragments for LM-1 (Fig. 5 D) corresponding to those of vesperlysine A (Fig.5 B). It is important to note here that, out of concern for potential carryover of material from previous injections, nosynthetic standard was injected into the LCQ instrument on the day the native LM-1 analysis was performed. Furthermore, the HPLC injector that was used for serial purification of LM-1 had never been exposed to synthetic vesperlysine A, thereby excluding the possibility of cross-contamination between the synthetic and native material. As a final proof of the identity of LM-1 with vesperlysine A, both synthetic and native compounds were acetylated with acetic anhydride and the reaction products were analyzed by C-18 reverse phase chromatography. In both cases the retention times of the fluorescent compounds were greatly retarded and eluted at 41.2 min, and in both cases a degradation compound was formed upon storage of the preparation, which eluted at 40.8 min (data not shown). The former peak likely corresponds to the fully acetylated vesperlysine A of which the unstable O-acetyl group on the ring is spontaneously cleaved off upon storage. Mass spectrometric analysis with the LCQ mass spectrometer showed a m/z signal at 477.7 for the acetylated vesperlysine A. The MS/MS of m/z 477.7 shows four major fragments with m/z signal at 459.2 (loss of 1 OH), 435.2 (loss of 1 acetyl), 389.3 (loss of 2 COOH), and 306.2 (loss of 1N α-acetylnorleucine) (spectra not shown).Based on the findings above indicating identity between LM-1 and vesperlysine A, LM-1 is referred to as vesperlysine A for all subsequent studies described below.Vesperlysine A in Biological TissuesPreanalytical StudiesFor analysis of vesperlysine A in biological tissue, a number of pre-analytical variables were evaluated. They are summarized as follows. The yield of vesperlysine A from bovine serum albumin that was glycated for 80 days with 53 mmd-ribose in 200 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was unaffected by hydrolysis time (12 to 18 h) or presence of oxidizing conditions (O2 and presence of 100 μm CuSO4) during acid hydrolysis of 3 mg/ml protein for 18 h at 110 °C. Furthermore, presence of added glucose or ribose (2 mm each) during hydrolysis had no effect on the yield. Finally, vesperlysine A was not an artifact of acid-hydrolyzed ribated protein because vesperlysine A could also be obtained from unprotected l-lysine and d-ribose reacted at 50 °C (pH 7.4) without acid hydrolysis.Detection of Vesperlysine A in the Human LensHuman lenses (age: 16–86 years; n = 46) were separated into WS and WI fractions and analyzed by a two-step HPLC system using fluorescence at 440 nm (excitation at 370 nm). An age-related increase was noted in both water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions (Fig.7 A). A shallow increase of the regression line (r 2 = 0.32, p < 0.05) was noted in the water-soluble fraction, which reached only 2.5 pmol/mg of protein at 90 years (individual data points not shown). In contrast, a sharp curvilinear increase (r 2 = 0.85, p < 0.001) was noted in the insoluble fraction, which reached 20 pmol/mg at 90 years, i.e. 6–8 fold higher than in the soluble fraction. Moreover, most of the values from diabetic lenses were increased, including in those the WS fraction in which the highest diabetic value reached 10 pmol/mg (data not shown).Figure 7Levels of vesperlysine A (A), furosine (B), pentosidine (C) andN ε -(carboxymethyl)lysine (D) in water-insoluble lens crystallins from diabetic (■) and non-diabetic (♦) subjects as a function of age.

It is readily apparent that, with age, a curvilinear increase is observed for CML, pentosidine, and vesperlysine A, in contrast to furosine, the concentration of which remains unchanged, as previously reported by Patrick (7Patrick J.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Gerontol. Biol. Sci. 1990; 45: B18-B23Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only vesperlysine A and furosine are elevated beyond normal values in diabetic lenses. Finally, CML stands out as the major modification, followed by furosine, vesperlysine A, and pentosidine, the levels of which are 6, 150, and 500 times lower than CML at the end of life span, respectivelyFurther correlation was sought with the degree of pigmentation of the lenses using the classification of Pirie (5Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1965; 4: 629-637PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.8). A strong relationship was noted with lens color for all advanced Maillard products, except for vesperlysine A, the concentration of which is decreased in the highly pigmented, so-called brunescent lenses. Differences between diabetic and non-diabetic lenses were significant for furosine in all lens types (p < 0.001), and for vesperlysine A in type III and IV lenses (p < 0.001).Figure 8Levels of vesperlysine A (A), furosine (B), pentosidine (C), andN ε -(carboxymethyl)lysine (D) in water-insoluble crystallins from lenses classified on the basis of pigmentation.

As shown in TableI, all markers were significantly correlated with total fluorescence except furosine. Interestingly, removing the values for the diabetic lenses ameliorated the correlation coefficients for all advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and removing the brunescent lenses ameliorated the correlation coefficient of vesperlysine A and pentosidine. Most impressively, CML had the highest correlation coefficient in normal subjects, suggesting that it is an excellent surrogate marker for the process responsible for total fluorescence at 310/430 nm. We determined that vesperlysine A accounted for at most 5% of the total fluorescence at 370/440 nm in the water-insoluble proteins of old lens crystallins.Table ICorrelation coefficients (r2) between total lenticular fluorescence (310/430 nm) and AGEs or furosine in water-insoluble crystallinsGlycation productNormal and diabetic (n = 31)Normal (n = 21)Normal1-aBrunescent lenses excluded. and diabetic (n = 27)Normal1-aBrunescent lenses excluded.

Open table in a new tab Mechanism of Formation of Vesperlysine AStudies on the mechanism of formation of vesperlysine A were performed. Poly-l-lysine (9 g/liter) was incubated in 200 mm phosphate buffer with 50 mm carbonyl compound (d-glucose, d-ribose,d-arabinose, d-threose,dl-glyceraldehyde, methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and ascorbic acid) for 7 days at 37 °C. The results (TableII) show that vesperlysine A could be efficiently synthesized from ribose, threose, and ascorbate, but not from glucose, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and glyceraldehyde. Arabinose and xylose were also precursors.Table IIThe effects of incubation of various sugars, oxoaldehydes and ascorbic acid with poly-l-lysine (10 g/liter) for 7 days at 37 °C on the formation of vesperlysine ASugar (50 mM)Vesperlysine Anmol/mmol l-lysineGlucoseND2-aND, not detected.Ribose20.4Arabinose3.3Xylose4.5Threose22.9GlyceraldehydeNDGlyoxalNDMethylglyoxalNDAscorbic acid8Incubation was in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).2-a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Because the heterocyclic ring of vesperlysine A requires the participation of 7 carbon atoms, we hypothesized addition of C-2 and C-3 carbonyl compounds should have a catalytic effect on vesperlysine A formation from C-5 sugars. A dramatic, dose-dependent increase in vesperlysine A was noted with glyoxal and glycolaldehyde (Fig. 9, A and B). Although some effect was noted with dl-glyceraldehyde (Fig.9 D), methylglyoxal had not catalytic effect (Fig.9 C, see value of the y scale). We tentatively attribute the very small increase observed to the presence of potential contaminant(s) reported present in commercial batch of methylglyoxal (8Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 9Catalytic effect of C-2 and C-3 carbonyl compounds on vesperlysine A formation. Increasing concentration (0, 1, 5, and 10 mm) of glyoxal (A), glycolaldehyde (B), methylglyoxal (C), or glyceraldehyde (D) were initially added to the incubation mixture of poly-l-lysine (9 g/liter) andd-ribose (10 mm) in 200 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Vesperlysine A was detected and quantified using a two-column HPLC system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In light of the fact that glyoxal and arabinose are autoxidation products of glucose (9Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), repeated attempts were made to obtain vesperlysine A from glucose under aerobic conditions and high phosphate buffer (200 mm) to enhance glucose autoxidation (9Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, none succeeded.Vesperlysine A in Other TissuesVesperlysine A was quantitated in the collagen-rich acid-insoluble fraction from heart, kidney, lung, and skin, as well as in the trichloroacetic acid precipitate from plasma, red blood cell, liver, and lens from streptozotocin diabetic and non-diabetic rats after 8 weeks of diabetes. Levels were almost nondetectable (<1 pmol/mg of protein). Similarly, very low levels and no increase were found in highly insoluble skin collagen from a 90- versus 15-year-old human donor. Vesperlysine A was also quantitated in the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated fraction from 4 healthy subjects, 4 diabetic, and 4 uremic subjects. Levels were 4.72 ± 0.86, 3.5 ± 0.58, and 5.33 ± 0.66 pmol/mg of protein, respectively.DISCUSSIONA chromatographic peculiarity appears to underlie former failures to synthesize LM-1 fromN α-acetyl-l-lysine andd-ribose, in that no fluorescent peak was observed at the expected retention time for LM-1 using the C-18 reverse phase column. 2F. Tessier, M. Obrenovich, and V. M. Monnier, unpublished data. This led to the erroneous conclusion LM-1 could not possibly be a lysine dimer. Similar observations were made in the initial phase of the current study. Subsequently, we found the retention time of vesperlysine A was significantly affected by the concomitant presence of amino acids. Thus, identical retention times between LM-1 and vesperlysine A were observed only when vesperlysine A was either added to lens protein hydrolysate, or injected mixed together with, e.g., acid-hydrolyzed bovine serum albumin. The awareness of this chromatographic idiosyncrasy eventually allowed us to demonstrate full identity between LM-1 and vesperlysine A in terms of chromatographic behavior in two systems, with and without derivatization with acetic anhydride, as well as spectral analysis.Vesperlysines were first described in vitro by Ienaga and colleagues (2Nakamura K. Nakzawa Y. Ienaga K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as a family of fluorescent sugar-derived cross-links ofl-lysine. In our studies, the single major fluorescent peak at LM-1 retention time corresponded to vesperlysine A. However, a second minor peak that was also elevated in old lenses co-chromatographed at 18 min with another synthetic lysine-ribose advanced product (data not shown), suggesting other vesperlysines might also be present in the human lens.In depth studies on the mechanism of LM-1/vesperlysine A formation were carried out, and the results were compared with our former study (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and that of Nakamura (2Nakamura K. Nakzawa Y. Ienaga K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). First, we were able to reproduce our previous findings (1Nagaraj R.H. Monnier V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that LM-1 could be most efficiently made fromd-ribose and ascorbate, but also d-threose. In our previous study, neither fructose nor glucose were precursors. In contrast to Nakamura et al., numerous attempts to make vesperlysine A from glucose, even in presence of 200 mmnon-Chelex-treated phosphate buffer, failed. This was rather unexpected in view of the fact that both d-arabinose and glyoxal are autoxidation products of glucose (9Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), which should act in concert as vesperlysine A precursors, as suggested by the kinetic experiments in Fig. 9. This discrepancy suggests presence of competing reactions, possibly by glucose itself and other products for sites necessary for vesperlysine A formation. Further possible differences include the utilization by Nakamura et al. of pentylamine instead of lysine as a reactant. Finally, we have utilized a highly specific two-column system in all our analytical studies, which may have helped achieve better separation of vesperlysine isomers.The inability of C-2 and C-3 sugar fragments and oxoaldehydes per se to make vesperlysine A is in agreement with its structure. However, based on its structure, we hypothesized and confirmed that both glyoxal and glycolaldehyde are vesperlysine A precursors when added to d-ribose. The presence of these oxoaldehydes in t"

In view of the emerging concept of the “glycosphingolipid-enriched domain” (GEM), we studied the mechanism of the ganglioside effect, focusing on the structure and function of such a domain. GEM in Neuro2a cells, separated as a low density membrane fraction, contains essentially all glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin, together with five signal transducer molecules (c-Src, Lyn, Csk, Rho A, Ha-Ras). 3H-Labeled Il3NeuAc-LacCer (GM3), Gb4Cer (globoside), and Il3NeuAc-Gg4Cer (GM1) added exogenously to cells were incorporated and concentrated in the low density GEM fraction.

Brief stimulation of an isolated GEM fraction by the exogenous addition of GM3, but not lactosylceramide, caused enhanced c-Src phosphorylation with a concomitant decrease of Csk level in GEM. A decreased Csk/c-Src ratio in GEM may cause activation of c-Src because Csk is a negative regulator of c-Src. The effect of exogenous GM3 on c-Src activity was also observed in intact Neuro2a cells. Activation of c-Src was followed by rapid and prolonged (60 min) enhancement of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity leading to neuritogenesis. Thus, the ganglioside induction of neuritogenesis in Neuro2a cells is mediated by GEM structure and function.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xviiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Considering the fact that differentiation and neuritogenesis of Neuro2a cells are inducible by gangliosides but not by NGF, we studied the composition and functional organization of GEM at the surface of these cells. Special focus was on the effect of exogenous gangliosides in inducing c-Src activation in GEM, leading to downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation resulting in neuritogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsGM3 was prepared from dog erythrocytes (20Klenk E. Heuer K. Z. Verdauungs u Stoffwechselkrankheiten. 1960; 20: 180-183PubMed Google Scholar). Gg3 was prepared from guinea pig erythrocytes (21Seyama Y. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GM1 from bovine brain was from Fidia Research Laboratories (Italy). Gb4 and lactosylceramide (LacCer) were from human erythrocytes (22Hakomori S. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S. Sphingolipid Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1983: 1-165Crossref Google Scholar). GM1 and Gb4 were radiolabeled at the terminal sugar residue using the galactose oxidase-[3H4]NaB procedure (23Suzuki Y. Suzuki K. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GM3 radiolabeled at C-3 of the long chain base was kindly provided by Prof. S. Sonnino (University of Milan, Italy) (24Sonnino S. Nicolini M. Chigorno V.

For the specific activity of 3H-labeled GSLs and PC applied for incorporation into cells, see the Fig. 5 legend. Specific anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody DH2 (IgG3) (25Dohi T. Nores G. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5680-5685PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-Gg3 monoclonal antibody 2D4 (IgM) (26Young W.W.J. MacDonald E.M.S. Nowinski R.C. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were established as described previously. Specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed to caveolin, Lyn, Rho A, Ha-Ras, Csk, and other transducer molecules were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-c-Src polyclonal IgG (N-16, Santa Cruz) and rabbit anti-c-Src polyclonal IgG (SRC2), which recognize different epitopes of c-Src protein, were used for combinations of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments. Goat anti-ERK1 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz) was used in the MAPK activation assay. Lavendustin C was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [3H4]NaB (204.1 mCi/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products.Cell CultureMouse Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells (CCL-131, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT), 4 mml-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 4.5 mg/mld-glucose, 100 units/ml potassium penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified atmosphere.GEM PreparationMembrane fraction presumably corresponding to the GSL-enriched microdomain (GEM) was prepared from Neuro2a cells by ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient after lysis and homogenization in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (27Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or in hypertonic sodium carbonate medium (28Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) by modification of original procedure as described below. After ultracentrifugation, 1-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. GEM was also prepared after stimulation of Neuro2a cells with different GSLs as described under “Effect of Gangliosides on c-Src Activation in Intact Cells.”Detergent MethodCells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mm Na3VO4, lysed, homogenized, and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate the low density light-scattering membranous fraction (16Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 27Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–5 × 107 cells were suspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, containing 1% Triton X-100, Dounce homogenized, and the “postnuclear fraction” was subjected to gradient ultracentrifugation (16Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), i.e. the fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in the same buffer. The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose concentration gradient (30–5%) in the same buffer. Samples were centrifuged for 17 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C. A white light-scattering band under light illumination located between 5 and 30% sucrose interface was collected and used as the GEM fraction. The entire procedure was performed at 0–4 °C (in ice immersion). The protein content of each fraction was determined using a MicroBCA kit (Pierce Chemical Co.).Hypertonic Sodium Carbonate MethodCells were harvested in 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (2–4 × 107 cells/2 ml) and homogenized using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a bath sonicator (three 20-s bursts). 1.5 ml of the cell homogenate thus obtained was mixed with an equal volume of 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (30–5% in the same buffer containing 250 mm sodium carbonate). Samples were submitted to ultracentrifugation, and the light-scattering band just above the 5–30% sucrose interface was collected and designated as the GEM fraction as above. The protein content of each fraction was determined as above.Determination of Distribution Patterns of Glycosphingolipids, Sphingomyelin, Glycerophospholipids, and Cholesterol in Fractions Obtained from Sucrose Gradient CentrifugationGEM and other fractions obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above were analyzed to determine the lipid content. Each fraction was dialyzed against water to eliminate sucrose and then lyophilized. Residues were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the lipid extracts were subjected to repeated Folch-Pi partition (29Folch-Pi J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting aqueous phases were purified further using C18 Bond elut packed columns (1 ml, Analytichem International, Harbor, CA) (30Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and subjected to HPTLC. Gangliosides were visualized using orcinol-sulfuric acid staining. GM3 was detected by immunostaining using anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody DH2 and a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) using biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody and diaminobenzidine substrate for the final staining (31Mårtensson S. Brodin T. Carlström A.-S. Dahmen J. Frejd T. Gunnarsson A. Jansson U. Magnusson G. Lundblad A. Glycoconj. J. 1986; 3: 163-174Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The organic phases from the Folch-Pi partition were subjected to alkaline methanolysis (32Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Eng L.F. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) to remove interfering glycerophospholipid, and the content of neutral GSL and SM was analyzed by HPTLC. Glycerophospholipids and cholesterol were separated directly from the lower phase of the Folch-Pi partition without alkaline methanolysis and were subjected to HPTLC. Neutral GSLs and gangliosides were separated by TLC with solvent chloroform/methanol/water 5:4:1 and visualized by spraying with 0.5% orcinol in 10% sulfuric acid. SM and glycerophospholipids were separated by TLC in solvent chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water 10:2:4:2:1 and revealed with phosphomolybdate spray (33Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol was separated by TLC in solvent hexane/diethyether/acetic acid 80:20:1 and visualized by spraying with 15% solution of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1-butanol. In all cases, the quantity of lipids and their ratio were determined by densitometry in comparison with a known quantity of standard lipid using the Scion Image program (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). For determination of 3H-labeled GSLs, TLC autoradiography was performed by exposure to Kodak BioMax MS film at −80 °C with Kodak TranScreen-LE intensifying screen.Distribution of Signal Transducer Molecules in Fractions Obtained from Sucrose Gradient CentrifugationFor analysis of distribution of transducer molecules, GEM and other fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar) using commercially available specific antibodies as described previously (16Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In some experiments, aliquots of GEM (containing ∼30 μg of protein) were diluted 10-fold in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 75 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated by adding 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-Csk polyclonal IgG, 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-c-Src polyclonal IgG, or 1 μg/ml normal rabbit IgG (as negative control). Immunoprecipitates were recovered by adding protein G-Sepharose beads, washed with IP buffer, suspended with 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting.Coimmunoprecipitation of GM3 and c-SrcNeuro2a cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (500 μg of protein/ml of buffer) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 75 milliunits/ml aprotinin and allowed to stand for 20 min. The cell suspension was Dounce homogenized, lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,300 ×g, and 1 ml of supernatant was mixed with protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl packed) and stirred by rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation (500 × g for 1 min), the supernatant was added to 20 μl of DH2 ascites or 20 μl of mouse myeloma SP2 ascites as negative control. The mixtures were placed overnight in a rotary stirrer at 4 °C, added to protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl packed), and placed again in a rotary mixer for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with IP buffer, recovered by brief weak centrifugation (270 × g, 2 min), suspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged (1,000 × g, 2 min).Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, with the first run performed through 5–15% gradient gel under nonreducing conditions. The second run was performed through 8% gel under reducing conditions. Subsequently, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunodetected as described previously (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). The purpose of the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE procedure was to improve detection of c-Src, avoiding interference from the presence of mouse IgG (from DH2 antibody).Incorporation of Exogenous Gangliosides, GSLs, and PC in GEM and Other Membrane and Soluble Fractions from Neuro2a CellsPreconfluent Neuro2a cells cultured in 150-mm dishes were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated in the same medium for 10 min or 1 h in the presence of 10 μm[3H-Sph]GM3, [3H-Gal]GM1, [3H-GalNAc]Gb4, or [arachidonyl-3H-]PC (10 ml, 0.25 μCi/ml, specific activity 0.025 Ci/mmol). For specific activity of3H-labeled GSLs and PC applied for incorporation into cells, we followed the protocol described previously (35Riboni L. Prinetti A. Pitto M. Tettamanti G. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, [3H]GM3 solution in ethanol (76 μl, containing 73,000 dpm/μl; specific activity 2 Ci/mmol; equivalent to 2.5 μCi and 1.25 nmol) was mixed with 9.87 μl of 10 mm solution of cold GM3 solution in ethanol. Lipid solution was concentrated under a nitrogen stream to near dryness (∼10 μl), and 10 ml of DMEM was added, sonicated, and allowed to stand at 37 °C for 2 h. DMEM solution of 3H-labeled GM1 or Gb4 was prepared in the same way, with approximately the same specific activity. For preparation of DMEM solution of 3H-labeled PC, 25 μl of [3H]PC solution (0.1 mCi/ml; specific activity 175 Ci/mmol) was mixed with 200 μl of 0.5 mm ethanol solution of cold PC prepared from bovine brain and concentrated under a nitrogen stream to near dryness, and 10 ml of DMEM was added, sonicated, and allowed to stand at 37 °C as above. Thus, the DMEM solution of3H-labeled lipids (10 μm) with a specific activity 0.025 Ci/mmol, corresponding to radioactivity of 0.25 μCi/ml, was obtained. After incubation, cells were washed three times with 10% FBS and DMEM and incubated for 30 min in the same medium to remove the loosely bound portion of lipid (38Cannella M.S. Roisen F.J. Ogawa T. Sugimoto M. Ledeen R.W. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 39: 137-143Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in the same buffer. Two dishes were pooled for each experimental point and subjected to GEM preparation by the detergent method described above. Radioactivity associated with postnuclear supernatant and sucrose gradient fractions was determined by liquid scintillation with a Beckmann LS6000IC counter.Effect of GM3 on c-Src Activation and Src/Csk Interaction in Isolated GEMGEM was diluted 10× with kinase buffer (30 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2 1 mm CaCl2) (protein content 7–10 μg/ml), and 5-ml aliquots of diluted GEM suspension were used for stimulation by GM3, by the following procedure. The stock solution of GM3 was prepared as a 10 mm solution in absolute ethanol. 5 μl of this solution was added to 5 ml of GEM suspension (final concentration of ethanol in GEM suspension was 0.1%). As a control, GEM suspension was added to an ethanol solution of LacCer having the same concentration as GM3 or ethanol alone (final ethanol concentration in GEM suspension was 0.1%). In some experiments, lavendustin C (36O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) was added to GEM suspension with GM3. A stock solution of lavendustin C (50 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared, and 5, 10, or 15 μl of the stock solution was added to 5 ml of GEM suspension to obtain, respectively, 50, 100, or 150 μm final concentration of lavendustin C. Dimethyl sulfoxide at these concentrations had no effect on c-Src activity. c-Src activity was determined by adding 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP solution (370 GBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in 50 μl of kinase buffer and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 5 min. After incubation, reactions were stopped by placing on ice and adding 5 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (30 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were washed twice with acetone and dissolved in 1.0 ml of IP buffer. Samples were added to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and placed on a rotary stirrer for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation for 5 min at 270 × g, the supernatants were collected and mixed with 1 μg/ml goat anti-Src IgG. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed five times with IP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and boiled with SDS-sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The electroblotted membranes were subjected to autoradiography. Separated proteins were also evaluated by Western blotting. In some experiments, incubation of GEM with GM3 was carried out in the absence of radioactive ATP for different times. After adding stop buffer, samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src or anti-Csk antibodies as described above, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.Effect of Gangliosides on c-Src Activation in Intact CellsPreconfluent Neuro2a cells cultured in 150-mm dishes were washed extensively with serum-free DMEM and incubated in the presence of 10 μm GM3, GM1, or LacCer (from 10 mm stock solution in ethanol) in serum-free DMEM for 5, 15, or 30 min. Cells were harvested, and GEM was prepared from stimulated cells using the detergent method described above. Aliquots of GEM from different samples containing roughly the same amount of protein (typically 30 μg) were diluted to 500 μl with water and added to the same volume of 2 × IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Triton X-100). Mixtures were precleared with protein G-Sepharose. Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation, added to 1 μg/ml goat anti-c-Src IgG, and incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation after adding protein G-Sepharose beads, and the immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described above.Effect of Lavendustin C on Ganglioside-dependent Neuritogenesis in Neuro2a CellsNeuro2a cells (5,000 cells/cm2) were incubated in 2% FBS and DMEM in the absence or presence of 100 μmlavendustin C. After 1 h, cells were incubated further in the presence of 10 μm GM3 or GM1 in the same medium with or without lavendustin C, and the degree of morphological differentiation was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test.Measurement of MAPK Activation in Neuro2a CellsNeuro2a cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (15,000 cells/cm2) and cultured 24 h in 10% FBS and DMEM. Cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated in the presence of 10 μm GM3, GM1, or LacCer in serum-free DMEM for various times (0–60 min). Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mmNa3VO4, scraped in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 75 units/ml aprotinin), and sonicated for 10 s 10 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and precleared for nonspecific binding with protein G-Sepharose."
https://openalex.org/W2033933409,"Sphingolipid-rich rafts play an essential role in the posttranslational (Borchelt, D. R., Scott, M., Taraboulos, A., Stahl, N., and Prusiner, S. B. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 743–752)) formation of the scrapie prion protein PrPSc from its normal conformer PrPC(Taraboulos, A., Scott, M., Semenov, A., Avrahami, D., Laszlo, L., Prusiner, S. B., and Avraham, D. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 129, 121–132). We investigated the importance of sphingolipids in the metabolism of the PrP isoforms in scrapie-infected ScN2a cells. The ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1(FB1) reduced both sphingomyelin (SM) and ganglioside GM1 in cells by up to 50%, whereas PrPSc increased by 3–4-fold. Whereas FB1 profoundly altered the cell lipid composition, the raft residents PrPC, PrPSc, caveolin 1, and GM1 remained insoluble in Triton X-100. Metabolic radiolabeling demonstrated that PrPC production was either unchanged or slightly reduced in FB1-treated cells, whereas PrPSc formation was augmented by 3–4-fold. To identify the sphingolipid species the decrease of which correlates with increased PrPSc, we used two other reagents. When cells were incubated with sphingomyelinase for 3 days, SM levels decreased, GM1 was unaltered, and PrPSc increased by 3–4-fold. In contrast, the glycosphingolipid inhibitor PDMP reduced PrPSc while increasing SM. Thus, PrPSc seems to correlate inversely with SM levels. The effects of SM depletion contrasted with those previously obtained with the cholesterol inhibitor lovastatin, which reduced PrPSc and removed it from detergent-insoluble complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2160740275,"In this report, we describe the inactivation and site-specific light induction of plasmid expression using a photosensitive caging compound. Plasmids coding for luciferase were caged with 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane (DMNPE) and transfected into ∼1-cm diameter sites of the skin of rats with particle bombardment. Skin sites transfected with caged plasmids did not express luciferase. However, subsequent exposure of transfected skin sites to 355-nm laser light induced luciferase expression in proportion to the amount of light. Liposome transfection of HeLa cells with DMNPE-caged green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmids showed similar results. Caging DNA with DMNPE blocks expression at the level of transcription, since in vitro production of mRNA from linearized GFP plasmid was also blocked by caging and subsequently restored by exposure to light. Under the reaction conditions of these experiments, our absorbance data indicate that each DMNPE-caged GFP plasmid contains ∼270 caging groups. In addition to inhibition and subsequent restoration of plasmid bioactivity, the presence and photocleavage of this relatively small number of cage groups also alters electrophoretic mobility of plasmids and optical absorption characteristics. This light-induced expression strategy provides a new means to target the expression of genetic material with spatial and temporal specificity.

This light-induced expression strategy provides a new means to target the expression of genetic material with spatial and temporal specificity. The unrealized goal of in vivo gene therapy is the controlled expression of exogenous genes exclusively within a target cell population. Successful in vivo gene therapy must overcome two significant challenges: 1) delivery of transgenes to the specific target cell population and 2) subsequent expression only within these cells. Viral and nonviral technologies for delivery of transgenes to specific target cells are currently under development, but none of these techniques is suitable in its current form for targeted delivery of transgenes in vivo. Nonspecific delivery of “silent” genes followed by site-specific induction is one potential targeting strategy. Several postdelivery expression strategies have been described (1Yarranton G.T. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These may be broadly classified into induction by tissue-specific promoters and induction by changes in the cellular environment. Tissue-specific promoters (2Hart I.R. Semin.

Most current induction strategies add factors to the cellular milieu to control expression. These factors include metal ion concentration (4Searle P.F. Stuart G.W. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Cell.

However, targeted expression with environmental induction agents is difficult, since it requires limiting the in vivo distribution of the induction agents solely to the target cell population. To achieve site-specific expression, a strategy permitting spatially targeted induction is needed. In this report, we describe a targeting strategy based on “cage” chemistry. Caged compounds have a covalently attached group that is rapidly cleaved upon exposure to near-UV light. Attachment of the caging compound renders the bioactive molecule inert, until photolysis releases it in its bioactive form (12Kaplan J.H. Forbush B.D. Hoffman J.F.

Caged compounds have been used in a number of temporal biological studies to examine cell motility, the chemistry of muscle contractility, active transport proteins, biological membranes, and other intracellular responses (14McCray J.A.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar), in the synthesis of biochip oligonucleotides (17McGall G. Labadie J. Brock P. Wallraff G. Nguyen T. Hinsberg W. Proc. Natl.

MacMillan A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3173-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Application of caging chemistry to plasmid DNA offers the possibility of light-activated expression after delivery to cells, and furthermore, since light exposure can be spatially controlled, this photoactivation approach has the potential to produce targeted expression. 5 mg of 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitroacetophenone hydrazone and 50 mg of manganese(IV) oxide were gently agitated in 1 ml of Me2SO at 25 °C for 20 min (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Manganese oxide was removed from the activated caging compound by filtering the solution through 100 mg of CeliteTM supported by glass wool in a 1 cm3 tuberculin syringe. 150 μl of the filtrate was agitated with 150 μg of plasmid DNA in 300 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C. In order to remove all excess caging compound from the reaction, the caged plasmid DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. Caged plasmids were stored in TE buffer at 4 °C, protected from light. pGreenLantern-1 plasmid (pGFP, Life Technologies, Inc.), DMNPE-caged pGFP, ATP, and DMNPE-caged ATP (Molecular Probes) were dissolved in water in separate cuvettes (pGFP, 135 μg/ml; ATP, 55 μg/ml) and scanned for absorbance from 200 to 450 nm (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 Spectrometer). After an initial scan, the cuvette contents containing caged pGFP and caged ATP were exposed to 365-nm light at a distance of 10 cm for 20 min. This lamp has a peak output at 365 nm and a fluence rate of 4.68 milliwatts/cm2at 10 cm (Blak Ray, San Gabriel, CA; model B 100 AP). Spectrographic characterization of this lamp confirmed that the emission spectrum is 365 ± 8 nm (Triax-180 spectrograph; Instruments S.A., Edison, NJ). Approximately 5 min after the light exposure ended, the cuvette contents were rescanned, and the postlight absorbances were compared with the prelight spectra. The extinction coefficient (ελ = 355) of the bound caging DMNPE group was calculated from the local absorbance peak at 355 nm before exposures to 365-nm light of commercially available DMNPE-caged ATP (Molecular Probes). The extinction coefficient for DMNPE-ATP (ελ = 355) was obtained from the expression, ελ=355=Aλ=355cb=0.357(0.89)(75μM)(1cm)=5340M−1cm−1Equation 1 where A λ = 355 represents absorbance at 355 nm, c represents molar concentration of solution, andb represents path length of the cuvette (1 cm). The concentration value (75 μm) used in this calculation was adjusted to account for the 89% of ATP that was reported to be caged (19Molecular Probes Photoactivatable (“Caged”) Probes Product Information Sheet. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1997Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient was then used to determine the molar concentration of DMNPE in the caged plasmid samples by measuring the absorbance at 355 nm. From these data, an average number of DMNPE caging groups per plasmid was then calculated. 150 ng of pGreenLantern-1 plasmid per well was run in 1% agarose in Tris acetate buffer (4 mm Tris acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) at 5 V/cm for 1 h 45 min. Gels were stained after electrophoresis with 1× SYBR-Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes) in 1× Tris acetate buffer for 15 min. The line profile analysis tool in Image Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) was used to quantify band intensities. BamHI-linearized pGreenLantern-1 plasmid was used as the template for the MEGAscriptTM In Vitro Transcription Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, catalog no. 1330). 1 μg of DMNPE-caged and control plasmid templates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in the enzyme mixture supplied with the kit. Immediately prior to incubation, one caged sample was exposed to 365-nm light as described above. Gels were stained after electrophoresis with 1× SYBR-Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes) in 1× MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) for 25 min. 5 μl of RNA product from the kit was run in 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde in 1× MOPS buffer at 4 V/cm for 1 h. For caged samples, 10 μl of kit product was loaded to improve visualization of the caged versus caged light-exposed bands. Gel band intensities were quantified using the summation statistics tool in Image Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Intensity values for each pixel were summed for each lane of the gel. Background values were measured over three separate empty lanes of the gel (not shown), averaged, and subtracted from all other measured values. HeLa cells were liposome-transfected with plasmids coding for GFP. 1 μg of pGreenLantern-1 plasmid was complexed with 6 μg of liposome in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) and used for transfection. Cationic liposomes (Dioleoyl-3-Trimethylammonium-Propane/Dioleoyl Phosphatidylethanolamine, 1:1) were prepared by vacuum evaporation followed by extrusion to yield unilamellar liposomes of 0.1 μm as described previously (20Tseng W.-C. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25641-25647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded onto 35-mm Petri dishes (Fisher) at 20,000 cells/cm2 16–18 h before transfection. 1 ml of the DNA-liposome complex in Opti-MEM was added to the cell culture dishes for 3.5 h, after which the solution was replaced with 1 ml of Opti-MEM. Both pre- and post-transfection effects of light were investigated. To study light-induced plasmid damage, matched cultures were transfected with plasmids that had been exposed to 5 J/cm2 of light with the lamp described in the spectral scanning protocol, or no light before transfection. In a second group of cultures, after liposomal transfection with unexposed plasmids, culture dishes were individually exposed to 0.5, 2.6, or 5.6 J/cm2 of light from the same light source. A third group of samples was transfected with unexposed DMNPE-caged pGFP and exposed to light in the same manner as the second group. Following light exposure, Opti-MEM medium in all culture dishes was replaced with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with cold calcium- and magnesium-free/phosphate-buffered saline twice, trypsinized (0.15%) and paraformaldehyde-fixed (1%) for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then washed with calcium- and magnesium-free/phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde three times, resuspended in calcium- and magnesium-free/phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde, and stored at 4 °C for flow cytometric analysis. Transfection samples were analyzed by a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson) flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser exciting at a wavelength of 488 nm. For each sample, 20,000 gated events were collected by list-mode data consisting of side scatter, forward scatter, and fluorescence emission centered at 530 nm (FL1), 580 nm (FL2), and 610 nm (FL3). Determination of positive events for GFP expression was made using a standard gating technique (20Tseng W.-C. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25641-25647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cytometric results from a nontransfected control sample were displayed on a dot plot of FL3versus FL1 fluorescence intensity. A gate was drawn along a line of maximum detected FL1 intensity for the control events. This gate was kept constant through analysis of all subsequent measurements. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was calculated as the ratio of the number of events within this gate divided by the total number of events collected. The plasmid used forin vivo rat studies was the luciferase expression plasmid pCEP4 coding for luciferase and containing the SV40 Poly(A) signal (Promega, Madison, WI). Particle-mediated gene delivery was achieved as reported in Ref. 21Benn S.I. Whitsitt J.S. Broadley K.N. Nanney L.B. Perkins D. He L. Patel M. Morgan J.R. Swain W.F. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. Briefly, plasmid DNA was precipitated on gold particles (2 μm in diameter) in the presence of 50 mmspermidine and 0.5 m CaCl2 at a final concentration of 2 μg of DNA/μg of gold. The DNA-gold complexes were washed extensively with absolute ethanol and resuspended in absolute ethanol. The suspension was then used to coat the interior of18-inch outside diameter Tefzel tubing (McMaster-Carr Supply Co., Elmhurst, IL) in a specially designed loading and drying apparatus (Agracetus, Inc., Elmhurst, IL). After the particles adhered to the tubing, it was cut into ½-inch lengths such that 0.5 μg of DNA-coated gold particles would be delivered with each dose. Prepared tubing segments were stored at −20 °C in a sealed, desiccated container. At the time of the experiment, the DNA-gold-coated tubes were brought to room temperature, loaded into the cylinder of the delivery device, and accelerated into the tissue by a rapid release of a pulse of helium with an electrically controlled valve at 400 p.s.i. Particles were deposited in a circular pattern with a diameter of ∼0.8 cm. Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g; Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were housed in the Vanderbilt Veterans Affairs animal care facility maintained according to the American Association for Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care Standards. The animals were allowed food and water ad libitum. All transfection and surgical procedures are carried out under general anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine. All animal procedures were approved under the guidelines of the local animal care and use committees. Cutaneous transfections were carried out with the animal under general anesthesia. Two rows of three sites per row distributed transversely across the dorsal surface were transfected with a single dose of the expression construct or caged DNA. The site was prepared by clipping the pelt and by treatment with the depilatory agent, Neet (Reckitt and Colman Inc., Wayne, NJ) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The plasmid-gold complexes were then transfected into the skin at the selected pressure by placing the muzzle of the gene gun in contact with the site. Within 1 h of particle-mediated gene transfer, selected transfection sites on each rat were exposed to targeted pulses of light with a Nd:YAG laser tuned to 355 nm (Vanderbilt University Free Electron Laser Facility). The total dosage for each site was either 1 or 10.8 J/cm2. Light was delivered in 10-mJ pulses at 10 Hz. The light pattern was circular and matched the dimensions of the transfection region. 24 h after transfection, animals were killed by carbon dioxide poisoning, pelts were removed, and tissue from transfection sites was isolated and halved. One half was sectioned, imaged, and analyzed in Image Pro Plus to determine average bead depth. The other half of each transfection site was homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Luciferase activity was measured in 20-μl aliquots of tissue lysate, with a 100-μl luciferase assay buffer consisting of 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmd-luciferin as provided by Promega using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.) set for single photon counting. The luciferase activity was expressed as counts/min. Fig. 1 shows the similarity of the absorbance spectra of DMNPE-caged pGFP plasmid prepared for these studies (top) and DMNPE-caged ATP obtained from Molecular Probes (bottom). Theupper solid curves are absorbance spectra before caged materials were exposed to light, and thedashed curves are spectra obtained 5 min after exposure to 20 min of 365-nm light. Light produced similar shifts in absorbance at 355 nm for both DMNPE-caged pGFP and commercially available DMNPE-caged ATP. After exposure to 365-nm light, increases in absorbance at 390 nm are observed for both compounds. This is presumably produced by photolysis of the caging group attached to ATP and pGFP. Native DNA plasmids and ATP do not absorb in the region from 300 to 450 nm (lower solid curves). Electrophoresis of caged plasmids shows characteristic changes in mobility corresponding to the addition and removal of the caging groups (Fig.2). Typical plasmid conformation bands are observed; the bands with greatest mobility correspond to multiple conformations observed with supercoiled bands (S), the least mobile bands correspond to the nicked conformations (N), and the bands that appear between these two groups are presumed to be relaxed (R) (22Johnson P.H. Grossman L.I. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The markers in lane A are from an EcoRI digest of λ DNA.Lane B is caged plasmid. Lane C contains caged light-exposed plasmid exposed to 20 min of 365-nm light. Lane D contains plasmid that was exposed to the caging reaction conditions but without the caging compound. Qualitatively, the greatest change produced by light is seen in the redistribution of the relaxed bands. To characterize the shifts in gel banding pattern between caged (B) and caged light-exposed plasmids (C), the areas under each of the relaxed band peaks (R) were calculated and compared for both caged and caged light-exposed plasmids. In the caged sample, the bands are approximately 1:1 in intensity. The distribution of amounts in these bands changes with light exposure, since this ratio for the caged light-exposed plasmid is 3:7, with the greater intensity in the most mobile band. Fig.3 shows a denaturing agarose gel of mRNA products from the in vitro transcription of DMNPE-caged plasmids. Caged pGFP plasmids are not transcribed in vitro (D). Caged light-exposed plasmids produce an mRNA band (E) with an amount similar to that produced by native plasmids (B) and caging reaction controls (C). In Fig. 3, the intensities for the native template and the template subjected to the extraction and isolation procedures of the caging reaction were within 10% of each other (103,264 and 114,830 counts, respectively). These values were averaged and used as a standard for comparison. The caged template and caged light-exposed template samples showed intensities of 35,522 and 59,311 counts. These values were halved to account for the increased (2×) loading of the caged and light-exposed lanes, resulting in mRNA production estimates of 3.6% for caged and 19% for caged light-exposed as percentages of the average mRNA production from the native template. The expression level of native pGFP was 43 ± 3.9% (n = 11, mean ± S.E.,gray bars, Fig. 4). Within each experiment, the percentages of GFP-positive cells were normalized with this positive control group. Without exposure to light (i.e. with 0 J/cm2 of 365-nm light) the fraction of HeLa cells that express caged pGFP (solid bar) is about one-fourth of the level of expression of native material (25.8%, n = 7). After exposure to 0.25 or 0.5 J/cm2 of light, expression of the caged material increases to 50% of control. The asterisks above thesebars indicate significant difference from expression of caged plasmids that received no light exposure (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's t test). Beyond 0.5 J/cm2, increased light dosages caused a decrease in expression levels of caged pGFP. Cultures transfected with caged pGFP and treated with 2.8 and 5.6 J/cm2 of light showed expression levels of 20 and 10% of control, respectively. These results were obtained from transfection experiments using caged plasmids from a single caging reaction. Products from other caging reactions produced varying amounts of expression between the caged and light-exposed states. These differences are most evident in the cage's ability to block expression and varied from almost 0% expression to ∼25% of control. However, caged plasmids from all reactions showed similar trends with at least a doubling of GFP expression after light exposure. Decreased expression of caged plasmids appeared to be reduced by higher levels of light exposure. This decrease in expression with increasing 365-nm light dosage was also observed for native pGFP plasmids. GFP expression levels decreased as post-transfection light exposure increased, from a normalized 100% with no light exposure, to 81, 24, and 10% with light exposures of 0.5, 2.6, or 5.6 J/cm2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, cultures exposed to 2.8 or 5.6 J/cm2 of light after transfection showed significantly lower levels of expression (denoted by crosses,p < 0.05, Bonferroni's t test) than those that received no light. This decrease is evidently not an effect of light on plasmid structure, since pGFP plasmids exposed to the highest dose of light (5.6 J/cm2) before transfection (bar labeled Pre-Flash) express at levels equal to control plasmids that received no light. Luciferase expression of skin sites transfected with caged plasmid is equal to background levels measured in nontransfected skin. Exposure of skin sites transfected with caged plasmids to increasing amounts of 355-nm laser light increased expression to 6 ± 3, 12 ± 4, and 17 ± 6% of control, respectively. The right bar indicates the highest expression (40 ± 12% of control) from skin sites transfected with caged plasmids exposed to light before delivery (Fig.5). The asterisks indicate difference from no light exposure by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (n = 4; mean ± S.E.). We used a simple in vivo test to demonstrate the feasibility of light-induced expression and its potential for targeting expression. Plasmids coding for luciferase were caged with 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)diazoethane and transfected into ∼1-cm diameter sites of rat skin with gold particle bombardment (21Benn S.I. Whitsitt J.S. Broadley K.N. Nanney L.B. Perkins D. He L. Patel M. Morgan J.R. Swain W.F. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The presence of the DMNPE cage groups on plasmids blocks expression; sites transfected with caged plasmids have expression levels equal to nontransfected skin sites (Fig. 5). However, luciferase expression is induced at sites transfected with caged plasmid and subsequently exposed to 355-nm laser light. A low dose of 355-nm light (1 J/cm2) increases luciferase expression to 6 ± 3% of positive control. Increasing the light dosage by an additional factor of 10 and 20 produces additional increases in luciferase expression to 12 ± 4 and 17 ± 6% of positive control. Caged plasmids subjected to 1.6 J/cm2 of light before particle-mediated delivery result in skin sites with the highest expression and are 40 ± 12% of positive control. Results from cytometric analysis of HeLa cells liposome-transfected with DMNPE-caged GFP plasmid also show that caging can reversibly block expression. Cells transfected with caged pGFP do not express GFP at the levels of cultures transfected with native pGFP. However, with exposure to 0.5 J/cm2 light, GFP expression is induced and increases from 25 to 50% of positive controls (Fig. 4). When doses of light greater than 0.5 J/cm2 were applied to the transfected cultures, expression levels decreased. This decrease was further characterized in tests of 365-nm light exposure on native pGFP expression. As shown by the gray bars in Fig. 4, increasing the light dose decreases the percentage of GFP-expressing cells transfected with native pGFP. Light levels above a threshold level 0.5 J/cm2 produced significantly lower levels of expression of native pGFP plasmid. In cultures transfected with native pGFP that had been given the highest exposure of light prior to transfection, expression levels were identical to nonexposed controls. This latter observation suggests that the decrease in expression is not due to plasmid damage caused by light exposure. Subsequent in vitro investigation suggests that the mechanism of expression blockade occurs at the transcriptional level. In an in vitro transcription assay, caging DNA blocks mRNA production, but after light-induced photo-activation, mRNA transcription is restored. The pattern of light-induced in vitro transcription (Fig. 3) is very similar to the pattern of light-induced expression observed in the expression study in rat skin. As seen in the rat skin study, caged DNA has near background levels of transcription; mRNA produced by the transcription of a caged pGFP linear template is only 3.7% of positive control. Further paralleling the in vivo expression results, the exposure of caged templates to 365-nm light increases the mRNA production 5-fold to 19% of control. As seen in vivo, complete restoration of bioactivity was not achieved despite matching the concentration of controls and caged products by absorbance at 260 nm. However, matching plasmid concentration using optical absorbance does not take into account the conformational state of the plasmids, which may be important for expression (23Weintraub H. Cheng P.F. Conrad K. Cell. 1986; 46: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Indeed, a DNA gel comparison with native plasmids or control plasmids (Fig. 2) shows that a substantial proportion of the caged plasmid is nicked, which is not seen in native plasmid. Furthermore, electrophoretic comparison of caged plasmids and caged plasmids exposed to light also indicates that there is a reversible alteration in caged plasmid structure produced by exposure to light. The DMNPE-caged plasmids exhibit lower mobility, resulting in characteristic band shifts seen in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The greatest light-induced change is seen in the pair of relaxed conformation bands with apparent linear molecular size of 10 kilobases. In the caged state, the distribution of plasmid between the two relaxed bands is approximately equal. After exposure to light, 70% of the relaxed form appears in the more mobile band. These shifts are consistent with the addition of the nonpolar DMNPE groups that retard plasmid mobility by neutralizing negative charges on the phosphate linkages of the DNA backbone. The characteristic absorbance of the DMNPE cage groups provides a convenient means to compare caged plasmids with other caged moieties. For example, light-induced changes in the absorbance of DMNPE-caged plasmid are similar to those observed with commercially available caged ATP (Fig. 1). The absorbance spectrums of DMNPE-caged ATP (Molecular Probes) and DMNPE-caged pGFP plasmid show similar peaks in absorbance at 355 nm (lower curves). Absorption at this wavelength is consistent with the presence of DMNPE caging group"

We describe the characterization of one member of a Brassica napussulfotransferase gene family coding for an enzyme that catalyzes theO-sulfonation of brassinosteroids and of mammalian estrogenic steroids. The enzyme is specific for the hydroxyl group at position 22 of brassinosteroids with a preference for 24-epicathasterone, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 24-epibrassinolide. Enzymatic sulfonation of 24-epibrassinolide abolishes its biological activity in the bean second internode bioassay. This mechanism of hormone inactivation by sulfonation is similar to the modulation of estrogen biological activity observed in mammals. Furthermore, the expression of the B. napussteroid sulfotransferase genes was found to be induced by salicylic acid, a signal molecule in the plant defense response. This pattern of expression suggests that, in addition to an increased synthesis of proteins having antimicrobial properties, plants respond to pathogen infection by modulating steroid-dependent growth and developmental processes.

Many developmental and physiological processes in organisms ranging from fungi to humans are regulated by a small number of steroid hormones. However, until recently the plant kingdom was almost completely excluded from the field of steroid endocrinology. The recent demonstration that the Arabidopsis de-etiolated2(det2) and the constitutive photomorphogenesisand dwarfism (cpd) mutants are defective in the synthesis of brassinosteroids (BRs) 1The abbreviations used are: BR, brassinosteroid; ST, sulfotransferase; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; SA, salicylic acid; PR, pathogenesis-related focused attention toward the physiological function of steroids in plants (1Li J.

Since this initial discovery, the structure of over 40 analogues of brassinolide has been elucidated, and BRs are believed to be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom (9Takatsuto S. J. Chromatogr. 1994; 658: 3-15Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In view of their structural similarities with animal steroids, it has been proposed that BRs might interact with a soluble receptor in order to regulate the expression of specific genes (Fig. 1). This hypothesis has recently been challenged with the molecular characterization of the Brassinosteroid-Insensitive-1(BRI1) gene that encodes a putative BR receptor (4Li J. Chory J. Cell. 1997; 90: 929-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The BRI1 protein belongs to a family of plant receptor-like transmembrane kinases. Members of this family have an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain, suggesting that BRs mediate their effects at the cell surface. Despite this important discovery, direct or indirect binding of BRs to the BRI1 receptor has not been demonstrated, and their mode of action remains to be characterized. In mammals, it is well recognized that sulfotransferases (STs) play an important role in the modulation of the biological activity of a number of compounds, such as steroid and thyroid hormones, and catecholamine neurotransmitters (10Hobkirk R.

Sulfonate conjugation not only facilitates transport and excretion of hydrophobic molecules by increasing their water solubility, it abolishes the biological activity of hormones, such as estrogens. Considering the important role of mammalian STs in the modulation of the biological activity of hormones, our research interest is to elucidate the function of plant STs in growth and development. In this paper, we describe the characterization of one member of a Brassica napus ST gene family coding for an enzyme that sulfonates BRs as well as mammalian estrogenic steroids. We also demonstrate that enzymatic sulfonation of 24-epibrassinolide abolishes its biological activity. In addition, our results indicate that the pattern of expression of the B. napus steroid ST gene is similar to other pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins,i.e. having very low constitutive expression in control seedlings and being inducible by salicylic acid (SA) (14Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Alexander D.C. Ahl-Goy P. Métraux J.-P. Ryals J.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This represents the first example where the function of a PR protein can be linked to the modulation of the biological activity of a plant hormone by conjugation. A B. napus genomic library constructed in pTZ18R was probed with 32P-labeledRaR047 cDNA (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) under conditions of high stringency according to standard procedures (16Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mapping analysis of two positive clones resulted in the identification of three genes (BNST1, -2, and -3), which were subcloned in pBSK−(Stratagene) and sequenced in an automated system (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences ofBNST1, -2, and -3 and RaR047 was created with the PILEUP program of the GCG sequence analysis package (17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCATCATCATCATCTG-3′; 5′-GGGAAGCTTAAACTATCATCATTAAAGC-3′) were designed to introduceBamHI and HindIII restriction sites at the respective 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region of BNST3 by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). This allowed the directional cloning of theBNST3 coding sequence in the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The expression of BNST3 in E. coli cultures (A 600 ≈0.7) was induced with 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thio-galactopyranoside for 9 h at 22 °C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by two passages in a French pressure cell (14,000 pounds/square inch). The recombinant BNST3 recovered in the soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose matrix as recommended (Qiagen). B. napus cv. Westar and Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia were grown in vermiculite under continuous white light. The roots of 7-day-old B. napus seedlings and of 5-week-oldA. thaliana plants were drenched with an aqueous sodium salicylate solution (10 mm, pH 7.0) and grown for various times. Plants were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and then either extracted in phenol/chloroform as described (18Cashmore A.R. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, NY1982: 387-392Google Scholar) to isolate total RNA or boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer to obtain total proteins. Northern blot analysis of total RNA was achieved under high stringency conditions according to standard procedures (16Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the32P-labeled coding region of BNST1 as a probe. Protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and STs were detected using anti-BNST1 polyclonal antibodies (dilution 1:3000) and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (dilution 1:3000; Bio-Rad). Anti-BNST1 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified recombinant BNST1 expressed in E. coli as the antigen. The antibodies were found to cross-react with BNST2 and -3 (data not shown). Analysis of substrate specificity was performed by testing enzymatic activity with three different concentrations of acceptor substrate as follows: 200, 5, and 0.1 μm. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) also contained 2 μm35S-labeled PAPS (NEN Life Science Products) and approximately 5 μg of affinity purified recombinant BNST3 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For kinetic analysis, a PAPS concentration of 5 μm was used in the same buffer. Concentrations of 24-epicathasterone were 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.2 μm and of 24-epiteasterone were 50, 20, 10, and 5 μm. Stock solutions (1 mm) of acceptor substrates were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol in the assay was 5%. Commercial substrates were obtained from Sigma, and desulfoglucosinolates were kindly provided by D. Reed, Plant Biotechnology Institute, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 25 °C. Incorporation of the35S-labeled sulfate was monitored as described (19Varin L. Barron D. Ibrahim R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were deduced from double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. 24-Epibrassinolide sulfate was produced enzymatically and extracted twice in ethyl acetate as a tetrabutyl ammonium salt (19Varin L. Barron D. Ibrahim R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Test compounds (10 nmol) solubilized in 2 μl of methanol were applied at the base of the second internode of 7-day-old bean seedlings as described (20Mitchell J.W. Livingston G.A. Agriculture Handbook, U. S. Department of Agriculture, No. 336. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1968Google Scholar). Methanol alone (2 μl) was applied on control bean plants. Bean seedlings were grown at 21 °C with a 16-h photoperiod. The length of the second internode was measured 4 days following the application of test compounds. Brassinolide was purchased from Beak Technologies Inc., Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The following BRs were synthesized from ergosterol using published procedures: 24-epicathasterone and 24-epibrassinolide (21McMorris T.C. Patil P.A. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2338-2339Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar); (22S,23S)-28-homocastasterone and 28-homobrassinolide (22McMorris T.C. Patil P.A. Chavez R.G. Baker M.E. Clouse S.D. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 585-589Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 6-deoxo-24-epicastasterone (23Spengler B. Schmidt J. Voigt B. Adam G. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 907-910Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar); 24-epiteasterone (24Voigt B. Schmidt J. Adam G. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 1997-2004Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar); 24-epicathasterone; and 22-deoxy-24-epiteasterone (25Voigt B. Porzel A. Buhn C. Wagner C. Merzweiler K. Adam G. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 17039-17054Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A mixture of 24-epicathasterone (47.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), hydrozine-monohydrate (1.5 ml, 80%), KOH (1.4 g), and diethylene glycol (10 ml) was stirred and heated for 2 h at 200 °C. After cooling the mixture was diluted with HCl (10 ml, 1.2 n) and the solution extracted with chloroform. Usual workup gave a residue, which was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel. Elution with n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 2:8 v/v, furnished 6-deoxo-epicathasterone with m.p. 175–178 °C and EI-MS, m/z 400 (M+ − 18). The 1H NMR data are in agreement with the given structure. A clone encoding a putative ST of unknown substrate specificity has recently been isolated from an A. thaliana cDNA library (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This clone,RaR047, was used as a probe to isolate three intronless genes (BNST1, -2, and -3) from a B. napus genomic library. The BNST1, -2, and -3 genes belong to a multigene family comprising at least 12 members, as determined by Southern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments (data not shown). BNST1, -2, and -3 encode proteins having a predicted molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa that share 73–83% sequence identity (Fig.2). The variations among the three amino acid sequences are mostly observed in the domain that is involved in ST acceptor substrate recognition, suggesting that the three enzymes may have distinct substrate specificities (26Varin L. Marsolais F. Brisson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12498-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The BNST amino acid sequences are very similar to A. thaliana RaR047, BNST3 being the closest relative with 87% amino acid sequence identity. Thus, it is likely that the B. napus ST genes are orthologs of A. thaliana RaR047. In contrast, the B. napus ST proteins share 41% sequence identity with the flavonol STs of Flaveria chloraefolia and 27–30% identity with the mammalian phenol, estrogen, and hydroxysteroid STs. B. napus seedlings grown under normal conditions expressed very low to undetectable levels of BNST mRNAs and proteins (Fig. 3, A andC, lane 1). However, watering the seedlings with 10 mm SA resulted in a rapid induction of their expression. Steady-state mRNA levels increased within 6 h following SA treatment (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) and resulted in the expression of several proteins with apparent molecular mass ranging from 32 to 35 kDa (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 3). The kinetics of induction of BNSTs is comparable to that of PR genes (14Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Alexander D.C. Ahl-Goy P. Métraux J.-P. Ryals J.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to their high level of nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity, analysis of the expression of BNSTs using the full-lengthBNST1 coding sequence, or polyclonal antibodies raised against the BNST1 protein as probes, should identify most, if not all, of the related expressed BNSTs. Therefore, the detection of several proteins in Western blots is consistent with BNST1, -2, and-3 being members of a multigene family. In contrast, the detection of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 32.5 kDa in SA-treated A. thaliana (Fig. 3 C, lane 4) is in agreement with the report that RaR047 exists as a single copy gene in this plant (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The inducible expression ofBNSTs by SA suggests that these genes play a role in the plant defense response. This is further supported by the pattern of expression of RaR047 in A. thaliana, which is preferentially induced by infection with avirulent pathogens (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to define the role of the BNST proteins, we studied the ST activity of purified recombinant BNST3 expressed in E. coli. The choice of BNST3 was dictated by the fact that it is expressed in SA-treated seedlings as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and is the most similar to A. thaliana RaR047. Although a variety of acceptor molecules of plant and mammalian origin (e.g.desulfoglucosinolates, gibberellins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, steroids, phytosterols, and terpenoids) were used as substrates, BNST3 catalyzed the transfer of the 35S-labeled sulfonate group from the cosubstrate PAPS to BRs and estrogenic steroids only (Fig. 1and Table I). The BNST3 enzyme did not sulfonate the structurally related mammalian steroids estrone, 17α-estradiol and testosterone, the phytosterols campesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol, nor the ecdysteroids ecdysone or 20-hydroxyecdysone, thus exhibiting specific structural requirements for the sulfonate acceptor substrate. The fact that the BNST3 enzyme accepts 17β-estradiol 3-methyl ether and not estrone as substrate indicates that sulfonation takes place at position 17 of the estrogenic steroid substrates. Furthermore, the BNST3 enzyme is stereospecific for the 17-hydroxyl group in position β, since it does not sulfonate the 17α-stereoisomer. It seems that a 17-hydroxyl group attached to a rigid ring system, in estradiol, may limit its sulfonate accepting ability. Substrate-dependent stereoselectivity has also been reported for the rat hydroxysteroid ST (STa) and phenol ST (AST IV) and was shown to be caused by the degree of steric bulk on the hydroxyl-containing chiral carbon (27Satish R. Duffel M.W. Chirality. 1991; 3: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Banoglu E. Duffel M.W. Drug Metab.

Open table in a new tab To determine the position of sulfonation and the substrate preference of BNST3, several natural and synthetic BRs were tested (Fig. 1). Of those, BNST3 exhibits the highest affinity for 24-epicathasterone followed by 24-epiteasterone with apparentK m values of 1.4 and 4.2 μm, respectively (Tables I and II). The apparent K m value for PAPS was found to be 1.0 μm. The catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of the enzyme is 13-fold higher for 24-epicathasterone as compared with 24-epiteasterone (Table II). Furthermore, 24-epicathasterone is the only substrate for which a significant enzymatic activity is measured at a concentration of 0.1 μm (2.5 pkatal/mg). Although BNST3 also accepts 24-epibrassinolide as a substrate, this activity is only observed at high substrate concentration (Table I). The enzyme is also sensitive to the level of oxidation of ring B, as revealed by the low relative activity values obtained with 6-deoxo-24-epicastasterone and 6-deoxo-24-epicathasterone as substrates. The most striking feature of BNST3 substrate specificity is its efficient use of the natural substrate 24-epibrassinolide and the synthetic enantiomer (22S,23S)-28-homobrassinolide, whereas it is inactive with the natural substrate brassinolide (Table I).Table IIKinetic parameters of recombinant BNST3 for the preferred BR substratesSubstrateK mV maxV max/K mμmpkatal mg−1pkatal mg−1 μm−124-Epicathasterone1.4423124-Epiteasterone4.29.62.3 Open table in a new tab The fact that the enzyme accepts 24-epicathasterone and 24-epiteasterone but does not accept the synthetic substrate 22-deoxy-24-epiteasterone suggests strongly that sulfonation is taking place at position 22 of the steroid side chain (Table I). The specificity of the enzyme for position 22 explains why early BR intermediates and BR precursors lacking a hydroxyl group at this position are not accepted by the enzyme. It has previously been reported that hydroxylation of brassinosteroid intermediates at position 22 increases considerably their biological activity, suggesting that sulfonation at this position by BNST3 might lead to the loss of their function (24Voigt B. Schmidt J. Adam G. Tetrahedron. 1996; 52: 1997-2004Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of 24-epibrassinolide and its sulfonated derivative to promote growth of the bean second internode, a well established biological test for the activity of BRs (29Fujioka S. Inoue T. Takatsuto S. Yanagisawa T. Yokota T. Sakurai A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1973-1975Crossref Google Scholar). As expected, application of 10 nmol of epibrassinolide dramatically induced elongation of the internode (mean = 6.5 cm, S.D. = 1.2 cm,n = 5) (Fig.4 A), as compared with control plants (mean = 1.1 cm, S.D. = 0.4 cm, n = 5). However, the addition of 10 nmol of epibrassinolide sulfate did not stimulate the internode elongation (mean = 1.5 cm, S.D. = 0.5 cm,n = 5) (Fig. 4 B) as compared with control bean seedlings. We have isolated three genes (BNST1, -2, and-3) from B. napus which encode STs. They belong to a gene family comprising at least 12 members having a high level of sequence identity with a previously characterized cDNA clone (RaR047) from A. thaliana (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). According to the guidelines on sulfotransferase nomenclature, RaR047 and theBNSTs fall below the 45% amino acid sequence identity threshold value to be members of the flavonol SULT3 family (30Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Therefore, they represent the first characterized members of the new SULT4 family. When expressed in E. coli, the enzyme encoded by the BNST3 gene exhibited specificity for steroid substrates and catalyzed the sulfonation of the plant-specific BRs, and of mammalian estrogens such as 17β-estradiol (Fig. 1 and Table I). Whereas several studies (31Geuns J.M.C. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1-14Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Simons R.G. Grinwich D.L. Can. J. Bot. 1989; 67: 288-296Crossref Google Scholar) described the presence in plants of the mammalian steroids estradiol, estrone, and testosterone, as well as their physiological effects on growth, development, and flowering, the functional significance of estrogen sulfonation by a plant enzyme remains to be elucidated. Despite the lack of information on the accumulation of 24-epimers of BRs in B. napus, our results suggest that they are in fact synthesized in this plant. These results call for a thorough investigation of BRs in B. napus tissues in order to confirm their natural occurrence in this plant. The differences observed in the domain responsible for ST substrate specificity of BNST1, -2, and -3 suggest that they have distinct substrate preferences, and it is possible that other members of the BNST family are involved in the sulfonation of brassinolide and/or its precursors. BNST3 has the highest affinity for 24-epicathasterone, of the substrates tested. The 13-fold lowerV max/K m value observed for 24-epiteasterone as compared with 24-epicathasterone suggests that the latter might be the only BR sulfated in vivo by BNST3. The preference of BNST3 for an early precursor, as compared with the final product 24-epibrassinolide, is quite surprising considering the fact that the latter is about 1000-fold more active (33Fujioka S. Inoue T. Takatsuto S. Yanagisawa T. Yokota T. Sakurai A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1973-1975Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, cathasterone is considered to be the first BR precursor with significant biological activity, and it has been proposed that its synthesis is the rate-limiting step in the formation of the more potent BRs (5Choe S. Dilkes B. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Sakurai A. Feldmann A.K. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fujioka S. Inoue T. Takatsuto S. Yanagisawa T. Yokota T. Sakurai A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1973-1975Crossref Google Scholar). The substrate preference of BNST3 for 24-epicathasterone may be an efficient mechanism to block its intrinsic activity and at the same time interfere with the biosynthesis of the more potent final product 24-epibrassinolide. The fact that the currently used techniques for the analysis of BRs are not suitable for the preservation of the labile sulfate moiety may explain the lack of reports on the characterization of sulfated BRs in plant extracts. However, it has been shown that rice seedlings administered labeled cathasterone produce non-glycosidic polar BR derivatives that may in fact be sulfate esters (34Yokota T. Higuchi K. Kosaka Y. Takahashi N. Karssen C.M. Loon L.C. Vreugdenhill D. Progress in Plant Growth Regulation. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1992: 298-305Google Scholar), based on their chromatographic behavior and their susceptibility to solvolysis. Our results also demonstrate that sulfonation of 24-epibrassinolide abolishes its biological activity in the bean second internode bioassay suggesting that plants, like mammals, may modulate the biological activity of steroids by sulfonation. The recent finding thatBRI1 codes for a potential transmembrane leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinase, which is required for BR perception, suggests that BRs mediate their biological activity on the external surface of the cell membrane (4Li J. Chory J. Cell. 1997; 90: 929-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that the expression of theCPD gene is confined to specific cell types of leaves, other than those involved in elongation, suggests that BRs must be transported from source to target tissues (35Mathur J. Molnar G. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Sakurai A. Yokota T. Adam G. Voigt B. Nagy F. Maas C. Schell J. Koncz C. Szekeres M. Plant J. 1998; 14: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sulfonation of BRs may interfere with their excretion, their transport, or their binding to the BRI1 receptor. The availability of clonedBNST3 and RaR047 cDNAs provides the tools for further study of the function of these enzymes in relation to BR action. Transgenic A. thaliana overexpressingBNST3 are presently being produced in our laboratory. Another interesting feature of the BR STs is the induction of their expression following SA treatment in both B. napus andA. thaliana (15Lacomme C. Roby D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the modulation of steroid activity may be part of the defense response of plants to pathogens. The results of several experiments suggest that BRs stimulate plant growth by increasing the plasticity of the cell wall (36Clouse S.D. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 702-709Crossref Google Scholar). In the context of a pathogen infection, this growth mechanism is undesirable since it reduces the protection offered by the cell wall. The sulfonation of BRs by the SA- and pathogen-inducible steroid STs provides a mechanism through which BR-dependent cell wall hydrolysis might be stopped. Additional mechanisms are likely to parallel steroid ST activity to reduce the levels of biologically active BRs during pathogen infection. A reduced rate of synthesis of BRs is also expected, since the expression of the Δ24-sterol C-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the first committed step in phytosterol biosynthesis, was reported to decrease following elicitation of soybean cells (37Shi J. Gonzales R.A. Bhattacharyya M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9384-9389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppression of phytosterol biosynthesis following elicitor treatment has been reported in parsley, potato, tobacco, andTabernaemontana divaricata (38Vögeli U. Chappell J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Haudenschild C. Hartmann M.-A. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 1117-1124Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Brindle P.A. Kuhn P.J.

Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 2981-2988Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The widespread occurrence of STs and sulfatases in mammalian tissues has led to the hypothesis that the concerted action of both groups of enzymes may regulate the level of active steroids (10Hobkirk R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Considering the structural, functional, and metabolic conservation of steroids between plants and mammals, it is likely that a common mechanism of modulation of steroid activity has also been conserved through evolution. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate the occurrence of steroid STs in plants and that sulfonation of 24-epibrassinolide leads to the loss of its biological activity. We thank Dr. D. Roby for the A. thaliana RaR047 cDNA clone and Dr. G. Bellemare for the B. napus genomic library."
https://openalex.org/W1966635630,"Recently, we have demonstrated that in PC12 cells activation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in response to membrane depolarization or bradykinin is mediated by calcium-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we address the question whether Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) has a role in the EGFR transactivation signal. Using compounds that selectively interfere with either CaM kinase activity or calmodulin function, we show that KCl-mediated membrane depolarization-triggered, but not bradykinin-mediated signals involve CaM kinase function upstream of the EGFR. Although both depolarization-induced calcium influx and bradykinin stimulation of PC12 cells were found to induce c-fos transcription through EGFR activation, the former signal is CaM kinase-dependent and the latter was shown to be independent. As PYK2 is also activated upon elevation of intracellular calcium, we investigated the potential involvement of this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in EGFR transactivation. Interestingly, we observed that inhibition of CaM kinase activity in PC12 cells abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 upon KCl but not bradykinin treatment. Nevertheless, PYK2 activation in response to both stimuli appeared to be mediated by pathways parallel to EGFR transactivation. Our data demonstrate the existence of two distinct calcium-dependent mechanisms leading either to EGFR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated activation or to PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Both pathways either in concert or independently might contribute to the definition of biological responses in neuronal cell types.

The concentration of intracellular calcium can be increased by influx across the plasma membrane or by release from internal stores (1Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

Elevation of intracellular calcium and its subsequent binding to calmodulin (CaM) has been reported to be an important cellular response upon hormonal stimulation or membrane depolarization (7Rasmussen H. Rasmussen J.E. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1990; 31: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ca2+-calmodulin is required for the activity of a wide variety of enzymes including protein kinases such as the multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 8Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev.

In PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma-derived cell line that is widely used as a model system for neuronal differentiation, calcium influx through VGCC induces c-fos transcription through a signaling pathway that may include the activation of a CaM kinase (10Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 12Dash P.K. Karl K.A. Colicos M.A. Prywes R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4756-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Moreover, in hippocampal neurons it has been demonstrated that both membrane depolarization and stimulation of NMDA receptors result in elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations and c-fos induction, but only KCl-induced c-fos expression can be blocked by inhibition of CaM kinases (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the mode of calcium entry, different signaling pathways can be activated downstream.Besides activating Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent signaling cascades, membrane depolarization-induced calcium influx triggers the ubiquitous Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (13Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 14Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, calcium influx rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC and SHC-Grb2 complex formation, steps known to couple cell surface receptors such as tyrosine kinases to Ras (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). This finding, and the earlier report that calcium entry following membrane depolarization triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (13Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), led to the demonstration that EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation represents an essential signaling event for ERK activation in PC12 cells upon KCl as well as bradykinin stimulation (14Zwick E.

Therefore, in PC12 cells, calcium plays an important role in the EGFR transactivation mechanism, which had previously been demonstrated to be required for G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated ERK activation in Rat-1 fibroblasts and other cell types (16Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 17Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 101-112Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The critical role of calcium in the EGFR transactivation mechanism is further supported by the recent finding that ERK activation by angiotensin II involves Ca2+-dependent EGFR stimulation (18Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).Cytoplasmic kinases of the Src family have also been reported to be implicated in the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway by various stimuli such as membrane depolarization and GPCR-mediated signals (19Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase PYK2, a relative of the focal adhesion kinase FAK, was reported to link GPCR signaling and the calcium second messenger system influx to the MAPK pathway in PC12 cells (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that concerted action of receptor tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases might be necessary to activate distinct signaling cascades in response to GPCR stimulation or membrane depolarization (22Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrate that a calcium-calmodulin-dependent pathway is involved in KCl- but not bradykinin-induced EGFR transactivation. Selective inhibition of CaM kinases strongly attenuates SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation in response to membrane depolarization. Furthermore, membrane depolarization and bradykinin stimulation of PC12 cells activate c-fos transcription through distinct calcium-dependent signaling pathways involving the EGFR. Finally, we demonstrate that PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation upon KCl but not bradykinin stimulation is dependent on CaM kinase function and address the question of PYK2 involvement in calcium-triggered EGFR transactivation.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that the EGFR plays a key role in the transduction of mitogenic signals in response to membrane depolarization (13Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) or activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (16Daub H. Weiss F.U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, the KCl- or bradykinin-triggered EGFR transactivation pathway requires the presence of extracellular calcium (14Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that membrane depolarization- but not bradykinin-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase function (Fig.1, A and B). This conclusion is derived from experimental results that involve inhibitors, which, although established in the literature, may interfere with the function of molecules other than CaM kinase or calmodulin. KN-62 was shown to reduce Ca2+ channel activity in the pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15 (29Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. 1992; 364: 395-411Google Scholar) and adrenal chromaffin cells (30Maurer J.A. Wenger B.W. McKay D.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas in hippocampal CA1 neurons KN-62 and KN-93 do not affect Ca2+currents (39Wyllie D.J. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As we were able to verify the presented data using the structurally and functionally unrelated compound W-7 (27Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1113-1124PubMed Google Scholar), our data strongly indicate that in PC12 cells membrane depolarization-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation requires CaM kinase function in PC12 cells. A number of studies have shown that CaM kinases, among them CaM kinase II and CaM kinase IV, are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium level mediated either by calcium influx through VGCC (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 6Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) or by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (40Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1113-1124PubMed Google Scholar). Although treatment of PC12 cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin results in calcium influx into the cells, under these conditions inhibition of CaM kinase activity does not affect EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D). This suggests that only calcium entry through l-type VGCC requires a CaM kinase-dependent pathway for EGFR transactivation. In contrast, bradykinin and ionomycin-induced Ca2+ influx, which is due to a distinct temporal and spatial mode of Ca2+ entry, seem to utilize additional Ca2+-dependent mediators, whose function is sufficient to trigger EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells.Focusing on the tyrosine kinase substrate SHC and the MAPK ERK2 for further analysis, we found that inhibition of CaM kinases abrogates KCl-mediated SHC tyrosine phosphorylation as well as membrane depolarization-induced ERK activation (Figs. 1 C and 2). Earlier findings, such as those of Muthalif et al., have suggested that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with norepinephrine, a Gi-coupled receptor agonist that activates Ca2+ influx primarily through l-type VGCC, induces ERK activation by activating CaM kinase II (41Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is no report showing that norepinephrine-mediated ERK activation involves EGFR transactivation, although GPCR-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was recently reported in this cell system in response to angiotensin II (18Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).When we investigated the role of CaM kinase in membrane depolarization- and bradykinin-induced c-fos gene expression, we found that inhibition of CaM kinase activity suppressed c-fos gene expression only upon KCl treatment, but not following bradykinin stimulation (Fig. 3 A). This confirms earlier results of Greenberg and colleagues, which support the involvement of CaM kinase II in c-fos transcription following VGCC activation, but not upon NMDA receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx (4Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Science. 1986; 234: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 6Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous reports have shown that elevation of intracellular calcium activates Ras (6Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 13Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and downstream the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 resulting in the promotion of gene transcription. The transcription factor Elk-1 is activated via this signaling cascade (42Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and induces c-fos gene expression through binding to the SRE with in the c-fos promotor. Taken together with our result that expression of a dominant-negative EGFR mutant abrogated both membrane depolarization- and bradykinin-induced c-fos transcription (Fig. 3 B), it appears that CaM kinase-dependent EGFR transactivation is an important pathway for membrane depolarization-induced signaling and regulation of gene expression in PC12 cells. Calcium-induced CaM kinase activation is also known to regulate c-fos expression through serine phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which binds to the calcium response element, an important cis element of the c-fos promotor (3Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar,43Metthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhoa X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of Ser133 of CREB, which acts as a critical positive regulatory site (50Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), has been reported to be directly mediated by certain CaM kinase isoforms in the nucleus (10Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar,12Dash P.K. Karl K.A. Colicos M.A. Prywes R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4756-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 44Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP-activated protein kinase A (45Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), as well as another NGF-induced CREB kinase (46Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), which is activated by a Ras-dependent mechanism in PC12 cells, is able to phosphorylate CREB at Ser133. The phosphorylation of CREB at another site, Ser142, appears to inhibit CREB's transcriptional activation potential, as it has been shown that CaM kinase II, which phosphorylates Ser133 and Ser142, is much less effective in inducing CREB-dependent transcription than CaM kinase IV, which only phosphorylates Ser133 (47Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 48Tan S.E. Wenthold R.J. Sonderling T.R J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This negative regulatory function of CaM kinase II on CREB-induced transcription may be the reason for the increase of bradykinin-mediated c-fos gene expression upon preincubation with CaM kinase inhibitors (Fig.3 A). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the EGFR/ERK MAPK pathway is necessary to mediate activation of the c-fos promotor upon membrane depolarization and bradykinin stimulation of PC12 cells. Furthermore, in contrast to bradykinin, KCl-induced c-fos transcription is not only dependent on EGFR signaling, but also requires CaM kinase function.Another tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in ERK/MAPK activation involving calcium signals is PYK2 (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Investigating the role of PYK2 in the membrane depolarization- and bradykinin-mediated EGFR transactivation pathway, we demonstrated that preincubation of PC12 cells with KN-62 abrogates PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation upon KCl, but not upon bradykinin stimulation (Fig. 4). As PYK2 was reported to interact with Src upon bradykinin stimulation (20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), this association may be required for Src to efficiently phosphorylate its cellular substrates. This interpretation is supported by the observation that overexpression of a dominant-negative Src mutant interferes with depolarization-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation (19Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Haleggoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Taken together with our finding that PYK2 and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated by similar calcium-dependent pathways, we raised the question of how the EGFR and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase complex PYK2/Src are functionally linked in PC12 cells. Interestingly, experiments with the PC12/PYK2-KM/Tet cell line (Fig. 5) suggest that dominant-negative PYK2 does not interfere with KCl- or bradykinin-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate that expression of PYK2-KM reduced bradykinin-mediated ERK activation approximately by 30–40% (Fig. 6). On the other hand, we observed that ERK2 was inhibited to the same extent upon stimulation with low doses of EGF (0.3 and 1.0 ng/ml) when PYK2-KM was expressed (Fig. 6). Furthermore, we show that expression of the dominant-negative EGFR mutant HER-CD533 had no influence on PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation upon KCl or bradykinin treatment (Fig. 8, upper panel), whereas in the same experiment inhibition of EGFR function completely abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules (Fig. 8, lower panel). Thus, these experiments suggest that PYK2 acts in parallel to the EGFR signaling pathway and might play an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion properties as indicated by our findings (Fig. 7). Moreover, contradictory results concerning PYK2-dependent ERK activation in PC12 cells could be due to the fact that ERK activation upon KCl and bradykinin stimulation is not exclusively mediated by an EGFR-dependent pathway. Incomplete inhibition (80%) of KCl- and bradykinin-mediated ERK activation by expression of HER-CD533 (14Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) indicates that other upstream transducers such as PYK2 (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) are involved in KCl- or GPCR-mediated induction of ERK. With respect to these results, it seems likely that the impact of the EGFR transactivation pathway depends on cell type and the specific physiological state of the cell.Interestingly, in the present study, we found differences between membrane depolarization- and GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation. Although we were able to demonstrate that a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent pathway is involved in KCl-, but not in bradykinin-triggered EGFR transactivation, the mechanism of CaM kinase-dependent EGFR transactivation is still unknown. It was reported that CaM kinase II is able to phosphorylate the EGFR at serines 1046/1047 based on a consensus sequence (54Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this process, however, seems to be important for the desensitization and down-regulation of the EGFR. Nevertheless, it might be possible that direct phosphorylation of the EGFR or interaction with intermediate signaling factors which have been modified by CaM kinase action might lead to KCl-induced EGFR transactivation.Our data establish the existence of two distinct calcium-dependent mechanisms that converge on the EGFR as a central signal relay element, which then activates the Ras/ERK pathway resulting in the initiation or modulation of gene transcription. These pathways and those involving PYK2 are parts of a complex signaling network that controls and defines diverse responses of neuronal cell types to physiological stimuli. In neurons, transient changes of intracellular calcium levels are critical for a variety of cellular signaling processes. The concentration of intracellular calcium can be increased by influx across the plasma membrane or by release from internal stores (1Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J.

The mechanism of Apaf-1 action is unclear but has been proposed to involve the clustering of caspase-9 molecules, thereby facilitating autoprocessing of adjacent zymogens. Here we show that Apaf-1 can dimerize via the CED-4 homologous and linker domains of the molecule providing a means by which Apaf-1 can promote the clustering of caspase-9 and facilitate its activation. Apaf-1 dimerization was repressed by the C-terminal half of the molecule, which contains multiple WD-40 repeats, but this repression was overcome in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP. Removal of the WD-40 repeat region resulted in a constitutively active Apaf-1 that exhibited greater cytotoxicity in transient transfection assays when compared with full-length Apaf-1. These data suggest a mechanism for Apaf-1 function and reveal an important regulatory role for the WD-40 repeat region.

Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that drives the apoptosis program consists of a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, that cleave their substrates after aspartic acid residues and are normally present in cells as inactive precursors (2Martin S.J.

Because of the potential for explosive amplification of multiple caspases by a small initial pool of active caspase, proximal caspase activation events appear to be tightly regulated. An attractive model for activation of initiator caspases is the induced proximity model where molecules that promote close association of caspases facilitate caspase activation by enabling clustered caspases to process one another in trans (8Yang X.

Targeted inactivation of either Apaf-1 or CASP-9 in the mouse results in many extra cells in several tissues, most notably the brain, and results in embryonic lethality (25Cecconi F.

Cytochromec has been shown to bind to Apaf-1, thereby promoting Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9 by an unknown mechanism (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar,17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). By analogy with other proximal caspase activation events it is possible that Apaf-1 promotes caspase-9 activation by promoting clustering of this caspase (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). In support of this model, it has been demonstrated recently that the C. elegans homologue of Apaf-1, CED-4, promotes CED-3 activation through oligomerization (27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we show that Apaf-1 can form homodimers via the CED-4 homologous and adjacent linker domains of this molecule. Significantly, Apaf-1 dimerization was strongly repressed by its own C terminus, a region that contains multiple WD-40 repeats. This repression was overcome in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, suggesting that cytochrome c and dATP facilitate Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation by regulating Apaf-1 dimerization. Full-length human Apaf-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Xiaodong Wang. All other constructs described in this paper were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification of the relevant coding sequences using full-length Apaf-1 cDNA as a template followed by the insertion of the digested polymerase chain reaction products into either pACT2 (CLONTECH), pAS2–1 (CLONTECH), pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), or pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene). Constructs were verified for authenticity by automated sequencing on an ABI 310 (Applied Biosystems). A GST·Apaf-11–601 fusion was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification of the relevant coding sequence from the full-length Apaf-1 cDNA followed by subcloning of the resulting polymerase chain reaction product in-frame with the GST coding region of pGEX4TK2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids encoding GST and GST fusion proteins were transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α, and bacteria were induced to express recombinant proteins in the presence of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–4 h at 30 °C. Recombinant proteins were subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to standard procedures. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain Y190 (CLONTECH) was transformed by the lithium acetate method as described by Gietz et al. (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Briefly, a colony of Y190 was inoculated into YPD and grown at 30 °C to stationary phase. Yeast were then expanded into fresh YPD (300 ml) and grown to an A 600 of 0.5 ± 0.1. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed once in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA) followed by resuspension in LA/TE buffer (100 mm LiAc, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA) to ∼109 cells/ml. Following a 10-min incubation in this buffer, 100 μl of aliquots (∼108 cells) of the competent yeast were added to tubes containing aliquots of the appropriate bait and prey plasmids and 100 μg of freshly denatured herring sperm carrier DNA (Sigma). Samples were vortexed briefly to mix reagents followed by the addition of 40% polyethylene glycol in TE buffer (600 μl/tube). Yeast were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C under gentle agitation followed by the addition of Me2SO (70 μl/tube) and a 15-min heat shock at 42 °C. Cells were allowed to recover on ice and were then pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of TE buffer, and aliquots were plated on appropriate synthetic dropout media and grown for 2–4 days at 30 °C to select for transformants. Protein-protein interactions in yeast were detected using a Gal4-based two-hybrid assay (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), utilizing one of the following independent reporter assays: the ability to grow on medium lacking histidine or expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. For the HIS reporter assay, yeast transformed with bait and prey plasmids were streaked onto synthetic dropout medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Duplicates were streaked onto synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to confirm the presence of both plasmids. Interactions between bait and prey proteins resulted in expression of the histidine synthethase reporter gene (HIS3) and enabled yeast harboring these plasmids to grow on medium lacking histidine. For the β-galactosidase reporter assay, yeast transformants were streaked unto the appropriate selective dropout medium and grown at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Colony lifts were then performed with Whatman No. 5 (90 mm) filter paper followed by two rounds of freeze-thaw (−70 °C) to lyse the yeast. Filters were then incubated at 30 °C in Z-buffer at pH 7 (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.26% 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 325 μg/ml X-gal. The assay was allowed to proceed in a sealed chamber until the development of a blue reaction product (8 h maximum). Yeast total protein extracts were prepared as follows. Yeast transformants expressing the appropriate plasmids were expanded in 50 ml of YPD growth medium to an A 600 of 0.4 ± 0.1. Cells were harvested and washed once in ice-cold water followed by pelleting. Pelleted yeast were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by resuspension in ∼250 μl of cracking buffer prewarmed to 60 °C (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 90 μm EDTA, 7 m urea, 4.5% SDS, 0.35 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 125 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μmleupeptin, 9 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 4.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were then normalized with respect to cell density by the addition of further cracking buffer. Samples were then brought to 70 °C for 10 min followed by vigorous vortexing for 1 min in the presence of 300 mg of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). Protein lysates were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet beads and intact cells. Proteins were subjected to standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 60–70 V and were transferred onto 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Costar, United Kingdom) for 3 h at 50–75 mA. Gal4-activation domain (AD) fusion proteins were detected using an anti-hemagluttinin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) directed against the hemagluttinin epitope tag encoded by the pACT2 vector. Bound antibodies were revealed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in conjunction with the Supersignal chemiluminescence detection reagent (Pierce). [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated using the TNT kit (Promega) as described previously (18Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 30Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Typically, 1 μg of plasmid was used in a 50-μl transcription/translation reaction containing 4 μl of translation grade [35S]methionine (1000 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products). Interaction of 35S-labeled Apaf-1 deletion mutants with GST·Apaf-1ΔWD-40 (amino acid residues 1–601) was assessed as follows. [35S]Methionine-labeled Apaf-1 deletion mutants (5–15-μl aliquots of translation reactions) were brought to 200 μl in GST buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Aliquots (∼5 μg of protein) of glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized GST or GST·Apaf-1601(prewashed in GST buffer) were then added. In some instances, cytochrome c and dATP were added to the pulldown reactions to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 1 mm,respectively. Reactions were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. Bead complexes were then washed several times in GST buffer, and bound 35S-labeled proteins were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with pCDNA3-based Apaf-1 or FADD expression plasmids in conjunction with the pCMVβgal reporter construct (CLONTECH) using the Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were incubated for 24–48 h followed by fixation in paraformaldehyde fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% gluteraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2) at 4 °C for 5 min. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, followed by staining for β-galactosidase reporter gene expression by the addition of β-galactosidase staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS) containing 1 mg/ml X-gal. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to 2 h to allow blue color development. Preliminary investigations using co-immunoprecipitation assays have suggested that Apaf-1 can self-associate either directly or via putative adaptor proteins (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these possibilities, we used a Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid interaction trap assay to ask whether Apaf-1 can dimerize and to map the region(s) involved. We generated a series of Apaf-1 deletion mutants fused to the Gal4 AD and co-transformed these into yeast in combination with similar Gal4 DNA-binding domain Apaf-1 deletion mutants (Fig.1, A and B). Expression of Apaf-1 deletion mutants in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). Using two different reporter assays (the ability to grow in the absence of histidine and β-galactosidase reporter gene expression) Apaf-1 dimerization, mediated via the CED-4 and linker domains (amino acid residues 92–601), was readily detected (Fig.2). Both the CED-4 homologous and linker domains were required for maximal interaction, although the CED-4 homologous domain alone (residues 92–412) appeared to be capable of mediating weak but significant association with the CED-4/linker regions in both the growth and the β-galactosidase reporter assays (Fig. 2, A and B). Strikingly, Apaf-1 dimerization in yeast was strongly inhibited by the C-terminal portion of the molecule, which contains multiple WD-40 repeats (Fig. 2,A and B), suggesting that this region regulates Apaf-1 self-association. To confirm these observations, in vitro protein-protein interaction assays were performed using a GST·Apaf-1ΔWD-40 fusion protein (amino acid residues 1–601) in conjunction with various 35S-labeledin vitro transcribed and translated Apaf-1 deletion mutants (Fig. 3 A). These assays confirmed that Apaf-1 can self-associate via the CED-4 homologous and linker domains of the molecule and that the CED-4 homologous domain alone, in agreement with the two-hybrid data, was far less efficient in promoting dimerization (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, caspase-9 was found to be more efficiently captured in the pulldown assays relative to the Apaf-1 deletion mutants, suggesting that the caspase-9/Apaf-1 interaction is of a higher affinity than the Apaf-1/Apaf-1 interaction (Fig. 3 B). As expected from the yeast two-hybrid data, GST·Apaf-1ΔWD-40 very weakly bound full-length Apaf-1 (data not shown) or a deletion mutant lacking the CED-3 homologous region (Fig.4), again suggesting that the WD-40 repeat region prevents Apaf-1 self-association. Significantly, the addition of cytochrome c/dATP to the in vitrointeraction assay overcame this inhibition and restored dimerization (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that cytochrome cactivates the intrinsic caspase-activating properties of Apaf-1 by overcoming the inhibition exerted by the WD-40 repeat region, which is likely by binding to this region and inducing a conformational change that permits Apaf-1 aggregation. Apaf-1 has previously been reported to be a relatively poor promoter of apoptosis when transiently overexpressed in mammalian cells (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 31Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), presumably because cytochrome c is required to unlock the caspase-activating properties of this molecule. A logical extension of our observations with regard to Apaf-1 dimerization would predict that the removal of the C-terminal WD-40 repeat region (amino acid residues 602–1194) should generate a constitutively active Apaf-1 that would promote apoptosis in the absence of cytosolic cytochrome c. To test this possibility we transiently transfected MCF-7 cells with either full-length Apaf-1 or an Apaf-1 deletion mutant lacking the WD-40 repeat region (Apaf-1ΔWD-40) to compare their cytotoxic effects. FADD, the adaptor protein for the Fas/CD95 receptor, was used as a positive control in these assays. Fig.5 illustrates that FADD exhibited very potent cytotoxic effects when transiently overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, as expected. In contrast, full-length Apaf-1 failed to promote cell death, as previously reported (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 31Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Interestingly we consistently observed greater cell survival in the presence of full-length Apaf-1 relative to the vector control plasmid, suggesting that full-length Apaf-1 may exert a cell death protective effect in the absence of cytosolic cytochrome c. However, overexpression of the Apaf-1ΔWD-40 mutant resulted in a significant decrease in cell survival, confirming that removal of the WD-40 repeat region unlocks the cytotoxic potential of Apaf-1. The data presented herein suggest an important regulatory role for the WD-40 repeat region in regulating the ability of Apaf-1 to form dimers and promote apoptosis. These and other data (16Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) suggest a relatively simple model of Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation where the ability of Apaf-1 to form oligomers enables adjacent caspase-9 molecules to process each other in trans (Fig.6). Although this ability is normally repressed by the C-terminal WD-40 repeat region of this molecule, binding of cytochrome c to this region overcomes this inhibition, possibly by inducing a conformational change in this region. As a corollary of this model, molecules that disrupt Apaf-1 dimerization would be expected to efficiently block Apaf-1-mediated caspase aggregation and activation. In this context, it has recently been demonstrated that potent death repressor molecules of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-xL and Diva (or Boo) bind to Apaf-1 (32Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Our observations that Apaf-1 dimerization is mediated via the CED-4 homologous and linker domains strongly suggest that Bcl-2 family members that bind to Apaf-1 exert their inhibitory effects on caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis by simply blocking Apaf-1 self-association. We have provided evidence that the WD-40 repeat region of Apaf-1 negatively regulates Apaf-1 self-association. Clearly, further studies are required to determine the mechanism of this inhibition. Possibilities include long range effects on the CED-4 homologous and linker domains that alter their configuration and disrupt the dimerization surface; alternatively, the WD-40 repeat region may physically occlude the binding sites. Whatever the mechanism, our data suggest that this block to self-association is overcome in the presence of cytochrome c, suggesting that cytochrome c may bind to the WD-40 repeat region and alter its conformation. It is possible that other WD-40 repeat-binding proteins may be capable of performing a similar role to cytochrome c in certain situations. In this context, it is interesting that Apaf-1 contains a number of caspase consensus cleavage sites close to the junction between the linker and WD-40 repeat regions, raising the possibility that caspase-catalyzed removal of the WD-40 repeat region may also activate Apaf-1. During the preparation of this report, Nunez and colleagues (35Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) also reported data to suggest that the WD-40 repeat region regulates Apaf-1 self-association. These authors showed that overexpression of an Apaf-1 deletion mutant spanning part of the linker region in addition to the WD-40 repeat region (amino acid residues 468–1194) could block co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged Apaf-1 deletion mutants lacking the WD-40 repeat region (amino acids 1–559). In the present study, we have directly demonstrated the ability of the WD-40 repeat region to regulate Apaf-1 self-association, both in yeast as well asin vitro, and have extended these findings by showing that cytochrome c/dATP can overcome this repression. There is also very good agreement between our studies with respect to the region of Apaf-1 involved in promoting self-association. Targeted inactivation of Apaf-1 in mice results in profound developmental abnormalities in cell number regulation in the brain as well as in other tissues such as the peripheral nervous system, resulting in embryonic lethality (25Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 26Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). These data strongly implicate Apaf-1 as an important player in pathways that result in neuronal apoptosis during development. Although it is unclear whether Apaf-1 plays a similar role in regulating neuronal apoptosis in nondevelopmental settings, it is likely to be involved in at least a subset of these cell deaths. Thus, strategies aimed at disrupting Apaf-1 dimerization may be capable of attenuating cell loss in neurodegenerative disease. Such strategies may involve exploiting natural regulators of Apaf-1 function (such as Bcl-XL or Diva) or small molecule inhibitors targeted to the domains required for efficient Apaf-1 self-association. Further studies will explore these possibilities. We thank Xiaodong Wang and Dr. Emad Alnemri for provision of cDNAs for Apaf-1 and caspase-9, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2073070083,"We have identified a novel mitochondrial targeting signal in the precursor of the DNA helicase Hmi1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is located at the C terminus of the protein. Similar to classical N-terminal presequences, this C-terminal targeting signal consists of a stretch of positively charged amino acids that has the potential to form an amphipathic alpha-helix. Deletion of the C-terminal 36 amino acids of helicase resulted in loss of import into mitochondria, while deletion of the N-terminal 40 amino acids had no effect. When C-terminal regions of the helicase were placed at the C terminus of a passenger protein, dihydrofolate reductase, the resulting fusion proteins were directed into the mitochondrial matrix, and the C-terminal region of helicase became proteolytically processed. Import of helicase occurs in a C- to N-terminal direction; it requires a membrane potential and the TIM17-23 translocase together with mitochondrial Hsp70. Helicase is the only mitochondrial matrix protein identified thus far with a cleavable targeting signal at its C terminus."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a defect in basal, insulin-, and exercise-stimulated glucose transport in the skeletal muscle of these animals. IRS2−/− and wild-type (WT) mice (male, 8–10 weeks) exercised on a treadmill for 1 h or remained sedentary. 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake was measured in isolated soleus muscles incubated in vitro in the presence or absence of insulin. Resting blood glucose concentration in IRS2−/−mice (10.3 mm) was higher than WT animals (4.1 mm), but there was a wide range among the IRS2−/− mice (3–25 mm). Therefore, IRS2−/− mice were divided into two subgroups based on blood glucose concentrations (IRS2−/−L < 7.2 mm, IRS2−/−H > 7.2 mm). Only IRS2−/−H had lower basal, exercise-, and submaximally insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake, while maximal insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake was similar among the three groups. The ED50 for insulin to stimulate 2DG uptake above basal in IRS2−/−H was higher than WT and IRS2−/−L mice, suggesting insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle from the IRS2−/− mice with high blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, resting blood glucose concentrations from all groups were negatively correlated to submaximally insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake (r 2 = 0.33, p < 0.01). Muscle GLUT4 content was significantly lower in IRS2−/−H mice compared with WT and IRS2−/−L mice. These results demonstrate that the IRS2 protein in muscle is not necessary for insulin- or exercise-stimulated glucose transport, suggesting that the onset of diabetes in the IRS2−/− mice is not due to a defect in skeletal muscle glucose transport; hyperglycemia may cause insulin resistance in the muscle of IRS2−/− mice.

Conditions of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes are characterized by defects in glucose handling by skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue and an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion to compensate for the impaired insulin action in the periphery (1DeFronzo R. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 667-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overt type 2 diabetes typically occurs when insulin secretion becomes insufficient to fully compensate for decreased insulin action in the peripheral tissues (1DeFronzo R.

Since impaired insulin action in peripheral tissues has been associated with defects in insulin signaling molecules leading to glucose transport (2Saad M.J.A. Eraki E. Miralpeix M. White M.F.

It is now well established that activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; WT, wild-type; KRB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer 3-kinase) is necessary to elicit insulin effects on glucose transport (8Cheatham B.

IRS1-deficient mice have normal blood glucose concentrations despite peripheral insulin resistance, suggesting adequate β-cell compensation (12Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B.

On the other hand, IRS2-deficient mice exhibit both peripheral insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic β-cell function and develop severe diabetes (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H.

It is not known if insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is the primary factor leading to the development of diabetes in the IRS2-deficient animals. Glucose transport is the rate-limiting step for glucose disposal in skeletal muscle under most condition (15Kubo K. Foley J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: E100-E102PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation and physical exercise are the most physiologically relevant stimulators of transport in muscle, and both stimuli increase transport through the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface (16Goodyear L.J.

The activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle, whereas exercise stimulates GLUT4 translocation through a PI 3-kinase-independent mechanism (18Goodyear L.J.

It is not known if IRS2 is necessary for insulin- or exercise-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle, although one report has suggested that IRS2 functions as a signaling mechanism leading to contraction-stimulated glucose transport in cardiac myocytes (22Till M. Kolter T. Eckel J. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 85A-89AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the current study we determined if skeletal muscles from IRS2-deficient mice have altered rates of glucose transport under basal conditions and in response to submaximal and maximal insulin stimulation. We also investigated whether IRS2 is required for exercise to increase glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Our results show that IRS2 is not necessary for increases in glucose transport in response to insulin or exercise and suggest that it is the onset of hyperglycemia that results in skeletal muscle insulin resistance in IRS2-deficient mice. Male insulin receptor substrate-2-deficient (IRS2−/−, n = 55) and wild-type (WT, n = 46) mice aged 8–10 weeks were studied. The generation of these animals and many of the physiological characteristics of the mice have been described in detail (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in an animal room maintained at 23 °C with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed standard laboratory chow and waterad libitum. Following a 15-h fast, mice were killed by decapitation, and blood was collected for the measurement of blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. The soleus muscles were rapidly dissected, and both ends of each muscle were tied with suture (silk 4–0) and mounted on an incubation apparatus as described previously (23Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Muscles were preincubated in 6 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) (117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 24.6 mm NaHCO3) containing 8 mmd-glucose at 37 °C for 20 min. The muscles were then incubated for 20 min in KRB containing 8 mmd-glucose in the absence or presence of 0.9, 1.8, or 120 nm insulin. After this incubation period, muscles were rinsed in 7.5 ml of KRB containing 8 mmd-mannitol at 30 °C for 10 min, and 2DG uptake was measured in 2 ml of KRB containing 1 mm2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (1.5 μCi/ml) and 7 mmd-[14C]mannitol (0.45 mCi/ml)(NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C for 20 min. Insulin was added to the buffer if present during the previous incubation period. The buffers were continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Muscles were processed, radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting for dual labels, and 2DG uptake was calculated as described previously (24Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). IRS2−/− and WT mice were fasted for 15 h. Blood glucose concentrations were measured in blood taken from the tail prior to the exercise. Mice ran on a rodent treadmill (Quinton Instruments Co., Seattle, WA) for 1 h at 0.7 mph up a 10% incline. Animals were killed immediately after exercise, and blood was collected for the measurement of blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. The soleus muscles were rapidly dissected and mounted on the incubation apparatus. The muscles were incubated for 20 min in KRB containing 8 mmd-mannitol at 30 °C in the absence or presence of insulin (1.8 or 120 nm), and 2DG uptake was measured as described above. Gastrocnemius muscles were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 2 mmEGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4. Homogenates were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Aliquots of protein (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GLUT4 as described previously (25Sherman L.A. Hirshman M.F. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Goodyear L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Blood glucose concentrations were measured using a ONE TOUCH PROFILE blood glucose meter (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by radio immunoassay using rat insulin as a standard (Linco, Charles, MO). For measurement of muscle glycogen, gastrocnemius muscles were dissolved in 30% KOH and 5% Na2SO4 at 70 °C for 15 min. Glycogen was then precipitated by mixing with 3 × volume of absolute alcohol and stored at −20 °C overnight. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The glycogen was hydrolyzed in 6 n H2SO4 at 100 °C for 45 min and cooled. Samples were neutralized with 1n NaOH, and glucose was measured using the glucose (HK) reagent (Sigma). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between WT and IRS2−/− mice were performed by an unpaired Student's t test. Comparisons of parameters before and after exercise were performed by Student'st test (paired and unpaired as appropriate) or Mann-WhitneyU test. Comparisons among WT, IRS2−/−L, and IRS2−/−H mice were performed by a one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Blood glucose concentrations in the IRS2−/− mice were significantly higher compared with WT mice (TableI). Since IRS2−/− mice had such a wide range of blood glucose concentrations (3.1–24.8 mm), we divided these mice into two subgroups: mice from one group had blood glucose concentrations within a 2 S.D. distribution of the WT mice (<7.2 mm, IRS2−/−L), and mice from the other group had blood glucose concentrations greater than 2 S.D. of WT mice (>7.2 mm, IRS2−/−H). Plasma insulin concentrations were elevated in IRS2−/− mice compared with WT, but were not different between the IRS2−/−L and IRS2−/−H mice. Body weight was approximately 10% lower in IRS2−/− mice compared with WT and was not statistically different between the IRS2−/−L and IRS2−/−H mice.Table IBody weight, blood glucose, and plasma insulin concentrationsWild-type, n = 46IRS2−/−Total, n = 55SubgroupsIRS2−/−L, n = 30IRS2−/−H, n = 25Body weight (g)25.4 ± 0.622.6 ± 0.51-ap < 0.05 versus wild-type.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether there is a defect in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle from IRS2−/− mice, isolated soleus muscles were incubated in KRB buffer in the absence or the presence of insulin. IRS2−/− mice in the absence of hyperglycemia had normal 2DG uptake under basal conditions (Fig.1). However, in the IRS2−/−H mice, where mean blood glucose concentration was 16.1 mm, there was a significant reduction in basal 2DG uptake. 2DG uptake in response to two different submaximal insulin concentrations was also significantly lower in the IRS2−/−H mice, but not the IRS2−/−L mice (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation with a maximal dose of insulin induced similar rates of 2DG uptake in all three groups (Fig. 1). Using the data shown in Fig. 1, we calculated the insulin dose that results in 50% of the maximal insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake (ED50). Since basal 2DG uptake in IRS2−/−H mice was lower than those of WT and IRS2−/−L mice, we calculated the ED50 with and without subtraction of basal 2DG uptake for each individual group. The ED50 without subtraction of basal 2DG uptake in IRS2−/−H mice (1.5 nm) was greater than WT (0.8 nm) and IRS2−/−L mice (0.7 nm). Similarly, the ED50 with subtraction of basal 2DG uptake in IRS2−/−H mice (1.9 nm) was greater than WT (1.4 nm) and IRS2−/−L mice (1.3 nm), suggesting that only the IRS2−/−H mice are insulin-resistant in skeletal muscle. Fasting blood glucose concentrations from all groups were negatively correlated with basal 2DG uptake (r 2 = 0.21, p < 0.05) and submaximally insulin-stimulated (1.8 nm) 2DG uptake (r 2 = 0.33, p < 0.01). Blood glucose concentrations in the WT and IRS2−/−H mice did not change in response to exercise, while there was a slight, but statistically significant, decrease in blood glucose in the IRS2−/−L mice (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, plasma insulin concentrations dramatically decreased with exercise in both groups of IRS2−/− mice, resulting in similar insulin levels compared with the WT (Fig. 2 B). Since blood glucose concentrations among the three groups were significantly difference, the alcohol precipitation method for glycogen was used in order to avoid measuring glucose associated with blood and tissue. Muscle glycogen content at rest was similar among the WT, IRS2−/−L, and IRS2−/−H groups and was significantly decreased after exercise in all three groups (Fig.2 C). However, the percent decrease in glycogen after exercise was lower in IRS2−/−H mice compared with IRS2−/−L mice (47.7 versus 68.2%, respectively, p < 0.05), suggesting less reliance on muscle glycogen as a fuel source during exercise in the IRS2−/−H mice. We next determined if IRS2 is necessary for the effects of exercise per se to increase glucose transport and to determine whether IRS2 is required for the additive effects of exercise plus insulin on glucose transport in skeletal muscle. 2DG uptake following exercise in the absence of insulin was not statistically decreased in the IRS2−/−L mice, but was lower in the IRS2−/−H mice (Fig.3). The -fold increase above basal in IRS2−/−H mice (2.4-fold) was similar to the WT mice (2.1-fold), suggesting that the lower exercise-induced increase in 2 DG uptake may be due to impaired basal rates of glucose transport in the IRS2−/−H mice. 2DG uptake with the combination of exercise and insulin was not altered in the IRS2−/−L mice, while 2DG uptake in the IRS2−/−H mice was lower compared with the WT and IRS2−/−L mice (Fig. 3). The partially or fully additive effects of exercise plus insulin (submaximal and maximal insulin dose) on 2DG uptake in the WT and IRS2−/−L animals was not present in the hyperglycemic IRS2−/−H mice. To determine whether IRS2 deficiency alters GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle, we measured GLUT4 protein in WT and IRS2−/− mice. Fig.4 shows that GLUT4 content in the gastrocnemius muscles was not different between the IRS2−/−L and the WT mice. However, the hyperglycemic IRS2−/−H mice had 18 and 28% less GLUT4 compared with the WT and IRS2−/−L mice, respectively. Of the four members of the IRS family that have now been identified, IRS1 (26Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn R.C. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Kahn C.R.

Both IRS1 and IRS2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin, and binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and subsequent activation of the enzyme are thought to be important for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (8Cheatham B.

Recent studies using “knockout” mouse models have advanced our understanding of the role of the insulin receptor and IRS proteins in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Muscle-specific insulin receptor knockout mice have a dramatic impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, demonstrating that the receptor is necessary for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (24Bruning J.C.

IRS1-deficient mice have normal blood glucose concentrations despite peripheral insulin resistance (13Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In the current study, we observed that IRS2−/− mice with near normal glycemia have normal rates of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. These findings demonstrate that IRS2 is not necessary for glucose transport in skeletal muscle and suggest that signaling through other molecules such as IRS1 are sufficient to mediate insulin's effects on glucose transport in this tissue. There is good evidence that the first detectable defect in human patients predisposed to type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (30Lillioja S. Mott D.M. Spraul M. Ferraro R.

IRS2−/− mice develop overt type 2 diabetes, usually by the age of 10 weeks, and these animals are characterized by impaired β-cell function and peripheral insulin resistance as measured by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). In the current study, only the IRS2−/− mice that had developed severe hyperglycemia had impaired glucose uptake in isolated skeletal muscles. Furthermore, fasting blood glucose concentrations were negatively correlated to submaximally insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the muscle. Thus, hyperglycemia resulting from hepatic insulin resistance and β-cell failure, and not the lack of IRS2 in muscle, is likely to cause insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of IRS2−/− mice. Both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia typically accompany the development of type 2 diabetes, and it is difficult to determine their priority. In the IRS2−/− mice the precursor leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes may be hyperinsulinemia, since IRS2−/− mice with near normal glycemia and normal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle were already hyperinsulinemic. Furthermore, there is the wide range of fasting insulin concentrations in IRS2−/−L mice with near normal glycemia (Table I). These findings also suggest that insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is not causing the hyperinsulinemia in these animals. Although 6–8-week-old IRS2−/− mice are hyperinsulinemic, the rate of hepatic glucose production in the fasted state is similar to WT mice (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). However, low dose insulin infusion during an insulin-glucose clamp does not suppress hepatic glucose production in IRS2−/− mice (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), and these animals also display decreased levels of liver glycogen. 2M. F. White, unpublished observations. These findings suggest that the liver is insulin-resistant for the suppression of glucose production and/or that there is impairment in glycogenesis. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, glycogen levels in the basal state were not altered in either group of IRS2−/− mice. The difference between these tissues provides further evidence that IRS2 plays a more limited role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle compared with other tissues and that insulin resistance in skeletal muscle occurs secondary to defects in glucose homeostasis in other tissues such as the liver and pancreas. It has been suggested recently that contraction-induced signaling leading to glucose transport in isolated rat cardiac myocytes involves IRS2 (22Till M. Kolter T. Eckel J. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 85A-89AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether IRS2 is necessary for the effects of exercise to increase glucose transport in skeletal muscle and if the protein is necessary for the post-exercise increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Similar to the effects of insulin, only the hyperglycemic IRS2−/− mice had impaired glucose uptake in response to exercise. For the effects of exercise “per se,” the lower rate of glucose uptake in the hyperglycemic IRS2−/− mice was probably due to lower basal rates of transport, since the -fold increment above basal was normal in these animals. The fact that the defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the post-exercise state only occurred in the IRS2−/−H mice is consistent with our hypothesis that hyperglycemia is the cause of defects in glucose transport in the muscle from IRS2−/− mice animals. Impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after exercise in hyperglycemic IRS2−/− mice could be due to decreased glycogenolysis during exercise, since post-exercise glycogen concentrations are negatively correlated with glucose transport in rat epitrochlearis muscle (31Kawanaka K. Tabata I. Tanaka A. Higuchi M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The decrease in GLUT4 content in skeletal muscle from hyperglycemic IRS2−/− mice could also be a factor leading to an impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport after exercise. However, the decrease in GLUT4 content in skeletal muscle did not result in impaired maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Given that hyperinsulinemia may be the precursor leading to insulin resistance in the IRS2−/− mice, it is of interest that there was a dramatic decrease in plasma insulin concentrations following exercise in both the IRS2−/−L and IRS2−/−H mice, regardless of prevailing blood glucose concentrations. In addition, IRS2−/−L mice with near normal glycemia had a significant decrease in blood glucose concentrations after 1 h of exercise. Although 4-week-old IRS2−/− mice were already hyperinsulinemic, the insulin response to a glucose load is nearly normal (14Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion deteriorates with aging, and then hyperglycemia results in impaired β-cell function. Given that IRS2−/− mice with near normal glycemia showed normal glucose transport and insulin response, it is possible that performance of regular exercise from an early age may have a beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis in these animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that expression of the IRS2 protein is not necessary for the stimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle in response to insulin or exercise. The initial onset of diabetes in IRS2−/− mice is not due to a defect in skeletal muscle glucose transport, and prolonged hyperglycemia may be a primary mechanism leading to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of IRS2−/− mice."

Modification of caspases by nitric oxide and its relevance during apoptosis is currently a controversial subject. In this study we analyzed the S-nitrosated form of caspase-3 at a molecular level. By using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we detected poly-S-nitrosation of caspase-3 with an average of about 2 molecules of NO bound per enzyme. Although NO treatment completely inhibited enzyme activity,S-nitrosation was not restricted to the active site cysteine. Rather, we detected multiple relative mass increases of 30 ± 1 Da in both the p12 and p17 subunits of caspase-3, corresponding to single to triple S-nitrosation. The stability of these S-nitrosations differed in physiologically relevant concentrations of 5 mmglutathione. Whereas all S-nitroso bonds in the p12 subunit were cleaved with release of NO and partial formation of protein-mixed disulfides with glutathione, a single S-nitrosation in the p17 subunit remained stable. Since this S-nitrosation was not observed in a mutant form of caspase-3 lacking the active site cysteine, we conclude that NO nitrosates the active site cysteine of caspase-3 and that this modification is notably inert to fast trans-nitrosation with glutathione. Furthermore, we provide evidence that treatment of caspase-3 with NO can lead to mixed disulfide formation with glutathione, demonstrating the oxidative character of NO.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In cellular systems, NO is produced by the enzymatic oxidation of l-arginine tol-citrulline and can directly modify proteins and thereby regulate their activity. Preferred targets for NO modification in cells are transition metal ions and sulfhydryl groups. Whereas the interactions of NO with heme-iron and iron-sulfur clusters are well established, the mechanisms and end products of NO-thiol modifications are still under investigation (3Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Depending on the redox state of a cell, the oxygen content, and the chemical properties of the thiol group, NO may favor S-nitrosation or induce oxidative reactions resulting in the formation of mixed disulfides with glutathione, intramolecular disulfides, or higher oxidative species such as sulfenic and sulfinic acids (4Stamler J.S. Hausladen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Whereas NO in low concentrations acts as a second messenger molecule in signaling pathways, high concentrations of NO may cause harmful effects (5Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar,6Brüne B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Regulation of enzyme activity by NO has been established for glutathione reductase (7Becker K. Savvides S.N. Keese M. Schirmer R.H. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), tissue-type plasminogen activator, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the small GTPase p21ras, the transcription factor oxyR, and others (for review see Ref. 8Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Recently, the possibility of employing NO to attempt to modulate the activity of the caspase family of cysteine proteases attracted increasing attention (9Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The processing of pro-caspase-3 to its active form is considered to be a point of no return in the death signaling cascade. Thus inhibition of the enzymatic activity of caspases might provide a mechanism to abort the apoptotic program. Although it has been reported that NO can protect certain cell lines from executing the apoptotic pathway (9Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 13Mannick J.B. Miao X.Q. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24125-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether direct modification of the active site thiol of caspases by NO, via formation of a nitrosothiol, contributes to this process. We have investigated S-nitrosation of caspase-3 by NO and the subsequent effect on enzyme activity. By using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (14Mann M. Wilm M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 219-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we showed that caspase-3 is, in contrast to previous studies (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), not selectively nitrosated at a single cysteine residue. Rather, we observed multiple nitrosation of the cysteine groups in caspase-3 with an average of 2 NO molecules per enzyme. A significant difference in nitrosothiol stability is seen after treatment of the nitrosated protein with physiological equivalent concentrations of GSH (5 mm). Whereas one NO remained covalently bound to the enzyme, all other nitrosothiol bonds were cleaved with release of NO and partial formation of protein-mixed disulfides with GSH. Mutation of the active site cysteine of caspase-3 followed by nitrosation and GSH treatment of the protein led to glutathionylation with the notion that no NO remained bound to the mutated p17 subunit. In summary, our studies show that NO promotes poly-S-nitrosation, oxidation, and glutathionylation of caspase-3. The full-length cDNA encoding human caspase-3 in a pET23b vector was kindly provided by Dr. G. S. Salvesen, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA (15Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20977-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Expression was performed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The His6-tagged protein was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, bacterial lysates were prepared in a phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 1 h. Caspase-3 was eluted by column chromatography with an imidazole step gradient up to 150 mm. Fractions containing caspase-3 (150 mm imidazole) were pooled, concentrated by Millipore centricons, and diluted with caspase assay buffer A (100 mmHepes, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Chaps, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Since caspase-3 spontaneously oxidized during purification, the enzyme was reduced with 30 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. Excess DTT was removed by anion exchange chromatography on a Hi-TrapQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany), equilibrated with argon-saturated buffer A. Elution was performed with a NaCl gradient up to 120 mm. To avoid further oxidation, chromatography was carried out under an argon atmosphere, and fractions containing reduced caspase-3 were stored in septum-sealed vials at 4 °C for further use or frozen at −20 °C. The overall yield of purified caspase-3 from 1.5-liter E. coli cultures was 3–4 mg. Mutation of the active site cysteine 285 2Amino acids are numbered according to the x-ray structure of caspase-1 (21Liang H. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). of caspase-3 to alanine was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany) employing the following primers: ACCCAAACTTTTCATTATTCAGGCCGCCCGTGGTACAGAACTGGACTGTGGCATT and AATGCCACAGTCCAGTTCTGTACCACGGGCGGCCTGAATAATGAAAAGTTTGGGT. The C285A mutation was verified by sequencing and subsequently transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. Expression and affinity chromatography were performed as described for wild-type caspase-3. In order to allow formation of the quaternary structure of the mutant in parallel to wild-type caspase-3, we cleaved the proform of caspase-3C285A by incubating caspase-3C285Afor 2 h at 30 °C with active caspase-3 (ratio 15:1, caspase-3C285A:caspase-3). Subsequent protein reduction and anion exchange chromatography were performed in analogy to caspase-3. Processing of caspase-3C285A was checked by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Reduced caspase-3 was diluted to a final concentration of 15 μm with buffer A containing 50 μm DTT. This concentration of DTT was necessary to avoid spontaneous oxidation during the experiments. SNAP (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany) was added at a concentration of 2 mm at room temperature, for the times indicated. Under our experimental conditions SNAP released 100–150 μm NO per h, detected by decreasing absorbance at 335 nm due to the cleavage of the S–NO bond. Reactions were stopped by buffer exchange through a Sephadex G-25 PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A for caspase activity determinations or with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, for UV-visible and mass spectrometry. Buffer exchange for caspase-3C285A was done with 3-kDa size centricons. Fractions that contained nitrosated caspase-3 revealed an absorption at 335 nm arising from the S–NO bond. Nitrosothiol formation was quantified by the Saville reaction (16Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Francis S. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, the S–NO bond was cleaved by HgCl2 in a sulfanilamide solution, acidified with hydrochloric acid. The release of NO was detected by diazodye formation with naphthylethylenediamine by UV-visible spectroscopy. Calculations are based on an extinction coefficient of 50,000m−1 cm−1 at 540 nm. Free NO in solution was determined in analogy, without HgCl2 addition. The amount of nitrosated protein was calculated as the difference between bound and free NO. Protein concentrations were determined either by Bradford or by UV absorbance at 280 nm based on an extinction coefficient of 26,000 m−1cm−1 (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The latter method was used to calculate the stoichiometry of S-nitrosation. Oxidized or nitrosated caspase-3 (100 ng) was incubated in buffer A with the indicated concentrations of GSH and DTT at 30 °C for 30 min in the case of oxidized caspase-3 or for 90 min with the nitrosated enzyme. Enzyme activity was followed by the release of AMC from the fluorescent substrate N-Ac-DEVD-AMC, 25 μm (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), at 30 °C with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorimeter (excitation wavelength 380 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm). Reactions with GSH at concentrations higher than 5 mm were performed in buffer A containing 250 mm Hepes to avoid pH shifts. Caspase-3 activity is optimal at pH 7.5 (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Reversible inhibition of caspase-3 (10 μm) was performed by incubating caspase-3 with a 50-fold molar excess of the reversible inhibitor N-Ac-DEVD-CHO for 45 min. Excess inhibitor was removed by 3 cycles of dilution/concentration in 3-kDa size centricons. Enzyme activity was determined with 200 μm N-Ac-DEVD-AMC in the presence of 10 mm DTT or 5 mm GSH. Samples were desalted on a 100-nl PorosTM R1 microcolumn. The column was assembled by injecting a dilute methanol suspension of the Poros material into a glass capillary (GC 120, Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) pulled on a microcapillary puller (model P-87, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, Canada). After carefully breaking the tip of the glass capillary, the methanol was removed by using a table centrifuge (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (18Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted in 1 μl of a 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid aqueous solution directly into a nanoelectrospray capillary. The gold-coated nanoelectrospray capillary was mounted in a nanoelectrospray ion source on an API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) for mass spectrometric analysis. The original spectra were deconvoluted using Bio-MultiView (PE-Sciex). Cross-linking of primary amines was performed with the homobifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce, BA Oud Beijerland, Netherlands). 15 μg of protein were incubated in buffer A with a final concentration of 25 μm in the presence of 1.5 mm DSS for 30 min at 22 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 30 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 15% gels and visualized by silver staining. The processed cysteine protease caspase-3 consists of 2 subunits, a 12-kDa subunit that contains 3 cysteines and a 17-kDa subunit with 5 cysteines. To obtain enzymatic activity, caspase-3 dimerizes to a heterotetramer consisting of two p12 and two p17 subunits. The histidine-activated Cys-2852 in the active site of the p17 subunit is conserved in the caspase superfamily and is required for enzyme activity (19Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar, 20Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar, 21Liang H. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The active site cysteine in caspase-3 is highly sensitive to oxidation. In accord with other results (9Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), we found a fast inactivation of caspase-3 when reducing agents such as DTT were removed during purification. In order to obtain maximal caspase-3 activity, we performed anion exchange chromatography with reduced caspase-3 under an inert gas atmosphere. The resulting enzyme still became inactivated during activity measurements in non-reducing buffer, but addition of 50 μm DTT fully restored caspase-3 activity and kept the protein sufficiently stable for the experiments described. In order to determine caspase-3 modification by NO, we incubated the protein with the NO-releasing compound SNAP. SNAP decreased caspase-3 activity in a time-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition at 50–60 min (Fig. 1). By assuming protein thiol nitrosation to be the underlying mechanism, we determined the rate of S-nitrosation in caspase-3 parallel to activity measurements. Surprisingly, NO was added to the enzyme twice as fast as caspase-3 activity decreased, resulting in a stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol of NO bound per mol of caspase-3 (p12 + p17 subunit). Since the UV-visible spectra of NO-modified caspase-3 showed no significant absorbance except for that due to the protein (280 nm) and the nitrosothiol (335 nm), our results indicate that more than one cysteine in caspase-3 undergoes nitrosation in the presence of SNAP. To analyze NO modification of caspase-3 further, we used nanospray ESI-MS (14Mann M. Wilm M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 219-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nano-spray MS allows the detection of protein molecular masses at a molecular level with an accuracy of 1 Da in 10 kDa, which is sufficient to detect the addition of NO (29 Da) to the 12- and 17-kDa subunits of caspase-3. Noncovalent bonds such as protein subunit interactions are not retained under denaturating conditions in ESI-MS, whereas covalent modifications remain intact during the measurement. Therefore, we expect two peaks in the ESI-MS spectrum of unmodified caspase-3 corresponding to the p17 and p12 subunits. We detected these peaks with distinctive masses of 16,613 and 12,961 Da (data not shown). The relative mass of the p12 subunit is increased by 1065 Da compared with the mass calculated from caspase-3 sequence (11,896 Da). This is caused by the mass of a linker region and the His6-tag used for purification. In the spectrum of nitrosated caspase-3 (Fig.2) we observed for both subunits a series of peaks with mass increases of 30 ± 1 Da, in addition to the unmodified protein, suggesting covalent binding of one to three molecules NO to each subunit. Considering the amount of unmodified protein in relation to the occurrence of single to triple S-nitrosated protein, the average amount of NO that is bound to either the p12 or p17 subunits is estimated to be approximately 2 mol of NO bound per mol of enzyme. This is in accordance with the data obtained by quantification of proteinS-nitrosation using the Griess assay (Fig. 1). Although enzyme activity is completely abolished under these experimental conditions, ESI-MS spectra show relative mass peaks corresponding to unmodified as well as single to multiple S-nitrosated p12 and p17 caspase-3 subunits. The multiple relative mass increases of 30 ± 1 Da indicate poly-S-nitrosation of caspase-3 by SNAP. Since mammalian cells have a reduced intracellular environment, we determined the stability of S-nitrosated caspase-3 toward increasing concentrations of DTT and GSH by measuring enzyme activity (Fig.3). Whereas the strong reducing agent DTT completely restored caspase-3 activity at concentrations far below 10 mm, increasing concentrations of the cellular important tripeptide GSH only slightly increased caspase activity. Even at concentrations of 30 mm GSH only 60% of caspase-3 became reactivated. Considering that purified caspase-3 showed a remarkable sensitivity toward spontaneous oxidation, which leads to enzyme inactivation, we investigated the reactivation of spontaneous and NO-enforced inactivated enzymes toward DTT and GSH (Table I). IC50 values for reactivation of the oxidized and S-nitrosated enzyme by DTT were both below 1 mm. However, reactivation of the oxidized enzyme occurred about 3 times faster compared with theS-nitrosated enzyme.Table IReactivation of oxidized and S-nitrosated caspase-3 by DTT and GSHDTTGSHCas-NOCas-OxCas-NOCas-Oxk (min−1)0.085 ± 0.0100.245 ± 0.0670.053 ± 0.0130.287 ± 0.070IC50(mm)0.90.623.81.8Spontaneously oxidized caspase-3 (Cas-Ox) and nitrosated caspase-3 (Cas-NO) (100 ng) were incubated with 5 mm GSH or 5 mm DTT.

By using GSH we determined an IC50 value of 1.8 mm for reactivation of the oxidized protein and thus in the same concentration range as observed for DTT. In contrast, 20 mm GSH was necessary to restore 50% activity of the nitrosated enzyme. Furthermore, reactivation of the oxidized enzyme by GSH occurred approximately 5 times faster compared with theS-nitrosated enzyme. These data suggest that there is a significant difference in the stability of nitrosated and spontaneously oxidized caspase-3 toward reducing agents and that only 20–30% of nitrosated caspase-3 can be reactivated under cellular relevant redox conditions of 5–10 mm GSH. Since caspase-3 activity most likely reflects the status of the active site thiol, we checked the stability of the nitrosothiol bonds toward GSH by ESI-MS (Fig. 4). In the p12 subunit, we observe the removal of NO from all cysteine residues after treatment of nitrosated caspase-3 with 5 mm GSH. Instead we find a peak at a distance of 305 Da from that for the unmodified enzyme that accounts for incorporation of GSH. This indicates mixed disulfide formation of the cysteine residues of caspase-3 with GSH with release of NO. In the p17 subunit that contains the active site thiol, we detected unmodified protein, a peak with a mass increase of 32 Da, and a 305-Da shift of both peaks. This indicates that in the p17 subunit one NO remains bound to the protein and that GSH is incorporated. We conclude that only one cysteine-NO bond in the p17 subunit is stable in the presence of reducing agents, whereas others are cleaved by GSH, in part at the expense of protein-mixed disulfide formation with GSH. Our mass spectrometric data show that the p17 subunit of caspase-3 remains partially nitrosated in the presence of 5 mm GSH. Furthermore, we found that the enzymatic activity in these samples reached only 20–30% of unmodified caspase-3 activity. We therefore questioned whether the stable S—NO bond directly affects the active site of caspase-3. In order to test this hypothesis, we mutated the active site of caspase-3 from cysteine to alanine. The mutation revealed an enzymatically inactive protein with the mass of about 32 kDa which does not undergo autocatalytic cleavage to the p12 and p17 subunit. Since a comparison between the active caspase-3 and caspase-3C285Ademands the processed tetrameric structure of the enzyme, we cleaved caspase-3C285A using active caspase-3 in 15 times lower concentrations. As a result, we obtained two subunits of caspase-3C285A that were used for subsequent experiments. ESI-MS analysis of caspase-3C285A revealed a peak with the mass of 12,962 Da corresponding to the unchanged p12 subunit and the p17 peak with the mass of 16,583 Da, which is reduced by 32 Da (mutation of Cys (–SH) to Ala (–H)) compared with the p17 peak in wild-type caspase-3 (Table II).Table IIESI-MS analysis of caspase-3C285AProtein speciesDetected molecular mass (Da)Peak identification (subunit + relative mass shift (Da))Interpretation of relative mass shiftDaCaspase-3C285A12,962p1216,583p17Caspase-3C285A + NO12,962p1212,991p12 + 29+ NO13,019p12 + 57+ 2 NO16,584p1716,613p17 + 29+ NOCaspase-3C285A + NO + GSH12,961p1213,267p12 + 306+ GSH13,577p12 + 616+ 2 GSH16,584p1716,889p17 + 305+ GSH17,198p17 + 614+ 2 GSHCaspase-3C285A was cleaved with active caspase-3, purified by anion exchange chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reduced protein (15 μm) was incubated with 2 mm SNAP for 90 min.

Open table in a new tab Caspase-3C285A was cleaved with active caspase-3, purified by anion exchange chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reduced protein (15 μm) was incubated with 2 mm SNAP for 90 min. Excess NO donor was removed by solvent exchange with 3-kDa size centricons. In part, nitrosated caspase-3C285A was incubated with 5 mm GSH for 90 min. Nitrosated caspase-3C285Aand the GSH-treated enzyme were analyzed by mass spectrometry in analogy to wild-type caspase-3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Peaks of the ESI-MS spectra are shown in the table. We then nitrosated caspase-3C285A and analyzed the protein by mass spectrometry (Table II). In both subunits we found unmodified enzyme and intensive peaks for the addition of one NO (+29 Da). Additional nitrosation is weakly observed in the p12 subunit (+57 Da) but hardly detectable in the mutated p17 subunit. For further comparisons, we treated the nitrosated protein with 5 mmGSH. The ESI-MS spectra of those samples showed in the p12 subunit, in analogy to wild-type caspase-3, the peak for unmodified caspase-3C285A at 12,961 Da, a peak with relative mass increases of 306 Da, and a small adduct of 616 Da, respectively, which accounts for mixed disulfide formation of caspase-3C285Awith one or two molecules of GSH. In the p17 subunit we observed the peak for unmodified caspase-3C285A at 16,584 Da but no additional peak at a distance of 30 Da which would indicate the addition of NO. A small peak at 16,889 Da and an additional peak at 17,198 Da represent mixed disulfides of the p17 subunit with glutathione. The experiments with caspase-3C285A show that the protein is nitrosated but there is no stable S—NO bond in the presence of 5 mm GSH in the p17 subunit, although glutathionylation is observed in analogy to wild-type caspase-3. To gain further insight into the binding of NO to wild-type caspase-3, the active site cysteine was protected by the reversible caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO. The inhibitor should block S-nitrosation of the active site, and following inhibitor withdrawal an active enzyme should be generated. Caspase-3 was blocked by a 50-fold excess of DEVD-CHO over protein that completely attenuated enzyme activity. The DEVD-CHO inhibited enzyme was then nitrosated by exposure to 2.5 mm SNAP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thereafter, free DEVD-CHO and excess NO were removed, followed by activity determination with an excess of substrate (200 μm DEVD-AMC). In the presence of 10 mm DTT 35–40% of the initial enzyme activity was recovered. Since it is known that 10 mm DTT completely restores enzyme activity following oxidation or nitrosation, it is assumed that not all inhibitor had been removed from the active site, thus allowing the recovery of only a maximum of 1/3 of the starting activity under these conditions. We then assayed enzyme activity in the presence of 5 mm GSH, which is known to leave the stable S—NO bond in the p17 subunit intact but to allow circumventing the oxidation of caspase-3. Again, 37 ± 1% (mean ± S.D., n= 2) of the initial activity (enzyme without inhibitor) was measured in the presence of GSH and 200 μm substrate. When caspase-3 was treated with inhibitor and subsequently nitrosated, followed by NO removal, 39 ± 1% (mean ± S.D., n = 2) of the starting activity was recovered. Obviously NO cannot directly attenuate caspase-3 activity when the active site is blocked by an reversible inhibitor, which further supports the notion that one inhibitory site affected by NO is indeed cysteine 285. To analyze whether the subunits of caspase-3C285A are able to form the tetrameric complex that is necessary for catalytic activity and probably affects the access of NO to the active site of the protein, we performed cross-linking experiments with the homobifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (22Craig W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DSS covalently connects primary amines at a distance of 11 Å. Therefore, the structure of proteins in solution can be fixed for further analysis by SDS-PAGE. The processed caspase-3C285A showed two bands on silver-stained SDS gels, representing the individual subunits of the protein with the masses of 12 and 17 kDa (Fig.5 lane 3). These bands disappear after treatment with 1.5 mm DSS. Instead a band at approximately 58 kDa is observed which accounts for the (p12/p17)2 tetramer of caspase-3C285A(lane 6). Since we have shown that the mutation of one amino acid in caspase-3 does not lead to conformational rearrangements in the tetrameric protein complex, we investigated the influence of NO on the quaternary structure of caspase-3. Performing cross-linking experiments with the nitrosated protein, we intended to show whether NO dissociates the caspase-3 tetramer and thus inhibits enzyme activity. The comparison between caspase-3 and the nitrosated enzyme before and after cross-linking with DSS revealed no significant differences (Fig. 5,lanes 4 and 5). For the wild-type and theS-nitrosated species we observed, in analogy to caspase-3C285A, a band corresponding to the tetramer at 58 kDa. The weak band at approximately 40 kDa is caused by insufficient cross-linking and may represent a trimeric species. In summary, neither mutation nor nitrosation of caspase-3 prevents formation of the terameric structure of the protein. This implies that enzyme inhibition by NO resulted from posttranslational modifications rather than from overall structural changes of caspase-3. In this study we used ESI-MS to detect poly-S-nitrosation of caspase-3 which is associated with enzyme inhibition. Exposure of the nitrosated protein to GSH led toS-glutathionylation of particular cysteine residues, but one cysteine residue in the p17 subunit remained in itsS-nitrosated form. Since an active site mutant of caspase-3 does not show the stable S—NO bond, we suggest that NO modifies the active site thiol of caspase-3 by nitrosation and that thisS-nitrosation is rather inert to trans-nitrosation in relevant cellular concentrations of GSH. Besides nitrosative inhibition of caspase-3, we observed a fast oxidation of the enzyme in the absence of reducing agents. Since oxidation is reversed by DTT and GSH, we suggest that disulfide formation accounts for enzyme inhibition. Moreover, the oxidation to a disulfide is not associated with significant changes in the molecular mass of caspase-3 and thus explains the presence of the unmodified protein detected by ESI-MS in enzymatically inactive protein samples. Exposing spontaneously oxidized and nitrosated caspase-3 to physiological concentrations of GSH, we investigated a possible relevance of nitrosation and oxidation to enzyme activity under reducing conditions. Since the activity of oxidized caspase-3 is restored, intramolecular oxidation is unlikely to account for enzyme inhibition under cellular conditions in the absence of oxidative stress. In contrast, the NO modified form of one cysteine residue remains stable in the presence of GSH. Assuming that this stable nitrosothiol bond is located in the active site of caspase-3, the high stability might be explained by the higher nucleophilicity of the active site cysteine compared with the other cysteine residues. X-ray analysis showed that Cys-285 is activated by His-237 (21Liang H. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This might stabilize the S—NO bond and protects the active site from the attack of nucleophilic GSH. However, at high concentrations of GSH the equilibrium between nitrosation of caspase-3 and GSH may shift to formation of S-nitrosoglutathione. In order to explain the partial reactivation of caspase-3 by GSH, we propose that inhibition of caspase-3 is caused not only by nitrosation but also by low levels of oxidation that causes intramolecular disulfide formation. By addition of GSH, the disulfide is reduced, and caspase-3 activity is restored. Furthermore, the nitrosothiol may be cleaved by trans-nitrosation with GSH. With respect to enzyme activity, we propose a low trans-nitrosation rate at physiological GSH levels that increases with higher GSH concentrations and thus explains the recovery of 60% caspase-3 activity in the presence of 30 mm GSH. The observed glutathionylation of nitrosated caspase-3 by GSH might be interpreted as an NO-induced oxidation. Possibly, the lower nucleophilicity of the non-activated cysteine residues in caspase-3 and the resulting weak S-nitroso bonds facilitate mixed disulfide formation with GSH. Since both nitrosation and oxidation may be induced by NO in the same molecule, this implies that the chemical property of a cysteine residue is an important factor that influences the balance between nitrosative and oxidative pathways. By using ESI-MS we detected posttranslational modifications in caspase-3 and could show the distribution of NO on the 2 subunits of the protein. To identify the modified amino acids we used an indirect approach. Comparing mutated caspase-3 with wild-type protein after treatment with NO and GSH, we found that the ESI-MS spectrum of caspase-3C285A does not obtain the peak for the stable S-NO bond, detectable in wild-type caspase-3. However, we could still detect the mass shifts of approximately 305 Da in the ESI-MS spectra of caspase-3C285A and the wild-type protein, resulting from glutathionylation. The occurrence of these peaks imply that the other cysteine residues in both protein species have similar chemical properties. Additionally, we investigated the binding of NO to wild-type caspase-3 by reversibly blocking the active site cysteine with the inhibitor DEVD-CHO. Again, NO could not modify the enzyme in the absence of the active site, shown by the recovery of enzyme activity upon inhibitor withdrawal. Another factor that might influence the interaction of caspase-3 with NO is structural rearrangements in the protein. Thus, for correct interpretation of ESI-MS data of caspase-3C285A in comparison to wild-type caspase-3, we analyzed the quaternary structure of both proteins. The most important and required structural characteristic for caspase-3 activity is the formation of a (p12/p17)2 tetramer (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Liang H. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To detect this species, we performed cross-linking experiments with caspase-3C285A and nitrosated caspase-3. Both the modified enzymes as well as wild-type caspase-3 form the tetramer in solution. Although we cannot determine minor structural changes of caspase-3 by cross-linking experiments, we provide evidence that neither NO nor the mutation of cysteine to alanine in the active site causes enzyme inhibition by dissociation of the caspase-3 tetramer. Since our data fit to the model of active site nitrosation of caspase-3 as a result of NO-induced enzyme inhibition, one may speculate about the relevance of this process under cellular conditions. It is reported that NO prevents cell death in certain cell lines, e.g.hepatocytes at least in part by modulation of caspase-3 activity (9Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). If we propose caspase-3 as a target for NO in apoptosis, other members of the caspase family that are highly homologous should also be considered (10Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 19Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). In addition, whether and how the inactive proforms of caspases are modified by NO and whether caspase inhibition by nitrosation is only possible once the enzyme is activated by proteolysis need to be investigated. Thus, the time course of caspase activation in correlation with the cellular NO concentration seems to be important. Assuming that pro-caspases are not targeted by NO, one could explain the apparent “paradox” that NO not only inhibits but also induces apoptosis in certain cell lines (6Brüne B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Blood. 1998; 91: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation could be that in these cell lines NO initiates the apoptotic signaling cascade without affecting pro-caspases. Once caspases are processed into their active form the NO concentration is decreased to a level that is not sufficient to modulate caspase activity by S-nitrosation. Effects similar to those of NO are observed for oxidative agents (24Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is able to induce and inhibit apoptosis. Thus one might also speculate whether under cellular conditions effects induced by NO are channeled into oxidative reaction pathways. Here we have used ESI-MS to characterize NO-induced posttranslational modifications of caspase-3, and we have detected nitrosothiol formation at similar rates as published by others (9Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated the distribution of NO at a molecular level, and we observed an unselective poly-S-nitrosation of the protein that is accompanied by oxidation in the absence of reducing agents. In the presence of GSH, one NO-modified cysteine, which is not detectable in caspase-3C285A, remained in its nitrosated form, whereas the other nitrosothiols were cleaved at the expense of protein-mixed disulfide formation with GSH. Whether a similar mechanism might occur under cellular conditions and how a model of caspase-3 inhibition by S-nitrosation fits to the observation that NO can induce apoptosis with activation of caspases needs to be investigated.

Mammalian genomes encode approximately 50 members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M.

The receptors for steroids, retinoids, thyroid hormone, and a number of other ligands currently comprise about half of the superfamily. These proteins are ligand-dependent transcription factors that generally bind DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers and activate transcription in the presence of their ligands. The rest of the family is made up by the orphan receptors, which do not have known ligands but share sequence similarity with the conventional receptors (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). Throughout the superfamily the highest sequence similarities are observed in the DNA binding domains, which are zinc-binding modules. Lesser conservation is observed in the ligand binding domains, with as little as 20% sequence identity between the most divergent family members. However, x-ray crystallographic studies have confirmed that even divergent sequences adopt very similar three-dimensional structures (3Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D.

Within the receptor superfamily, SF-1 is also somewhat unusual in that it binds DNA efficiently as a monomer. SF-1 is required for development of both gonads and adrenals (8Luo X. Ikeda Y.

The very broad range of receptors sensitive to this inhibition suggests a central role for SHP in modulation of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Although the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of SHP remain to be defined, they depend on a variety of factors, particularly the relative amounts of SHP and its targets. Thus, factors that increase or decrease SHP expression could have significant effects on receptor signaling. To identify such factors, we have studied the SHP promoter. Among a number of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors examined, SF-1 and the closely related orphan FTF were found to stimulate SHP promoter function. A combination of mutagenesis and footprinting studies revealed a series of functional SF-1 binding sites in close proximity to the transcription start site and demonstrated that each of three high affinity sites is necessary for transactivation. These results suggest that SF-1 and FTF are important regulators of SHP expression and that increasing or decreasing the amounts or specific activity of SF-1 or FTF could have indirect effects on a variety of receptor dependent signaling pathways. Various reporter constructs for the mouse and human SHP promoters were prepared by insertion of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 5′-flanking regions of the two genomic DNAs into a previously described luciferase reporter (14Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of 5′ deletion constructs of mouse SHP promoter has been described elsewhere (15Lee H.-K. Lee Y.-K. Park S.-H. Kim Y.-S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.-B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.-S. J.

Point mutations were introduced into the SHP(−453)luc reporter using polymerase chain reaction with primers in which the GG in the SF-1 consensus site was altered to TT. The SF-1luc reporter has five copies of an SF-1 consensus sequence in front of the prolactin promoter, as described previously (16Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol.

A pCI human FTF expression vector is a kind gift from Dr. Luc Belanger. For in vitro translation of SF-1, SF-1 insert from pCEP4-SF-1 was placed downstream of the T7 promoter in the pT7 vector. HepG2 and Y1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. One day before transfection, cells were split into 12-well plates. In general, 4 h after replacement with fresh medium the cells were transfected using calcium phosphate (17$$Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg/well of both the luciferase reporter and the TKGH (18Selden R.F.

However, in comparisons of SHP promoter deletion constructs, equimolar amounts were used. Luciferase expression was assayed and normalized using growth hormone expression as described previously (19Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell.

Bacterially expressed GST-SF1 fusion protein was incubated with approximately 30 fmol of end-labeled DNA probe at room temperature for 30 min, and the reaction mixture was digested with DNase I for 3 min using standard conditions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The digested products were analyzed using 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the five SF-1 protected sites from the SHP promoter region were used as DNA probes. SF-1 protein was expressed using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The assays were performed essentially as described (9Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μl of the lysate was incubated with end-labeled probe for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by 5% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Competition assays used either 1-, 5-, and 20-fold molar excesses of a unlabeled oligonucleotide containing sft1, the furthest upstream SF-1 binding site, or 100-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a mutant version of the sft1 sequence in which the GG in the SF-1 consensus was changed to TT. In order to study the regulation of SHP gene expression, approximately 2 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SHP gene was introduced into a luciferase reporter construct. A variety of nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors were tested for ability to stimulate the SHP promoter in transient transfection. Among these, the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 was found to enhance SHP promoter driven luciferase activity 2–10-fold, depending on the cell type transfected. In Y1 cells, which have been routinely used for studies of SF-1 transactivation (16Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SF-1 expression increased SHP promoter activity by approximately 5-fold, whereas the TKluc reporter, which contains the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter from herpes simplex virus, did not respond to SF-1 (Fig.1 A). The closely related human SHP promoter showed a similar transactivation by SF-1, although basal promoter activity was somewhat lower. Similar results were also observed in the human hepatocyte-derived cell line, HepG2 (data not shown). In order to map sequences required for SF-1 activation, a series of 5′ deletions of the SHP promoter (15Lee H.-K. Lee Y.-K. Park S.-H. Kim Y.-S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.-B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were used. As shown in Fig.1 B, SF-1 responsiveness was retained with a deletion up to −352, but was lost with the −238 construct, indicating that sequences required for SF-1 response lie in the region between −352 and −238. This region is not sufficient to confer SF-1 response, however, since a number of constructs in which fragments, including this region, inserted upstream of either the murine SHP TATA box or the TK promoter failed to show such response (data not shown). To directly identify SF-1 binding sites within the proximal promoter, bacterially expressed GST-SF1 fusion protein was used for DNase I footprinting with a murine SHP promoter fragment extending from −453 to +21. As shown in Fig. 2 A, five areas of strong protection were identified (sft1–5) with increasing amount of the fusion protein. Sequence analysis of these regions revealed that each of these footprints contained a sequence matching the consensus SF-1 binding site (20Keri R.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10782-10785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Footprints sft1, sft3, and sft4 contain motifs that differ from the SF-1 consensus sequence at only one position; and the sft2 and sft5 motifs contain two mismatches (Fig. 2 B). Similar elements were also observed in the human SHP promoter. Gel mobility shifts were used to confirm these footprinting results and test the relative binding affinity of SF-1 for each site. As shown in Fig. 3, SF-1 bound oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the five sites, as expected. An sft1 oligonucleotide with a GG to TT mutation in the core of the SF-1 binding site, which abolishes specific DNA binding (21Shen W.H. Moore C.C. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), was unable to compete for binding. Consistent with their sequences, sft1, sft3, and sft4 were relatively resistant to competitions with increasing amounts of an unlabeled sft1 oligonucleotide, indicating that they bind SF-1 with high affinity. Sites sft2 and sft5 have lower apparent affinity for SF-1, as they were more sensitive to competition with the sft1 oligonucleotide. The deletion results indicate that the presence of sites sft3, sft4, and sft5 is not sufficient to confer response to SF-1. To explore the requirements of the individual sites for the SF-1 responsiveness in more detail, a GG to TT double substitution was introduced into each site individually in the SHP(-453)luc reporter construct. As indicated in Fig. 4, mutation of either sft1, sft3, or sft4 abolished transactivation by SF-1 (msft1, msft3, and msft4). On the other hand, mutation of sft5 had only a modest effect, and mutation of sft2 had no effect. Similar results were reproduced in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Thus, the transactivation results with the individual mutant constructs are consistent with both the 5′ deletion results, which indicated that loss of sft1 and sft2 in SHP(−238)luc was accompanied by a loss of SF-1 response, and also with the individual binding results, which showed weaker affinity for sft2 and sft5. We conclude that each of the high affinity sites, sft1, sft3, and sft4, is essential for SF-1 transactivation of the murine SHP promoter. The response of SHP to SF-1 is consistent with the coexpression of the two orphans in adrenals (15Lee H.-K. Lee Y.-K. Park S.-H. Kim Y.-S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.-B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.-S.

Lovell-Badge R. Camerino G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, SHP is also relatively abundant in liver, which does not express SF-1, but does express its relative FTF (23Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (also known as LRH-1). Previous results indicate that the DNA binding specificity of SF-1 and FTF is indistinguishable (23Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the SHP promoter should also be transactivated by FTF. In accord with this prediction, the −2080 mouse SHP promoter construct was responsive to FTF in HepG2 cells (Fig.5). However, this response differs somewhat from that of SF-1 in Y1 cells, since the SHP(−453)luc construct retaining the five footprints showed little or no transactivation by FTF. The basis for this requirement for additional 5′ sequences remains to be identified. Previous results demonstrate that SHP acts to inhibit transactivation by a number of the members of nuclear receptor superfamily (9Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 10Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Seol W.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These inhibitory effects are not absolute, but are dependent on the relative amounts of both SHP and its various targets. Thus, information on factors that increase or decrease SHP expression is clearly central to understanding its regulatory effects. Based on this, we examined a number of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other transcription factors for effects on the SHP promoter. As described here, the SHP promoter can be strongly transactivated by SF-1 and FTF. The magnitude of this response is consistent with the fact that the promoter contains at least five SF-1/FTF binding sites. Recently, we have found that the promoter can also be transactivated by the estrogen receptor. 2W. Seol, Y.-K. Lee, D. D. Moore, and M. Brown, manuscript in preparation. The activation of the SHP promoter by SF-1 is consistent with the presence of SHP transcripts in several SF-1 expressing tissues or cell lines, including rat testis and adrenal (12Johansson L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the adrenal-derived Y-1 cell line. 3Y.-K. Lee, unpublished data. Similarly, the response to FTF is consistent with the expression of SHP in liver (9Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, the current results suggest that alterations in the levels of SF-1 and FTF could have important effects on a variety of nuclear receptor signaling pathways as a consequence of their effects on SHP. Each of the three highest affinity binding sites is essential for SF-1 response in Y1 adrenocortical cell lines, since mutation of any one of them abolishes SF-1 transactivation. This finding contrasts with results with some other promoters, in which individual elements are sufficient to confer response to various receptors. However, it is also consistent with results with other promoters found to have multiple SF-1 sites, such as those directing expression of steroid 21-hydroxylase (24Rice D.A. Kronenberg M.S. Mouw A.R. Aitken L.D. Franklin A. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8052-8058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (25Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Kallen C.B. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7249-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This need for multiple sites suggests that SF-1 may be particularly dependent on cooperative or synergistic interactions for effective function. Thus, in promoters that apparently contain single functional SF-1 binding sites, SF-1 may be synergizing with other transcription factors. Recent reports of cooperative function of SF-1 and NGFI-A in the luteinizing hormone β subunit promoter (26Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and SF-1 and Sp1 in the bovine CYP11A promoter (27Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) provide apparent examples of such synergy. The observation that SHP is a general inhibitor of nuclear receptor transactivation raises the possibility that it may act in negative feedback loops to inhibit its own expression. This would contrast with findings with several other nuclear receptor superfamily members, including SF-1 (28Nomura M. Nawata H. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8243-8249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and all three retinoic acid receptor genes (29de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H.

Surprisingly, preliminary results indicate that SHP stimulates SF-1 transactivation, but inhibits FTF transactivation, suggesting that it can affect its own promoter both negatively and positively. Further studies will be necessary to define the molecular basis of these apparently disparate effects of SHP.

Previous work in our laboratories produced compositional information on the PC-glycan of ES-62, a secreted protein of the rodent parasite Acanthocheilonema viteae. In particular, we established using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (MS) analysis that PC was attached to a glycan with a trimannosyl core, with and without core fucosylation, carrying between one and four additional N-acetylglucosamine residues. In the present study, we demonstrate that this structure is conserved among filarial nematodes, including the parasite of humans,Onchocerca volvulus, for which new drugs are most urgently sought.

A number of studies performed in vitro lead to the conclusion that this PC may have an immunomodulatory function. Thus, PC-containing filarial products have been shown to (i) inhibit proliferation of human T-cells induced by phytoheamagglutinin (2Lal R.B. Kumaraswami V. Steel C. Nutman T.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 42: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and also murine B cells induced via the antigen receptor (3Harnett W. Harnett M.M. J.

As these effects appear to be largely due to the PC moiety of the molecules, we are interested in the possibility of developing novel anti-filarial drugs that prevent PC attachment during biosynthesis. Structural and biosynthetic information on PC-containing filarial biopolymers is an essential prerequisite to rational design of such drugs. ES-62 is the major PC-containing protein secreted byAcanthocheilonema viteae, a rodent filarial nematode (7Harnett W. Worms M.J. Kapil A. Grainger M. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1989; 99: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that PC is attached to the N-linked glycans in ES-62 (8Harnett W. Houston K.M. Amess R. Worms M.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Houston K.M. Harnett W. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), almost certainly being added in the Golgi during intracellular trafficking following the generation of an appropriate glycan substrate (10Houston K.M. Cushley W.C. Harnett W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric structural analyses have defined the types of N-glycan in ES-62 that carry PC substitution (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They all have a trimannosyl core, which is characteristic of eukaryotic N-glycans, and a portion are core-fucosylated. In addition they carry between one and fourN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues that are separately attached as antenna “stubs” to the core. It is likely that PC is attached directly to one or more of these GlcNAc residues (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although such information on structure/biosynthesis may be employed in the design of inhibitors of PC attachment to ES-62, it is unknown whether PC is attached to similar glycan structures on all filarial nematodes, and hence the relevance to drug development for human filarial parasites is uncertain. To address this issue, we have begun to screen a range of filarial parasites for their N-glycan content. In this study, we compared the major N-glycans present in extracts of adult A. viteae with similar extracts from Onchocerca volvulus, the human filarial nematode for which safe and effective drugs against adult stages is most urgently sought (12World Health Organization Tropical Disease Research, Progress 1995–96, Thirteenth Programme Report UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research & Training in Tropical Diseases. WHO, Geneva1997: 86-99Google Scholar), and with secreted material from the closely related (13Copeman D.B. Acta Trop. 1993; 53: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) bovine parasite Onchocerca gibsoni, which has been employed for drug screening (14Copeman D.B. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1979; 30: 469-474Google Scholar). We show that the two Onchocercaspecies have PC-containing glycans of the type identified in A. viteae, indicating that PC-glycans could be a target for the development of wide-spectrum anti-filarial drugs. Furthermore, we report the unexpected discovery of highly unusual N-linked glycans, the antennae of which are composed of chito-oligomers. All three nematodes show remarkable similarity in their chito-oligomer content. Adult A. viteae (mixed males and females) were recovered from jirds (Meriones libycus) infected eight weeks previously according to the method of Wormset al. (15Worms M.J. Terry R.J. Terry A. J. Parasitol. 1961; 47: 963-970Crossref Google Scholar). The worms were washed several times in sterile RPMI 1640 medium before being homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing proteolytic enzyme inhibitors as described previously (16Harnett W.

MALDI-MS was performed in the Reflectron mode using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager Elite mass spectrometer with delayed extraction. Samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 80:20 (v/v) methanol:water, and aliquots (0.5 μl) of the resulting solutions were analyzed using a matrix of 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid. Angiotensin and insulin B chain were employed as external calibrants. In our previous work on ES-62, we showed that FAB-MS of perdeuteroacetylated derivatives provides a sensitive means of detecting low molecular weight glycans substituted with PC (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have used a similar strategy in the present work to examine each of the parasite samples for PC-substituted glycans. N-Glycans were released by PNGase F digestion of reduced/carboxymethylated trypsinized material. The glycans were separated from more hydrophobic components by passing the digest through a Sep-Pak cartridge and were analyzed by FAB-MS after perdeuteroacetylation and Sep-Pak purification. All samples gave molecular ions analogous to those observed previously in ES-62 (Fig.1 and TableI). The major signals in Fig.1 A correspond to protonated molecular ions, whereas those in Fig. 1 B are sodiated; Fig. 1 C shows similar amounts of protonated and sodiated species. The data are consistent with compositions PC1HexNAc3–6Hex3Fuc0–1(Table I) corresponding to the structures shown in Fig.2. It is notable that the most abundant PC-containing glycans from A. viteae and O. gibsoni are core-fucosylated, whereas O. volvulusglycans are predominantly nonfucosylated. Signals corresponding to neutral N-glycans were observed in all three samples (Fig. 1and Table I). Once again, these were consistent with data previously obtained from ES-62 (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H.

Our earlier studies of ES-62 indicated that although glycans containing several PC substituents are rather intractable to direct MS analysis, putative glycan scaffolds for multiple PC substitution could be readily detected after PC release. We proposed the following simple strategy for screening for large and/or multiply PC-substituted glycans (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A portion of the sample is initially screened for the presence of components lacking PC moieties. This is achieved by MS analyses of permethylated derivatives using experimental procedures involving chloroform extraction that do not allow the recovery of charged material from the permethylation procedure. A second portion is then treated with aqueous hydrofluoric acid using conditions that are known to cleave phosphodiester linkages. The products are permethylated and analyzed by MS. Molecular ions that are observed only after HF treatment are indicative of components in the native sample that have HF-sensitive functional groups, such as PC. When we applied this strategy to the phosphate-buffered saline and excretory secretory extracts, we made the unexpected discovery that N-glycans with highly unusual antennae are present in all three nematodes. FAB-MS of PNGase-F released permethylated glycans from the three species of filarial nematodes gave data corresponding to high mannose (Hex5–9HexNAc2) and truncated structures (Fuc0–1Hex2–4 HexNAc2) consistent with those previously observed in our studies of ES-62 (11Haslam S.M. Khoo K.-H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and were not investigated further (data not shown). In contrast, spectra from samples that had been treated with HF after the PNGase F digestion showed abundant new signals, the compositions of which suggested novel structures (Fig. 3). The spectra are dominated by a series of glycans with composition HexNAc3–11Hex3Fuc0–1 (TableII). These compositions are consistent with substoichiometrically fucosylated trimannosyl cores to which are added between one and eight N-acetylhexosamine residues. As previously observed (Fig. 1 and Table I), the N-glycans ofO. volvulus are core-fucosylated to a much lesser degree than those of A. viteae and O. gibsoni.Table IIAssignments of molecular and fragment ions observed in FAB and MALDI spectra of permethylated N-glycans of A. viteae, O. gibsoni, and O. volvulus after treatment with HF eluting in the 50% aqueous acetonitrile (v/v) fraction from a Sep-Pak C18Signal (m/z)Assignment260HexNAc+464HexHexNAc+505HexNAc2+679FucHexNAc2+750HexNAc3+872Hex3HexNAc+967Hex2HexNAc2+Na+995HexNAc4+1117Hex3HexNAc2+1141FucHex2HexNAc2+Na+1171Hex3HexNAc2+Na+1240HexNAc5+1280Hex5HexNAc+1416Hex3HexNAc3+Na+1579Hex5HexNAc2+Na+1590FucHex3HexNAc3+Na+1661Hex3HexNAc4+Na+1783Hex6HexNAc2+Na+1835FucHex3HexNAc4+Na+1906Hex3HexNAc5+Na+1987Hex7HexNAc2+Na+2080FucHex3HexNAc5+Na+2151Hex3HexNAc6+Na+2325FucHex3HexNAc6+Na+2396Hex3HexNAc7+Na+2570FucHex3HexNAc7+Na+2641Hex3HexNAc8+Na+2815FucHex3HexNAc8+Na+2886Hex3HexNAc9+Na+3060FucHex3HexNAc9+Na+3131Hex3HexNAc10+Na+3305FucHex3HexNAc10+Na+3376Hex3HexNAc11+Na+3550FucHex3HexNAc11+Na+3621Hex3HexNAc12+Na+3795FucHex3HexNAc12+Na+3866Hex3HexNAc13+Na+4040FucHex3HexNAc13+Na+4111Hex3HexNAc14+Na+4285FucHex3HexNAc14+Na+4356Hex3HexNAc15+Na+ Open table in a new tab In order to ensure that the data acquired after HF treatment were associated with N-glycans released by PNGase F digestion, rather than being derived from saccharides present in the original sample, the following series of experiments was carried out. Worm material was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin, and the product mixture was fractionated on reverse phase Sep-Pak C18. The aqueous eluent, which would contain oligo- and polysaccharide components, was analyzed in the same way as described above for PNGase F-released glycans, whereas the included fractions containing peptides and glycopeptides was subjected to PNGase F digestion as before. These experiments (data not shown) confirmed that the chito-oligomeric components were not present in the aqueous eluent and were only observed after PNGase F digestion of the glycopeptide fraction. Corroborative evidence for the existence of a family ofN-acetylhexosamine-rich N-glycans was provided by MALDI-MS, which yields molecular ions at very high sensitivity (Fig.4). In addition to the molecular ions consistent with compositions HexNAc3–11Hex3Fuc0–1, the added sensitivity of the instrumentation allows the detection of larger structures in the series up to a maximum composition of HexNAc15Hex3. An important feature of FAB-MS is that it yields abundant fragment ions (A-type fragment ions), which are formed by cleavages at HexNAc residues. These provide information on the types and lengths of antennae (23.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 22Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1987; 6: 331-393Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The low mass fragment ion region of the FAB spectra were very similar for all three filarial nematodes; the A. viteae spectrum is shown as a representative example (Fig.5 and Table II). The most abundant A-type ions occur at m/z 260, 505, 750, 995, and 1240, which correspond to HexNAc1–5+. This indicates the presence of N-glycans with highly unusual antennae comprising up to five N-acetylhexosamine residues; in some experiments, an additional A-type ion at m/z 1485 was observed, indicating the probable presence of HexNAc6 as a minor constituent. To further explore the nature of the unusual HexNAc-rich antenna, the A-type fragment ions were subjected to CAD MS-MS experiments. The CAD MS-MS spectrum of HexNAc5+ (m/z 1240 (Fig.6)) contains three series of daughter ions (m/z 995, 750, 505, and 260; m/z 1009, 764, 519, and 274; and m/z 1178, 933, 688, 443, and 198), the derivation of which is shown in Fig. 6, inset. These fragment ions are consistent with an unbranched sequence of fiveN-acetylhexosamine residues in 1–4 linkage.Figure 6Positive ion CAD mass spectrum of theA. viteae HexNAc 5+ A-type fragment ion. Structurally informative fragment ions are assigned on the inset. The fragment ions at m/z 154 and 196 are a ketene increment apart. The latter has a mass equivalent to loss of two methanol groups from m/z 260 and is probably formed by extrusion of HexNAc moieties from the parent ion by a combination of elimination and glycosidic cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Linkage analysis data for the HF-treated N-glycans of A. viteae are shown in Table III. The other two species of filarial nematode gave similar data. From these data we can conclude that the presence of high levels of 2-Man, 2,4-Man, and 2,6-Man is consistent with bi-, tri-, and tetraantennnary complex type glycans being the dominant structures. However, the most striking feature of the linkage data is the abundance of the peak corresponding to 4-linked GlcNAc (Fig. 7). Its size cannot be explained purely by core derived 4-linked GlcNAc, and the lack of other major signals corresponding to linked HexNAc residues suggests that the unusual HexNAc-rich N-glycan antennae are composed of 4-linked GlcNAc. GlcNAc is also the most abundant terminal sugar indicating that the majority of complex type structures have this residue at there nonreducing termini, although some antennae are likely to be capped with GalNAc because this is present as a minor terminal residue in the linkage data (Fig. 7). The presence of terminal mannose is consistent with the high mannose and truncated structures observed in the FAB experiments both before and after HF treatment (see above). The presence of terminal fucose and 4,6-GlcNAc, both of which are of lower abundance in O. volvulus, are in accord with core fucosylation. The identification of high levels of 3,6-Man without detectable levels of 3,4,6-Man indicates the lack of bisecting GlcNAc.Table IIIGC-MS analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates obtained from the PNGase F released N-glycans of A. viteae after HF treatmentElution timeCharacteristic fragment ionsAssignmentRelative abundancemin16.95115, 118, 131, 162, 175Terminal fucose0.2118.55102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 205Terminal mannose0.4418.83102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 205Terminal galactose0.0119.78129, 130, 161, 1902-Linked mannose0.6520.23102, 118, 129, 162, 189, 2336-Linked mannose0.0721.02130, 190, 2332,4-Linked mannose0.1721.45129, 130, 189, 1902,6-Linked mannose0.0921.62118, 129, 189, 2343,6-Linked mannose0.5122.62117, 159, 203, 205Terminal GlcNAc0.2823.10117, 159, 203, 205Terminal GalNAc0.0423.57117, 159, 2334-Linked GlcNAc1.0024.92117, 159, 2614,6-Linked GlcNAc0.06 Open table in a new tab To ascertain the anomeric configuration of the N-acetylhexosamine residues that make up the highly unusual N-glycan antennae, HF-treated A. viteae glycans were digested withN-acetyl-β-d-hexosaminidase prior to permethylation and FAB-MS screening. The spectra revealed that large HexNAc-rich molecular ions had been digested to two main products atm/z 1171 and 1345, which are consistent with trimannosyl cores with and without core fucosylation (data not shown). It can therefore be concluded that the N-acetylhexosamine residues of the N-glycan antenna are β-linked. Taking into account the FAB-MS, MALDI-MS, CAD MS-MS, linkage, and exoglycosydase data, we conclude that the three species of filarial nematodes share a major family ofN-glycans. The glycans are composed of substoichiometrically fucosylated trimannosyl cores to which are attached up to 13N-acetylhexosamine residues, the majority of which are GlcNAc, to give mono-, bi, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures. These structures contain highly unusual chito-oligomeric antennae comprising up to five β1–4-linked GlcNAc residues capped with GlcNAc or GalNAc (Fig. 8)."
https://openalex.org/W2083354474,"Nitroxyl anion (NO−), the one-electron reduction product of nitric oxide (NO⋅), is formed under various physiological conditions. We have used four different assays (DNA strand breakage, 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine formation in calf thymus DNA, malondialdehyde generation from 2′-deoxyribose, and analysis of site-specific DNA damage using32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments of the human p53tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene) to study the effects of NO− generated from Angeli's salt on DNA damage. It was found that strong oxidants are generated from NO−, especially in the presence of H2O2 plus Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II). NO⋅released from diethylamine-NONOate had no such effect. Distinct effects of hydroxyl radical (HO⋅) scavengers and patterns of site-specific DNA cleavage caused by Angeli's salt alone or by Angeli's salt, H2O2 plus metal ion suggest that NO− acts as a reductant to catalyze the formation of the HO⋅ from H2O2 plus Fe(III) and formation of Cu(I)-peroxide complexes with a reactivity similar to HO⋅ from H2O2 and Cu(II). Angeli's salt and H2O2 exerted synergistically cytotoxic effects to MCF-7 cells, determined by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Thus NO− may play an important role in the etiology of various pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, especially when H2O2 and transition metallic ions are present.

Thus NO− may play an important role in the etiology of various pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, especially when H2O2 and transition metallic ions are present. Excess production of nitric oxide (NO⋅) has been implicated as a cause of diverse pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. These detrimental effects of NO⋅ have been attributed to reactive nitrogen species such as NOx and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which are formed by the reaction of NO⋅with oxygen and superoxide, respectively. Reactive nitrogen species can oxidize, nitrate, and nitrosate biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids, thus altering their functions. We have recently reported that NO−, which is the one-electron reduction product of NO⋅, can also cause strand breakage and oxidative damage in DNAin vitro (1Ohshima H. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have proposed that a highly toxic hydroxyl radical (HO⋅) generated from the reaction between NO− and NO⋅ is responsible for the oxidation reactions (Equations 1 and 2). NO−+NO⋅→N2O⨪2Equation 1 N2O⨪2+H+→N2O+HO⋅Equation 2 NO− has been also reported to be cytotoxic, reducing intracellular glutathione levels and causing DNA strand breakage in cultured cells (2Wink D.A.

However, it can also be converted under physiological conditions in vitro, as well as in cells, to NO⋅ and other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxynitrite (3Fukuto J.M.

Three recent publications have suggested that NO⋅ synthase generates NO−, which can be then converted to NO⋅by superoxide dismutase and other electron acceptors (6Hobbs A.J. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J.

It has been reported that, in the absence of oxygen, nitrosylhemoglobin liberates NO− in a reaction producing methemoglobin (12Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Ferrocytochrome calso reacts with NO⋅ to form ferricytochrome c and NO−, which may have implications for inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption by NO⋅ (13Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In our previous reports, NO− was proposed as one of the possible agents responsible for DNA strand breakage induced by NO⋅ and catechol-type compounds such as catecholamines, catechol-estrogens, and certain flavonoids (14Ohshima H. Yoshie Y. Auriol S. Gilibert I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NO− can be formed by one-electron reduction of NO⋅ by the quinone/hydroquinone redox system in a manner similar to that of the formation of O⨪2 from oxygen (14Ohshima H. Yoshie Y. Auriol S. Gilibert I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have studied the effects of NO−generated from Angeli's salt (sodium trioxodinitrate, Na2N2O3) on DNA strand breakage and DNA base modifications in vitro mediated by H2O2 in the presence of metallic ions. At physiological pH, Angeli's salt exists predominantly in the form of the monoanion HN2O3−, which decomposes to NO− and nitrite (NO2−) (Equation 3) (15Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. Inorg. Chem. 1985; 24: 4285-4288Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As HNO is a weak acid (pK a = 4.7), NO− is the predominant form in aqueous solution at neutral pH (Equation 4) (15Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. Inorg. Chem. 1985; 24: 4285-4288Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HN2O3−→HNO+NO2−Equation 3 HNO↔NO−+H+Equation 4 We have found that NO− generated from Angeli's salt dramatically enhances DNA damage mediated by H2O2 in the presence of the ferric ion (Fe(III))-EDTA or copper ion (Cu(II)), indicating that NO−acts as an endogenous reductant to catalyze formation of strong oxidants. Furthermore, Angeli's salt and H2O2cooperatively exerted cytotoxic effects toward human breast cancer cells. We discuss possible implications of our findings as a cause of diverse pathophysiological conditions mediated by activation or overexpression of NO⋅ synthase.

Med. 1993; 15: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Angeli's salt prepared in 0.01 N NaOH (0–5 mm, 100 μl) was added to a reaction mixture (final volume, 1 ml) containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, calf thymus DNA (1 mg), 10 μm DTPA, 500 μm H2O2, either 50 μm FeCl3-EDTA or CuCl2, and an appropriate amount of HCl to neutralize the NaOH present in the Angeli's salt solution (final pH ∼7.5), and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the reaction, ethanol-precipitated DNA was hydrolyzed enzymatically, and 8-oxo-dG and 2′-deoxyguanosine were analyzed by HPLC with a Coulochem II electrochemical detector (ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA) and a Shimadzu UV spectrophotometer (model SPD-2A), respectively, according to a modification of the method of Yamaguchi et al. (18Yamaguchi R. Hirano T. Asami S. Chung M.H. Sugita A. Kasai H. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2419-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. The experiments were carried out by incubating plasmid pBR322 DNA (100 ng) at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm DTPA, 500 μmH2O2, either 50 μmFeCl3-EDTA or CuCl2 , 200 μm Angeli's salt prepared in 0.01 N NaOH, and an appropriate amount of HCl to neutralize the NaOH present in the Angeli's salt solution (final volume, 10 μl; final pH, ∼7.5). After the reaction, electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (1Ohshima H. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Free Radical Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4584-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Oikawa S. Kawanishi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture in a microtube (1.5-ml, Eppendorf) contained 100 μm Angeli's salt, 20 μm CuCl2, 20 μmH2O2, 20 μm/base of sonicated calf thymus DNA, and a 32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragment in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 μm DTPA. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the DNA fragments were heated at 90 °C in 1 mpiperidine and treated as described previously (26Oikawa S. Kawanishi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4584-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The treated DNA fragments were electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide/8 murea gel, and the autoradiogram was obtained by exposing x-ray film to the gel. The preferred cleavage sites were determined by direct comparison of the positions of the oligonucleotides with those produced by the procedure of Maxam and Gilbert (28Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar) using a DNA-sequencing system (LKB 2010 Macrohor). A laser densitometer (LKB 2222 UltroScan XL) was used for the measurement of the relative amounts of oligonucleotides from treated DNA fragments. Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Cells were seeded into 96-well microculture plates one day before the treatment, at a density of 105cells/well with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with Angeli's salt or DEA-NO prepared in 0.01 N NaOH in combination with H2O2 prepared in water (0–10 mm). The NaOH present in the Angeli's salt or DEA-NO solutions was neutralized with the same volume of 0.01 N HCl. The LDH assay was performed using the CytoTox Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). To obtain maximal LDH release, nontreated cells were incubated in the presence of lysis solution (9% Triton X-100) for 45 min at 37 °C. After 4.5 h of incubation in the presence of the different products, the plate was centrifuged at 250 × g for 4 min, and 50 μl of supernatant was used for the LDH assay. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated according to the following equation, %LDH release=(exp−back1)/(max−back2)×100Equation 5 where exp = experimental value, max = mean of cell maximum LDH release, back1 = mean of cell culture background, and back2 = mean of cell culture background plus lysis solution. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate, and the results are expressed as means ± S.D. Four different assays were used to study the effects of Angeli's salt on oxidation reactions mediated by H2O2 in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II). The first assay was based on oxidation of 2′-deoxyribose leading to the formation of MDA, which has been measured as a marker of HO⋅ generation (29Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). The formation of MDA in the presence of Angeli's salt, H2O2, and Fe(III)-EDTA was very rapid and reached a plateau in 10 min, whereas H2O2 and Fe(III)-EDTA alone catalyzed the formation of MDA linearly up to 60 min of incubation (Fig. 1 A). Lower concentrations of MDA were formed when the reaction was carried out in the presence of H2O2 plus Cu(II) than with H2O2 plus Fe(III)-EDTA. MDA was also formed dose dependently with different concentrations of Angeli's salt in the presence of H2O2 and metallic ions (Fig.1 B). However, its formation was inhibited by a high concentration (2 mm) of Angeli's salt, especially when the reaction was carried out in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA. Fig.2 compares the levels of MDA formation mediated by H2O2 and metallic ion in the presence of Angeli's salt, DEA-NO, or some reducing agents. NO− generated from Angeli's salt catalyzed MDA formation from 2′-deoxyribose, as did other reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, and NAD(P)H. In contrast, NO⋅ generated from 200 μm DEA-NO inhibited MDA formation mediated by 500 μm H2O2 and 50 μmFe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II) by 43 and 19%, respectively (Fig. 2). Formation of MDA from 2′-deoxyribose mediated by 200 μm Angeli's salt, 500 μm H2O2, and 50 μm Fe(III)-EDTA was also inhibited by 83 and 80% by the inclusion of 200 μm ferricyanide or 4-OH-TEMPO (electron acceptors), respectively (data not shown).Figure 2Comparison of the effect of Angeli's salt and DEA-NO with that of other reducing agents on MDA formation from 2′-deoxyribose by H2O2 and Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II). The reactions were carried out in 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm DTPA, 1 mm 2′-deoxyribose at 37 °C for 10 min (final volume, 1 ml; final pH, ∼7.5). 1, reductant alone; 2,reductant plus 50 μm FeCl3-EDTA;3, reductant plus 500 μmH2O2; 4, reductant plus 500 μm H2O2 plus 50 μmFeCl3-EDTA; 5, reductant plus 50 μm CuCl2; 6, reductant plus 500 μm H2O2 plus 50 μmCuCl2. The compounds tested were: H2O (none,Control), Angeli's salt (AS), DEA-NO, glutathione (GSH), NADH, NADPH, and ascorbic acid (ASC). The concentrations were 200 μm, except for GSH, which was 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig.3, the levels of 8-oxo-dG increased dose dependently in calf thymus DNA incubated with Angeli's salt in the presence of H2O2 and metallic ions. As previously reported for other reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and NADH (27Oikawa S. Kawanishi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), Angeli's salt catalyzed the hydroxylation of 2′-deoxyguanosine in DNA more efficiently in the presence of Cu(II) than in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA. As shown in TableI, hydroxyl radical scavengers (ethanol,d-mannitol, Me2SO) inhibited 8-oxo-dG formation mediated by Angeli's salt, H2O2, and Fe(III)-EDTA more effectively than that mediated by Angeli's salt, H2O2, and Cu(II). Two electron acceptors, ferricyanide and 4-OH-TEMPO, also inhibited the formation of 8-oxo-dG by H2O2 and either Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II). NO⋅ generated from 0.02, 0.2, or 2 mm DEA-NO did not increase 8-oxo-dG levels in DNA induced with 500 μmH2O2 and 50 μm Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II), but rather reduced the hydroxylation of deoxyguanosine mediated by H2O2 and Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II) (40–55% inhibition) (data not shown).Table IEffects of hydroxyl radical scavengers and electron acceptors on 8-oxo-dG formation in calf thymus DNA incubated with Angeli's salt plus H2O2 in the presence of Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II)8-Oxo-dG (μmol)/dG (mmol)Fe(III)-EDTACu(II)Control1-aControl; in the absence of scavengers.0.427 ± 0.070 (100)1-bNumbers in parentheses are the percentages of controls (100%).3.12 ± 0.15 (100)1-bNumbers in parentheses are the percentages of controls (100%).Ethanol (0.2 m)0.039 ± 0.009 (9)3.71 ± 0.12 (119)Me2SO (0.2 m)0.036 ± 0.010 (9)2.68 ± 0.27 (86)d-Mannitol (0.1m)0.075 ± 0.009 (18)2.74 ± 0.16 (88)Ferricyanide (0.02 m)0.172 ± 0.055 (40)0.90 ± 0.17 (29)4-OH-TEMPO (0.02m)0.021 ± 0.008 (5)1.17 ± 0.22 (38)Calf thymus DNA (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 200 μmAngeli's salt, 500 μm H2O2, and 50 μm Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II) in the presence of HO⋅scavengers and electron acceptors in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm DTPA at 37 °C for 30 min.

The pBR322 plasmid DNA was incubated with 200 μm Angeli's salt in the presence or absence of 500 μm H2O2 plus 50 μmFe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II), and the percentages of form I (supercoiled form), form II (open ring form), and form III (linear form) were measured (Table II). As we previously reported (1Ohshima H. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), incubation of plasmid pBR322 with Angeli's salt alone formed 52.6% of form II, corresponding to ∼1.25 single strand breaks/104 bp. Increased levels of DNA strand breakage were also observed when plasmid DNA was incubated with metallic ions (Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II)) alone or in combination with H2O2 and Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II) compared with nontreated plasmid. However, the addition of Angeli's salt dramatically enhanced strand breakage induced by H2O2 plus Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II). In particular, when the reaction was carried out in the presence of Angeli's salt, H2O2, and Cu(II), none of forms I, II, and III were clearly detected, indicating that the DNA was completely fragmented. When the plasmid was incubated with Angeli's salt, H2O2, and Fe(III), only forms II and III were formed, indicating that in addition to single strand breakage, double strand breaks were also induced.Table IIDNA strand breakage induced by Angeli's salt in the absence or presence of H2O2 and/or Fe(III)-EDTA or Cu(II)Percentages of formI (Supercoiled)II (Ring open)III (Linear)Control94.8 ± 1.65.2 ± 1.6—2-aNot detected.H2O291.7 ± 1.78.3 ± 1.7—Fe(III)-EDTA80.7 ± 1.819.3 ± 1.8—Cu(II)89.2 ± 3.110.8 ± 3.1—AS47.4 ± 3.252.6 ± 3.2—AS + H2O240.9 ± 1.359.1 ± 1.3—AS + Fe(III)-EDTA24.2 ± 5.775.8 ± 5.7TraceAS + Cu(II)49.5 ± 2.850.5 ± 2.8—H2O2 + Fe(III)-EDTA47.1 ± 3.252.9 ± 3.2TraceH2O2 + Cu(II)—80.7 ± 3.819.3 ± 3.8AS + H2O2 + Fe(III)-EDTA—64.7 ± 8.635.3 ± 8.6AS + H2O2 + Cu(II)———Plasmid pBR322 DNA (100 ng) was incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm DTPA at 37 °C for 15 min.

Fig. 4shows that incubation of the 32P-5′-end-labeled 261-bp fragment (AvaI* 1645-XbaI 1905) of the human c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene with 200 μmAngeli's salt alone can induce DNA damage (lane 2). Hydroxyl radical scavengers such as ethanol, d-mannitol, and sodium formate inhibited the damage induced by Angeli's salt (lanes 3–5). Carboxy-PTIO, an NO⋅-trapping agent, which may also scavenge other oxidants (20Yoshie Y. Ohshima H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Pfeiffer S. Leopold E. Hemmens B. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), inhibited the Angeli's salt-mediated DNA damage (lane 6), whereas bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelating agent, did not affect it (lane 7). On the other hand, 40 μm Angeli's salt in the presence of 20 μm CuCl2 and 40 μm H2O2 exerted much stronger effects on the DNA than Angeli's salt alone (lane 8). This DNA damage was not inhibited by hydroxyl radical scavengers (lanes 9–11), whereas it was inhibited by carboxy-PTIO and bathocuproine almost completely (lane 12 and13). The DNA cleavage sites were examined using 32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments of the human p53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene by the procedure of Maxam and Gilbert (28Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5,B and D, Angeli's salt alone caused DNA cleavage at every nucleotide position without marked site preference. On the other hand, Angeli's salt in the presence of H2O2 and Cu(II) induced piperidine-labile sites frequently at thymine residues (Fig. 5, A and C). The most preferred site was the thymine residue, especially in the 5′-CTG-3′, 5′-GTG-3′, and 5′-GTA-3′ sequences. Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were incubated for 4.5 h with various concentrations of H2O2 in the presence or absence of 500 μm Angeli's salt or DEA-NO (Fig.6 A). Either 500 μm Angeli's salt or DEA-NO or 0–0.5 mmH2O2 alone did not elicit significant cytotoxic effects in MCF-7 cells. However, in the presence of Angeli's salt or DEA-NO, LDH release was increased by H2O2 dose dependently with the increase reaching 48.6 ± 5.2% and 30.3 ± 0.2%, respectively, at the 500 μm concentration. On the other hand, Angeli's salt alone showed weak cytotoxic activity after 4.5 h of incubation. However, increased cytotoxicity was observed when the cells were analyzed after 8 h of incubation (data not shown). The presence of H2O2increased dramatically the cytotoxicity mediated by Angeli's salt. The increases in LDH release induced by 500 μmH2O2 alone or 2 mm Angeli's salt alone were only 9.0 ± 2.0% and 17.0 ± 0.3%, respectively, but up to 72.4 ± 1.7% when both compounds were incubated together. Although no cytotoxic effects were found with even the highest concentration (2 mm) of DEA-NO alone, the presence of H2O2 also enhanced cytotoxicity mediated by DEA-NO (Fig. 6 B). However, the cytotoxic effect with DEA-NO plus H2O2 was, in general, weaker than that with Angeli's salt plus H2O2. It should be noted that Angeli's salt and DEA-NO have similar half-lives (∼2.5 min) under physiological conditions. Four different assays (DNA strand breakage, MDA formation from oxidation of 2′-deoxyribose, hydroxylation of 2′-deoxyguanosine in DNA, and analysis of site-specific DNA damage using32P-5′-end-labeled DNA fragments of the humanp53 tumor suppressor gene and the c-Ha-ras-1 protooncogene) have been used to study the effects of Angeli's salt, an NO− generating compound (2Wink D.A.

Here we described the identification and characterization of DFF35, an isoform of DFF45 comprised of 268 amino acids. Functional assays have shown that only DFF45, not DFF35, can assist in the synthesis of highly active DFF40. Using the deletion mutants, we mapped the function domains of DFF35/45 and demonstrated that the intact structure/conformation of DFF45 is essential for it to function as a chaperone and assist in the synthesis of active DFF40. Whereas the amino acid residues 101–180 of DFF35/45 mediate its binding to DFF40, the amino acid residues 23–100, which is homologous between DFF35/45 and DFF40, may function to inhibit the activity of DFF40. In contrast to DFF45, DFF35 cannot work as a chaperone, but it can bind to DFF40 more strongly than DFF45 and can inhibit its nuclease activity. These findings suggest that DFF35 may function in vivo as an important alternative mechanism to inhibit the activity of DFF40 and further, that the inhibitory effects of both DFF35 and DFF45 on DFF40 can put the death machinery under strict control.

Apoptosis is fundamentally important in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Apoptotic cells undergo an orchestrated cascade of events characterized by distinct morphological changes including membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, chromatin aggregation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (1Webb S.J.

The cleavage of chromatin into the nucleosomal fragments, which distinguishes apoptosis from oncosis and necrosis, is a key element in the cell death process and is believed to be mediated by Mg2+/Ca2+ required and Zn2+-sensitive nuclease (8Wyllie A.H.

We have previously identified a triplet of nuclease proteins named NP42–50 that causes DNA degradation in vitrowhen cells undergo apoptosis (13Zhang C.H. Robertson M.J. Schlossman S.F. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 165: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The similarity in molecular weight and biochemical characteristics between NP42–50 and the recently identified DFF40 led us to further investigate these molecules. DFF is a heterodimeric protein composed of DFF45 and DFF40 subunits. DFF45 has been found to be the substrate of caspase-3, and DFF40 has also been cloned and found to be a DNA fragmentation nuclease (7Liu X.S. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 14Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr.

A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the DFF45 by caspase-3 during apoptosis releases DFF40 that degrades chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal fragments. Similar findings have also been described recently in the mouse. The mouse DFF is composed of three molecules: one caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and two forms of CAD inhibitors (ICAD-L and ICAD-S) (16Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 17Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Mouse CAD and ICAD-L are apparently the counterpart of human DFF40 (CPAN) and DFF45, respectively, whereas the human counterpart of mouse ICAD-S has not been identified. In the present study we described the cloning of human DFF35, the short isoform of DFF45 and mapped the function domains of DFF35/45. Functional analysis has shown that the intact structure/conformation of DFF45 is essential for it to function as a chaperone and assist in the synthesis of active DFF40. In contrast, DFF35, although it can bind to DFF40 and inhibit its nuclease activity, cannot assist in the synthesis of active DFF40. While DFF35 binds to DFF40 more strongly than does of DFF45, suggesting that DFF35 may function in vivo as an additional inhibitor of DFF40, augmenting the regulatory control of DFF45. Taken together, our studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of both DFF35 and DFF45 on DFF40 place this important component of the cell death machinery under strict control. Outer encoding region primers 5′-GCTTCCTTGGCATTCCCGCTGCTGC-3′ (for both DFF35 and DFF45), 5′-GCAGAGGTGAACAAAAGGGCCCACACACC-3′ (for DFF35), and 5′-GGTGGGCAGGTCCCACCTTGTGGAGG-3′ (for DFF45) were designed for amplifying both DFF35 and DFF45 from Jurkat cell total RNA and human fetal liver cDNA library by PCR. The PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) for sequencing (ABI 200 sequencer). DFF35 and DFF45 were further amplified by 5′-GCTCTAGAGATGGAGGTGACCGGGGACG-3′ (for both DFF35 and DFF45), 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTCAGTGACCCTGGTTTCC-3′ (for DFF35), and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGCTATGTGGGATCCTGTCT-3′ (for DFF45) and cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST fusion protein. D117E and D224E double mutants of DFF35 were generated by two-step PCR using 20-nucleotide primers carrying the mutated nucleotides. Deletion mutants of DFF45 were also generated by two-step PCR. All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and adsorbed by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then eluted by either reduced glutathione (GSH) containing buffer (50 mm Tris, 20 mm GSH, pH 9.6) or thrombin (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Flag-tagged DFF45 and DFF35 were generated by cloning into pCDNA3.0-Flag vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). Jurkat cells were incubated with anti-Fas monoclonal Ab 7C11 (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h, the crude cytoplasm fraction containing DNA fragmentation nuclease was extracted as described previously (7Liu X.S. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Jurkat nuclei (5 μl, 6.5 × 105 total), were incubated with 100 ng of nuclease fraction at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA fragmentation was determined by extraction of genomic DNA and analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Indicated GST fusion proteins or thrombin-cleaved proteins treated or untreated with 100 ng/ml caspase-3 at 30 °C for 2 h and then inactivated with 20 nm CHO-DEVD (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 2 h were included in the abovein vitro system to test their inhibitory effects on DNA fragmentation. A polyclonal Ab against the N-terminal peptide of both DFF35 and DFF45 (EVTGDAGVPESGEIRTLPKC) was from Upstate Biotechnology. A polyclonal Ab against intermediate peptide of both DFF35 and DFF45 (KQEESKAAFGEEVDAVD) and a polyclonal Ab against C-terminal peptide of DFF45 only (KASPPGDLQNPKRARQDPT) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A monoclonal Ab against epitope Flag (M5) was purchased from Sigma. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged plasmids by calcium phosphate method. Jurkat cells were incubated with staurosporine (Sigma) at the final concentration of 1 μm for the indicated time. Immunoblot was performed with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (N-terminal) or donkey anti-goat (internal and C-terminal) Ab using ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers 5′-GCGAGGACGATCTGAGCAGCTTGGGCAG-3′ and 5′-AAATGATGCCCACGTCAGGCCTCAAACA-3′ were used to amplify DFF40 from human lymphocyte cDNA library and directly for sequencing. To express DFF40 in a cell-free system, the encoding cDNA of DFF40 was placed under T7 promoter of pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen), and the coupled transcription and translation of DFF40 was performed by using TNTin vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. pCDNA-DFF40 (1 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with 40 μl of TNT reagents and 20 μCi [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) in the absence or presence 200 ng of indicated recombinant proteins. To test DFF40 nuclease activity, a 5-μl aliquot of synthesized DFF40, after being treated with caspase-3 and inactivated with CHO-DEVD, was incubated with Jurkat nuclei (5 μl, 6.5 × 105total) to test its ability to induce DNA fragmentation or DNA digestion in assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 4 mmMgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEGTA, 75 mm NaCl, and 16.7 μg/ml histone HI). Caspase-3-treated or -untreated recombinant DFF-35, DFF45, or its mutant proteins were included in the system to test their effects on DFF40 activity. To test binding ability, a 10-μl aliquot of synthesized DFF40, after treatment with caspase-3 and inactivation by CHO-DEVD, was diluted to 500 μl, and 20 μg of GST-DFF35, GST-DFF45, or its GST mutant protein-Sepharose 4B beads were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Binding complex was eluted by 30 μl of GST-containing buffer. A 15-μl aliquot was used for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the gel was treated with autoradiography enhancer (NEW Life Science Products), dried, and then visualized by exposing to Kodak X-AR film. In an effort to search for the short form of DFF45 and to better understand the molecular details of DNA fragmentation, an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone was found of approximately 1.5 kilobases which contained an open reading frame encoding a novel protein of 268 amino acid residues. A homology search in GenBankTM data bank indicated that this protein was identical to DFF45 (consisting of 331 amino acids) up to amino acid position 261, after which the sequences diverged (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the mRNAs encoding these two proteins were generated through alternative splicing. The two potential caspase-3 cleavage sites within the protein are exactly the same as those of DFF45. More importantly, the C-terminal region of this protein is highly homologous with the mouse short isoform of ICAD, ICAD-S (16Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar), and has three additional amino acids, QGH, at the C-terminal when compared with mouse ICAD-S (Fig. 1 B). These results clearly suggest that this protein is the human counterpart of mouse ICAD-S. We therefore designated this protein as DFF35 because it appears to be the short form of DFF45 with a molecular weight of 35 kDa. To further confirm whether the RNA transcript and the encoded protein exist in vivo, Jurkat cell total RNA and fetal liver cDNA were amplified by PCR using DFF45 or DFF35 outer encoding region primer sets (5′ primer is the same for both DFF35 and DFF45, but 3′ primers are different) and cloned (Fig.2 A). Sequences of the PCR products showed an exact match with the sequences of DFF45 and EST clone, respectively (data not shown). Moreover, polyclonal Ab specific for an N-terminal or intermediate peptide of DFF35/45 recognized two bands corresponding to DFF45 and DFF35 by Western blot analysis of the Jurkat cell lysate, whereas a polyclonal Ab specific for a C-terminal peptide of DFF45 recognized only one band corresponding to DFF45, but not DFF35 in the same blot (Fig. 2 B). To further exclude the possibility that DFF35 is because of the degradation of DFF45, flag-tagged DFF35, DFF45, or an irrelevant control plasmid p53 was transiently transfected into 293T cells. Although the blot with anti-DFF35/45 indicated the existence of two endogenous bands, only the one exogenous band was observed on the blot with either anti-Flag or anti-DFF35/45 corresponding to the indicated transfected plasmid (Fig.2 C). These results clearly demonstrated that the novel 35-kDa isoform does exist in vivo at both mRNA and protein levels. A modified in vitro apoptosis system that mimics the later stages of the apoptotic cascade under cell-free conditions was used to analyze the function of DFF35. Addition of cytosolic extracts prepared from apoptotic cells to Jurkat nuclei induced the formation of internucleosomal DNA fragments. GST-DFF35 fusion protein could completely block the DNA cleavage induced by apoptotic cytosolic extract but not GST-DFF35 cleaved by caspase-3. However, GST-DFF35 double mutant (at caspase-3 cleavage sites D117E and D224E) could block DNA degradation either in the absence or presence of caspase-3 (Fig.3 A). Cleavage of both DFF45 and DFF35 and subsequently generated DNA fragmentation in vivo were also observed in Jurkat cells killed by staurosporine (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that the caspase-3 cleavage sites are required for dismantling the inhibitory ability of DFF35, as well as DFF45, and releasing the nuclease responsible for DNA cleavage. Such a nuclease seems to be DFF40. DFF40 was then cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from Jurkat cells and ligated into pCDNA3.1 downstream of the T7 promoter and subjected to coupled in vitro transcription and translation in the absence or presence of recombinant DFF35 or DFF45. DFF40 was synthesized in vitro only in the presence of pCDNA3.1-DFF40 and bound to DFF45 or DFF35 in the subsequent GST pull-down experiment (Fig.4 A). Functional assay showed that the DFF40 synthesized in the presence of DFF45, but not DFF35 or vector only, could induce DNA fragmentation in the cell-free system assay, suggesting that DFF45 may act as a chaperone to assist DFF40 folding into a functional conformation with high DNase activity (Fig.4 B). However, both DFF35 and DFF45 could inhibit fully functional synthesized DFF40 in vitro and such an inhibition can be dismantled by caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4 C). These results show that the excess carboxyl terminus of DFF45 is indispensable to achieve the correct folding of DFF40. To our surprise, an equal amount of GST-DFF35 can pull down much more in vitro synthesized DFF40 than DFF45 (Fig. 4 A), indicating DFF35 has a much stronger ability to bind to DFF40 than DFF45 does. By comparing the protein sequences of DFF35/45 with DFF40, we could delineate a homologous region at the N-terminal between the nuclease and its inhibitors (the amino acids 23–100 of DFF35/45 and the amino acids 10–87 of DFF40). Further comparison found that this region was also conserved in the mouse CAD and ICAD-S/L (44%) (Fig.5 B). We hypothesize that this region may be involved in mediating the binding or inhibitory effect of DFF35/45 on DFF40 or ICAD-S/L on CAD. We therefore constructed four deletion mutants of DFF45, which deleted the region of DFF45 ranging from 23–100 (DFF45D1), 101–261 (DFF45D2), 101–180 (DFF45D3), and 181–260 amino acids (DFF45D4), respectively. As shown in Fig.5 C, DFF40 was synthesized in the presence of all four deletion mutants at levels comparable with that of wild type DFF45, but only wild type DFF45, DFF45D1, and DFF45D4, but not DFF45D2 and DFF45D3, bound to DFF40 (Fig. 5 C). It suggests that DFF40 binding domain is within 101–180 amino acids of DFF35/45. Functional analysis shows that only DFF40 synthesized in the presence of DFF45 but not in the presence of any mutant has nuclease activity (Fig.5 D). Although both DFF45D1 and DFF45D4, as well as DFF45, can bind with DFF40, only DFF45 and DFF45D4, but not DFF45D1, can inhibit the nuclease activity of DFF40 (Fig. 5 E). It suggests that the homologous region (the amino acid 23–100 of DFF35/45) may function as the inhibitory domain of DFF35/45 to inhibit the nuclease activity of DFF40. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the physical interaction of DFF35 or DFF45 with DFF40 is a prerequisite for their inhibition and/or folding function. Thus, DFF45D2 and DFF45D3 cannot inhibit the activity of DFF40 because of their failure to bind to DFF40 (Fig. 5 E). DFF35 and the deletion mutants of DFF45 cannot assist in the synthesis of active DFF40, suggesting that an intact structure/conformation of DFF45 is essential for its function as a chaperone involved in the folding DFF40 into an active enzyme. Several enzymes including cyclophins, DNase I, and DNase II have been shown to be partially involved in DNA degradation during apoptosis (18Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Stephan H. Crompton T.

Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Both DFF45 and DFF35 can completely block nuclease activity of DFF40 but have no inhibitory effect on DNase I or II (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of both DFF45 and DFF35 is DFF40-specific. Further, our findings suggest that DFF45 can both bind DFF40 and assist in the folding of nascent DFF40 into a functional nuclease with high activity and inhibit its activity as well. DFF40 is a highly active nuclease that is harmful or even lethal to normal cells. Thus, it is not surprising that DFF35 with its strong binding ability can also serve as an important safety net to ensure a complete control of DFF40 activity in cells.

https://openalex.org/W1984870526,"A novel fluorophore was isolated from human lenses using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The new fluorophore was well separated from 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3-OHKG) and its deaminated isoform, 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid O-glucoside, which are known UV filter compounds. The new compound exhibited UV absorbance maxima at 260 and 365 nm, was fluorescent (Ex360 nm/Em500 nm), and increased in concentration with age. Further analysis of the purified compound by microbore HPLC with in-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 676 Da. This mass corresponds to that of an adduct of GSH with a deaminated form of 3-OHKG. This adduct was synthesized using 3-OHKG and GSH as starting materials. The synthetic glutathionyl-3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside (GSH-3-OHKG) adduct had the same HPLC elution time, thin-layer chromatographyR F value, UV absorbance maxima, fluorescence characteristics, and mass spectrum as the lens-derived fluorophore. Furthermore, the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the synthetic adduct were entirely consistent with the proposed structure of GSH-3-OHKG. These data indicate that GSH-3-OHKG is present as a novel fluorophore in aged human lenses. The GSH-3-OHKG adduct was found to be less reactive with β-glucosidase compared with 3-OHKG, and this could be due to a folded conformation of the adduct that was suggested by molecular modeling.

The human eye lens is composed largely of elongated fiber cells that are derived from epithelial cells located in a thin layer at the anterior surface. The innermost layers of the lens are formed during embryonic development, and throughout life, the lens continues to grow as newly differentiated fiber cells are formed (1Maisel H. Harding C.V. Alcalá J.A. Kuszak J. Bradley R. Bloemendal H. The Morphology of the Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 49-84Google Scholar). The fiber cells are rich in crystallins, which form a highly ordered transparent structure that permits light transmission and thus vision. It is well known that aging of the lens is associated with certain biochemical changes. In particular, the lens becomes yellow and fluorescent (2Lerman S. Borkman R. Ophthalmic Res. 1976; 8: 335-353Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previous work has aimed to identify exactly which biochemical changes lead to the increased yellow color of the lens, with a focus mostly on modification of the crystallins (e.g. Refs. 3Bando M. Ishi Y. Nakajimi A. Ophthalmic Res. 1976; 8: 456-463Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 4Yappert M.C. Sundeep L. Borchman D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1992; 33: 3555-3560PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms responsible for the development of lens color and fluorescence remain to be defined. Furthermore, less is known about age-related changes in lens fluorescence that occur in the non-protein (aqueous) environment of the lens. The lens is equipped with two major Trp-derived UV filter compounds, 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3-OHKG) 1The abbreviations used are: 3-OHKG, 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside; GSH-3-OHKG, glutathionyl-3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside; AHBG, 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid O-glucoside; AHAG, 2-amino-3-hydroxyacetophenone O-glucoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-ESIMS, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; DQF-COSY, double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy; TQF-COSY, triple quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; Kyn, kynurenine; DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (5van Heyningen R.

It has also been suggested that under certain conditions, UV filters can form covalent links with lens crystallins and in this way play a damaging role. Several theories have been proposed to account for the modification of lens crystallins by UV filters. In most cases, some form of photoexcitation, oxidation, or enzymatic modification of the UV filters is required to render them reactive (7Ellozy A.R. Wang R.H. Dillon J. Photochem.

In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel fluorophore that was determined to be a GSH adduct of deaminated 3-OHKG. Unlike the other UV filter compounds, which remain relatively stable or decrease slightly in concentration during adult life (11Bando M. Nakajima A. Satoh K. J. Biochem.

Truscott R.J.W. Vision Res. 1994; 34: 1369-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the concentration of the GSH-3-OHKG adduct, relative to the other UV filters, was found to increase with age. All organic solvents were HPLC grade (Ajax, Unichrom, Auburn, New South Wales, Australia). Reduced glutathione was from Sigma; trifluoroacetic acid (>99% pure) was from Aldrich; and acetic acid (>99.8% pure) was from BDH. Me2SO-d 6 was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Milli-Q water (purified to 18 megaohms cm−2) was used in the preparation of all solutions. Human lenses were obtained from donor eyes used for corneal grafting with ethical approval from the Eastern Sydney Area Health Service-Research Ethics Committee (Ref. 90/057) and the University of Wollongong Human Ethics Committee (Ref. HE96/145). Lenses were homogenized in 80% ethanol (0.5 ml/lens) and left on ice for 1 h before centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove precipitated protein. The pellet was re-extracted, and the combined supernatants were lyophilized. The residue was redissolved in water, and the UV filters were analyzed using the isocratic reversed-phase HPLC system described previously (6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mobile phase used in this method is initially 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), followed by 20% (v/v) methanol in water. Peaks that eluted from the isocratic HPLC system in 20% methanol were collected and further analyzed by microbore HPLC (Model 172 separation system, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an Alltima 250 × 2.1-mm C18 column (catalog no. 88371, Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). Samples were routinely eluted using an acetonitrile gradient in aqueous 4 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5) and a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The gradient was run linearly from 0 to 80% acetonitrile over 40 min. In some experiments (where indicated), the same system was employed using a more shallow gradient (0–40% acetonitrile over 40 min) with trifluoroacetic acid (0.05%, v/v) instead of ammonium acetate. Samples were detected by monitoring absorbance at 360 nm and by in-line liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS). Mass spectra were obtained on a VG Biotech Quattro quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an upgraded electrospray ionization source. Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode with a scan rate of 100 m/z per s. The source was maintained at 150 °C. Samples (0.5–1 μl) were separated on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a mobile phase of butanol/acetic acid/water (12:3:5, v/v/v) and visualized under UV light (365 nm). UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-265 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer in three-dimensional scan mode. 3-OHKG was isolated from individual human lenses (using ethanolic extraction and the isocratic HPLC system described above), dried under vacuum, and redissolved in 0.3 ml of 25 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9–10). 1 mg of reduced GSH was then added, and the solution was placed under argon (to limit GSH autoxidation), sealed with plastic film, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The resulting reaction mixture was then analyzed using the isocratic HPLC system, and peaks eluting in 20% methanol were collected for further analysis by LC-ESIMS as for the lens UV filters. In some experiments, synthetic 3-OHKG (14Manthey M.K. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 3930-3933Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or 2-amino-3-hydroxyacetophenone O-glucoside (AHAG) (15.Manthey, M. K., Mechanism and Structural Elucidation of Protein Modification by 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid. Ph.D. thesis, 1990, 288, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia.Google Scholar) was used in place of lens-derived 3-OHKG. The procedure was also scaled up to produce milligram quantities of GSH-3-OHKG for NMR spectroscopy (see below). Reaction mixtures contained 3-OHKG (15 mg) and GSH (150 mg) in 3 ml of 25 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.1) and were incubated as described above for 24–48 h. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by semipreparative HPLC (250 × 10-mm C18 column, Hypersil, Cheshire, United Kingdom) using an acetonitrile/H2O gradient in 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The percentage acetonitrile in the gradient was 0% for 25 min, 0–40% over 15 min, 40–100% over 5 min, and 100–0% over 15 min. The flow rate was 5 ml/min for 20 min, 4 ml/min for 25 min, and 5 ml/min for 15 min. Salt, GSH, and GSSG eluted within the first 15 min; 3-OHKG and the GSH-3-OHKG adduct eluted at 32 and 36 min, respectively (the identity of these species was confirmed by LC-ESIMS). The GSH-3-OHKG thus isolated was dried under vacuum, dissolved in Me2SO-d 6, and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. One- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 400 MHz and 25 °C using a Varian Unity-400 spectrometer. GSH-3-OHKG was dissolved in Me2SO-d 6 to give a concentration of 4.4 mm. DQF-COSY, TQF-COSY, TOCSY (spin lock times of 30 and 80 ms), and NOESY (mixing time of 250 ms)1H NMR experiments were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation (16Croassman W.R. Carlson R.M.K. Two-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy: Applications for Chemists and Biochemists. 2nd Ed. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Typically, 512t 1 increments, with up to 96 scans/increment, were acquired over 2048 data points, which were zero-filled to 2048 data points in both dimensions and multiplied by a gaussian window function prior to Fourier transformation. The gradient heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiment (17Davis A.L. Keller J. Laue E.D. Moskau D. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 207-216Google Scholar) was acquired in the phase-sensitive mode with 256 t 1 increments and 256 scans/increment. The spectral delay was set to 1/(2J CH), with J CH = 140 Hz. All chemical shift values (δ) are given in ppm. Spectra were referenced to residual Me2SO methyl resonances at δ 2.49 and 39.5 ppm for 1H and 13C, respectively. Lens extracts were digested for 18 h at 37 °C in 10 mmcitrate buffer (pH 5) containing 1 mg/ml (4 units) almond β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21; catalog no. G0395, Sigma). 1 unit of activity will liberate 1.0 μmol of glucose from salicin/min at pH 5 and 37 °C. Digested extracts and controls (incubated in the absence of enzyme) were then analyzed using isocratic HPLC. The rate of glucose hydrolysis from isolated UV filters was also assessed by continuous fluorescence monitoring at Ex360 nm/Em500 nmat 37 °C. Since the deglucosylated UV filters are no longer fluorescent (6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Bando M. Nakajima A. Satoh K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the rate of fluorescence loss can be used to monitor the course of the reaction. For these experiments, substrate concentrations were adjusted to give the same absorbance at 365 nm. Enzyme concentration was routinely 0.2 mg/ml in the kinetic studies. The three-dimensional structures of GSH-3-OHKG and 3-OHKG were investigated using molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methodology as incorporated in Insight II/Discover Version 97.0 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and using a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The default force field was used (consistent-valence forcefield), and the modeling was performed on isolated molecules (in vacuo, constant dielectric of 1). The amino acids were modeled both in the neutral and charged forms. Conformational searching was achieved by using a repeated routine of molecular dynamics, then sampling, and then minimization. Details were as follows: time step for molecular dynamics = 1 fs, temperature = 600 K, and initialization period = 100 fs, followed by 50 × 1000 iterations of dynamics. A sample was taken after each 1000 iterations and minimized by 100 iterations of steepest descents, followed by 1000 iterations of conjugate gradients (or until the maximum derivative was <0.00010 kcal/Å). All other parameters were left at the default values specified in the software. Hydrogen bonding was defined to be present in the various conformers only where the distance between the bonding atoms was <2.5 Å and the bond angle was between 120° and 180°. The initial structure of GSH-3-OHKG was not folded, and the energetics of every conformer was compared. Ethanolic extracts of human lenses contain two major UV filter compounds, 3-OHKG and AHBG, and at least three additional chromophores, 3-hydroxykynurenine, Kyn, and another compound of unknown identity that elutes after AHBG on isocratic reversed-phase HPLC (5van Heyningen R. Nature. 1971; 230: 393-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified an additional chromophore (“Unknown-18 min”) that eluted before AHBG and appeared to be present predominantly in lenses taken from older subjects (Fig.1, A versus B). When the UV filter compounds were extracted from lenses ranging in age from 18 to 83 years and analyzed by HPLC, a significant linear increase (r 2 = 0.62, p = 0.0003, 18–83 years, n = 17) in the relative abundance of Unknown-18 min was observed as age increased (Fig.2). The data are expressed relative to AHBG levels, which do not change significantly in concentration during adult life. 2A. M. Wood, J. F. Jamie, J. Zhu, and R. J. W. Truscott, unpublished observation.

Maximum fluorescence intensity was observed at Ex360 nm/Em500 nm (Fig.3 A), and two absorbance maxima were observed at 260 and 365 nm (Fig. 3 B). These spectral characteristics were very similar to those of the major UV filters (i.e. 3-OHKG: λmax at 365 and 264 nm and maximum fluorescence at Ex360 nm/Em500 nm; AHBG: λmax at 358 and 262 nm and maximum fluorescence at Ex357 nm/Em500 nm). LC-ESIMS was then employed to elucidate the molecular mass of Unknown-18 min. Thus, the compound was collected after separation from the other UV filters using the isocratic HPLC system and re-chromatographed by microbore HPLC with in-line mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single peak was eluted by 31 ± 3% acetonitrile (mean ± S.E., n = 5) and detected by its absorbance at 360 nm (Fig.4 A). The corresponding mass spectrum for this peak revealed a molecular ion peak at anm/z value of 677 ± 0.3 (mean ± S.E.,n = 5) (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating a molecular mass of 676 Da. A minor ion at m/z515 was also consistently observed (Fig. 4 C). This ion appeared to be a fragment of the m/z 677 ion and thus only appeared concomitantly on the chromatogram (data not shown). Formation of this fragment results from the loss of 162 mass units, which is characteristic of the loss of glucose from a range of glucosides (18Dell A. Kay-Hooi K. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukada M. Kobata A. Glycobiology. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). In addition, fragmentation to yield an aglucon (i.e. less 162 atomic mass units) has been observed during mass spectrometric analysis of other UV filter glucosides (6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Inoue A. Satoh K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 2303-2306Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Unknown-18 min was also a substrate for β-glucosidase, which confirmed that it was a glucoside (see below). These data indicated that Unknown-18 min may have been a modified 3-hydroxykynurenine-type glucoside. The two major glucosides of this type in the lens are 3-OHKG and AHBG, which have molecular masses of 386 and 371 Da, respectively (5van Heyningen R. Nature. 1971; 230: 393-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), leaving a mass difference of 290–305 Da to be accounted for in Unknown-18 min. Since GSH (307 Da) is present in human lenses at a concentration of ∼1 mm(20Reddy V. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and is known to form conjugates with a variety of macromolecules,e.g. glutathionyl-DOPA (21Agrup G. Falck B. Rorsman H. Rosengren A.M. Rosengren E. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1977; 57: 221-222PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a GSH-3-OHKG adduct could account for the structure of Unknown-18 min. We therefore synthesized a GSH-3-OHKG adduct and compared its characteristics with those of Unknown-18 min. It has been shown previously that the amino group of the Kyn side chain can be eliminated under basic conditions (22Butenandt A. Schiedt U. Biekert E. Cromartie R.J.T. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1955; 590: 75-90Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Hirose Y. Sakan T. J. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1958; 79: 752-761Google Scholar, 24Butenandt A. Schäfer W. Gore T.S. Chemistry of Natural and Synthetic Colouring Matter. Academic Press, New York1962: 13-33Google Scholar) to form an αβ-unsaturated carbonyl (23Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Hirose Y. Sakan T. J. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1958; 79: 752-761Google Scholar). In the absence of a competing nucleophile, the NH2group at C-2 of the Kyn ring reacts with the β-carbon atom of the side chain to form Kyn yellow (23Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Hirose Y. Sakan T. J. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1958; 79: 752-761Google Scholar, 24Butenandt A. Schäfer W. Gore T.S. Chemistry of Natural and Synthetic Colouring Matter. Academic Press, New York1962: 13-33Google Scholar). This reaction is thought to occur under physiological conditions that lead to the formation of insect pigments (25Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Sakan T. Brown K.S. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We observed (using LC-ESIMS) that incubation of 3-OHKG at a pH of 9–10 generated a 365 nm-absorbing positive ion atm/z 370 (data not shown). The compound responsible for this ion was readily explained by the loss of the amino group from the Kyn side chain and (as a result of the deamination) the formation an αβ-unsaturated carbonyl. It is well known that cysteine, both free and in proteins and peptides, reacts rapidly with αβ-unsaturated carbonyls at the β-carbon atom via a Michael addition (26Cecil R. McPhee J.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14 (and references therein): 256-391Google Scholar). We therefore predicted that if the amino group were eliminated from the Kyn side chain of 3-OHKG, an αβ-unsaturated carbonyl may be formed that would be highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the glutathionylcysteine, thus generating a sulfur-linked adduct (Fig.5). Many examples of this type of adduct have been prepared by reacting benzoylacrylic acid and its derivatives with thiol-containing proteins (27Anderson B.M. Tanchoco M.L. Dal Pozzo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 703: 204-211Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). When benzoylacrylic acid was incubated at 25 °C with GSH, we observed the rapid formation of an adduct with a mass of 483 Da, indicating that glutathionylcysteine was also reactive toward the αβ-unsaturated carbonyl of benzoylacrylic acid. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of benzoylacrylic acid with cysteine is k 2 = 3726m−1 min−1 (27Anderson B.M. Tanchoco M.L. Dal Pozzo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 703: 204-211Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). With the above reaction pathway in mind, we incubated 3-OHKG with GSH at pH 9–10, and this resulted in the formation of a new fluorescent peak that eluted at ∼16 min in 20% methanol on the isocratic HPLC system. GSH-3-OHKG was generated with a yield of ∼24% at pH 9, but only ∼2% at pH 7. The greater efficiency of the reaction at higher pH is explicable first by the increased β-elimination of NH3 at the higher pH (22Butenandt A. Schiedt U. Biekert E. Cromartie R.J.T. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1955; 590: 75-90Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Hirose Y. Sakan T. J. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1958; 79: 752-761Google Scholar, 24Butenandt A. Schäfer W. Gore T.S. Chemistry of Natural and Synthetic Colouring Matter. Academic Press, New York1962: 13-33Google Scholar) and second by the higher concentration of the thiolate anion, which is a stronger nucleophile than the thiol in this reaction (26Cecil R. McPhee J.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1959; 14 (and references therein): 256-391Google Scholar). The synthetic GSH-3-OHKG adduct was collected from the HPLC column and subjected to the same analytical techniques used to characterize Unknown-18 min. The characteristics of Unknown-18 min and the synthetic GSH-3-OHKG adduct are given in Table I. Both compounds exhibited the same absorbance and fluorescence characteristics and migration pattern on TLC plates (note that theR F values for 3-OHKG and AHBG were 0.36 and 0.63, respectively), eluted at the same time (within experimental error) on the isocratic HPLC system, and had the same mass spectral properties (Fig. 6; cf. Fig.4 C). In particular, for both the synthetic GSH-3-OHKG adduct and Unknown-18 min, the appearance of the major ion at m/zof 677 was accompanied by minor fragments with m/z values of 515, 548, and 530, which are explicable by the loss of glucose (162 Da), Glu (129 Da), and Glu plus H2O (147 Da in total) from the structure proposed in Fig. 5. In summary, Unknown-18 min and the synthetic GSH-3-OHKG adduct appeared to be identical for all parameters tested.Table ICharacteristics of Unknown-18 min and synthetic GSH-3-OHKGUnknown-18 minGSH-3-OHKGHPLCRT1-aRT, retention time; ESI, electrospray ionization. in 20% MeOH18 ± 1 min (17)1-bQuantitative data show means ± S.E. with the number of experiments given in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab The novel fluorophore (Unknown-18 min) and synthetic GSH-3-OHKG were purified using isocratic HPLC. The isolated samples were then characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), fluorescence scanning (Fluorescence), TLC, and microbore HPLC with in-line mass spectrometry (mass spectrometry) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Isolated Unknown-18 min was also reanalyzed by the isocratic HPLC method, and this was followed directly by analysis of the synthetic GSH-3-OHKG adduct. In this case, both eluted with a retention time of 18.3 min. Furthermore, when synthetic GSH-3-OHKG was added to isolated Unknown-18 min and analyzed by LC-ESIMS, there was a dose-dependent increase in a single 360 nm-absorbing chromophore with a corresponding increase in signal for the ion atm/z 677. We interpret these results as indicating that Unknown-18 min was a GSH-3-OHKG adduct. The molar extinction coefficient of GSH-3-OHKG was determined to be ε365 = 6759 m−1 cm−1 (note: 3-OHKG, ε365 = 4340 m−1cm−1; and AHBG, ε360 = 3400m−1 cm−1). Using data derived from Fig. 2, we calculate that GSH-3-OHKG is present in older lenses at concentrations of up to 0.62 μmol/g of lens protein. In a previous study from our group, treatment of the ethanolic extracts of human lenses with β-glucosidase (1 mg/ml for 3 h at 37 °C) resulted in the loss of 3-OHKG and AHBG from the HPLC traces and the appearance of the corresponding aglucon moieties (6Truscott R.J.W.

In these earlier studies, another peak that eluted before AHBG was also detected, and this was only partially removed (∼60%) after such β-glucosidase treatment (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 6Truscott R.J.W. Wood A.M. Carver J.A. Sheil M.M. Stutchbury G.M. Zhu J. Kilby G.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We believe that this peak probably corresponds to the GSH-3-OHKG adduct as identified in the present report. In agreement with this, we found, in the present study, that it was necessary to extend β-glucosidase incubation times from 3 to 18 h to completely hydrolyze the O-glucosidic linkage in GSH-3-OHKG (data not shown). In addition, kinetic studies of the hydrolysis of glucose from GSH-3-OHKG suggested that its affinity for almond β-glucosidase was lower than for 3-OHKG. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, which shows that the rate of fluorescence loss from lens-derived GSH-3-OHKG was lower than from 3-OHKG. An initial faster rate of hydrolysis was followed by a slower (linear) phase from 8 to 20 min (Fig. 7, inset). The loss of fluorescence was lower in the GSH-3-OHKG incubations during both phases.

ADF did not sever filaments in a catalytic fashion, but decreased the steady-state length distribution of actin filaments in correlation with its effect on actin dynamics. The increase in filament number was modest as compared with the large increase in filament turnover. ADF did not decrease the length of filaments shorter than 1 μm. ADF promoted the rapid turnover of gelsolin-capped filaments in a manner dependent on the number of pointed ends. To explain these results, we propose that, as a consequence of the cooperative binding of ADF to F-actin, two populations of energetically different filaments coexist in solution pending a flux of subunits from one to the other. The ADF-decorated filaments depolymerize rapidly from their pointed ends, while undecorated filaments polymerize. ADF also promotes rapid turnover of gelsolin-capped filaments in the presence of the pointed end capper Arp2/3 complex.

When added to solutions of pure F-actin, ADF/cofilins enhance the turnover of actin filaments up to values similar to those observedin vivo, by increasing the rate of depolymerization of actin filaments from their pointed ends (9Carlier M.-F.

It was then proposed that ADF accelerated the treadmilling of F-actin,i.e. increased the steady-state rate of barbed end growth, which drives lamellipodium extension or Listeria propulsion. In support to the proposed model, the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin, which feeds barbed end growth, was found increased by ADF (11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The effect of ADF on filament turnover is mediated by its specific interaction with the ADP-bound forms of G- and F-actin, and the subsequent modification of their dynamic properties. While ADF association with G-actin is a simple, rapid, bimolecular reaction, its binding to F-actin is more complex and shows a high degree of kinetic cooperativity (12Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X.

The structural change of the filament imposed by ADF results in a functional sorting of the filaments, because the structure of the ADF-F-actin filament is not compatible with the binding of myosin or tropomyosin (15Nishida E. Mineyuki E. Mekawa S. Ohta Y. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6624-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or drugs like phalloidin (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R.

All ADFs from different organisms from amoeba to man share similar biochemical properties and control the dynamics of actin filaments by the same general mechanism, with quantitative differences that specify the functional properties of the different ADFs (9Carlier M.-F.

The change in structure and dynamics of the filament is likely to be associated with a change in the mechanical properties of the filaments, making them more easily fragmented when submitted to shearing forces. The intricate complexity of ADF effects on actin structure and dynamics and the fact that these effects are not independent of each other raised discrepancies between different groups concerning the real cellular function of ADF and the molecular mechanism by which it is fulfilled. The enhancement of filament turnover in bulk solutions of F-actin in vitro was viewed as the sole consequence of the increased number of filaments due to a severing action of ADF (19Cooper J.A.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As emphasized earlier, a severing effect of ADF cannot by itself elicit depolymerization of F-actin (11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In vivo, the agonist effect of ADF on motility processes such as extension of the lamellipodium, which require rapid barbed end growth of individual filaments anchored at the plasma membrane, cannot be accounted for by fragmentation and is likely to be rather mediated by the effect of ADF on the dynamic parameters of F-actin. To sort out the involvement of the different properties of ADF in its function, the number of filament ends in F-actin solutions in the absence and presence of ADF was measured using the capping protein as a tool (11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The increase in number of ends due to ADF was too modest to account for the 30-fold increase in turnover rate. However, the presence of the capping protein could introduce a bias in those measurements, in part due to its ability to nucleate filaments, hence to affect the length distribution as well. The present work was undertaken with the goal to understand the effects of ADF on the structure and dynamic properties of the actin filament in a comprehensive fashion. The dependence of the number of filaments on ADF and F-actin concentration, in the presence and absence of capping proteins like gelsolin, or of the Arp2/3 complex which has been reported to bind to pointed ends with high affinity (24Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), has been examined in detail, in combination with turnover measurements. It is found that the cooperativity in ADF binding to F-actin, associated with the large change in dynamic properties of the filament, generates two populations of filaments of very different stabilities and dynamic properties, which coexist in solution. The energetic difference between the ADF-decorated and the bare filaments promotes a flux of subunits from one to the other. ADF also promotes fast turnover of gelsolin-capped filaments in the presence of Arp2/3 complex, due to the continuous generation of barbed ends by Arp2/3 at steady state. The mechanism of rapid turnover of actin filaments, somewhat different from the classical treadmilling process, is discussed in view of the biological function of ADF in living cells. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. J. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated as CaATP-G-actin by Sephadex G-200 chromatography (26McLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) in G buffer (5 mmTris-Cl−, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3). CaATP-G-actin was converted into MgATP-G-actin by addition of 1 molar equivalent and 10 μmexcess MgCl2. Actin was pyrenyl-labeled as described (27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Profilin and thymosin β4 were purified from bovine spleen as described (28Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 74: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recombinant ADF1 from Arabidopsis thalianaand human ADF were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain by ion exchange and affinity chromatography as described elsewhere 2F. Ressad, D. Didry, C. Egile, D. Pantaloni, and M.-F. Carlier, manuscript in preparation. and stored at −80 °C in 10 mm Tris-Cl− buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 m sucrose. Capping protein β2 (the homolog of CapZ) was purified from bovine erythrocytes as described (29Kuhlman P.A. Fowler V.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13461-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gelsolin purified from human plasma was a kind gift from Dr. Yukio Doi (Kyoto). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients ε0.1% of 0.617 cm−1at 290 nm for actin, 0.89 and 0.63 cm−1 at 278 nm forA. thaliana ADF1 and human ADF, respectively (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), and 1.0 for profilin. The concentration of the Arp2/3 complex and of the capping protein were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Actin was polymerized by addition of 0.1 m KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 to Mg-G-actin. Barbed end capped filaments were polymerized by addition of 0.1 m KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 to a solution of CaATP-G-actin in G buffer containing either gelsolin at the desired gelsolin:actin ratio. Solutions of 10% pyrenyl-labeled F-actin at different concentrations were obtained by serial dilution of a stock F-actin solution polymerized at 20 μm for 1 h, split in two samples that were supplemented, 3 h later, with either ADF at a given concentration or with an identical volume of buffer. The F-actin and F-actin + ADF solutions were then used as seeds of filament growth by diluting them 20–30-fold into either F buffer (dilution-induced depolymerization assay) or solutions of Mg-G-actin (10% pyrenyl labeled) at the desired concentrations that were supplemented with 0.1m KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 just before adding the seeds (seeded filament growth assay). When seeds capped by gelsolin (at the indicated gelsolin:actin ratio) were used, care was taken to add CaCl2 in excess over the EGTA coming from the Mg-G-actin solution, to avoid dissociation of the capping protein from the capped barbed ends during the growth assay. Gelsolin-capped and standard filaments used as seeds were prepared at least 3 h in advance and were split into ADF-free and ADF-containing seeds 30 min before use. The amount of gelsolin-capped F-actin added as seeds was adjusted at each gelsolin:actin ratio, so as to work at a constant number of pointed ends added to the growth assay. The initial rates of filament depolymerization or elongation were measured from the change in fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled actin, using a Spex Fluorolog2 spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 387 nm, respectively. The turnover of actin filaments was measured as described previously (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) from the decrease in fluorescence of ε-ADP-F-actin, at steady state in the presence of 50 μm ε-ATP, following a chase of ATP. The fluorescently labeled F-ε-ADP-actin solutions were supplemented with ADF 15 min before the ATP chase. The number of filaments in a solution of F-actin assembled at steady state was measured using them as seeds in the seeded polymerization assay described under “Materials and Methods.” The behaviors of plant and human ADFs were compared. When seeds were assembled in the absence of ADF, the initial rate of filament elongation, which is indicative of the number of filaments in the seed solution, increased linearly with the concentration of F-actin present in the seed solution. On the other hand, when the seed solutions were pre-equilibrated in the presence of ADF, the initial rate of growth varied in a sigmoidal fashion with the concentration of F-actin in the seed solution (Fig.1, a and b). At each concentration of F-actin in the seeds, a steady value of the initial rate of seeded polymerization was reached about 3 min following addition of ADF to the seed solution that is when the new steady state was established (data not shown). The rate measurements using F-actin + ADF seeds (Fig. 1) represent steady state measurements. The sigmoidal shape is consistent with the previous observation (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) that ADF causes the partial depolymerization of about 2 μm F-actin. Hence, when the actin concentration was lower than 2 μmin the F-actin seed solution containing 2 μm ADF, no filament ends could be measured in the growth assay. As the concentration of F-actin increased in the F-actin + ADF seed solution, the rate of filament growth eventually stopped increasing steeply and the curve became parallel to the control without ADF (Fig. 1,a and b). The increase in number of filaments reached at the plateau was itself a saturation function of the concentration of ADF present in the seed solution (Fig. 1 c). The plant and human ADFs behaved similarly qualitatively (comparepanels a and b in Fig. 1), but a larger number of ends was generated by plant ADF than by human ADF (panel c). Controls were run in which ADF at the same final concentration as in the sample was added to G-actin together with standard seeds at time 0. With ADF1 (Fig. 1 c, open triangles) a notable increase in rate was recorded in the controls at high concentration of ADF, due to appreciable binding of ADF1 to the filaments during the mixing time (10–15 s). This was not observed with human ADF, which has been found to bind more slowly to F-actin (12Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ADF does not behave as a severing factor which would catalytically continuously increase the number of ends with time, and which would produce more fragments when the concentration of the substrate F-actin, i.e. the number of available sites for severing, is increased, or when the concentration of the enzyme (here ADF) is increased. In contrast, ADF appears to change the steady-state length distribution of actin filaments in a manner dependent on the saturation of F-actin by ADF. The number of ends created by ADF stops increasing when the concentration of F-actin exceeds the ADF concentration. The maximum increase in number of filaments reached at saturation is moderate (about 6-fold for plant ADF, 4-fold for human ADF, Fig. 1 c) as compared with the massive increase in turnover rate measured under similar conditions. Hence, in agreement with previous reports (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Maciver S.K. Pope B.J. Whytock S. Weeds A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the fragmentation activity of ADF cannot account for its effect on actin dynamics in bulk solutions. Solutions of F-actin at steady state in the presence of ADF contain a large pool of unassembled actin, which consists essentially in an increased amount of ATP-G-actin, and a high concentration (about 2 μm) of ADF-ADP-G-actin (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). ADF also greatly increases the nucleation of ADP-actin (12Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). One can imagine that small nuclei of ADF-ADP-G-actin dimers, for instance, exist at steady state in the seed solutions containing ADF. Such nuclei would actively elongate in the seeded polymerization assay. In this situation, the filament average length would not be actually affected by ADF, only nuclei would coexist with the filaments. To investigate this possibility, two experiments were performed. First, the effect of addition of the corresponding amount of ADF-ADP-G-actin together with the standard F-actin seeds was measured. No significant change was observed as compared with the sample. Second, the rate of dilution-induced depolymerization of the F-actin + ADF seeds was compared with the rate of depolymerization of standard F-actin seeds. In this dilution-induced depolymerization assay, only long enough filaments measurably contribute to the loss in pyrenyl-F-actin fluorescence, while nuclei are expected not to give a significant signal. The ADF-induced increase in the number of ends derived from this assay was exactly identical to the one derived from the seeded growth assay, demonstrating that the number of filaments was increased and the average filament length was decreased by ADF. The above experiments do not provide insight in the mechanism by which the number of filaments is increased by ADF, which could be either enhanced spontaneous fragmentation or enhanced nucleation. They demonstrate that a steady number of filaments is maintained in the presence of ADF, in conditions under which practically all ADF is bound to F-ADP-actin and G-ADP-actin, which suggests that the lower average filament length results from the highly dynamic state of F-actin in the presence of ADF. Populations of filaments of different average lengths were obtained by polymerizing actin (16 μm) in the presence of gelsolin at different gelsolin:actin ratios in the range 1:2000 to 1:100. Each F-actin solution was split in 2 samples, one of which was supplemented with 2.5 μm ADF. These two filament solutions were used as seeds to initiate polymerization from G-actin at different concentrations and derive theJ(c) plots. Data displayed in Fig.2 show that theJ(c) plots obtained from F-actin and F-actin + ADF seeeds were superimposable at gelsolin:actin ratios above 1:300, that is when filaments contained less than 300 subunits (1 μm length) on average. At lower gelsolin:actin ratios (1:500, 1:1000, and 1:2000), the J(c) plot derived from F-actin + ADF seeds had a higher slope than the control plot derived from F-actin seeds, and it extrapolated to a value of the critical concentration (J = 0) lower than 0.5 μm, indicating that new uncapped barbed ends had been created by ADF in the seed solution. The association rate constant of G-actin to barbed ends is 10-fold higher than to pointed ends, hence the newly created filaments bring a large contribution to the observed rate, making the assay very sensitive to a small change in filament number. The rates of growth from F-actin seeds, J(c), and from F-actin + ADF seeds, J′((c), are expressed as a function of the concentrations of gelsolin-capped filaments, F, and of the concentration of new filaments induced by ADF, Φ, as follows, J=k+PF(c−CCP)Equation 1 J′=k+P(F+Φ)(c−CCP)+k+BΦ(c−CCB)Equation 2 Leading to, J′J=1+ΦF1+k+Bk+P·c−CCBc−CCPEquation 3 The value of Φ can be derived from the fit of the above equations to the data using the following values of the parameters: CCP = 0.5 μm, CCB = 0.08 μm, k+B = 10· k+P. This analysis of the data indicates that ADF increased the number of filaments by 14.5, 10.7, 5, and 0% at gelsolin:actin ratios of 1:2000, 1:1000, 1:500, and 1:250, respectively. This result is in agreement with earlier sedimentation velocity measurements (9Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) showing that at a gelsolin:actin ratio of 1:1000, filaments (3 μm long on average) were not appreciably shortened by ADF. The conclusion that no barbed ends were created by ADF when filaments were capped by gelsolin at a gelsolin:actin ratio of at least 1:400 was confirmed by testing the G-actin sequestering effect of profilin in the absence and presence of ADF. When F-actin was capped by gelsolin at a gelsolin:actin ratio of 1:400, profilin sequestered actin (Fig.3, circles), causing depolymerization of F-actin, in the presence and absence of ADF. The sequestering efficiency was greater in the presence of ADF, indicating that the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin was increased by ADF when barbed ends are capped. The increase in the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin by ADF has already been established when barbed ends are free (11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using Equation 3 in Ref. 11Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, it was calculated that the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin was increased 2-fold, from 0.5 to 1 μm, by addition of 1.75 μm ADF1 to 10 μm F-actin. Different results were obtained at a gelsolin:actin ratio of 1:4000, which leaves a few barbed ends uncapped (Fig. 3, squares). Accordingly, the sequestering efficiency of profilin was greatly reduced, both in the absence and presence of ADF, due to the profilin-induced lowering of the concentration of ATP-G-actin when barbed ends are free (28Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 74: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, deriving the fraction of free barbed ends in the presenceversus absence of ADF from these data is difficult because the depolymerizing effect of ADF by itself increases the sequestering effect of profilin, even though the number of barbed ends is increased by ADF. Together with the data shown in Fig. 2, these results confirm that at high enough gelsolin:actin ratio, all gelsolin-capped filaments remain capped in the presence of ADF, and no free barbed end is maintained at steady state. The effect of ADF on filament turnover was examined at different gelsolin:actin ratios ranging from 1:2000 to 1:100, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The turnover was much faster in the presence than in the absence of ADF at all gelsolin concentrations (Fig. 4 a). The turnover rate increased with the number of capped filaments, under conditions where the experiments described in the previous paragraph (Fig. 2,c and d) demonstrated that ADF did not create new barbed ends (gelsolin:actin < 1:300). To be absolutely sure that this rapid turnover was not mediated by the transient formation of barbed ends, due to either filament severing or nucleating activity of ADF, the turnover of gelsolin-capped, ADF-bound filaments was measured with addition of cytochalasin D (up to 150 nm) or capping protein β2 (up to 150 nm) together with the ATP chase. The turnover process was unaffected at all C Dand gelsolin:actin ratios. In summary, ADF increases filament turnover in a pointed end-dependent fashion under conditions where the flux of subunits from the pointed ends to the barbed ends cannot occur, all barbed ends being blocked. The dependence of the turnover rate on ADF concentration, in the presence of gelsolin (gelsolin:actin = 1:300), showed a maximum at an ADF:actin ratio of 0.5 (Fig. 4 b), as previously observed when barbed ends are free (9Carlier M.-F.

This result was confirmed by steady-state ATPase measurements (data not shown). The Arp2/3 complex has been shown to cap the pointed ends of filaments with high affinity and to induce barbed end growth branching off the sides of filaments (24Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D.

The vascular endothelium is a dynamic organ controlling hemostasis, vasodilation, and wound healing. The endothelium is influenced by shear stress, hypoxia, and chemotactic/mitogenic gradients that promote migration and division of its cells.

In contrast, inhibition of the PKC pathway by prolonged treatment with phorbol esters inhibits mitogenesis of endothelial cells (8Presta M. Tiberio L. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Ragnotti G. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Daviet I. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial cell proliferation in response to mitogens and PKC activation are poorly understood. However, it is likely that specific components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus may govern these responses. Recent studies have suggested that individual isozymes modulate specific cell cycle transitions in specific cell types. The G1-S transition is regulated by the PKCη isozyme in NIH3T3 cells (10Livneh E. Shimon T. Bechor E. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 311-320Google Scholar), whereas in vascular smooth muscle cells PKCα/ε regulate this transition (11Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Hirata M. Masuda J. Shimokado K. Fujishima M. Ogata J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCα and PKCδ affect cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression in several different cell types. PKCα promotes cellular proliferation in human breast cancer and other cells (12Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibucji K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S.

In contrast, overexpression of the PKCδ isoform in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts in the presence of phorbol ester induces G2/M-phase arrest (14Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).The components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus governing progression through the G1 phase are increasingly well understood (15Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 17Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine-threonine holoenzymes, consisting of a regulatory and catalytic subunit that phosphorylate target substrates to promote progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The phosphorylation of the pRB protein is mediated in part by cyclin D1/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 (18Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19Xiong W. Pestell R.G. Watanabe G. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1205-L1210PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of pRB inactivates its ability to block G1 phase progression. Phosphorylation of pRB is associated with release of E2F/DP proteins from their binding site on the pRB protein and progression through G1 into a phase of DNA synthesis. The activity of the CDKs is inhibited by members of the p21Waf1/Cip1 family (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2) and the INK family (p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p18Ink4c, and p19Ink4d). These proteins inhibit CDK enzymatic activity in part through binding to the CDK regulatory subunit, thereby inhibiting holoenzyme association. The p21 family proteins are referred to as “universal inhibitors” because of the ability to block the activity of the cyclin D, cyclin E, and cyclin protein kinase A. As the CDK holoenzymatic activity is directed at nuclear substrates, the activity of the CDK inhibitor (CKI) is in part determined by its subcellular distribution. Thus, the CKI is inhibitory in the nuclear but not the cytoplasmic location.In recent studies we showed that overexpression of PKCδ, but not PKCα, in EC inhibited cellular proliferation through an arrest in S-phase (1Harrington E.O. Loffler J. Nelson P.R. Kent K.C. Simons M. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7390-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These findings were consistent with several other studies in which the loss of PKCδ expression was associated with increased cellular proliferation or transformation (20Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y.-W. Zang Q. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together these studies suggested a role for PKCδ as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation, which may play an important role in slowing cell cycle progression in normal cells. The current studies were performed to understand the molecular mechanisms governing PKCδ-mediated cell cycle arrest. We report here that PKCδ overexpression (PKCδEC) delays serum-induced expression of kinase activity associated with cyclins D1, E, and A. However, the cyclin protein levels induced by serum in the PKCδEC were unchanged compared with the induction seen in control cells. Expression of the INK family members (p16Ink4a and p18Ink4c) and the CKI p21Cip1 was unchanged. PKCδEC contained higher nuclear levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 than vector controls. p27Kip1-antisense reduced p27Kip1 levels and relieved the cell cycle defect induced by PKCδ, strongly suggesting that increased expression of p27Kip1 was responsible for the prolongation of S-phase in PKCδEC.DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms by which specific isozymes of the PKC family regulate cellular proliferation are poorly understood. The current studies extend our previous findings that PKCδ delays S-phase progression in rat microvascular endothelial cells (1Harrington E.O. Loffler J. Nelson P.R. Kent K.C. Simons M. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7390-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PKCδ-mediated inhibition of S-phase progression was associated with a delay in the induction of the kinase activities associated with cyclins D1, E, and A. An investigation of the abundance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors associated with the inhibition of the cyclin kinase activity revealed an increase in the abundance of the “universal inhibitor,” p27Kip1. The relative abundance of p21Cip1 and the INK4 protein family was unchanged, suggesting that the induction of p27Kip1 was a relatively specific change. In addition, overexpression of an antisense expression plasmid for p27Kip1, which was shown to reduce p27Kip1 protein levels, was also shown to reverse the S-phase arrest observed in the PKCδEC lines. These studies are consistent with a model in which the induction of p27Kip1may play an important and specific role in PKCδ-mediated S-phase arrest in microvascular endothelial cells.The pRB protein is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression, and the phosphorylation of pRB during G1 phase coincides with passage of the cell through the restriction point in G1(15Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). pRB undergoes continued phosphorylation throughout the S-phase (40Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the cyclin D1-dependent phosphorylation, which is required for cyclin D1 to promote cell cycle progression, occurs on specific phosphorylation sites that can be assessed in immunoprecipitation assays using a pRB fragment containing this site (25Watanabe G. Pena P. Shambaugh III, G.E. Haines III, G.K. Pestell R.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 108: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe G. Albanese C. Lee R.J. Reutens A. Vairo G.

Methods in Molecular Medicine: Fibroblast Growth Factor Family of Polypeptides. Humana Press Inc., 1999Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation by cyclin D1, cyclin E kinase further phosphorylates pRB at distinct sites (41Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Cyclin E kinase activity phosphorylates and inactivates additional substrates that contribute to cell cycle progression in a pRB-independent manner (42Zhao J. Dynlacht B. Imai T. Hori T. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1998; 12: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the current studies the induction of cyclin D1-dependent pRB phosphorylation was maximally induced at 24 h in the V-EC and PKCαEC but occurred in a delayed manner in the PKCδEC. The induction of cyclin E kinase activity by serum was also delayed in the PKCδEC. These data are consistent with the role of p27Kip1 as a “universal inhibitor” of both cyclin E and cyclin D1 kinase activity. The phosphorylation of pRB coincides with the loss of the ability of pRB to bind and inhibit E2F/DP complexes. The corresponding induction of “free E2F activity” activates genes involved in DNA synthesis. In the current studies, the delayed induction of cyclin A kinase activity, a marker of S-phase entry, in the PKCδEC line, is consistent with the delayed entry into S-phase. pRB is a poor substrate for cyclin E kinase, and cyclin E overexpression can promote S-phase entry independently of pRB, suggesting that cyclins D1 and E function in parallel pathways to promote S-phase entry (21Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Zhao J. Dynlacht B. Imai T. Hori T. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1998; 12: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The current studies suggest that PKCδ inhibits these parallel pathways in EC lines.In the current studies, PKCδ induced p27Kip1 in rat microvascular endothelial cells. The induction of p27Kip1by serum was enhanced in the PKCδEC in association with S-phase arrest. Antisense p27Kip1 expression blocked the PKCδEC-induced S-phase arrest. Overexpression of p27Kip1, initially characterized as a protein homologous to p21Cip1(32Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar), can delay cell cycle progression in fibroblasts (43Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18337-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In recent studies p27Kip1 reduced the proliferation of smooth muscle induced by angioplasty and mediated the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by fibrillar collagen (45Chen D.

Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest that p27Kip1 may be an important inhibitor of vascular remodeling (45Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our finding that p27Kip1 is involved in the cell cycle delay by PKCδ extends the known cytostatic signaling pathways in which p27Kip1 is involved. p27Kip1 also mediates the cytostatic effects of rapamycin and cAMP (32Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 47Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).In the current studies, p27Kip1 immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the effect of the PKC isoforms on the multimeric complexes bound to p27Kip1. The cyclin/CDK complex to which p27Kip1 is bound determines its functional activity. p27Kip1 associates with cyclin E in a variety of cell types during quiescence (47Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 50Agrawal D. Dong K.F. Wang Y.Z. Kayda D. Pledger W.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). When bound to cyclin D1/Cdk4, p27Kip1 may not be inhibitory (47Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 51Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cyclin E/Cdk2 activity is inhibited by p27Kip1. In the current studies, we compared the relative proportion of p27Kip1bound to either cyclin D1 or cyclin E after 36 h of serum stimulation. In the PKCδEC line, p27Kip1 was bound to both cyclins D1 and E after 36 h stimulation; however, there was relatively more cyclin D1 bound to p27Kip1 in the V-EC line (Fig. 4). Thus, in the PKCδEC line the serum-induced increase in cyclin D1 binding to p27Kip1 is reduced. It is thought that the removal of p27Kip1 from the cyclin E/CDK complex is an essential step for S-phase entry. Through binding cyclin D1/Cdk4, p27Kip1 is sequestered from cyclin E/Cdk2, reducing its inhibition by p27Kip1 (47Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 51Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the PKCδEC line it may be expected that p27Kip1 is incorporated proportionately more in an inhibitory complex with cyclin E than is the case in the V-EC line. The failure of p27Kip1 to bind increasing amounts of cyclin D1 may be the result of the delayed nuclear entry of cyclin D1 in response to serum (Fig. 3). Thus, these studies suggest that PKCδ overexpression both increases the amount of p27Kip1 induced in the cell in response to serum stimulation and also alters the multiprotein complex with which p27Kip1 is associated in the cell.The mechanisms responsible for the increased p27Kip1 levels in the PKCδEC line remain to be fully evaluated. The abundance of p27Kip1 is regulated primarily at a post-translational level, and p27Kip1 protein levels decrease after mitogenic stimulation in quiescent NIH3T3 cells (50Agrawal D. Dong K.F. Wang Y.Z. Kayda D. Pledger W.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 54Winston J. Dong F. Pledger W.J. J. Biol.

Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The degradation of p27Kip1 upon mitogen stimulation is dependent upon prior phosphorylation. Cyclin E/Cdk2-induced phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on T187 in murine fibroblasts (56Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of p27Kip1 by cyclin E/Cdk2 enhanced degradation of p27Kip1. The delayed induction of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity in the PKCδEC line (Fig. 1C) may have delayed phosphorylation of p27Kip1, in turn delaying its phosphorylation-dependent degradation. The binding of the JAB-1 gene product to p27Kip1 causes p27Kip1degradation (57Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). An alternate mechanism may be that JAB-1 is a downstream target of PKCδ, with phosphorylation resulting in functional inactivation of JAB-1.The mechanism by which p27Kip1 inhibits cell cycle progression may vary with the cell type, although our studies are consistent with the model in which p27Kip1 inhibits cell cycle progression in part by binding to Cdk2 and thereby reducing cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity (32Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Increased p27Kip1levels induced by overexpression in VSMCs was associated with reduced Cdk2 activity (45Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings overexpression of p27Kip1 in the nuclear, rather than the cytoplasmic, compartment was required for the cell cycle arrest (58Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), indicating that the subcellular distribution of p27Kip1 is important in the inhibition of cellular proliferation. In recent studies an alternate mechanism of p27Kip1 action was proposed. In LAP-3 cells, derived from NIH3T3 cells, p27Kip1overexpression induced a cell cycle arrest associated with a specific E2F pocket protein complex. One consequence of the p27Kip1-Cdk2 association was disruption of the interaction between Cdk2 and both the E2F-p130 and the E2F-p107 repressor complexes (59Shiyanov P. Hayes S. Chen N. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The p130/p107 complexes that were induced by p27Kip1were similar to the complexes induced by serum starvation (59Shiyanov P. Hayes S. Chen N. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further studies will be directed at analyzing the effect of p27Kip1in the presence of the PKCδEC on components of the E2F-130 and E2F-p107 complexes. The present studies indicate, however, that alterations in cyclin E protein abundance do not appear to be important in the cell cycle effects mediated by p27Kip1, arguing against an indirect effect of p27Kip1 on E2F-p130/p107 complex activity.The results presented here are consistent with recent studies in which PKC isozymes were implicated in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression. PKC has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression in intestinal epithelial cells (60Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), IMR-90 fibroblasts (61Hamada K. Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Both the PKCα and PKCδ isozymes have been implicated in the inhibition of cellular proliferation in different cell types. Overexpression of PKCα inhibited cell cycle progression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (65Yamaguchi K. Ogita K. Nakamura S. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), B16 melanoma cells (66Gruber J.T. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27756-27761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rat microvascular capillary endothelial cells (EC), PKCα does not inhibit cell cycle progression but rather promotes migration of the endothelial cells in response to growth factors (1Harrington E.O.

The studies suggest the cell cycle regulatory effect of the PKC isozymes may be cell type specific. PKCδ is the only isoform to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation (68Gschwendt M. Keilbassa K. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and PKCδ was inactivated by tyrosine phosphorylation in v-Src (21Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) transformed cells, raising the possibility that inactivation of PKCδ may promote unregulated cellular proliferation and transformation. In view of the current findings that p27Kip1 is required for the cell cycle inhibitory function of PKCδ and the prior observations that PKCδ inactivation may play an important role in oncogene induced transformation, future studies are warranted to examine the role of p27Kip1 in oncogene/PKC-induced transformation. The vascular endothelium is a dynamic organ controlling hemostasis, vasodilation, and wound healing. The endothelium is influenced by shear stress, hypoxia, and chemotactic/mitogenic gradients that promote migration and division of its cells. Endothelial cellular division is an important component of the angiogenic response to many stimuli (2Yang E.Y. Moses H.L. J.

The rate of Na+ entry is controlled by the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) complex. Insertion/retrieval of the ENaC complex into the apical membrane as well as direct kinetic effects at the single channel level are recognized mechanisms of regulation. Recent data suggest that the syntaxin family of targeting proteins interact with and functionally regulate a number of ion channels and pumps. To evaluate the role of these proteins in regulating ENaC activity, we co-expressed rat ENaC cRNA (α, β, γ subunits) with syntaxin 1A or 3 cRNAs inXenopus oocytes. Basal ENaC currents were inhibited by syntaxin 1A and stimulated by syntaxin 3. Both syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with ENaC subunit proteins, suggesting physical interaction. Interestingly, immunofluorescence data suggest that with either syntaxin isoform the ENaC-associated epifluorescence on the oocyte surface is enhanced. These data indicate that (i) both syntaxin isoforms increase the net externalization of the ENaC channel complex, (ii) that the functional regulation is isoform specific, and (iii) suggest that ENaC may be regulated through mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions.

Such channels have been characterized in amphibian skin and in mammalian tissues, including urinary bladder, renal collecting duct, distal colon, sweat and salivary glands, lung, and taste buds. They mediate the first step of active Na+ reabsorption and play a major role in the maintenance of electrolyte and water homeostasis. The ENaC complex is specifically blocked by the diuretic drug amiloride and its analogues (3Benos D.J. Warnock D.G. Smith J.B. Schafer J.A. Kristensen P. Ussing H.H. Giebisch G. Membrane Transport in Biology. 5. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 166-231Google Scholar), is composed of three homologous α, β, and γ subunits (4Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

For example, Liddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of human hypertension in which the cytosolic region of either the β or γ subunit is truncated or altered by missense mutations in a critical PPPnY domain in their cytosolic carboxyl termini (6Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., G.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P.

Na+ entry through the apical membrane of epithelial cells is tightly regulated by several known mechanisms (8Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). These include changes in protein expression, the relative distribution of protein between intracellular pools and the apical membrane, and changes in unitary conductance properties of the channel. Mutations associated with Liddle syndrome lead to both an increase in channel density at the cell surface and an increase in open probability (9Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 10Snyder P.M. Price M. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Channel density at the cell surface could be modulated by retrieval of the channel complex from the plasma membrane and subsequent degradation. The α and γ subunits of ENaC are ubiquitinylated and hence targets for degradation through the lysosomal pathway (11Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has also been implicated in the control of ENaC half-life and density of cell surface expression (12Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for ENaC regulation is through protein-protein interactions, although few data exist to date on this possibility. There is a direct interaction between PPPnY domains in the carboxyl termini of the ENaC subunits and the WW domain of the Nedd-4 protein (13Abriel H. Loffing H. Rebhus J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L.

Henry P.C. et al.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Another family of proteins that could mediate such functional interactions is the syntaxins, plasma membrane localized t-SNARES that are hypothesized to mediate vesicle trafficking (15Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 16Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Patterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence raise the possibility of an interaction between syntaxin and ENaC: (i) each member of the syntaxin family contains several domains predicted to form α-helical coiled-coiled structures (16Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Patterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), regions likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions; (ii) several syntaxin isoforms (1A, 3, and 4) have been localized to the apical membrane in cultured epithelial cells (17Low S.H.

Physiol. 1997; 273: F718-F730PubMed Google Scholar), and thus could be co-localized with ENaC; and (iii) syntaxin 1A has been shown to interact with and functionally regulate a number of ion channels including Ca2+ channels (19Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4010-4100Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsein R.W.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syntaxins 3 and 4 have a high degree of homology with syntaxin 1A. The role of these syntaxins in plasma membrane fusion reactions and regulation of ion channel activity has not yet been determined. In the present report, we show that syntaxins 1A and 3 interact with and functionally regulate rat ENaC complexes when they are co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We found that these syntaxin isoforms enhance the surface expression of ENaC complexes but had opposite effects on ENaC function. Similar functional results were observed when syntaxin 1A was co-expressed with an ENaC complex containing a COOH-terminal truncated β subunit (as occurs in Liddle's syndrome (7Warnock D.G. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that syntaxin 1A or 3 was physically associated with the ENaC complex. These data suggest that ENaC can be regulated functionally by syntaxins, likely through protein-protein interactions, and that the surface expression of the ENaC complex is regulated in part by vesicular trafficking. Rat ENaC α, β, and γ subunits with or without FLAG™ inserts were kind gifts from Dr. Bernard Rossier (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). The kit for cRNA preparation (mMessage mMachine™) was from Ambion (Austin, TX). Enhanced chemiluminescence kits for developing the Western blots were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Goat anti-mouse IgG-alexa 488 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-syntaxin 3 antibody (24Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Knepper (National Institutes of Health). The anti-syntaxin 1A monoclonal antibody (HPC-1) and other antibodies and reagents were obtained from Sigma. ND96 buffer was used for oocyte incubation and contained in mm: NaCl, 96; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 2; HEPES, 5; pH 7.4. RIPA buffer contained 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100. DIGNAM D buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). RIPA and DIGNAM D both buffers also contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg each of pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor with 0.2% Triton X-100. For statistical analyses, two-sample comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. The COOH terminus truncated chimeric β subunit (rat plus human) was constructed by replacing the COOH-terminal region of the full-length rat β subunit with human COOH-terminal sequences. Human β subunit COOH-terminal sequences were obtained by PCR amplification using cDNAs prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes from an individual in the original Liddle's kindred (6Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., G.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed so that the PCR products contained artificially introduced XhoI or AccI sites at the ends. The forward primer corresponded to nucleotides 1609–1631 (numbered according to GenBankTM data base, L36592) with one nucleotide substitution (A to C at 1612) to create aXhoI restriction site, and the reverse primer corresponded to nucleotides 1790–1814 with two nucleotide substitutions (GG to CA at 1807–1808) to create an AccI restriction site. The amplified PCR products were digested with XhoI andAccI and ligated into the full-length rat β subunit cDNA (βrENaC) in pSPORT. The XhoI site in βrENaC was created at the corresponding site of the human β subunit by PCR-directed mutagenesis, and an extra AccI site at nucleotide position 2 (numbered according to GenBankTM,X77932) in brENaC was removed by a restriction with SalI, followed by blunt-end ligation. The sequence of the K100 chimera was confirmed by restriction map analysis as well as DNA sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI 373 automated DNA sequencer at the University of Alabama Center for AIDS Research Sequencing Core. Vectors containing ENaC and syntaxin inserts were linearized, and complimentary RNAs (cRNA) were synthesized in vitro using the mMessage mMachine™ kit. For most experiments, 5 ng each of the rat ENaC subunit cRNAs (α, βFLAG, and γFLAG cRNAs) were injected into stage V or VI oocytes. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 36–48 h in ND96 plus horse serum (25Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then assayed. Electrophysiological recordings were made using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp system (Gene Clamp 500, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Oocytes were bathed continuously in ND96. For the current-voltage analysis, oocytes were held at −40 mV, and the holding potential was stepped for 500 ms, in increments of 20 mV, from −120 to +20 mV. Experimental controls and data analysis were performed using pClamp software. Amiloride-sensitive currents reported in the text were determined as the difference in currents before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride to oocytes at a holding potential of −100 mV. Oocytes were injected with ENaC cRNAs with or without syntaxin 1A or 3. For control assays, some oocytes were injected with wild-type rat α, β, γ cRNAs without inserted FLAG epitopes. Oocytes were homogenized in RIPA buffer with a glass homogenizer on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were collected. The supernatant fractions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane in Towbin transfer buffer for 2 h. The PVDF membrane was then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and probed with M2 monoclonal antibody. The blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Oocytes were injected with ENaC cRNAs with or without syntaxin 1A or 3. For control assays, some oocytes were injected with wild-type rat α, β, γ cRNAs without inserted FLAG epitopes. Oocytes were homogenized in DIGNAM D buffer with a glass homogenizer on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was obtained. The lysates were incubated with anti-syntaxin antibody for 4–6 h. 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the sample, and the preparation was gently shaken for 2–4 h. The beads were then washed three times with DIGNAM D. The proteins were then eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membrane in Towbin transfer buffer for 2 h. The PVDF membrane was then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and probed with M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope. The blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Oocytes were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The oocytes were then incubated with M2 monoclonal antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After three washes in PBS, the oocytes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-alexa 488 for 1 h at 37 °C. The oocytes were washed five times with PBS and examined immediately with fluorescent microscopy. Oocytes were optically sectioned on an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with step motor filter wheel assembly (Ludl Electronics Products Ltd., Hawthorne, NY) and filter set 83000 (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Images were captured with a SenSys cooled CCD, high resolution, monochromatic, digital camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Deconvolution of optical sections and merging of resultant sections were done with a PowerMac 9500/132 computer supplied with IP Lab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA) and Power Microtome software (VayTek, Inc., Fairfield, IA). To test the hypothesis that syntaxins functionally regulate ENaC, amiloride-sensitive currents were assayed inXenopus oocytes expressing ENaC with or without co-expression of syntaxin 1A and 3 (Fig.1). At −100 mV, oocytes expressing ENaC showed basal currents that were inhibited by 10 μmamiloride (−671 ± 121 nA). These amiloride-sensitive currents increased 2-fold (to −1245 ± 187 nA) in oocytes expressing full-length syntaxin 3, but not with a syntaxin 3 construct (Syn 3ΔC) lacking the 13-amino acid COOH-terminal membrane-anchoring domain (−708 ± 134 nA). The basal currents were inhibited 60% (−269 ± 72 nA) in oocytes expressing syntaxin 1A. This change was not observed in oocytes expressing ENaC and a syntaxin 1A construct (Syn 1AΔC) lacking the 13-amino acid membrane-anchoring domain. These data indicate that (i) functional regulation is syntaxin isoform-specific, and (ii) that the membrane anchor of syntaxin is required for it's regulatory effects. Similar functional regulation of CFTR activity, with inhibition by syntaxin 1A and stimulation by syntaxin 3, has been reported previously (21Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To understand if syntaxins affect the unitary properties of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel in oocytes, we monitored the current-voltage relationship in ENaC-expressing oocytes co-injected with or without syntaxin 1A or syntaxin 3. We observed no significant change in either the resting membrane potential or the reversal potential of amiloride-sensitive sodium currents in presence of syntaxin 1A or 3 (Fig. 2). These data indicate that either of syntaxin isoform does not effect these macroscopic channel behaviors. K100 is a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of the β subunit of ENaC associated with Liddle's syndrome. This mutation increases amiloride-sensitive currents in Xenopusoocytes (24Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Consistent with this observation, we found that a mixture of ENaC subunits containing this construct (rat α, K100, rat γ) produced an approximately 2-fold increase in amiloride-sensitive currents (−912 ± 156 nA) compared with basal ENaC currents recorded with wild-type rat α, β, and γ cRNA (−443 ± 141 nA). We observed a substantial inhibition of the K100-stimulated currents when syntaxin 1A was co-expressed (−376 ± 132 nA; Fig. 3, lane 4). In fact, the currents associated with wild-type ENaC were almost the same as the K100 mixture co-injected with syntaxin 1A. After co-injection with syntaxin 3, further increases in the K100-stimulated currents were seen compared with K100 without syntaxin 3 co-expression, but the magnitude of this effect was dependent upon the basal level of ENaC activity. The regulation of ENaC activity by both syntaxins 3 and 1A was dose-dependent. A total of 5 ng ENaC (1.66 ng each of α, β, and γ ENaC subunit cRNA) was co-injected in the Xenopus oocytes with increasing concentrations of syntaxin cRNA (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 ng). Fig.4 A shows the dose-dependent activation of ENaC currents with increasing amounts of injected syntaxin 3 cRNA. We observed a saturable increase in amiloride-sensitive currents with increasing syntaxin 3 cRNA. The maximum stimulation of these currents was approximately 2.5-fold. Similar experiments were also conducted with syntaxin 1A. We observed a steady decline in amiloride-sensitive currents with increasing amounts of syntaxin 1A cRNA (Fig. 4 B). The maximum reduction of ∼65% was observed with an ENaC:syntaxin ratio of 1:5. Although the maximum modulatory effects of syntaxin on ENaC activity was observed at the maximum concentration injected, for practical purposes a ratio of 1:3 (ENaC:syntaxin) was found to produce comparable results and hence used in all other reported experiments. The functional data suggested an interaction between ENaC and syntaxin proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in which we injected Xenopus oocytes with epitope-tagged ENaC and either syntaxin 1A or 3. Oocytes expressing these proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-syntaxin antibody and blotted with M2 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the FLAG epitope (9Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). ENaC proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with both syntaxins 3 and 1A (Fig.5 A). Similar results were observed when the complex was first precipitated with M2 monoclonal antibody followed by immunodetection with isoform-specific syntaxin antibody (Fig. 5 B). Of note, full-length and carboxy-truncated syntaxins co-immunoprecipitated with ENaC. To examine further this interaction, we co-injected oocytes with increasing quantities of syntaxin cRNA. The homogenates were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and detected using isoform-specific anti-syntaxin antibody. With increasing concentrations of syntaxin, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate more bound syntaxin 1A or syntaxin 3 with ENaC (Fig. 6,A and B). These data suggest that ENaC and syntaxins physically associate in the oocyte expression system. Since the syntaxin family of membrane proteins has been implicated in membrane trafficking events, we next tested the hypothesis that the increase in amiloride-sensitive ENaC activity in the presence of syntaxin 3, and the decrease in amiloride-sensitive currents in the presence of syntaxin 1A was due to correlated changes in surface ENaC expression. We used FLAG epitope constructs (inserted into the extracellular loop of β and γ subunits) of ENaC, which we could label and detect on the oocyte surface by epifluorescence. As expected, we observed an increase in epifluorescence on the oocyte membrane surface of oocytes co-injected with syntaxin 3 (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, syntaxin 1A co-expression also caused an increase in surface epifluorescence, even though the functional activity of ENaC was reduced. The carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs of syntaxins 1A and 3 did not affect surface labeling of ENaC complexes, confirming the importance of the carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning region of syntaxins for interactions with membrane transport proteins (21Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that both syntaxin isoforms increase the net outward trafficking of ENaC proteins. The fact that syntaxin 1A increased surface ENaC epifluorescence but decreased ENaC currents suggests that factors other than surface expression, per se, can regulate ENaC function. Since we observed increased ENaC surface labeling in oocytes co-injected with syntaxins, it was of interest to see if the syntaxins altered the steady-state level of total cell ENaC protein. To answer this question, we extracted total ENaC proteins from oocytes and performed Western blot analysis (Fig.8). Our data indicate that the protein levels were unchanged in the oocytes preparations expressing ENaC with or without syntaxins 1A or 3. These results suggest that the syntaxins did not affect the ENaC half-life, or synthesis rate, and that the increased surface expression of ENaC observed with co-injection of syntaxins 1A or 3 was due to a redistribution of internal stores of the ENaC complex to the surface membrane. We used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to explore the role of syntaxins in the expression of amiloride-sensitive ENaC. The principal findings of the studies include: (i) ENaC can be functionally modulated by syntaxins 1A and 3, (ii) ENaC proteins physically interact with syntaxins 1A and 3, (iii) syntaxins 1A and 3 both increase the trafficking of ENaC proteins to the plasma membrane, (iv) co-expression with syntaxins 1A or 3 does not alter the steady-state amount of total ENaC protein, (v) enhanced ENaC trafficking may not reflect a parallel increase in ENaC function, and (vi) the β subunit carboxyl terminus does not interact with syntaxin 1A. Ion channel proteins are targeted to plasma membranes by the translocation of transport vesicles (25Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent vesicular fusion increases channel density at the surface. Important questions remain about the mechanisms by which transport vesicles are targeted to a specific membrane domain, and docking and fusion are regulated. The SNARE hypothesis (26Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar, 27Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), based on the regulated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, has expanded this concept. Vesicles may be targeted by membrane-associated proteins that behave as vesicle-targeting receptors or SNAREs. These proteins are associated with vesicular membranes (v-SNAREs) or with the target membrane (t-SNAREs). Syntaxins are a group of t-SNAREs, which participate in intracellular trafficking pathways (26Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar, 27Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). By using the oocyte expression system, we have demonstrated that syntaxins 1A and 3 can modulate amiloride-sensitive currents associated with ENaC. Syntaxin 3 is a positive functional regulator, whereas syntaxin 1A acts as a negative regulator of of ENaC activity. Both syntaxins physically interact with ENaC as demonstrated by the immunoprecipitation experiments. We were able to reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate ENaC proteins with syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 3 and also demonstrate that the functional interaction is critically dependent upon the carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning regions of the syntaxins. Truncation of these regions abrogated the ability of syntaxins 1A and 3 to affect either the surface expression or the functional activity of the ENaC complex (Figs. 1 and 7), even though the carboxyl-terminal truncated constructs still co-immunoprecipitated with ENaC (Fig. 5 B). This finding is consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning regions of the syntaxins are critical for there localization in the plasma membrane and for their targeting (tSNARE) function (19Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4010-4100Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsein R.W.

Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, the co-immunoprecipitation with the ΔC syntaxin constructs demonstrates that the α-helical regions interact with the ENaC proteins, rather than the carboxyl-terminal domains. The confocal microscopy data (Fig. 7) clearly demonstrate that ENaC density is increased at the oocyte surface when the ENaC subunits are co-injected with syntaxin 1A or syntaxin 3, thereby implying a role for these proteins in ENaC trafficking. The ΔC syntaxin constructs did not affect the ENaC surface expression. The opposite effects of syntaxins 3 and 1A on ENaC functional activity indicate a complex interaction between the ENaC complex and these syntaxins. We presume that additional components, either of the ENaC complex or other regulator factors, may play a crucial role in regulating ENaC functional activity. It appears likely that the pool of ENaC channels expressed at the membrane surface was labeled in our studies, since our confocal localization used a minor modification of the surface-labeling method described previously (9Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Some of the labeled ENaC could be present in subapical vesicles that were unfused with the plasma membrane. Since docking and fusion are distinct functions, the syntaxin-ENaC protein interaction may trigger interactions with other proteins consistent with the large array of proteins associated with syntaxins in SNARE complexes. Interaction between syntaxins and ENaC channel proteins may also result in conformational changes as documented for SNAP-SNARE complex (29Hong W. Protein Trafficking Along the Exocytotic Pathway. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 76Google Scholar) or could affect the stability of interacting components in the ENaC complex once they are assembled and expressed in the surface membrane. Syntaxin 3 has been cloned and described in various cell systems (16Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Patterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and enhances CFTR activity when co-injected in the oocyte system (21Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Since syntaxin 3 is expressed in principal cells of the collecting tubule (18Mandon B. Nielsen S. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F718-F730PubMed Google Scholar, 30Breton S. Inoue T. Nsumu N.N. Nielsen S. Knepper M. Brown D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 62Google Scholar), it could play a role in the trafficking of ENaC and water channels in these cells. A6 cells (an amphibian renal cell line), which functionally express ENaC activity and are used to study its regulation (31Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar), can also be labeled with syntaxin 3 antibody in our laboratory (data not shown). Syntaxin 3 has approximately 65% homology with syntaxin 1A and also has α-helical domains. Recently, the H3 domain of syntaxin 1A has been shown to interact with CFTR (22Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A similar homologous H3 domain is present in syntaxin 3. Our data demonstrate the physical and functional association of syntaxin 3 with ENaC in the oocyte expression system. The presence of this syntaxin isoform in native kidney (16Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Patterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 18Mandon B. Nielsen S. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F718-F730PubMed Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that syntaxin 3 could participate in the regulation of ENaC expression. In contrast to cultured epithelial cells where syntaxin 3 is apically expressed (17Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Weimbs T. Komuves L.G. Bennett M.K. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 32Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), syntaxin 3 appears to be localized at the basolateral membrane of principal cells (18Mandon B. Nielsen S. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F718-F730PubMed Google Scholar), while ENaC is primarily expressed in the apical membrane. Of note, syntaxin 4 is clearly expressed at the apical membrane of principal cells of the collecting tubule (33Mandon B. Chou C.L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The potential interactions of syntaxin 4 with ENaC have not yet been defined. ENaC regulates Na+ reabsorption (1Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 980-992PubMed Google Scholar) and maintains electrolyte balance. Several mutations in the ENaC subunits cause Liddle's syndrome, with abnormal regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance (1Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 980-992PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., G.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M.

Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These mutations increase ENaC functional activity and surface expression (9Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 24Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of ENaC activity is critical for our understanding of the pathogenesis of human salt-sensitive hypertension. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus of the ENaC β subunit were the originally described mutations in Liddle's syndrome (6Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., G.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). When such a construct (K100) is co-expressed with wild-type α and γ ENaC subunits, and syntaxins 1A, a similar inhibitory effect was observed as with the wild-type ENaC constructs, demonstrating that the functional interaction between syntaxin 1A and ENaC does not involve the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit. Since syntaxin 1A can still down-regulate the enhanced ENaC activity associated with the K100 construct, it is possible that some sort of protein-protein interaction may provide a therapeutic approach to regulating ENaC activity in human hypertension. In conclusion, ENaC physically and functionally interacts with at least two syntaxins, each of which differentially affect ENaC function. These interactions suggest a role for syntaxins in the trafficking and functional regulation of ENaC complexes and may also directly affect channel function as has been described for N-type calcium channel (20Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsein R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and CFTR (20Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsein R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L.

In view of the variety of syntaxin-associated proteins that have been described, it will be important to determine the specific nature of the syntaxin interactions with the ENaC complex. We thank Dr. M. J. Welsh for providing the human ENaC clones, Dr. B. C. Rossier for providing the rat ENaC clones, and Dr. M. K. Bennett for providing helpful suggestions and the syntaxin clones. The suggestions and assistance of Drs. A. Naren, Kevin Kirk, and J. Kevin Tucker are much appreciated."

We here examined whether Rho was involved in the barrier function of tight junction in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The activation of prostaglandin EP3β receptor, coupled to a Rho activation pathway, induced the increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) but the increase in paracellular flux of mannitol in the preformed monolayer of the MDCK cells expressing the EP3β receptor. This effect of the EP3 receptor was mimicked by the expression of constitutively active RhoA but not by active Rac1 in MDCK cells, using an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible expression system. On the other hand, the activation of EP3β receptor suppressed the elevation of TER and the decrease in paracellular mannitol flux during Ca2+ switch-induced tight junction formation, whereas the expression of active RhoA or Rac1 did not apparently affect the TER development in the Ca2+ switch. These results demonstrate that the EP3 receptor and active RhoA regulate permeabilities of ionic and nonionic molecules in opposite directions in the preformed monolayer, and the EP3 receptor suppresses the elevation of TER during the tight junction formation.

Epithelia form barriers and regulate vectorial transport of ions and solutes. Epithelial cells adhere to each other via three distinct adhesion systems, called tight junction, adherens junction, and desmosome. Of these, tight junction is the most apical component and is localized to the interface between apical and basolateral membrane domains (1Gumbiner B. Am. J.

It forms not only a boundary in the plasma membrane bilayer that separates the cell surface into biochemically and functionally distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains but also a barrier to the paracellular diffusion of ions and solutes. Recent studies have identified several proteins localized at tight junctions, including occludin (5Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

ZO-1 is a peripheral membrane protein with a molecular mass of 220 kDa and a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-containing family proteins, most of which may play key roles in clustering of proteins at synaptic and septate junctions, and ZO-1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of occludin (17Furuse M.

ZO-2, which has been characterized as a binding partner of ZO-1, is also a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-containing family (7Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For example, serum reduced ZO-1 protein levels and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) 1The abbreviations used are: TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; PT, pertussis toxin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; 8-br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IPTG, isopropyl-β-D thiogalactoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline in retinal epithelial cells (18Chang C.

However, intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the tight junction permeability, remain elusive. Rho and Rac are members of a subfamily of small GTPase that are thought to be involved in many cellular functions, including the regulation of actin filament reorganization, cell shape change, and gene expression (20Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 21Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Rho is responsible for regulating the assembly of focal adhesion and stress fiber formation, although Rac is involved in membrane ruffling and formation of lamellipodia (22Ridley A.J.

Besides, both Rho and Rac have been shown to be involved in serum response factor-mediated transcriptional activation (27Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). As for tight junction, C3 transferase, which ADP-ribosylates Rho on amino acid Asn-41 and is used as a specific inhibitor of Rho proteins (28Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was reported to induce the displacement of ZO-1 protein from tight junction and the increase in tight junction permeability, suggesting that Rho was involved in the regulation of tight junction integrity in epithelial cells (30Nusrat A.

Prostaglandin E2 exhibits a broad range of biological actions in diverse tissues through its binding to specific receptors on the plasma membrane (31Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin E receptors are pharmacologically divided into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, on the basis of their responses to various agonists and antagonists (32Coleman R.A. Kennedy I.

Although the well known EP3 receptor-mediated actions, mentioned above, are believed to be mediated by Gi, coupling of EP3 receptor to other signal transduction pathways has been suggested (39Negishi M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and stress fiber formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, an epithelial cell line derived from dog kidney, which are generally used as models of polarized cells (41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined roles of the EP3 receptor and RhoA in the barrier function of tight junction in MDCK cells, and we demonstrate that the EP3 receptor and the constitutively active RhoA oppositely regulate TER and the paracellular flux rate of mannitol in the preformed monolayer of MDCK cells, and in addition the EP3 receptor suppresses the elevation of TER during the Ca2+-induced tight junction formation. The MDCK strain II cell line and sulprostone were generous gifts from Drs. Keith E. Mostov (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and K.-H. Thierauch (Schering), respectively. Agents obtained and commercial sources were as follows: PT, Seikagaku Co., Japan; 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-br-cAMP), Research Biochemicals International.; rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, Molecular Probes, Inc.; rat anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibody, Chemicon International Inc.; rabbit anti-hemagglutinin (HA) polyclonal antibody, MBL International Co.; rhodamine-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-rat IgG, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG, DAKO; and Chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNA for human RhoA was generated as described previously (42Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The coding region of human Rac1 was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from HL-60 cells using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCCCGCAGGCCATCAAGTGTGTGGTGGT-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTTACAACAGCAGGCATTTTCTCTT-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI andEcoRI, cloned into the pBluescript SK(+), and completely sequenced. cDNAs for RhoAV14 and Rac1V12were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis (43Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK(+) containing the HA epitope at the 5′ end. 0.75- or 0.65-kilobase pair NotI-NotI fragment containing full-length human RhoAV14 or Rac1V12 cDNA tagged at the amino terminus with HA epitope was introduced into the mammalian expression vector pOPRSVICAT (Stratagene) at the site ofNotI (pOPRSVI/HA-RhoAV14 or HA-Rac1V12). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The MDCK cell line expressing the EP3β receptor has been previously described (41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To establish the MDCK cell line, expressing RhoAV14 or Rac1V12 under the control of isopropyl-β-D thiogalactoside (IPTG), MDCK cells were first transfected with a Lac repressor vector, p3′SS (Stratagene), by CellPhect Transfection Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stable transformants were cloned by selection with hygromycin (Wako Corp., Osaka, Japan), and the expression of Lac repressor was confirmed by immunoblotting using a Lac repressor protein anti-serum. Lac repressor-positive cells were further transfected with the pOPRSVI/HA-RhoAV14 or HA-Rac1V12 construct as described above. Stable transformants were cloned by selection with hygromycin and G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the Ca2+ switch experiments, the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 1.9 mm EGTA (low Ca2+ medium; estimated free Ca2+ concentration, 1–2 μm) for 4 h. They were then transferred to serum-free DMEM containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ (normal Ca2+ medium). MDCK cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well, and cultured for 2 days. For localization of actin filaments or ZO-1, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose for 1 h at 4 °C. They were then permeabilized with TPBS/HS (10 mmPBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min and washed with TPBS/HS twice. They were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TPBS/LS (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed with TPBS/HS. To identify the polymerized actin, they were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin in TPBS/LS for 1 h at room temperature. Then, they were washed with TPBS/HS three times and mounted onto a slide glass in PBS/glycerol containing p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. For localization of ZO-1, cells were incubated with antibody to ZO-1 (1:500 dilution) in TPBS/LS at 4 °C overnight. They were then washed with TPBS/HS three times and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (1:200 dilution) in TPBS/LS at room temperature for 1 h. They were washed with TPBS/HS three times and mounted onto a slide glass in PBS/glycerol containingp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Cells were photographed at 200× magnification under the fluorescent microscope. The cells were serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 1 h and stimulated with 5 mm IPTG for the time indicated. After the cells were rinsed briefly with PBS, they were incubated with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was separated by a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (1:200 dilution) overnight. The anti-HA antibody was detected using a chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. For culture on permeable support, MDCK cells were seeded on cell culture insert (Falcon 3095) at a density of 3 × 104 cells/filter and cultured for 5 days. After cells had been serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 1 h, they were stimulated with or without 1 μm sulprostone or 5 mm IPTG for the time indicated. TER was measured with a Millicell-ERS apparatus (Millipore Corporation). Calculations for ohm × cm2 were made by subtracting values of blank inserts from all samples and multiplying by the area of the monolayer (0.31 cm2). MDCK cells were seeded on cell culture insert at a density of 3 × 104cells/filter and cultured for 5 days. After cells had been serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 1 h, they were stimulated with or without 1 μm sulprostone or 5 mm IPTG for the time indicated. To measure paracellular flux, DMEM containing 5 μCi of [3H]mannitol and 5 mm unlabeled mannitol was added to the apical compartment, 5 mmunlabeled mannitol was added to the basal compartment, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After the 1-h incubation, aliquots from the apical and basolateral compartments were collected, and the radioactivities were measured. We previously established MDCK cell line expressing mouse EP3β receptor, which is coupled to Rho activation via a PT-insensitive heterotrimeric G protein (41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine a role of the EP3 receptor in the barrier function of tight junction in MDCK cells, we first investigated the effect of sulprostone, an EP3 agonist, on TER and the paracellular flux rate of mannitol. TER is thought to be a parameter of tight junction ionic permeability in MDCK strain II cells (44González-Mariscal L. Chávez de Ramirez B. Lázaro A. Cereijido M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the time course of the effect of sulprostone on TER in the preformed monolayer of the EP3β-expressing MDCK cells. Sulprostone at 1 μm induced the increase in TER with a lag period of 6 h, reaching a maximum level by 18 h. The sulprostone-induced TER increase was not observed in wild-type MDCK cells (data not shown). We previously showed that the EP3 receptor was linked to two signal transduction pathways, Gi-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition and Rho activation pathway via a PT-insensitive G protein (41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1857-1860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of PT on the EP3 receptor-mediated increase in TER. Sulprostone markedly induced the increase in TER in the PT-pretreated cells, the maximum level being slightly lower than that in the untreated cells, indicating that the EP3β receptor-induced increase in TER is mediated by the PT-insensitive pathway. We next examined the other parameter of tight junction permeability, the paracellular flux rate of mannitol. As shown in Fig.2, sulprostone stimulated the paracellular flux of mannitol in a time-dependent manner in the preformed monolayer of EP3β-expressing cells, and this increase in the flux was not affected by the PT treatment. Thus, the EP3β receptor oppositely regulated TER and paracellular mannitol flux via the PT-insensitive pathway. Sulprostone failed to affect the amount of occludin, as assessed by immunoblot and Northern blot analyses, indicating that the effect of the EP3 receptor on the barrier function is not due to fluctuation of cellular content of occludin (data not shown). EP3 receptor is coupled to Rho activation pathway via a PT-insensitive G protein (25Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C3 transferase is a very useful tool to verify the involvement of Rho in cellular functions, but C3 transferase is inadequate for application onto the regulation of permeability by the EP3 receptor, because microinjected C3 transferase and cell permeable C3 transferase have been shown to disrupt cell-cell adhesion and tight junction, respectively (30Nusrat A. Giry M. Turner J.R. Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Carnes D. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 46Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We also observed that the microinjection of C3 transferase induced the complete disruption of the cell-cell adhesion in MDCK cells (data not shown). Therefore, we next investigated the effect of constitutively active RhoA on the permeability of tight junction in the preformed monolayer of MDCK cells. We introduced HA-tagged GTPase-deficient constitutively active RhoA (RhoAV14) and Rac1 (Rac1V12) into MDCK cells using a Lac-inducible vector, and established MDCK cell lines, which express RhoAV14 and Rac1V12 under the control of IPTG (henceforth referred to as “RhoAV14-” or “Rac1V12-inducible MDCK cells,” respectively). HA-RhoAV14 or HA-Rac1V12 was expressed by the incubation with 5 mm IPTG for 3–6 h in RhoAV14- or Rac1V12-inducible cells (Fig.3). To verify the effects of RhoAV14 and Rac1V12 on the distribution of F-actin and ZO-1, we stained the cells by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin or anti-ZO-1 antibody. In parental MDCK cells expressing Lac repressor alone, stress fiber was not apparently found. IPTG did not show any alteration in F-actin distribution in these cells (Fig.4, A–C). In RhoAV14-inducible cells, although almost no stress fiber was seen in the unstimulated cells, IPTG induced clear stress fiber formation at 12 or 24 h (Fig. 4, G–I). In Rac1V12-inducible cells, the incubation with IPTG induced the marked increase in F-actin staining at the cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 4, D–F). Therefore, RhoAV14 and Rac1V12 expressed in the cells were functional. ZO-1 showed discrete and continuous patterns of distribution in the unstimulated parental and RhoAV14- and Rac1V12-inducible cells. Although IPTG treatment did not affect the ZO-1 distribution in parental and Rac1V12-inducible cells, this treatment induced the redistribution of ZO-1, and ZO-1 showed the discontinuous and fragmented staining pattern in RhoAV14-inducible cells (Fig. 5).Figure 4F-actin distribution in Rac1V12- and RhoAV14-inducible MDCK cells. Serum-starved parental (A–C), Rac1V12-inducible (D–F), and RhoAV14-inducible (G–I) MDCK cells were incubated as follows: no addition (A,D, and G), 5 mm IPTG for 12 (B, E, and H), and 24 h (C, F, and I). The cells were fixed, and F-actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results.

The induction of Rac1V12affected neither TER nor paracellular flux in the preformed monolayer of Rac1V12-inducible cells. On the other hand, the induction of RhoAV14 by IPTG progressively elevated the level of TER up to 24 h with a lag period of 12 h in the preformed monolayer of RhoAV14-inducible cells. RhoAV14 induction also stimulated the mannitol flux. The incubation with IPTG affected neither TER nor the paracellular flux of mannitol in parental MDCK cells (data not shown). Thus, constitutively active RhoA oppositely regulated TER and the flux rate of mannitol in the preformed monolayer of MDCK cells, whereas constitutively active Rac1 had no ability to modulate the barrier function of tight junction. The RhoAV14 induction did not affect the amount of occludin, as assessed by immunoblot and Northern blot analyses, indicating that the effect of RhoAV14 on the barrier function is not due to fluctuation of cellular content of occludin (data not shown). Cyclic AMP plays important roles in many aspects of cellular functions, and protein kinase A has been shown to modulate Rho-mediated function (47Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of cAMP on the EP3 receptor- and active RhoA-induced regulation of barrier function. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the pretreatment with 8-br-cAMP, a stable cAMP analogue, suppressed by 72% the TER increase induced by sulprostone without any change in the basal TER level in the preformed monolayer of EP3β-expressing cells. This treatment also suppressed the RhoAV14-induced TER increase by 65% in the preformed monolayer of RhoAV14-inducible cells (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that protein kinase A is a negative regulator for the RhoA-induced TER increase. We next examined the effects of the EP3 receptor, active RhoA, and active Rac1 on the Ca2+-induced formation of tight junction using a Ca2+ switch experiment. The elimination of Ca2+in the medium induced the disruption of cell-cell adhesion, and the following addition of Ca2+ induced the formation of tight junctions (48Balda M.S. González-Mariscal L.

The 4-h incubation with a low Ca2+ medium decreased the level of TER to almost zero. As shown in Fig.8 A, the addition of Ca2+ induced the marked"

Every halidohydrolase studied so far (l-2-haloacid dehalogenase, haloalkane dehalogenase, and 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase) has an active site carboxylate group that attacks the substrate carbon atom bound to the halogen atom, leading to the formation of an ester intermediate. This is subsequently hydrolyzed, resulting in the incorporation of an oxygen atom of the solvent water molecule into the carboxylate group of the enzyme. In the present study, we analyzed the reaction mechanism of dl-DEX 113. When a single turnover reaction of dl-DEX 113 was carried out with a large excess of the enzyme in H218O with a 10 times smaller amount of the substrate, either d- or l-2-chloropropionate, the major product was found to be18O-labeled lactate by ionspray mass spectrometry. After a multiple turnover reaction in H218O, the enzyme was digested with trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase, and the molecular masses of the peptide fragments were measured with an ionspray mass spectrometer. No peptide fragments contained 18O. These results indicate that the H218O of the solvent directly attacks the α-carbon of 2-haloalkanoic acid to displace the halogen atom.

However, none of the reaction mechanisms of these dl-DEXs have been studied, and it is unknown whether the reaction mechanism of dl-DEX is similar to that of other halidohydrolases (dehalogenases that catalyze the hydrolytic dehalogenation). We previously determined the primary structure of dl-DEX 113 (Fig.2), and found that it is similar to that of d-DEX from Pseudomonas putida AJ1 (17Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that dl-DEX 113 has a single and common catalytic site for both d- and l-enantiomers based on a site-directed mutagenesis experiment and kinetic analysis (17Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the reaction mechanism ofdl-DEX 113 by means of 18O incorporation experiments, and found that the reaction does not involve the formation of an enzyme-substrate ester intermediate. A water molecule is probably activated by a catalytic base of the enzyme, directly attacking the α-carbon of d- and l-2-haloalkanoic acids to displace the halogen atom (Fig. 1 B). This is the first example of an enzymatic dehalogenation that proceeds through the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 B. H218O (95–98%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) and Nippon Sanso (Tokyo, Japan). l- andd-2-chloropropionate were purchased from Sigma. Lysyl endopeptidase of Achromobacter lyticus M497–1 and trypsin (TPCK treated) were from Wako Industry Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Sigma, respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.

Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultivated at 37 °C for 14–18 h in a Luria-Bertani medium (1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and disrupted by ultrasonic oscillation at 4 °C for 20 min with a Seiko Instruments ultrasonic disintegrator model 7500. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a Butyl Toyopearl 650M column, and elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0–30% saturated ammonium sulfate in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. For a single turnover experiment, 200 nmol of dl-DEX 113 in 50 μl of a 400 mmTris-H2SO4 buffer (pH 9.5) was lyophilized. The reaction was initiated by dissolving the dried enzyme in 50 μl of H218O containing 20 nmol of d- orl-2-chloropropionate (neutralized with NaOH), and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixtures were ultrafiltered, diluted 10-fold with 50% acetonitrile/H2O (1:1), and then introduced into the mass spectrometer using a Harvard Apparatus syringe infusion pump operating at 2 μl/min. The molecular mass of the produced lactate was measured with a PE-Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray ion source in the negative ion mode (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Lyophilized 10 nmol of dl-DEX 113, 1.2 μmol of d- or l-2-chloropropionate (neutralized with NaOH), and 1.25 μmol of Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.5) were mixed in 50 μl of H218O and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The enzyme was inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture for 10 min at 80 °C and then denatured by the addition of 100 μl of 5 m urea in 100 mmTris-H2SO4 (pH 7.5). Subsequently, the volume was adjusted to 500 μl with 120 mmTris-H2SO4 (pH 7.5) in order to reduce the urea concentration to 1 m and the pH to approximately 8.0.dl-DEX 113 in this solution was digested with 5 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C for 12 h. To digest dl-DEX 113 in H218O, the protein was denatured by the addition of 100 μl of 3 murea in 100 mm Tris-H2SO4 (pH 7.0) prepared with H218O. Thereafter, 150 μl of 100 mm Tris-H2SO4 (pH 7.5) containing 5 μg of trypsin prepared with H218O was added to this solution and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Lyophilized 10 nmol of dl-DEX 113, 1.2 μmol of d- or l-2-chloropropionate (neutralized with NaOH), and 2.5 μmol of Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.5) were mixed in 50 μl of H218O and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The enzyme was inactivated by incubating the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 10 min, denatured with 8 m urea, and subsequently digested with 825 pmol of lysyl endopeptidase at 37 °C for 12 h. To digest the enzyme in H218O, 10 nmol ofdl-DEX 113, 1.0 μmol of d- orl-2-chloropropionate (neutralized with NaOH), and 20 μmol of Tris-H2SO4 (pH 9.5) were mixed in 50 μl of H218O and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A 20-μl aliquot was lyophilized and dissolved with 20 μl of H218O containing 8 m urea. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 30 μl of 1 mTris-H2SO4 (pH 9.0) in H218O and 10 μl of 33 μm lysyl endopeptidase in H218O were added to this solution, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h. The proteolytic digests of the enzyme were loaded onto a YMC-PackC4-AP column (100 × 1.0-mm inner diameter) (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) connected to the mass spectrometer and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 80 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A total ion current chromatogram was recorded in the single-quadrupole mode with a PE-Sciex API III mass spectrometer equipped with an ionspray ion source. The quadrupole was scanned from 300 to 2000 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.25 atomic mass units and a 0.5-ms dwell time per step. Ionspray voltage was set at 5 kV, and the orifice potential was 80 V. The molecular mass of each peptide was calculated with MacSpec software supplied by Sciex. Plasmid p4b (1Fetzner S. Lingens F. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 641-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mutagenized by the method of Kunkel et al. (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes and synthetic mutagenic primers were as follows (the underlines indicate the mutagenized nucleotides): D181A, 5′-TCACGGATGGCCCTGAG-3′; D181R, 5′-TCACGGATGCGCCTGAG-3′; D181E, 5′-TCACGGATTTCCCTGAG-3′.

After dialysis against a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), the remaining activities of the enzyme were measured by the standard assay method as described below. dl-DEX 113 was assayed with 25 mmd- orl-2-chloropropionate as a substrate. The chloride ions released were measured spectrophotometrically (21Iwasaki I. Utsumi S. Hagino K. Ozawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956; 29: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the dehalogenation of 1 μmol of the substrate/min. The protein assay was done with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. We conducted the single turnover reaction of dl-DEX 113 in H218O with d- or l-2-chloropropionate as a substrate, using an excess amount of the enzyme. We found that a majority of the lactate produced was labeled with 18O (Fig.3, A and B). This makes a clear contrast with our results on the l-DEX YL reaction, which proceeds through the mechanism involving an ester intermediate (Fig. 1 A) (5Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Only 10% of thed-lactate produced from l-2-chloropropionate byl-DEX YL was labeled with 18O (Fig.3 C). This suggests that in the dl-DEX 113 reaction an oxygen atom of the solvent water was directly incorporated into the product. While supporting the mechanism shown in Fig.1 B, this is not compatible with the mechanism in Fig.1 A, in which an oxygen atom of the solvent water is first incorporated into the enzyme. A multiple turnover reaction of dl-DEX 113 was carried out in H218O with d- orl-2-chloropropionate as a substrate. After completion of the reaction, the enzyme was digested with TPCK-treated trypsin, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated on a reversed phase column interfaced with an ionspray mass spectrometer as a detector. If the reaction proceeds through the mechanism in Fig. 1 B,18O should not be detected in the proteolytic fragments. The spectrometer was used in the single quadrupole mode, and the total ion current chromatogram was obtained as shown in Fig.4. Peaks 1–21 were assigned to peptides 144–151, 143–151, 67–76, 2–8, 286–298, 301–307, 9–21, 184–196, 108–119, 239–249, 152–162, 22–34, 211–228, 77–105, 273–283, 44–66, 163–180 (dimer), 197–210, 120–134, 255–272, and 35–43, respectively (Table I, Fig. 2). The molecular masses of all peptides were virtually indistinguishable from the predicted ones whether the reaction was conducted withd- or l-2-chloropropionate.Table IMolecular masses of proteolytic fragments of dl-DEX 113 incubated with substrates in H218OPeakFragment[M + H]+Predicted (average mass)Measuredl-CPA1-aDL-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin.d-CPA1-aDL-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin.1144–151933.99933.5933.82143–1511090.181089.51089.5367–761138.221137.51137.542–8851.04850.5850.85286–2981368.401367.81367.86301–307816.93816.5816.579–211465.571465.01465.08184–1961486.591486.01486.09108–1191263.391262.81262.810239–2491093.191092.81092.811152–1621201.411200.81200.81222–341545.691545.61545.913211–2282023.292022.72022.71477–1052919.262919.42919.115273–2831232.511231.81231.81644–662674.102674.42674.217163–180 (dimer)4165.724165.94166.218197–2101664.951665.51665.519120–1341830.101830.51830.520255–2722043.422043.22043.22135–431045.281046.01046.21-a DL-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin.

Peptides 120–142, 232–285, and 299–306 were identified, and their molecular masses were virtually indistinguishable from the predicted ones (TableII, Fig. 2).

Open table in a new tab An oxygen atom of the catalytic carboxylate group of haloalkane dehalogenase fromX. autotrophicus GJ10 is rapidly replaced by an oxygen atom of the solvent water even in the absence of the substrate (9Pries F.

If this is the case for dl-DEX 113, 18O once incorporated into the acidic amino acid residue during the dehalogenation should have been replaced by the 16O of the solvent water during the treatment with trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase, which raised the possibility that the increase in the molecular mass of the peptides might not be detectable in the above experiments. To examine this possibility, we carried out the denaturation and trypsin digestion of the enzyme in H218O. If there is an oxygen atom (16O) in the enzyme which is readily exchangeable for an oxygen (18O) of the solvent water, an increase in the molecular mass of the proteolytic peptides is expected. The molecular masses of the proteolytic peptides, 2–8, 9–21, 22–34, 35–43, 44–66, 67–76, 77–105, 108–119, 120–134, 144–151, 152–162, 184–196, 197–210, 211–228, 239–249, 255–272, and 273–283 were approximately 4 Da higher than the predicted molecular masses in the system with either d- orl-2-chloropropionate as a substrate (TableIII, Fig. 2). A peptide containing amino acid residues 163–180 appeared as a dimeric form, and its molecular mass was approximately 8 Da higher than the predicted one. These increases are attributed to the incorporation of two 18O atoms into the α-carboxylate group of the C-terminal amino acid residue of each tryptic fragment. The molecular mass of peptide 301–307 derived from the C-terminal region of the enzyme was almost identical to the predicted value. Peptide fragments prepared with lysyl endopeptidase were also analyzed, and the molecular masses of peptides 120–142, 232–285, 286–298, and 299–306 were about 4 Da higher than the predicted ones (Table IV, Fig. 2). These show that the 18O of the solvent water was incorporated only into the α-carboxylate group of each peptide but not into the side chain carboxylate group.Table IIIMolecular masses of proteolytic fragments of dl-DEX 113 incubated with substrates in H218OPeakFragment[M + H]+Predicted (average mass)Measuredl-CPA3-adl-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin in H218O.d-CPA3-adl-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin in H218O.1144–151933.99937.8937.8267–761138.221142.01141.832–8851.04855.0855.049–211465.571469.21470.05301–307816.93816.8816.86184–1961486.591490.21490.67108–1191263.391267.01267.28239–2491093.191097.01097.09152–1621201.411205.21205.01022–341545.691549.21549.211211–2282023.292027.32026.91277–1052919.262923.52923.21335–431045.281049.21048.814273–2831232.511236.01236.21544–662674.102678.42677.816163–180 (dimer)4165.724173.64173.617197–2101664.951669.01669.818120–1341830.101833.91834.419255–2722043.422047.32047.33-a dl-DEX 113 was incubated withl-2-chloropropionate (l-CPA) ord-2-chloropropionate (d-CPA) in H218O, and digested with trypsin in H218O.

Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that 18O was incorporated into Asp or Glu in these peptides. However, among these peptides, only peptide 181–183 contains an acidic residue, Asp181. We replaced Asp181with Ala, Arg, and Glu by site-directed mutagenesis to clarify whether Asp181 is involved in the catalytic reaction shown in Fig.1 A as Asp10 of l-DEX YL is. The activities of these mutant enzymes were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table V), indicating that Asp181 is not essential for the catalysis.Table VActivities of wild-type and mutant dl-DEX 113EnzymesSpecific activity (units/mg)l-2-Chloropropionated-2-ChloropropionateWild-type1.071.01D181A1.241.26D181R1.100.98D181E1.061.00Specific activities of the crude extracts of the recombinant E. coli cells were measured with 25 mM l- ord-2-chloropropionate.

This inactivation was observed only in the presence of the substrate, and an ester intermediate formed from Asp10 and the substrate was thought to be a target of hydroxylamine. This was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the inactivated enzyme, which showed that the modified Asp10 residue contained both hydroxylamine- and substrate-derived moieties. The inactivation of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase by hydroxylamine was also reported (13Crooks G.P. Xu L. Barkley R.M. Copley S.D. J. Am. Chem.

Single turnover reactions carried out in H218O indicated that an oxygen atom of the solvent water is directly incorporated into the product (Fig. 3,A and B). We also found that an oxygen atom of the solvent water is not incorporated into the side chain carboxylate groups of the acidic amino acid residues of the enzyme in the dehalogenation reaction (except for Asp181, whose molecular mass could not be measured) (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV). A site-directed mutagenesis experiment showed that Asp181 is not essential in the catalysis (Table V). These results are consistent with the general base mechanism shown in Fig. 1 B, but not with the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 A. This applies to the dehalogenations of both enantiomers of 2-haloalkanoic acids because the results obtained for both enantiomers were virtually the same. We previously reported thatdl-DEX 113 has a single and common catalytic site for bothl- and d-enantiomers based on a site-directed mutagenesis experiment and kinetic analysis (17Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

So far, no halidohydrolases have been shown to catalyze the reaction without the formation of the ester intermediate. Thus, dl-DEX 113 is unique in that its reaction does not involve the formation of an ester intermediate. Since d-DEX from P. putida AJ1 (27Barth P.T. Bolton L. Thomson J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2612-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows sequence similarity with dl-DEX 113 (17Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reaction of d-DEX probably proceeds through the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 B. Although dl-DEX andl-DEX can catalyze the same reaction (hydrolysis ofl-2-haloalkanoic acids), our present data clearly show that the reaction mechanisms of dl-DEX and l-DEX are completely different from each other. Recently, we found that Glu69 and Asp194 are essential for the catalysis of dl-DEX 113 by site-directed mutagenesis (17Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Park C. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4232-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several hydrolases such as aspartic proteases (28Hyland L.J. Tomaszek Jr., T.A. Meek T.D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have been shown to possess Glu or Asp as a catalytic base that activates a water molecule to attack the substrate molecule. In these enzymatic hydrolyses, ester intermediates are not produced. In this respect, dl-DEX 113 resembles these hydrolases, and Glu69 and/or Asp194 may be involved in the activation of a water molecule that attacks the α-carbon atom of the substrate. Further studies including crystallographic analysis of the enzyme are now being carried out to identify the active site residues and to clarify their roles in the catalysis."

Alanine substitution, removing minor groove interactions, strongly reduces polymerase selectivity for all single-base mispairs examined. In contrast, the lysine substitution, which retains significant interactions with the minor groove, has wild-type-like selectivity for T·dGMP and A·dGMP mispairs but reduced selectivity for T·dCMP and A·dCMP mispairs. Examination of DNA crystal structures of these four mispairs indicates that the two mispairs excluded by the lysine mutant have an atom (N2) in an unfavorable position in the minor groove, while the two mispairs permitted by the lysine mutant do not. These results suggest that unfavorable interactions between an active site amino acid side chain and mispair-specific atoms in the minor groove contribute to DNA polymerase specificity.

Accurate DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases during repair and replication is essential for genome stability. Thus, it is important to understand how DNA polymerases select correct nucleotides for incorporation. That polymerases may distinguish correct from incorrect base pairs by examining the positions of hydrogen bonding atoms in the minor groove of the template·primer duplex was suggested more than 20 years ago (1Bruskov V.I.

The positions of the two minor groove hydrogen bond acceptors (N3 of purines and O2 of pyrimidines) are similar in Watson-Crick base pairs, but different in mismatched base pairs (3Kennard O.

Pol β's primary function is in base excision repair (BER) of DNA damage resulting from exposure to endogenous metabolites and reactive genotoxicants (13Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar, 14Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this capacity, pol β fills in gaps of a single nucleotide (single-nucleotide BER) or gaps of two to six nucleotides (alternate or long patch BER). Pol β lacks an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease and generates single-base substitution errors at rates of 0.5–13 × 10−4 when filling short gaps (16Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R.

This fidelity is higher than predicted by free energy differences between correct and incorrect base pairing in solution (18Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 52: 429-457Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting that like other DNA polymerases, pol β contributes to the selectivity of nucleotide incorporation.Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that nucleotide selection by pol β occurs at a step following initial, nonspecific dNTP binding (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). When DNA with a single-nucleotide gap is bound by pol β, a 90° kink is observed at the 5′-phosphodiester linkage of the template residue that base pairs with the incoming dNTP (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 8-kDa domain of the enzyme binds to the 5′-phosphate in the gap, causing pol β to have a more compact structure compared with the unliganded enzyme (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Upon binding of a correct dNTP, the 8-kDa domain moves slightly toward the active site and a portion of the C-terminal domain rotates a large distance closing around the incoming nucleotide and stabilizing its complement in the template strand (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,B and C). The binding pocket for the nascent base pair (Fig. 1 A) is thus composed of the terminal base pair in the duplex template·primer stem on one side and residues in the C-terminal domain of pol β on the other side (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 19Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If there is complementarity between the enzyme and a correct base pair, numerous, small conformational changes take place triggering catalysis (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar).A key side chain involved in forming the active site pocket is Arg283. As highlighted in red in Fig.1 A, this side chain makes van der Waals contacts with the minor groove edge of the templating nucleotide. This side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the sugar of the preceding template nucleotide in the template·primer duplex. Previous studies have shown that the R283A mutant of pol β has greatly reduced fidelity consistent with the importance of these interactions for polymerase selectivity (16Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P.

Here we compare the extreme loss of selectivity resulting from this near complete removal of side chain interactions to the effects of arginine substitution with lysine, retaining some interactions with the minor groove and therefore the possibility of some selectivity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs models for DNA synthesis in both the single-nucleotide and long patch BER pathways, we used M13mp2 DNA substrates containing a single-nucleotide gap or a five-nucleotide gap (17Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These gaps contain an in frame opal codon in the lacZα-complementation sequence that renders M13 plaques colorless, and polymerase errors that restore α-complementation yield a blue plaque phenotype. When the fidelity of the R283A and R283K mutant polymerases was compared with the wild-type enzyme, both had significantly lower fidelity, as indicated by the increases in overall reversion frequencies (mutant fraction (MF)) in both gap-filling assays (TableI). Consistent with retention of some selectivity by the R283K mutant, the increase relative to wild-type was approximately 10-fold. In contrast, a greater than 100-fold increase was observed for the R283A mutant. DNA sequence analysis oflacZ revertants indicated that the R283A mutant was much less accurate than wild-type pol β for a variety of mispairs (TableI, Fig. 2). In contrast, the R283K mutant was selectively error-prone for some mispairs but not for other mispairs. For example, both mutant enzymes were error-prone for misincorporation of dCMP opposite template T or A, but the R283K mutant was as accurate as wild-type pol β for misincorporation of dGMP opposite template T or A (Table I, Fig. 2).Table IBase substitution specificity of wild-type and Arg283 DNA polymerase β mutants during short gap-filling synthesisTemplate nucleotideMismatch (template · dNTP)Error rates per detectable nucleotide (×10−4)1-aError rates per detectable nucleotide polymerized were calculated by dividing the total number of revertants obtained for each substitution error by the total number of mutants sequenced and then multiplying by the total mutant fraction.Wild-type pol βR283K pol βR283A pol βSingle-nucleotide BER gap-filling DNA synthesis1-bData for wild-type pol β are from Osheroff et al.

When compared with a correct base pair, the thymine O4-keto group of a T·G wobble base pair (25Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kneale G. Anand N.N. Rabinovich D. Kennard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is displaced in the major groove and the guanine N2-amino group protrudes farther into the minor groove (Fig. 3 A). In the active site of both the wild-type and R283K enzymes, closure of the C-terminal domain around the T·G mispair to allow catalysis would require the close approach of the hydrogen bond donors of the Arg283 side chain and N2-atom of the incoming dGTP (Fig.4, A and B; Arg, Lys). This unfavorable interaction or interference in the minor groove (Fig. 4A, white arrow; B, black arrows) may explain how the wild-type and R283K enzymes discriminate against the T·dGTP mispair (Fig. 2). The R283A mutant is unable to discriminate against this mispair due to the absence of unfavorable minor groove interactions (Fig. 4 B, Ala). In contrast to the T·G mispair, the structure of a T·C mispair (26Boulard Y. Cognet J.A. Fazakerley G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B) does not suggest a difference in the minor groove that would lead to steric interference with lysine but not alanine at position 283 (Fig.4 C). This analysis is consistent with our observation of the similar infidelity for the R283A and R283K mutants with the T·dCMP mispair (Fig. 2).Figure 3Superpositions of the structures of Watson-Crick base pairs and DNA mispairs.

In both the five- and one-nucleotide gap-filling reactions, R283K discriminates against A·dGTP mispairs to the same extent as wild-type pol β (Fig. 2). This may be due to unfavorable interactions (Fig. 4 D, black arrows) between the arginine or lysine side chain and the N2 of the incoming guanine in the minor groove in the A(syn)·G mispair (27Brown T. Hunter W.N. Kneale G. Kennard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2402-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Again, the smaller alanine side chain does not provide this discriminating interaction (Fig. 4 D). The structure of the A·C pair (28Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kennard O. Nature. 1986; 320: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) superimposes well with the adenine·thymine pair (24Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 D). This minor groove similarity may provide little or no information for steric hindrance discrimination by the lysine or alanine side chains (Fig. 4 E).The unique error specificities observed with these mutant pol β enzymes thus suggest that interactions between amino acid side chains and the DNA minor groove contribute to the high polymerase selectivity needed to faithfully repair genomes. This interpretation is consistent with the altered fidelity of other DNA polymerases when side chains that interact in the minor groove are altered (29Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L.

A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The positions of the two minor groove hydrogen bond acceptors (N3 of purines and O2 of pyrimidines) are similar in Watson-Crick base pairs, but different in mismatched base pairs (3Kennard O.

The structure of a DNA polymerase β·DNA·ddNTP complex reveals that the active site binding pocket for the nascent base pair is partly formed by interactions of side chains with the DNA minor groove (5Sawaya M.R.

Here we probe the importance of polymerase interactions with the DNA minor groove using DNA pol 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; BER, base excision repair1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; BER, base excision repairβ, the smallest and most extensively studied mammalian DNA polymerase. Pol β's primary function is in base excision repair (BER) of DNA damage resulting from exposure to endogenous metabolites and reactive genotoxicants (13Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar, 14Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this capacity, pol β fills in gaps of a single nucleotide (single-nucleotide BER) or gaps of two to six nucleotides (alternate or long patch BER). Pol β lacks an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease and generates single-base substitution errors at rates of 0.5–13 × 10−4 when filling short gaps (16Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R.

This fidelity is higher than predicted by free energy differences between correct and incorrect base pairing in solution (18Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 52: 429-457Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting that like other DNA polymerases, pol β contributes to the selectivity of nucleotide incorporation. Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that nucleotide selection by pol β occurs at a step following initial, nonspecific dNTP binding (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). When DNA with a single-nucleotide gap is bound by pol β, a 90° kink is observed at the 5′-phosphodiester linkage of the template residue that base pairs with the incoming dNTP (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 8-kDa domain of the enzyme binds to the 5′-phosphate in the gap, causing pol β to have a more compact structure compared with the unliganded enzyme (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Upon binding of a correct dNTP, the 8-kDa domain moves slightly toward the active site and a portion of the C-terminal domain rotates a large distance closing around the incoming nucleotide and stabilizing its complement in the template strand (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,B and C). The binding pocket for the nascent base pair (Fig. 1 A) is thus composed of the terminal base pair in the duplex template·primer stem on one side and residues in the C-terminal domain of pol β on the other side (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 19Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If there is complementarity between the enzyme and a correct base pair, numerous, small conformational changes take place triggering catalysis (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). A key side chain involved in forming the active site pocket is Arg283. As highlighted in red in Fig.1 A, this side chain makes van der Waals contacts with the minor groove edge of the templating nucleotide. This side chain is hydrogen-bonded to the sugar of the preceding template nucleotide in the template·primer duplex. Previous studies have shown that the R283A mutant of pol β has greatly reduced fidelity consistent with the importance of these interactions for polymerase selectivity (16Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This phenotype includes an error rate of 25% for T·dGMP (16Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M.

Here we compare the extreme loss of selectivity resulting from this near complete removal of side chain interactions to the effects of arginine substitution with lysine, retaining some interactions with the minor groove and therefore the possibility of some selectivity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs models for DNA synthesis in both the single-nucleotide and long patch BER pathways, we used M13mp2 DNA substrates containing a single-nucleotide gap or a five-nucleotide gap (17Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These gaps contain an in frame opal codon in the lacZα-complementation sequence that renders M13 plaques colorless, and polymerase errors that restore α-complementation yield a blue plaque phenotype. When the fidelity of the R283A and R283K mutant polymerases was compared with the wild-type enzyme, both had significantly lower fidelity, as indicated by the increases in overall reversion frequencies (mutant fraction (MF)) in both gap-filling assays (TableI). Consistent with retention of some selectivity by the R283K mutant, the increase relative to wild-type was approximately 10-fold. In contrast, a greater than 100-fold increase was observed for the R283A mutant. DNA sequence analysis oflacZ revertants indicated that the R283A mutant was much less accurate than wild-type pol β for a variety of mispairs (TableI, Fig. 2). In contrast, the R283K mutant was selectively error-prone for some mispairs but not for other mispairs. For example, both mutant enzymes were error-prone for misincorporation of dCMP opposite template T or A, but the R283K mutant was as accurate as wild-type pol β for misincorporation of dGMP opposite template T or A (Table I, Fig. 2).Table IBase substitution specificity of wild-type and Arg283 DNA polymerase β mutants during short gap-filling synthesisTemplate nucleotideMismatch (template · dNTP)Error rates per detectable nucleotide (×10−4)1-aError rates per detectable nucleotide polymerized were calculated by dividing the total number of revertants obtained for each substitution error by the total number of mutants sequenced and then multiplying by the total mutant fraction.Wild-type pol βR283K pol βR283A pol βSingle-nucleotide BER gap-filling DNA synthesis1-bData for wild-type pol β are from Osheroff et al.

Multiple base substitution mutations in a revertant were treated as independent events in the calculation. Open table in a new tab To explain the distinct base substitution specificities of the R283K and R283A enzymes, we compared the crystal and NMR structures of DNAs containing the four mispairs characterized in Fig. 2 with those of DNAs with correct base pairs. When compared with a correct base pair, the thymine O4-keto group of a T·G wobble base pair (25Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kneale G. Anand N.N. Rabinovich D. Kennard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is displaced in the major groove and the guanine N2-amino group protrudes farther into the minor groove (Fig. 3 A). In the active site of both the wild-type and R283K enzymes, closure of the C-terminal domain around the T·G mispair to allow catalysis would require the close approach of the hydrogen bond donors of the Arg283 side chain and N2-atom of the incoming dGTP (Fig.4, A and B; Arg, Lys). This unfavorable interaction or interference in the minor groove (Fig. 4A, white arrow; B, black arrows) may explain how the wild-type and R283K enzymes discriminate against the T·dGTP mispair (Fig. 2). The R283A mutant is unable to discriminate against this mispair due to the absence of unfavorable minor groove interactions (Fig. 4 B, Ala). In contrast to the T·G mispair, the structure of a T·C mispair (26Boulard Y. Cognet J.A. Fazakerley G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B) does not suggest a difference in the minor groove that would lead to steric interference with lysine but not alanine at position 283 (Fig.4 C). This analysis is consistent with our observation of the similar infidelity for the R283A and R283K mutants with the T·dCMP mispair (Fig. 2).Figure 3Superpositions of the structures of Watson-Crick base pairs and DNA mispairs.

In both the five- and one-nucleotide gap-filling reactions, R283K discriminates against A·dGTP mispairs to the same extent as wild-type pol β (Fig. 2). This may be due to unfavorable interactions (Fig. 4 D, black arrows) between the arginine or lysine side chain and the N2 of the incoming guanine in the minor groove in the A(syn)·G mispair (27Brown T. Hunter W.N. Kneale G. Kennard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2402-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). Again, the smaller alanine side chain does not provide this discriminating interaction (Fig. 4 D). The structure of the A·C pair (28Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kennard O. Nature. 1986; 320: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) superimposes well with the adenine·thymine pair (24Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 D). This minor groove similarity may provide little or no information for steric hindrance discrimination by the lysine or alanine side chains (Fig. 4 E).The unique error specificities observed with these mutant pol β enzymes thus suggest that interactions between amino acid side chains and the DNA minor groove contribute to the high polymerase selectivity needed to faithfully repair genomes. This interpretation is consistent with the altered fidelity of other DNA polymerases when side chains that interact in the minor groove are altered (29Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L.

As models for DNA synthesis in both the single-nucleotide and long patch BER pathways, we used M13mp2 DNA substrates containing a single-nucleotide gap or a five-nucleotide gap (17Osheroff W.P.

These gaps contain an in frame opal codon in the lacZα-complementation sequence that renders M13 plaques colorless, and polymerase errors that restore α-complementation yield a blue plaque phenotype. When the fidelity of the R283A and R283K mutant polymerases was compared with the wild-type enzyme, both had significantly lower fidelity, as indicated by the increases in overall reversion frequencies (mutant fraction (MF)) in both gap-filling assays (TableI). Consistent with retention of some selectivity by the R283K mutant, the increase relative to wild-type was approximately 10-fold. In contrast, a greater than 100-fold increase was observed for the R283A mutant. DNA sequence analysis oflacZ revertants indicated that the R283A mutant was much less accurate than wild-type pol β for a variety of mispairs (TableI, Fig. 2). In contrast, the R283K mutant was selectively error-prone for some mispairs but not for other mispairs. For example, both mutant enzymes were error-prone for misincorporation of dCMP opposite template T or A, but the R283K mutant was as accurate as wild-type pol β for misincorporation of dGMP opposite template T or A (Table I, Fig. 2). To explain the distinct base substitution specificities of the R283K and R283A enzymes, we compared the crystal and NMR structures of DNAs containing the four mispairs characterized in Fig. 2 with those of DNAs with correct base pairs. When compared with a correct base pair, the thymine O4-keto group of a T·G wobble base pair (25Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kneale G. Anand N.N. Rabinovich D. Kennard O. J. Biol.

In the active site of both the wild-type and R283K enzymes, closure of the C-terminal domain around the T·G mispair to allow catalysis would require the close approach of the hydrogen bond donors of the Arg283 side chain and N2-atom of the incoming dGTP (Fig.4, A and B; Arg, Lys). This unfavorable interaction or interference in the minor groove (Fig. 4A, white arrow; B, black arrows) may explain how the wild-type and R283K enzymes discriminate against the T·dGTP mispair (Fig. 2). The R283A mutant is unable to discriminate against this mispair due to the absence of unfavorable minor groove interactions (Fig. 4 B, Ala). In contrast to the T·G mispair, the structure of a T·C mispair (26Boulard Y. Cognet J.A. Fazakerley G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B) does not suggest a difference in the minor groove that would lead to steric interference with lysine but not alanine at position 283 (Fig.4 C). This analysis is consistent with our observation of the similar infidelity for the R283A and R283K mutants with the T·dCMP mispair (Fig. 2). In a similar manner, a comparison of the crystal structures of A·G and A·C mispairs to those of correct base pairs can be used to understand the distinct error specificities of the R283A and R283K mutant polymerases. In both the five- and one-nucleotide gap-filling reactions, R283K discriminates against A·dGTP mispairs to the same extent as wild-type pol β (Fig. 2). This may be due to unfavorable interactions (Fig. 4 D, black arrows) between the arginine or lysine side chain and the N2 of the incoming guanine in the minor groove in the A(syn)·G mispair (27Brown T.

https://openalex.org/W2048153230,"The exchange of oxygen atoms between acetate, glutaryl-CoA, and the catalytic glutamate residue in glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans was analyzed using [18O2]acetate together with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry of an appropriate undecapeptide. The exchange reaction was shown to be site-specific, reversible, and required both glutaryl-CoA and [18O2]acetate. The observed exchange is in agreement with the formation of a mixed anhydride intermediate between the enzyme and acetate. In contrast, with a mutant enzyme, which was converted to a thiol ester hydrolyase by replacement of the catalytic glutamate residue by aspartate, no 18O uptake from H218O into the carboxylate was detectable. This result is in accord with a mechanism in which the carboxylate of aspartate acts as a general base in activating a water molecule for hydrolysis of the thiol ester intermediate. This mechanism is further supported by the finding of a significant hydrolyase activity of the wild-type enzyme using acetyl-CoA as substrate, whereas glutaryl-CoA is not hydrolyzed. The small acetate molecule in the substrate binding pocket may activate a water molecule for hydrolysis of the nearby enzyme-CoA thiol ester. The exchange of oxygen atoms between acetate, glutaryl-CoA, and the catalytic glutamate residue in glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans was analyzed using [18O2]acetate together with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry of an appropriate undecapeptide. The exchange reaction was shown to be site-specific, reversible, and required both glutaryl-CoA and [18O2]acetate. The observed exchange is in agreement with the formation of a mixed anhydride intermediate between the enzyme and acetate.

The small acetate molecule in the substrate binding pocket may activate a water molecule for hydrolysis of the nearby enzyme-CoA thiol ester. The strict anaerobic bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans is able to grow with glutamate as the sole source of energy. The fermentation of glutamate proceeds via the hydroxyglutarate pathway yielding ammonia, carbon dioxide, acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen as products (1Buckel W. Barker H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of the oxidation of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate followed by reduction to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, almost all other transformations in this pathway are carried out on the CoA-ester level (2Buckel W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 88: 211-232Crossref Google Scholar). Hence the activation of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate is a key step in this metabolic pathway (3Schweiger G. Dutscho R. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (R)­2­Hydroxyglutarate2−+acetyl­CoA⇌(R)­2­hydroxyglutaryl­CoA−+acetate−Equation 1 The transfer of coenzyme A from acetyl-CoA to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (Equation 1) is catalyzed by (E)-glutaconate:acetyl-CoA CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.12, further referred to as glutaconate CoA-transferase), which can also use propionate and glutarate as substrates. The enzyme has been purified, and the two encoding genes have been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The hetero-octameric protein (α4β4) consists of two different subunits with molecular mass values of 35.5 kDa (α-subunit) and 29 kDa (β-subunit) (4Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The catalytic action of CoA transferases has been suggested to proceed via a mechanism outlined in Fig. 1 (6Jencks W.P. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 9B. Academic Press, New York1973: 483-496Google Scholar,7White H. Jencks P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1688-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By nucleophilic attack of a glutamate residue of the enzyme at the carbonyl of the donor acetyl-CoA, a mixed anhydride between the enzyme and acetate is formed. The transiently liberated CoAS−anion reattacks the glutamate carbonyl carbon to form the product acetate and an enzyme-CoA thiol ester. The second product, (R)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA, is formed by repetition of the steps outlined above. It should be noted that during one catalytic cycle, one oxygen atom is transferred from the acetate to the glutamate residue. Consecutive turnovers lead to a complete equilibration of all oxygen atoms involved in the reaction. The catalytic glutamate residue in glutaconate CoA-transferase has been identified as amino acid 54 of the smaller β-subunit (βGlu-54). The thiol ester between coenzyme A and the glutamate residue has been reduced with sodium boro[3H]hydride to the corresponding alcohol, which was identified as 2-amino-5-hydroxy[5-3H]valeric acid within a tryptic peptide (4Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enzyme was crystallized, and its structure has been solved recently at 2.55 Å resolution. The crystallographic data (8Jocob U. Mack M. Clausen T. Huber R. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Structure. 1997; 5: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as sequence alignments (9Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) also confirmed that glutamate β54 is the catalytic residue in glutaconate CoA-transferase. The important role of glutamate β54 has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (10Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whereas the replacement of glutamate β54 by alanine (βE54A) or asparagine (βE54N) completely abolished the transferase activity, the glutamine (βE54Q) mutant retained a remarkable residual activity (1% of the wild type). By incubating this enzyme with both substrates for 20 h at room temperature, the glutamine was completely converted to glutamate yielding a fully active CoA-transferase. Changing glutamate 54 to aspartate converted the enzyme to a thiol ester hydrolyase (9Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the missing methylene group in the side chain of aspartate as compared with glutamate allows a water molecule to occupy the space between the substrate and the carboxylate of aspartate β54. Activated by the carboxylate of aspartate as the general base, this water molecule should be able for a nucleophilic attack at the thiol ester carbonyl carbon and cleavage of the thiol ester bond. Alternatively, a mechanism requiring the transient formation of a mixed anhydride between aspartate and the donor carboxylic acid might be possible. The exchange of oxygen between the CoA donor, glutaryl-CoA, the acceptor, [18O2]acetate, and the catalytic glutamate residue could be followed by modern mass spectrometry techniques (MALDI-TOF MS). 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatographyThe 18O label is shown to be specifically, reversibly, and unequivocally located at glutamate β54. In contrast, the catalytic aspartate residue in the βE54D mutant, which acts as a hydrolyase, contained no 18O when the reaction was carried out in [18O]water. [18O]Water (purity 98%) was purchased from Promochem (Wesel, Germany). TPCK-treated trypsin (EC3.4.21.4), endoproteinase Asp-N (EC 3.4.24.33), carboxypeptidase Y (EC 3.4.16.1), and coenzyme A (trilithium salt) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of the highest available grade and were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Sigma, or Merck. Glutaconate CoA-transferases (wild type and βE54D mutant) were purified from overproducingE. coli strains as described earlier (5Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The crystallization step, however, was replaced by chromatography on Q-Sepharose. The molar concentrations of the hetero-octameric enzyme were calculated with the molecular mass of the heterodimeric subunit (65 kDa). The CoA thiol esters of acetic, glutaric, and propionic acid were prepared from the corresponding anhydrides and CoASH by the method of Simon and Shemin (11Simon E. Shemin D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The acyl-CoAs were desalted using Sep-PakTMC18 cartridges (Millipore). Ethyl acetimidate (1 mmol) was hydrolyzed for 2 h at 50 °C in 100 μl of [18O]water saturated with gaseous hydrochloric acid. Initially formed ethyl acetate was hydrolyzed in 100 μl of [18O]water adjusted to 1 m Na18OH with 3% (w/w) sodium amalgam at 50 °C for 16 h. The solution was adjusted to pH 8 with sodium hydrogen carbonate, lyophilized, and redissolved in [16O]water. The acetate concentration was determined enzymatically (12Bergmeyer H.U. Möllering H. Bergmeyer H.U. 2nd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1520-1528Google Scholar). The 18O content of the sodium acetate (99%) was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the methyl ester synthesized with diazomethane. Glutaconate CoA-transferase (10 μg/ml) was added to a mixture containing 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm glutaryl-CoA, and 1 mm sodium [18O2]acetate. Before the addition of the enzyme and after various time intervals, aliquots were taken and stopped by the addition of 1 volume of 8 mguanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7.5. The samples were applied on LiChroCART columns (4 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Merck) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The CoA derivatives were separated by a linear gradient from 10 to 20% (v/v) acetonitrile for 20 min at 20 °C and monitored at 260 nm. The eluting CoA derivatives were collected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (see below). The CoA derivatives were quantified using an internal calibration. The enzyme (2 nmol) was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm glutaryl-CoA, and 1 mm sodium [18O2]acetate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of 8 mguanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7.5, and applied to reverse-phase HPLC as described. A second sample was incubated as described and separated from low molecular mass compounds by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex-G25 column (NAP-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 100 mm [16O2]acetate. Glutaryl-CoA was added to the enzyme at a final concentration of 1 mmand incubated for another 2 min at 37 °C. Glutaconate CoA-transferase (2 nmol) was incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with 1 mm glutaryl-CoA in 200 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The reaction products were applied to reverse-phase HPLC as described below. The β-subunit of glutaconate CoA-transferase was lyophilized, redissolved in 25 μl of 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, in [18O]water, and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. The mixture was diluted to 1 ml with [16O]water, lyophilized, and reductively carboxymethylated (13Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The enzyme (2 nmol) was incubated at 37 °C in 200 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm acetyl-CoA in the presence of 50% (v/v) [18O]water for 5 (βE54D) or 240 min (wild type). The samples were applied on a Supelcosil LC-3DP column (4.6 × 250 mm, Sigma) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. CoA derivatives and enzyme subunits were eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 84% (v/v) acetonitrile within 30 min and monitored at 280 nm. Fractions were collected manually and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (see below). Molecular mass values of glutaconate CoA-transferase subunits, peptides, and coenzyme A derivatives were determined using a Voyager RP workstation (Perseptive Biosystems). Prior to the preparation of the samples, acetonitrile was removed by centrifugation in vacuo. Protein solutions (1–5 μm) were mixed 1:1 with 110 mm sinapinic acid ((E)-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 67% (v/v) acetonitrile on the sample slide and air-dried. Peptide samples (0.5–3 μm) and CoA derivatives (5–20 μm) were applied on a thin layer of indole-2-carboxylic acid prepared from a solution of 300 mmindole-2-carboxylic acid in acetone. Details of the measurements are given in the figure legends. Fractions containing the β-subunit were lyophilized, reduced with dithiothreitol, and carboxymethylated with iodoacetate (13Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Excess reagents were removed on Sephadex-G25 columns (NAP-10) equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.6, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. The protein was digested for 16 h at 37 °C by 2% (w/w) TPCK-treated trypsin. The peptides were adjusted to 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and applied on a Supelcosil LC-318 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Sigma) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed by a linear gradient from 0 to 42% (v/v) acetonitrile within 45 min. The eluting peptides were monitored at 215 nm, collected manually, and identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The tryptic peptide β6 was lyophilized, redissolved in 100 μl of 1 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Endoproteinase Asp-N (100 ng) was added, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The peptide β6A was dissolved in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.6, yielding a final concentration of approximately 10 μm. The peptide solution (2 μl) was mixed with 2 μl of carboxypeptidase Y (0.1 mg/ml) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The individual molecular mass values of the generated peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF MS (see above). The enzyme (0.77 nmol) was incubated at 25 °C in 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoate), and 200 μm acyl-CoA in either the presence or the absence of 100 mm sodium acetate. The change in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded for 10 min. The natural isotopic distribution of large molecules such as acyl-CoAs and peptides was calculated solving the binomial equation for the isotopic distribution. This calculation was aided by the isotope pattern calculator provided by the University of Sheffield (UK) at the Sheffield ChemPuter web site (http://www.shef.ac.uk/chemistry/chemputer/isotopes.html). The18O overlay was simulated by solving the binomial coefficient for different numbers of exchange sites. The distribution pattern for the enrichment of 18O is given by the general formula, 1=(a+b)nEquation 2 n=1:1=a+b(for acetyl­CoA)Equation 3 where a = 1 − b,b = 18O-enriched fraction of the total oxygen of the sample, and n = number of possible sites of oxygen exchange. Solved for different numbers of oxygen, it follows that n=2:1=a2+2ab+b2Equation 4 (for the peptide­bound carboxylate of glutamate or aspartate) n=3:1=a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3(for glutaryl­CoA)Equation 5 Within these formulas, e.g. a 2represents the unchanged component of the distribution, whereas 2ab represents the 16O/18O fraction and b 2 the 18O/18O fraction of the composite spectrum in a peptide, respectively. Hence, each term in the expression relates the contribution of a particular oxygen species to the overall distribution. Because the mass difference between 16O and 18O is 2, each term except the non-labeled fraction in the above equation requires a shift of 2 on them/z axis per exchanged oxygen. These fractional distributions are summed up to the composite distribution. The small error introduced in the natural distribution by the replacement of a relatively small number of oxygens by 18O is negligible within the experimental accuracy. The measured mass spectra were integrated, and the measured distributions were fitted to simulated stick spectra minimizing the least squares deviation between the intensities of measured and simulated distributions. These evaluations were performed using the “Solver” facilities provided by Excel 97. The experimental errors of the measurements were determined by doubling the value of χ2 for the nonlinear least square fits. The time course of the oxygen exchange was investigated with catalytic amounts (0.1 μm) of glutaconate CoA-transferase and initial concentrations of 1 mm for [18O2]acetate and glutaryl-CoA. At various time intervals, samples were subjected to HPLC analysis and subsequent MALDI-TOF MS of the CoA derivatives. As evident from the concentrations of acetyl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA (Fig.2 C), a chemical equilibrium of the reaction was reached after approximately 15 min withK eq = 0.64 ± 0.04. This value is close to 0.77, which can be calculated from the pK values of glutarate (pK 1 = 4.34) and acetate (pK = 4.75). In addition to acetyl- and glutaryl-CoA, increasing amounts of free CoA were detected by HPLC, whereas neither acetyl-CoA nor glutaryl-CoA exhibited significant rates of hydrolysis in control experiments. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the mass spectra of acetyl-CoA (Fig.2 A) and glutaryl-CoA (Fig. 2 B) showed clearly resolved single isotopic peaks. The mass spectra were integrated, and the relative signal intensities for the isotopic distribution were calculated. Alignments of these distributions to simulations allowed the determination of the18O content of the acyl-CoAs. Minimizing the least squares deviation between simulation and measured data, the 18O content of the analytes could be calculated with an experimental error of less than 4% (see insets in Fig. 2, A and B). The isotopic equilibrium, however, was reached much more slowly than the chemical equilibrium after approximately 120 min. The 18O contents at equilibrium for acetyl-CoA (45 ± 3%) and glutaryl-CoA (41 ± 3%) agreed with the calculated value of 39.4%. To analyze the incorporation of 18O into the catalytic glutamate residue βGlu-54 of glutaconate CoA-transferase, 20 μm of enzyme was incubated with 1 mm unlabeled glutaryl-CoA and 1 mm[18O2]acetate for 5 min, followed by HPLC separation (Fig. 3). The 18O label of the isolated acetyl-CoA (44 ± 3%) and glutaryl-CoA (43 ± 3%), determined by MALDI-TOF MS, indicated that an isotopic equilibrium of the oxygen atoms participating in the reaction was reached. The separated subunits of glutaconate CoA-transferase were identified by their molecular mass values obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. For the α-subunit a molecular mass of 35,573 ± 12 Da was determined in agreement with the value of 35,568 Da predicted from the sequence (Fig.4 A). For the β-subunit, a molecular mass of 29,018 ± 18 Da (theoretical 29,017 Da) was obtained. However, a second signal at m + 752 Da was found (Fig. 4 B). In incubations with glutaryl-CoA but without acceptor carboxylate, the higher molecular mass signal was the only visible one. The mass difference observed confirmed the covalent binding of a CoA-molecule to the catalytic glutamate according to the reaction scheme shown in Fig. 1. Neither the mass accuracy nor the resolution obtained in the spectra of the β-subunit was sufficient to determine 18O uptake. Hence, the protein was reduced with dithiothreitol, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. The carboxymethylation was required to obtain the βGlu-54-containing peptide in good yields. It is well established that a significant loss of Cys-containing peptides is frequently observed if no chemical modification of the thiol group is performed. The peptide containing the catalytic glutamate residue was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-318 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The monoisotopic molecular mass of that peptide (2744.6 ± 1.5 Da) was, within the experimental range of accuracy, identical to the expected mass of 2744.3 Da, but it showed a clearly visible broadening of the isotopic distribution, which was only poorly resolved (data not shown). Therefore, the peptide was digested for a second time using endoproteinase Asp-N. As shown in Fig.5, the undecapeptide containing amino acids 48-DCHIIVESGLM-58 gave well resolved mass spectra. The observed monoisotopic molecular mass of 1273.9 ± 0.5 Da was in agreement with the theoretical mass of 1274.6 Da. The natural isotopic distribution was clearly overlaid by an 18O distribution. A closer analysis of the signal distribution revealed the presence of two18O atoms with an isotopic enrichment of 31 ± 2%. This value is significantly lower than the 18O content of the acyl-CoA derivatives and can be explained by the partial hydrolysis of the enzyme-coenzyme A thiol ester intermediate in H216O. Control experiments, in which either the glutaryl-CoA or [18O2]acetate was omitted, showed within the experimental error no incorporation of18O into the undecapeptide. In another control experiment, the native 18O-labeled enzyme was separated from the excess [18O2]acetate and subsequently incubated with 100 mm unlabeled acetate and 1 mm glutaryl-CoA. Again no 18O was found in the undecapeptide (TableI).Table I18O labeling of the catalytic glutamate residue of wild-type glutaconate CoA-transferase and βE54D mutantNormalized relative signal intensities1-aThe normalized relative signal intensities were calculated from the integrated mass spectra (n = 3–5).

Open table in a new tab The enzyme was incubated as indicated, and the undecameric peptide containing the catalytic residue was isolated and analysed by MALDI-TOF MS as described in the text. The 18O uptake was calculated from the integrated mass spectra as described in the text. In addition to the peptide signals at 1274 Da, varying amounts of an oxidized form of the peptide at 1290.8 ± 1.2 Da were found. The mass difference of 16 Da suggested an oxidation of the methionine 58 to the sulfoxide. Further analysis showed that this oxidation was inevitable during the preparation of peptide samples for MALDI-TOF MS. Using a carboxyl-terminal cleavage with carboxypeptidase A and MALDI-TOF MS read-out of the peptide ladder, the C-terminal sequence VESGLM of the peptide was confirmed. The oxidation site was located on methionine 58 and the 18O label of the peptide was found in glutamate 54 (data not shown). The 18O contents in the non-oxidized and the oxidized forms of the peptide were found to be identical within the experimental accuracy. However, the isotopic distribution of the oxidized form of the peptide was always slightly disturbed by the sodium adduct of the non-oxidized peptide. As evident from Fig. 2, wild-type glutaconate CoA-transferase also catalyzed the slow hydrolysis of glutaryl-CoA. Further analysis revealed that this hydrolytic activity was significantly stimulated by 100 mm acetate (114 milliunits/mg as compared with <2 milliunits/mg, respectively), whereas the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was not further enhanced (105 milliunits/mg as compared with 98 milliunits/mg). Propionyl-CoA was hydrolyzed more slowly than acetyl-CoA, and a stimulation by 100 mm acetate was found (54 and 118 milliunits/mg, respectively) (TableII). It should be noted that the apparentK m values observed for the hydrolysis of different acyl-CoA derivatives were about 500 times lower (67–69 μm, Table II) than the apparent K mvalue for acetate (26 mm) in the CoA-transferase reaction in the presence of 100 μm glutaryl-CoA (4Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Table IIStimulation of the hydrolyase activity of wild-type glutaconate CoA-transferase by acetateAcyl-CoAControl+100 mm sodium acetateApparent K m for acetatemilliunits/mgmilliunits/mgμmWild-typeAcetyl-CoA10595Propionyl-CoA5411867Glutaryl-CoA<211469βE54D mutantGlutaryl-CoA15,000The enzyme (50 μg, 30 units/mg transferase activity) was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 200 μm acyl-CoA in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0.

Open table in a new tab The enzyme (50 μg, 30 units/mg transferase activity) was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of 200 μm acyl-CoA in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The liberation of CoASH was followed by the reaction with 1 mm Ellmann's reagent at 412 nm. In this paper we have demonstrated that a mechanism-based introduction of 18O label can be followed during several steps of analysis to the level of the labeled amino acid and that quantitative results can be obtained from the integrated spectra. These results encouraged us to investigate the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by wild-type glutaconate CoA-transferase. As expected, the chemical hydrolysis of the HPLC-purified thiol ester between βGlu-54 and CoA in H218O at pH 8.6 led to the incorporation of almost exactly 1.0 18O into the catalytic glutamate residue (47 ± 3%, Table I). By enzymatic hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA in 50% H218O catalyzed by wild-type glutaconate CoA-transferase, both the remaining acetyl-CoA (0.85 mm) and the βGlu-54 residue became equally labeled (14 ± 3% and 12 ± 3%, respectively (Table I). A glutaconate CoA-transferase, in which the catalytic glutamate has been replaced by aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis, has been shown to be a thiol ester hydrolyase rather than a coenzyme A-transferase. Although the replacement of glutamate by aspartate is predicted to generate an additional cleavage site for endoproteinase Asp-N, this new cleavage site was apparently not used under the experimental conditions. If this enzyme was incubated in the presence of either [18O2]acetate and glutaryl-CoA or glutaryl-CoA in H218O, no18O was found in the corresponding undecapeptide even after complete hydrolysis of glutaryl-CoA. In addition, the formation of an enzyme-CoA thiol ester was never observed with this enzyme. The incubation of [18O2]acetate and glutaryl-CoA in the presence of glutaconate CoA-transferase fromA. fermentans redistributed the 18O label, initially present only in acetate, among all seven of the participating oxygen atoms. Whereas the 18O content of the three oxygen atoms of glutaryl-CoA increased immediately, the decrease in the18O content of the single oxygen atom of acetyl-CoA was slightly delayed. This observation is in agreement with the statistical proposal for the exchange reaction. Initially, the reaction proceeds predominantly in the direction of acetyl-CoA formation. Hence, the initially formed acetyl-CoA is predicted to carry the same18O content as the added [18O2]acetate. Moreover, after a few catalytic cycles, the oxygen atoms of the catalytic glutamate had almost the same 18O content as the [18O2]acetate. Hence, all glutarate molecules released from glutaryl-CoA are 18O-labeled, and the reformed glutaryl-CoA contained 18O. The data demonstrate the exchange of oxygen between [18O2]acetate and glutaconate CoA-transferase as predicted by the formation of a mixed anhydride between actetate and the catalytic glutamate residue during catalysis of CoA-transfer. The observed exchange was found to require the presence of both [18O2]acetate and glutaryl-CoA and was shown to be completely reversible (Table I). The 18O label has been found to be localized on both oxygen atoms of glutamate residue 54 within the β-subunit of the enzyme, which forms the enzyme-CoA thiol ester intermediate as predicted by the mechanism outlined above (Fig.1). Only one oxygen atom of the catalytic glutamate residue became labeled with 18O by chemical hydrolysis of the isolated thiol ester between CoA and the wild-type enzyme in H218O. For the βE54D mutant of glutaconate CoA-transferase, it was proposed that because of the shortened side chain of aspartate as compared with the original glutamate residue, a water molecule might occupy the space between the aspartate and the acyl-CoA in the active center (9Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Acting as a general base, the carboxylate group of aspartate has been suggested to activate the water for hydrolysis of the thiol ester, which is in agreement with the absence of any18O in the βAsp-54 carboxylate. This result, however, cannot exclude the intermediacy of a mixed anhydride between βAsp-54 and acetate, which is specifically attacked by H218O at the acetyl carbonyl (Fig.6). Interestingly, the slow hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA in H218O catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme led to a significant 18O incorporation into the βGlu-54 carboxylate. In this case at least three mechanisms are possible that cannot be distinguished because of the subsequent much faster equilibration of the four oxygen atoms of acetate and βGlu-54 by CoA-transfer. The three mechanisms are as follows: (i) hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA by assistance of βGlu-54 carboxylate; (ii) hydrolysis of either carbonyl of the mixed anhydride; or most likely, (iii) the acetate catalyzed hydrolysis of the enzyme-thiol ester. Although the low but significant CoA-ester hydrolyase activity has been recognized much earlier (4Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), this current work shows that hydrolysis is due to an intrinsic property of the enzyme and subject to catalysis by acetate. Whereas glutaryl-CoA was not hydrolyzed (<2 milliunits/mg), hydrolyase activity was observed (114 milliunits/mg) in the presence of 100 mm acetate exhibiting an apparent K m= 69 μm acetate (Table II). Further analysis revealed that acetyl-CoA is hydrolyzed at the same rate and is not affected by the addition of acetate, whereas propionyl-CoA behaves in a manner in between acetyl- and glutaryl-CoA. The low apparentK m for acetate observed in the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA substrates is comparable with the low apparentK m-values observed in CoA-ester hydrolysis by the βE54D mutant and for the specific acetyl-CoA-dependent exchange of 1.0 3H from [2,4-3H]glutaconate with the solvent water (14Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 256-263Google Scholar). These low K m values show that the enzyme is able to bind these substrates very tightly. In all three reactions no complete CoA-transfer occurred. The unusually high K m-values in the complete CoA-transfer are in accordance with the hypothesis of White and Jencks (7White H. Jencks P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1688-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that CoA-transferases are able to convert binding energy into rate enhancement. If one adds the ∼370-fold increase inK m for acetate and the ∼170-fold increase inK m for acetyl-CoA (14Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 256-263Google Scholar), the transition state could be lowered by 27 kJ/mol. It has been shown by reduction with NaBH4 (4Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and by MALDI-TOF MS (this paper) that incubation of the CoA-transferase with glutaryl-CoA alone results in up to 100% conversion of the enzyme into the stable CoA-ester. Addition of acetate results in two reactions, CoA-transfer and hydrolysis. If hydrolysis requires a proceeding CoA-transfer, then no difference should be observed in theK m for both processes. Hence, it appears likely that acetate stimulates the hydrolysis of the enzyme CoA-ester intermediate by activating a water molecule. One of the possible two carboxylate binding sites should be large enough to accommodate water together with the general base acetate or, to a lesser extent, with propionate (Fig.7). The hydrolysis at the stage of the enzyme-CoA ester rather than acyl-CoA is in accordance with the high reactivity of the former toward NaBH4. Probably the enzyme-CoA ester is somehow distorted, which makes the carbonyl group more accessible for nucleophiles. In E. coli 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II (DNA glycosidase, AlkA) the catalytic aspartate residue 238 of the enzyme was proposed to activate a water molecule for hydrolysis of theN-glycosidic bond of the substrate (15Labahn J. Schärer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In agreement with this mechanism, it was found that the exchange D238N by mutagenesis completely abolished the hydrolyase activity of the protein. The same holds true for the mutants of glutaconate CoA-transferase (9Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Mack M. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whereas the βE54Q mutant is slowly converted to the active wild-type CoA-transferase in the presence of both substrates, no reactivation to a hydrolyase was found for the βE54N mutant. In a mechanism-based reactivation of the βE54Q mutant, the substrate carboxylate,e.g. glutaconate, may slowly form a mixed anhydride with the glutamine residue, and ammonia is formed. The anhydride is further hydrolyzed or more likely aminolyzed, yielding the active, glutamate β54-containing enzyme. In contrast, the βE54N mutant is not converted to the hydrolyase in a similar, mechanism-based fashion, probably because the anhydride between the aspartate and the glutaconate residue cannot be formed due to a gap between the asparagine β54 and the enzyme-bound dicarboxylate. The following lines of evidence support the activation of a water molecule for hydrolysis of acyl-CoA by the βE54D mutant of glutaconate CoA-transferase rather than formation of a mixed anhydride intermediate: 1) no 18O incorporation from H218O or [18O2]acetate was found for the βE54D mutant enzyme in the presence or absence of acyl-CoA; 2) no reactivation to a hydrolyase activity was found for the βE54N mutant, whereas the βE54Q mutant could be reactivated to the active wild-type enzyme in the presence of substrates; and 3) a specific acyl-CoA hydrolyase activity with acetate as cofactor was found for the wild-type enzyme. Taking all of these findings together, it appears far more likely that the carboxyl group of aspartate can act as a general base in the activation of a water molecule, allowing the direct hydrolysis of the acyl-CoA substrate rather than the intermediate formation of a mixed anhydride, which is further hydrolyzed.

The activity was low or undetectable at most phases of the cell cycle but showed a marked increase at early S phase. The induction of telomerase activity was not affected by the S phase blockers aphidicolin (which inhibits DNA polymerase α) or hydroxyurea (which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase), but it was prevented by olomoucine, an inhibitor of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinases that blocks G1-S cell cycle transition. These results suggest that the induction of telomerase activity is not directly coupled to DNA replication by conventional DNA polymerases, but rather is triggered by the entry of cells into S phase. Various analogs of the plant hormone auxin, including indole-3-acetic acid, α-naphthaleneacetic acid, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, potentiated the increase in telomerase activity at early S phase; the growth-inactive analog 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, however, had no such effect. Potentiation by indole-3-acetic acid of the induction of telomerase activity was dose dependent. Together, these data indicate that telomerase activity in tobacco cells is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and that the increase in activity at S phase is specifically inducible by auxin.

Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes present at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes that preserve chromosomal integrity and are essential for genomic stability and function. The telomeric DNA in most eukaryotes, including fungi, ciliates, plants, and mammals, consists of tandem arrays of short G-rich repeats (typically, six to eight nucleotides) that are markedly conserved throughout evolution (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar). Although telomeres in normal vertebrate somatic cells shorten progressively at a rate of 50 to 200 base pairs per cell division, because of the inability of conventional DNA polymerases to replicate 3′-terminal sequences, telomere length is maintained in unicellular eukaryotes, germline cells of multicellular organisms, and many human cancer cells (2Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The primary mechanism for generating and maintaining chromosome ends relies on the action of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that contains a specialized reverse transcriptase subunit and which catalyzes the addition of telomeric repetitive sequence to the chromosome ends with a segment of its integral RNA component serving as a template (3Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 4Lingner J. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that the expression of telomerase activity is closely related to processes of development and differentiation. Telomerase activity in immortal cells has been shown to be down-regulated in response to the induction of phenotypic differentiation (5Sharma H.W. Sokoloski J.A. Perez J.R. Maltese J.Y. Sartorelli A.C. Stein C.A. Nichols G. Khaled Z. Telang N.T. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12343-12346Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Savoysky E. Yoshida K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10827-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Recent molecular analysis of a human telomerase reverse transcriptase showed that its expression is down-regulated in response to an inducer of differentiation (8Ramakrishnan S. Eppenberger U. Mueller H. Shinkai Y. Narayanan R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 622-625PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of telomerase in normal human T lymphocytes is also both developmentally regulated and induced by cell activation (9Weng N.P. Levine B.L. June C.H. Hodes R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, human telomerase activity during embryogenesis is regulated by transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene and alternative splicing of its transcript (10Ulaner G.A. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar). Both telomere replication and telomerase activity are also regulated according to the cell cycle (11Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar,12Zhu X. Kumar R. Mandal M. Sharma N. Sharma H.W. Dhingra U. Sokoloski J.A. Hsiao R. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6091-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity increases in association with both cytokine-induced proliferation and cell cycle activation induced by antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes (13Yamada O. Motoji T. Mizoguchi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Buchkovich K.J. Greider C.W. Mol. Biol.

Furthermore, telomerase induction has been linked to signal transduction by protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; 2,4-DCPA, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; 2,4-DCPA, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid during T cell activation (17Bodnar A.G. Kim N.W. Effros R.B. Chiu C.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast to telomerases in yeast, ciliates, and mammals, which have been extensively studied, limited information is available on plant telomerases; in particular, the components of the plant enzyme remain uncharacterized at the molecular level. Chromosome ends in most plant species comprise tandem repeats of the heptanucleotide 5′-TTTAGGG-3′ (18Richards E.J. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 19Fajkus J. Kovarik A. Kralovics R. Bezdek M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity that exhibits conserved characteristics of the enzyme has been detected in various plant species and shown to be abundant in meristematic tissues, developing tissues such as embryos and anthers, and undifferentiated cells in suspension culture; activity was low or undetectable in differentiated tissues of mature plants (20Heller K. Kilian A. Piatyszek M.A. Kleinhofs A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Fajkus J. Kovarik A. Kralovics R.

A. 1996; 93: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, more detailed analyses of telomerase activity and telomere length in various plant tissues have shown them to be precisely regulated during ontogeny (23Killan A. Heller K. Kleinhofs A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Riha K. Fajkus J. Siroky J. Vyskot B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the expression of telomerase might be linked to cellular proliferation capacity; however, little is known of the expression of plant telomerase during the cell cycle or of its regulation. Suspension cultures of tobacco BY-2 cells have proved valuable for various studies on the plant cell division cycle because they can be highly synchronized (25Qian D. Zhou D. Ju R. Cramer C.L. Yang Z. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2381-2394PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mitsui H. Hasezawa S. Nagata T. Takahashi H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BY-2 cells have also been shown to possess a high level of telomerase activity (21Fajkus J. Kovarik A. Kralovics R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have now shown that expression of telomerase activity in synchronized BY-2 cells is largely restricted to early S phase, indicating cell cycle-dependent regulation, and that expression is triggered on entry into S phase from G1. Tobacco telomerase activity was also shown to be inducible by the phytohormone auxin, which promotes cell cycle progression. Suspension cultures of tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. bright yellow-2) cells were maintained on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 27 °C in 100 ml of Murashige-Skoog salt medium (27Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53695) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5 mg/liter of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-DCPA) (Wako, Osaka, Japan). For auxin treatment of BY-2 cells, 2,4-DCPA, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (Sigma), α-naphthaleneacetic acid (Wako), and the growth-inactive 2,4-DCPA analog 2,3-DCPA (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) were dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 mm and added separately to cultures at a final concentration of 1 μm, unless indicated otherwise. Cells cultured for 7 days, most of which had ceased to proliferate, were subjected to synchronization. A portion (10 ml) of the suspension culture was transferred to 90 ml of fresh Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml 2,4-DCPA and 0.4 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma). The cells were incubated for 24 h, washed three times with 200 ml of ice-cold 3% (w/v) sucrose, incubated for 4 h in 100 ml of fresh Murashige-Skoog medium, and, after the addition of 70 μl of 6 mm propyzamide (Sigma) (final concentration, 4.8 μm), incubated for an additional 4 h. The cells were washed with sucrose solution and then resuspended in 100 ml of fresh Murashige-Skoog medium for analyses. A portion (1 ml) of the culture was sampled every 2 h and the total cell number counted. For determination of the cell division index (the number of mitotic cells as a fraction of the total number of cells), cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) and the number of dividing cells was counted under a fluorescence microscope. The cell cycle blockers aphidicolin, propyzamide, and olomoucine (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at concentrations of 15, 6, and 10 mm, respectively, and used at final concentrations of 15, 6, and 30 μm, respectively. Hydroxyurea (Sigma) was added directly to cultures at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. For monitoring of DNA synthesis, a 30 mm aqueous stock solution of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 30 μm to synchronized cell cultures immediately after their release from M phase arrest by propyzamide. During cell cycle progression, 1 ml of culture was sampled every 2 h. The cells in each sample were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol and then homogenized with a cell scraper in a solution containing 1% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone. DNA was isolated from the homogenate by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. After their adjustment to a concentration of 100 μg/ml, 10 μl of each DNA sample were spotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and the DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to ultraviolet light. The incorporation of BrdUrd into newly synthesized DNA was quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on a mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd (Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples (50 μl) of cell cultures (104 to 105 cells/ml) were mixed with 450 μl of an ice-cold solution containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 μl of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm4-(aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS detergent, and 10% glycerol, and were homogenized with a plastic cell scraper in an Eppendorf tube. The resulting cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant (cell extract) was either used immediately for assay of telomerase activity or stored first at −80 °C. The protein concentration of the cell extract was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Telomerase activity in cell extracts was assayed with the polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) as described previously (28Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6539) Google Scholar), but with minor modifications. The TS21 primer (5′-GACAATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′) and the 5′-digoxigenin-labeled antisense telomeric repeat primer DPTR (5′-(AAACCCT)4-3′) were used as forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, respectively; both were obtained from Nippon Gene Research Lab (Miyagi, Japan). For TRAP assays, 2 μl of cell extract were incubated for 20 min at 24 °C with 38 μl of elongation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 63 mm KCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, T4G32 protein (0.125 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml)) containing 0.1 μg of TS21 primer. As a control, RNase A (0.5 μg) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been rendered free of DNase activity by preheating at 90 °C for 10 min, was added to the elongation reaction mixture in order to confirm the specific telomerase activity that is abolished by degrading RNA component of the enzyme. Elongation was terminated by heating the reaction mixture at 95 °C for 10 min. Ten microliters of polymerase chain reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.2 units of rTaq DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan)) containing 0.01 μg of DPTR primer were then added to 10 μl of the elongation mixture at 95 °C, so that the polymerase chain reaction was initiated under “hot-start” conditions. After initial incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, polymerase chain reaction was performed for 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The amplification products were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane with the use of a semidry electroblotting apparatus (Biocraft, Tokyo, Japan), and detected with the use of a chemiluminescent digoxigenin detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Ladders of DNA bands on x-ray film were scanned with a Scanning Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and band intensity was quantitated with the use of ImagequaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). To quantitate the telomerase activity in BY-2 cells and to standardize comparisons of activity among samples, we performed TRAP assays with various dilutions of cell extracts. Telomerase activity was highest when the assay was performed with 0.5 μg of extract protein (Fig.1). It decreased approximately in accordance with the dilution factor as the amount of extract protein was reduced below 0.5 μg; however, activity also decreased as the amount of extract protein was increased above 0.5 μg, possibly due to the presence in the cell extract of an inhibitor of telomerase or of the Taq DNA polymerase used in the assay. We therefore used 0.2 μg of extract protein for all subsequent TRAP assays. BY-2 cells were synchronized by consecutive exposure to aphidicolin and propyzamide, after which total cell number, cell division index (Fig.2 A), DNA synthesis (Fig.2 B), and telomerase activity (Fig. 2, C andD) were monitored. The coordinated time courses of total cell number, cell division index, and DNA synthesis after release from propyzamide-induced M phase arrest indicated that the cells were highly synchronized for at least 14 h. The maximal cell division index during this period was approximately 0.7 at 4 h after release from propyzamide block. The telomerase activity of cell extracts was maximal 8 h after release from M phase arrest, a time corresponding to early S phase; activity was low or undetectable at other phases of the cell cycle, with the exception of the intermediate level apparent immediately after removal of propyzamide. These data thus indicated that tobacco telomerase activity is regulated according to the phase of the cell cycle. To investigate whether the increase in tobacco telomerase activity at early S phase is directly coupled with DNA replication, we examined the effects of S phase blockers on telomerase activity in synchronous BY-2 cells. Despite the complete inhibition of DNA synthesis, cells treated with aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase α, showed a time course of telomerase activity similar to that apparent with untreated cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Likewise, treatment of cells with hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, did not affect the pattern of telomerase activity (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that the above two inhibitors of S phase progression do not block the increase in telomerase activity. In contrast, exposure of cells to olomoucine, an inhibitor of the Cdc2/Cdk2 cyclin-dependent kinases that blocks the transition from G1 to S phase, almost completely inhibited the induction of telomerase activity normally apparent 8 h after release from M phase block (Fig.3 D). These results suggest that the induction of telomerase activity at early S phase is not directly linked to DNA synthesis by conventional DNA polymerase. Most plant life processes, including growth, development, differentiation, and senescence are modulated by hormones (29Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The plant hormone auxin induces cell proliferation and is thought to be required both for the G1-S phase transition in the cell cycle and for initiation of DNA replication. Preliminary experiments revealed that addition of the natural auxin IAA to asynchronous BY-2 cells resulted in a rapid but small increase in telomerase activity (data not shown). We therefore examined the effect of IAA on telomerase activity in synchronous BY-2 cells. IAA was added to the cell culture at a concentration of 1 μm 7 h after the release from propyzamide-induced M phase arrest, a time corresponding to 1 h before the increase in telomerase activity (Fig. 2). Telomerase activity was measured every hour after the addition of IAA. The maximal telomerase activity apparent 1 h after the addition of IAA was about three times that of untreated cells (Fig.4, A and B). When olomoucine was added to the cells, the increase with IAA treatment was largely abolished (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the tobacco telomerase activity with IAA is inducible depending on Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase activity. Meanwhile, a cytokinin class phytohormone, 6-benzylaminopurine, which is also known to induce cell division was also tested; however, it showed no significant effect on the telomerase activity (data not shown). Synthetic auxins structurally distinct from IAA, including both biologically active and inactive forms, have been synthesized (30Hicks C. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1375: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether the induction of telomerase activity by IAA at S phase requires typical auxin activity, we investigated the effects of various synthetic auxins. Like IAA, both 2,4-DCPA and α-naphthaleneacetic acid at a concentration of 1 μm also increased by 2–3-fold the telomerase activity of cells at S phase (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, 2,3-DCPA, a growth-inactive analog of 2,4-DCPA, did not increase telomerase activity. We also demonstrated that the effect of IAA on telomerase activity was dose dependent (Fig. 5 B); the effect was apparent at IAA concentrations of 1 and 10 μmbut not at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, or 100 μm. This observation is consistent with previous results showing that IAA is biologically active at concentrations between 1 and 10 μm(31Blatt M.R. Thiel G. Plant J. 1994; 5: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Abel S. Nguyen M.D. Chow W. Theologis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19093-19099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of telomerase activity at early S phase appears to be a specific biological effect of auxin. We have shown that telomerase activity in synchronized BY-2 cells is specifically induced during early S phase of the cell cycle. Similar results have been obtained with various organisms and cell lines, including primary human epithelial cells (33Kunimura C. Kikuchi K. Ahmed N. Shimizu A. Yasumoto S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), synchronized Chinese hamster ovary cells (34Kruk P.A. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and certain tumor cell lines (17Bodnar A.G. Kim N.W. Effros R.B. Chiu C.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Fajkus J. Kovarik A. Kralovics R. Bezdek M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), as well as for the induction of telomerase RNA transcription in budding yeast (35Chapon C. Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 1337-1351PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a naturally synchronized culture ofPhysarum plasmodia exhibited maximal telomerase activity during late S phase, immediately before the completion of DNA replication (36Shimada Y. Nakano M. Kanda N. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kim J.K. Ide T. Murofushi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our data also revealed that BY-2 cells exhibited an intermediate level of telomerase activity immediately after release from M phase arrest. This latter observation may result from an increase in telomerase activity induced by washing or subculturing of the cells or it might reflect induction of activity at M phase; telomerase is active in extracts of Xenopus laevis germline cells in both S and M phases of the cell cycle (37Mantell L.L. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, these various studies indicate that regulation of telomerase activity during the cell cycle represents a conserved mechanism for maintaining telomere length. Exposure of synchronous BY-2 cells to aphidicolin, an inhibitior of DNA polymerase α, did not block the induction of telomerase activity at S phase. Telomerase induction during T cell activation also occurs in the presence of aphidicolin (17Bodnar A.G. Kim N.W. Effros R.B. Chiu C.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), indicating that DNA synthesis is not required for this effect. In the ciliate Euplotes, aphidicolin treatment resulted in a general lengthening of the G strands by telomerase and a marked increase in C strand heterogeneity (38Fan X. Price C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that the synthesis of G strands per se was not affected by aphidicolin. The S phase-specific expression of tobacco telomerase activity also was not blocked by hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. Similarly, hydroxyurea did not inhibit telomerase activation or Cdk2 kinase activity in normal human T cells (14Buchkovich K.J. Greider C.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, methotrexate and 5′-fluorouracil, both of which arrest cells at S phase, did not inhibit telomerase activity in human cancer cells (39Ku W.C. Cheng A.J. Wang T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conversely, gradual telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase does not immediately affect cell cycle progression (40Buchkovich K.J. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting that telomerase activity is not directly coupled to DNA replication. Our data indicate that telomerase activation at S phase is not linked directly to DNA replication by conventional DNA polymerases. Olomoucine, an inhibitor of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinases that blocks plant cells at the G1-S cell cycle transition, prevented the induction of telomerase activity in synchronous BY-2 cells, suggesting that Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase activity is necessary for both expression of telomerase activity and entry into S phase. Two inhibitors of PKC, bisindolylmaleimide and H-7, were shown to inhibit telomerase activity in human nasopharyngeal cancer cells (39Ku W.C. Cheng A.J. Wang T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of PKC with bisindolylmaleimide prevented the increase in telomerase activity associated with activation of human T cells (17Bodnar A.G. Kim N.W. Effros R.B. Chiu C.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), indicating that the induction of telomerase activity is linked to signal transduction by PKC in these cells. PKC contributes to the regulation of Cdc2 activity (41Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is thought to play an important signaling role, similar to that of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, in cell proliferation (42VanRenterghem B. Browning M.D. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the PKC-Cdk signaling pathway contributes to the cell cycle-dependent regulation of telomerase activity. The phytohormone auxin augmented the induction of telomerase activity at S phase in synchronous BY-2 cells. Auxin is a key regulator of growth and development throughout the plant life cycle. Exogenous auxin can affect rates of cell division and cell elongation, and can trigger specific differentiation. Recent molecular and genetic studies of the mechanism of auxin action have shown that the hormone exerts a rapid effect on several cellular processes through a specific signal transduction pathway (43Leyser O. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R305-R307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, studies on the activation of cell division in various tissues, organs, and cell culture systems have demonstrated that Cdk expression and activity are linked to auxin signaling (44Hirt H. Pay A. Gyorgyey J. Bako L. Nemeth K. Bogre L. Schweyen R.J. Heberle-Bors E. Dudits D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, auxin promotes cell division, which is mediated by activation of Cdc2, a key regulatory component in cell cycle control (45Miao G.H. Hong Z. Verma D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our observations that auxin promotes and olomoucine inhibits induction of telomerase activity in BY-2 cells suggest that telomerase is a downstream target of the auxin signaling pathway that controls cell cycle progression (Fig. 6). The pattern of auxin distribution in plants mirrors that of developing tissues and of undifferentiated cells with a high proliferation capacity. Many responses to endogenous auxin depend on the redistribution or polar transport of the hormone to tissues such as meristem, shoot apex, plumule, and immature seeds. The auxin distribution pattern also closely matches the spatial expression pattern of Cdc2, which is important for meristem activity and cell proliferation during plant development (46Martinez M.C. Jorgensen J.-E. Lawton M.A. Lamb C.J. Doerner P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 47Hermerly A.S. Ferreira P. Engler J.D. van Montagu M. Engler G. Inze D. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1711-1723PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of an Arabidopsis cyclin gene, CYC1At, that is induced by auxin has been shown to be restricted almost exclusively to dividing cells in root and shoot apical meristems (48Ferreira P.C. Hemerly A.S. Engler J.D. van Montagu M. Engler G. Inze D. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with the localized expression of the Cdc2 gene, telomerase activity is higher in immature embryos and meristematic tissues than in other tissues 2K. Tamura, H. Liu, and H. Takahashi, unpublished data. (20Heller K. Kilian A. Piatyszek M.A. Kleinhofs A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Fitzgerald M.S. McKnight T.D. Shippen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Killan A. Heller K. Kleinhofs A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the length of telomeres in barley tissues decreases during differentiation, but it is increased in undifferentiated callus tissue (49Kilian A. Stiff C. Kleinhofs A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9555-9559Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that telomerase activity is induced at early S phase in tobacco cells. This effect was promoted by auxin and appeared to require Cdc2/Cdk2 activity. Thus, regulation of telomerase activity by auxin is likely related to the control of cell proliferation by this hormone.

Although plasma fibronectin (FN) is a key component of the clot, its role in clot retraction is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that the incorporation of FN into fibrin matrices significantly improves clot retraction by nucleated cells expressing the integrin α5β1. Further, we show that FN-fibrin clots support increased cell spreading when compared with fibrin matrices. To determine the structural requirements for FN in this process, recombinant FN monomers deficient in ligand binding or fibrin cross-linking were incorporated into fibrin clots. We show that recombinant FN monomers support clot retraction by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the integrin α5β1. This process depends on both the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and the synergy cell-binding sites and on covalent FN-fibrin binding, demonstrating that cross-linking within the clot is important for cell-FN interactions. These data show that α5β1 can bind to FN within a clot to promote clot retraction and support cell shape change.

This provides strong evidence that α5β1-FN interactions may contribute to the cellular events required for wound contraction. Following tissue injury or inflammation, the formation of a provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FN, fibronectin; recFN, recombinant fibronectin; recFNM, recFN monomer; FCS, fetal calf serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary from extravasated plasma proteins plays a critical role both in hemostasis and wound repair (1Clark R.A.F.

The principle protein components of this “injury-associated” matrix are fibrin and plasma fibronectin (FN), and in a variety of wound healing events that have been studied, the proteins are deposited together to provide a substrate for cell adhesion and migration (3$$Google Scholar). The incorporation of FN into the clot markedly enhances cell attachment to the fibrin matrix (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Knox P. Crooks S. Rimmer C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Greiling D. Clark R.A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 861-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, FN is the essential component of plasma clots that facilitates fibroblast migration in vitro (5Knox P. Crooks S. Rimmer C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, it appears to provide a conduit for cell movement from collagen gels into fibrin-rich matrices (6Greiling D. Clark R.A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 861-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effective cell interaction with FN-fibrin matrices is dependent upon the formation of covalent cross-links between FN and fibrin molecules that are catalyzed by activated factor XIII (7Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 16: 6614-6621Google Scholar, 8Keski-Oja J. Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Cell. 1976; 9: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For example, Grinnell et al. (9Grinnell F. Feld M. Minter D. Cell. 1980; 19: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) showed that baby hamster kidney cells required FN and factor XIII for adhesion on fibrin substrates. More recently, using recombinant FN (recFN) molecules that could not be cross-linked to fibrin, we have demonstrated a 50% decrease in cell attachment and spreading on mutant recFN-fibrin matrices when compared with wild type (10Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data indicate that cross-linking may affect interactions between the adhesive sites of FN and integrin cell surface receptors. Integrins are the principle mediators of cell interactions with the ECM (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 12Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). They are noncovalently linked heterodimers composed of one α and one β subunit that together determine ligand binding specificity. Evidence suggests that integrins functionally link ECM molecules and cytoskeletal proteins (13Wang N.J. Butler P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 14Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horowitz A.F. J.

A. 1997; 94: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). This allows for the transmission of force by cells to anchorage sites, leading to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and matrix remodeling (15Maniotis A.J. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Traction forces generated by nucleated cells can deform three-dimensional matrices composed of collagen or fibrin (16Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Rosenfeldt H. Lee D.J. Grinnell F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22080-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The stable exertion of physical force required for gel contraction is dependent on the integrin α subunit and is presumed to reflect the strength of linkages between the integrin cytoplasmic tail and cytoskeletal components (19Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen et al. (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared the capacities of two β3 integrins to mediate fibrin gel retraction by nucleated cells. They demonstrated that αvβ3 but not αIIbβ3 could spontaneously support this process. Similarly, αvβ3 has been shown to induce fibrin clot retraction by a human melanoma cell line (21Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1785-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The integrin α5β1 has also been described as a receptor for fibrin clot retraction (22Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although FN is a ligand for both αvβ3 and α5β1, a role for FN in clot retraction has not been described. In the present work, we demonstrate that FN enhances retraction of fibrin matrices by nucleated cells and that this effect is mediated by the integrin α5β1. Further, we show that FN-fibrin clots support increased cell spreading when compared with fibrin matrices. Finally, we define some of the structural requirements for FN in the process of clot retraction. These data provide strong evidence that in a three-dimensional clot matrix, the engagement of the integrin α5β1 with FN promotes post-receptor occupancy events that include clot retraction and cell shape change. This suggests that α5β1-FN interactions may play an important role in the early events required for wound remodeling. CHO K1 cells transfected with a cDNA to the human α5 integrin subunit have been previously described (CHO-α5; Ref. 23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These cells express endogenous α5β1 but do not have β3. CHO K1 cells transfected with a cDNA to the human β3 integrin subunit (CHO-αvβ3; Ref. 24Wu C. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. McDonald J.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from M. H. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute). CHO B2 cells were kindly provided by Y. Takada (Scripps Research Institute). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mmglutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 μg/ml Geneticin (CHO-α5 cells only) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone Laboratories). For culture in three-dimensional matrices, cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.13 m NaCl at 1 × 107 cells/ml. BTI-TN-5B1–4 (High Five) insect cell line (Invitrogen Co.) was maintained in TNM-FH (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS. For purification of recombinant protein, High Five cells were grown in Express Five (Life Technologies, Inc.) serum-free medium supplemented with 18 mml-glutamine. Construction of recombinant FN monomers (recFNM) was performed in the baculovirus vector pVL1393. Construction of recFNM(WT) and recFNM(Q3) have been previously described (10Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To construct recFNM(RGD+), a termination codon was generated by adding an XbaI linker to a StuI site located at position 6860 in the FNΔIII1–7 cDNA (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and this fragment was inserted between the BamHI and XbaI sites in pVL1393. To construct recFNM(RGD−), a RsrII-SacI fragment of a full-length FN(RGD−) (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was inserted into recFNM(RGD+). To generate recFNM, a V0 alternatively spliced variant of recFNM(RGD+), aSacI-XbaI fragment of rat cDNA III8–15V0 (25Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into aSacI-XbaI digest of recFNM(RGD+). For recFNM(syn+) and (syn−), termination codons were added to the StuI sites of full-length wild type FN and FN(syn−), respectively (26Sechler J.L. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Constructions were confirmed by restriction digests. Recombinant protein production was performed as described previously (10Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Lyophilized human fibrinogen (98.8% clottable, American Diagnostica) and bovine thrombin were reconstituted as described previously (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous human plasma FN contaminating the fibrinogen was removed by batch incubation with gelatin-agarose (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with an anti-human FN monoclonal antibody was used to monitor the efficiency of FN depletion as previously reported (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residual FN was estimated at less than 150 ng of FN/mg of fibrinogen (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the cross-linking efficiency of the recFNsversus pFN, the clotting reactions were composed of the following components mixed in a 10:1 physiologic ratio of fibrinogen to FN: fibrinogen 600 μg/ml, pFN/recFN 60 μg/ml, thrombin 2 units/ml, 0.02 m CaCl2, 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.13 m NaCl. Human coagulation factor XIII (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) was added at 6 μg/ml, and the cross-linked products were analyzed as previously reported. 24-well tissue culture dishes were coated with 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. To prepare fibrin or FN-fibrin clots for retraction assays, the clotting components as described above were mixed in a volume of 0.5 ml at room temperature. CHO-αvβ3 (4 × 106/ml) or CHO-α5β1 (2 × 106/ml) cells in 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.13m NaCl were then added to clot components, quickly followed by thrombin. After the addition of thrombin, the mixture was rapidly pipetted into 24-well tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C. Aprotinin was added to this system to inhibit fibrinolysis. After 30 min of incubation, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FN-depleted FCS was added to the dishes. The clots were then carefully detached from the dishes using a dissecting microscope. Clot retraction was visualized and measured over a 4-h time period using a ruler. The area of the clot was calculated, and the percentage of clot retraction was determined relative to the starting area using the following formula: % retraction = (starting area − measured area)/starting area × 100. Cells in three-dimensional matrices were examined using inverted phase contrast optics. Photographic images were captured using an NEC video camera (NEC Corp.) connected to a Macintosh 7100/80 computer equipped with a Scion LG3 image capture board (Scion Corp). The retraction of fibrin matrices by nucleated cells is primarily mediated by the integrin αvβ3 (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1785-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because plasma FN is also a ligand for αvβ3, we sought to determine whether the incorporation of FN into fibrin matrices would affect the ability of cells to retract these matrices. CHO K1 cell transfectants expressing αvβ3(CHO-αvβ3) retract fibrin clots (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, the extent of retraction of FN-fibrin matrices when compared with fibrin matrices was significantly greater at all time points ranging from 30 min to 4 h (p < .002 at 4 h, Student's unpairedt test). Clot retraction was dependent on cell number as has been demonstrated by others (data not shown). The ability of cells to exert physical force on three-dimensional substrates has been correlated with cell shape change. For example, cells that have increased capacity to contract collagen matrices display an increased number of cell processes when placed into these gels (19Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To determine whether CHO-αvβ3cells display changes in morphology when cultured in FN-fibrin matrices, cells were seeded in fibrin or FN-fibrin gels and maintained in culture at 37 °C. After 18 h, there was a marked increase in the number of spread cells in the FN-fibrin matrices (Fig.1 B). When clot retraction was measured at 18 h, a significant difference between FN-fibrin and fibrin matrices was observed, comparable with the short time course experiments (data not shown). The addition of FN to fibrin matrices increases the extent of clot retraction by CHO-αvβ3 cells. One possible explanation for this is that FN-αvβ3 interactions promote clot retraction. To investigate the contribution of αvβ3 to retraction of FN-fibrin matrices, CHO-αvβ3 cells were incubated with a cyclic RGD peptide inhibitor that is specific for αvβ3 at low concentrations (27Pfaff M. Tangemann K. Muller B. Gurrath M. Muller G. Kessler H. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20233-20238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the peptide inhibitor rather than function blocking antibodies because others have shown antibodies to be less effective in this context (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effective concentrations of the inhibitor were determined through cell adhesion assays. The peptide at 1 μm blocked CHO-αvβ3 adhesion to fibrin- or fibrinogen-coated dishes while allowing adherence to FN-coated wells (data not shown). CHO-αvβ3 cells in suspension were then incubated in the presence or absence of the peptide inhibitor (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to culture in fibrin matrices. When compared with untreated cells, the presence of the cyclic RGD peptide inhibited clot retraction by an average of 50% (Fig. 2 A). However, when the CHO-αvβ3 cells were cultured in FN-fibrin matrices, there were no significant differences in clot retraction in the presence or absence of the inhibitor (Fig.2 B). These data strongly suggest that another integrin receptor may have a role in FN-mediated clot retraction. CHO-αvβ3 cells also express endogenous α5β1, a major FN integrin receptor. To determine whether the integrin α5β1 may be involved in the retraction of FN-fibrin matrices, cells were preincubated with the hamster-specific anti-α5β1 antibody PB-1 and then cultured in fibrin or FN-fibrin gels as described above. Fig. 2 Bdemonstrates that incubation with PB-1 decreases the retraction of FN-fibrin matrices by CHO-αvβ3 cells when compared with untreated or cyclic RGD peptide-treated cells. When both the cyclic RGD inhibitor and the PB-1 antibody were present, significant inhibition of clot retraction was achieved for both fibrin and FN-fibrin matrices. These data indicate that nucleated cells can use the α5β1 integrin to promote the retraction of FN-fibrin matrices. To establish a role for α5β1in FN-mediated clot retraction by nucleated cells, CHO K1 cells expressing the human integrin α5 subunit were used (CHO-α5). These cells have the specific advantage of producing little endogenous FN when compared with the parent cells (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CHO-α5 cells were cultured in fibrin or FN-fibrin matrices as described above. CHO-α5 cell retraction of FN-fibrin clots was significantly greater than retraction of fibrin clots (Fig. 3, p ≤ .0001 at 4 h; Student's unpaired t test). The extent of retraction was dependent on the concentration of FN. No increase in CHO-α5 cell retraction of fibrin clots was observed when added FN was less than 1.0 μg/ml. CHO B2 cells that do not express the α5 integrin subunit do not retract fibrin or FN-fibrin matrices (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the addition of FN to the fibrin clot markedly improves α5β1-mediated generation of tractional forces. Engagement of the α5β1 integrin receptor leads to “post-receptor occupancy” events that have been well described in two-dimensional culture systems (28Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 29Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These include cell spreading and intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation (30Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, the cellular events following α5β1ligation of FN in a three-dimensional culture system have not been described. To examine cell morphology, CHO-α5 cells were seeded in fibrin or FN-fibrin gels and observed in culture at 37 °C. By 18 h, it was evident that the incorporation of plasma FN into the fibrin matrix significantly improved cell spreading (Fig.4). CHO-α5 cells cultured in FN-fibrin matrices displayed a unique, bipolar cell morphology, whereas those in fibrin matrices remained rounded. Further, CHO-α5 cell retraction of FN-fibrin matrices at 18 h remained significantly greater than retraction of fibrin matrices (data not shown). The α5β1 integrin receptor is the primary FN receptor required for the assembly of FN into a fibrillar matrix. Matrix assembly is a process that requires that the FN molecule be in a dimeric form (31Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In a clot, dimeric plasma FN is incorporated into the fibrin matrix. To determine whether the dimer structure is required for FN-mediated clot retraction, CHO-α5 cells were cultured in clots formed from fibrin and plasma FN or a recFNM. As indicated in Fig. 3, the dimeric form of FN is not a requirement for clot retraction. Our previous work suggests that the covalent incorporation of FN into a fibrin matrix may affect the availability or conformation of integrin-binding sites (4Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand requirements for α5β1-FN interactions have been well described in a two-dimensional system and include the RGD sequence in repeat III10 and the synergy site in repeat III9 (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 12Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 32Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 113-364Crossref Google Scholar, 33Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ramos J.W. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The engagement of both sites by the α5β1 integrin receptor is a requirement for full cell adhesion and spreading. To determine the role of these sites in α5β1-FN interactions in a three-dimensional system, recFN molecules were expressed that contained either a deletion (RGD−) or mutation (syn−) in the important ligand-binding regions. Functional analyses of recFNMpolypeptides and equivalent wild type recombinant proteins were performed by assaying clot retraction. In these experiments, CHO-α5 retraction of fibrin matrices served as the negative control, and this background value for clot retraction was subtracted at each time point. When CHO-α5 cells were cultured in FN-fibrin matrices containing recFNM (RGD−), clot retraction was decreased by 90% when compared with the wild type recFNM(RGD+) (Fig.5 A). These data demonstrate that the increase in CHO-α5 retraction of FN-fibrin matrices when compared with fibrin matrices is mediated by cell binding to FN. Although CHO-α5 cell retraction of recFNM(syn−)-fibrin matrices was significantly less than wild type recFNM(syn+) at all time points (Fig.5 B), there was still measurable clot retraction. These data suggest that α5β1 engagement of the RGD site can partially support the development of tension by cells that use the α5β1 receptor but that full clot retraction requires the synergy site. Cross-linking of FN to fibrin is required for efficient cell attachment to FN-fibrin matrices (9Grinnell F. Feld M. Minter D. Cell. 1980; 19: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 10Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether cross-linking is also required for α5β1-mediated clot retraction, fibrin clots containing CHO-α5 cells were prepared with either a wild type FN or a mutant recFN lacking the amino-terminal glutamine residues (Gln3, Gln4, and Gln16) that are important for covalent FN-fibrin interactions (10Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CHO-α5 retraction of fibrin matrices served as the negative control, and this value was subtracted at each time point. Cells cultured in clots composed of the cross-linking-deficient recFNM(Q3) were significantly less efficient in retracting the clot matrices despite the presence of the appropriate ligand-binding site (Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that covalent cross-linking of FN to fibrin is required for the maximal promotion of force generation by CHO-α5 cells within the clot. In this report, we have examined whether the covalent incorporation of FN into three-dimensional fibrin clots influences the retraction of these clots by nucleated cells. We demonstrate that FN enhances the retraction of fibrin clots by nucleated cells and that this effect is mediated by the integrin α5β1. Further, we show that FN-fibrin clots support increased cell spreading when compared with fibrin clots. FN-fibrin clot retraction by α5β1-expressing cells does not require a dimeric FN molecule. However, retraction does depend on both the RGD and the synergy sites in the cell-binding domain of FN and also requires covalent cross-linking of FN to fibrin. These data provide strong evidence that in a three-dimensional system, the engagement of the integrin α5β1 with FN can contribute to the generation of mechanical force required for clot retraction, leading to distinct changes in cell shape. This suggests that FN may play an important early role in the process of tissue remodeling. Fibrin clot retraction by both platelets and nucleated cells using receptors of the β3 integrin family has been described (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T. Akamatsu N. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1785-1790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Gartner T.K. Ogilvie M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Integrin αIIbβ3 is essential for platelet-mediated clot retraction but cannot spontaneously support clot retraction in nucleated cells without the presence of an activating antibody (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). However, nucleated cells that express αvβ3 can retract fibrin matrices (20Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support a role for the integrin α subunit cytoplasmic domain in modulating the generation of mechanical force in three-dimensional substrates. This has also been observed in a collagen gel system using chimeric α2 integrin subunits composed of the external and transmembrane domains of α2 coupled to the cytoplasmic domains of α5 (19Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The chimeric α2-α5β1 complex had similar function to α2β1 in mediating collagen gel retraction, demonstrating that the integrin α5cytoplasmic tail can influence the generation of tension. Plasma FN is a key adhesive component of the fibrin-rich matrices typically found at injury sites, and with a plasma concentration of 330 μg/ml, it seems likely that FN is deposited wherever fibrinous exudates occur (3$$Google Scholar). Further, the release of FN from activated platelets may contribute to the dispersal of FN throughout the clot. Although a role for FN in cell adhesion and migration has been well described, a contribution to clot retraction has not been determined. Our results demonstrate a consistent increase in the ability of the CHO-αvβ3 cells to retract FN-fibrin matrices when compared with fibrin matrices. This response resulted from an interaction between endogenous hamster α5β1 and FN. One explanation for these observations could be that the engagement of additional integrin receptors strengthens the mechanical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton by increasing the total number of receptor-ECM connections. In this instance, α5β1 and αvβ3 would be functionally equivalent in their ability to mediate gel retraction. However, our data suggest that α5β1 plays the major role in mediating FN-dependent clot retraction. This is indicated by the fact that the cyclic peptide has a limited ability to inhibit FN-mediated clot retraction in the presence of functioning α5β1. Previous work has suggested that α5β1 can exclude other FN integrins from particular functions. For example, Wennerberg et al. (36Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) showed that β1-null cells that express αvβ3 were capable of assembling a FN matrix. However, when these cells were transfected with a β1 subunit and expressed functional α5β1, αvβ3 was excluded from sites of FN matrix assembly, suggesting that α5β1 assumed a preferential role in this process. Similarly, the presence of α5β1can exclude αvβ1 from sites of cell-FN attachment (37Yang J.T. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1737-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is possible that the α5β1-FN interactions leading to the generation of mechanical force in a three-dimensional matrix may be comparable with those required for FN matrix assembly. In this context, therefore, the α5β1 integrin may preferentially trigger post-receptor occupancy events that promote force generation with greater efficiency than αvβ3 and thus exclude it from the process. Differences in the abilities of individual integrins to support tractional forces have been demonstrated. Interestingly, an inverse correlation has been reported between the ability of cells expressing specific integrins to generate tension and their rates of cell migration (19Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 38Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For example, transfectants that expressed chimeric α2 integrin subunits composed of the external and transmembrane domains of α2 coupled to the cytoplasmic domains of α2, α5, or α4 were examined for their migratory rates on collagen (19Chan B.M.C. Kassner P.D. Schiro J.A. Byers R. Kupper T.S. Hemler M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cells that expressed the α2/α4chimera had the fastest migratory rate but the least capacity to contract collagen matrices. In contrast, the α2/α5 chimera had a relatively low migratory rate but an increased capacity to retract collagen gels. Because the αvβ3 integrin is also thought to play a key role in cell migration events (40Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 41Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar), this integrin may be less effective than α5β1 in FN-mediated clot retraction. Recently, α5β1 has been shown to bind to fibrin, both in two- and three-dimensional systems (22Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 42Suehiro K. Gailit J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CHO-α5 transfectants retract fibrin matrices, but the addition of FN even at low concentrations increases clot retraction 2- to 3-fold. Cross-linking of FN to fibrin increases fibrin fibril thickness and strength (43Kamykowsi G.W. Mosher D.F. Lorand L. Ferry J.D. Biophys. Chem. 1981; 13: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Okada M. Blomback B. Chang M.-D. Horowitz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1811-1820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These changes could alter fibrin structure, making it a more efficient ligand for α5β1. When the retraction of recFN-fibrin matrices composed of recFNM(RGD+) and recFNM (RGD−) are examined, however, CHO-α5 retraction of the recFNM(RGD−)-fibrin matrix is comparable with fibrin alone, demonstrating that the increased clot retraction results from the ligation of α5β1 by FN specifically. Furthermore, FN-fibrin matrices support distinct cell shape change. It is possible that the α5β1-mediated promotion of clot retraction may occur via the establishment of a functional link between FN and the cytoskeleton mediated by α5β1that supports the generation of mechanical force. In two-dimensional systems, α5β1-FN interactions result in the assembly of FN into a fibrillar matrix, organization of the cytoskeleton into stress fibers, and distinct intracellular signaling events (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 113-364Crossref Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that α5β1-FN interactions could influence clot retraction via “inside-out” signaling events that may impact other integrin receptors. The differences in the ability of ligands to promote post-receptor occupancy events may depend on the mechanism through which they occupy the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1. Recent evidence suggests that cells can sense the rigidity of the ECM and respond by localized strengthening of cytoskeletal linkages (45Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). This process of reinforcement required occupancy of FN-binding sites and could not be duplicated by antibody cross-linking of the integrin receptors. Thus, it is possible that a ligand that does not effectively occupy the α5β1-binding site permits only limited strengthening of the cytoskeletal attachments and incomplete force generation. In a three-dimensional matrix, therefore, fibrin may not effectively occupy the ligand-binding site of α5β1. Thus, integrin-cytoskeletal linkages are not reinforced limiting the strength of cell-ECM contacts that are required for clot retraction and cell shape change. This model also provides an attractive explanation for why the synergy site is required for efficient FN-fibrin matrix retraction, because in its absence, the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1 is only partially occupied. There also may be a relationship between ECM rigidity and the generation of force at anchorage sites. This suggests a mechanism that explains the importance of cross-linking in FN-mediated clot retraction. In the absence of cross-linking, we observed a nearly 75% decrease in clot retraction. The generation of traction forces by cells requires that the ECM resist cell tension at attachment sites (45Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 46Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Perhaps, if FN molecules are not fixed in position by the cross-linking process, they “give” in response to applied mechanical stress. As a result, cells maintain a more rounded configuration, and the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for force generation are not achieved. In summary, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of FN into fibrin matrices significantly improves clot retraction by nucleated cells and that this effect is mediated by the integrin α5β1. Further, we show that FN-fibrin clots support increased cell spreading when compared with fibrin matrices. Finally, we have determined that both the RGD and synergy sites in FN, as well as the covalent incorporation of FN into the fibrin matrix are required for α5β1-mediated promotion of clot retraction. These data provide strong evidence that α5β1-FN interactions in a three-dimensional clot matrix may contribute to the events required for early tissue remodeling.

Novel receptor subunits that specifically bind IL-13 (IL-13Rα) have been identified in mouse (26Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IL-13Rα has an apparent molecular mass of 60–70 kDa and binds IL-13 with a K d of 2–10 nmwhen transfected alone into COS cells (26Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A.

However, when hu-IL-13Rα was cotransfected with hu-IL-4Rα into 293 cells, or mu-IL-13Rα was transfected into CTLL-2 cells that express IL-4Rα, the K d values for human or murine IL-13 were 400 and 75 pm, respectively (26Hilton D.J.

IL-13Rα is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic domain of 60 amino acids. This region exhibits 95% amino acid identity in the murine and human species (28Miloux B. Laurent P. Bonnin O. Lupker J. Caput D. Vita N. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It contains a membrane-proximal Pro-rich region, analogous to those that occur in other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily and are thought to be involved in activation of JAK kinases. The carboxyl-terminal region contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-399 and Tyr-402, the distal one in a YXXQ sequence motif that is a consensus sequence for binding of the SH2 domain of STAT3 (29Stahl N. Farrugella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Another transmembrane protein that binds IL-13 and has a short cytoplasmic domain has been identified in humans (30Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol.

Beier D.R. Turner K.J. Wood C.R. Collins M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2317-2324PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a truncated IL-13Rα encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacking the cytoplasmic domain failed to stimulate detectable biological or biochemical responses to IL-13 in terms of JAK1, Tyk2, IL-4Rα, IRS-2, and STAT6 phosphorylation and proliferation (15Orchansky P.L. Ayres S.D. Hilton D.J. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22940-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we show that a mutant IL-13Rα that contains only the membrane-proximal Pro-rich sequence and six carboxyl-terminal residues supported IL-13-induced cell proliferation, although with a diminished efficiency. Mutation of Tyr-402 of IL-13Rα did not affect IL-13-induced mitogenesis but reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, which we show is induced by IL-13 and IL-4 when they signal through the IL-13Rα. Although we failed to detect IL-13-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-13Rα in vivo, GST protein fused to the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα was efficiently phosphorylated on tyrosine residuesin vitro by JAK1, JAK3, and Tyk2. However, only Tyk2 and JAK1 associated with the IL-13Rα in vivo, in a direct interaction not mediated by IL-4Rα. Taken together, the results suggest the existence of complex interactions between IL-13Rα, tyrosine kinases, and STAT3. FD-5 cells (32Gliniak B.C. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a subclone of the premyeloid cell line FDMACII, are dependent upon IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF, or CSF-1 for proliferation. FDCP-1 cells, a myeloid cell line, are dependent upon IL-3 or GM-CSF for proliferation. Cells were passaged in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and either 2% (v/v) L cell conditioned media (LCCM) containing CSF-1 for FD-5 cells or 2% (v/v) WEHI-3 conditioned media (W3) containing IL-3 for FDCP-1 cells. Crude preparations of chemically synthesized IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF were kindly provided by Dr. I. Clark-Lewis (The Biomedical Research Center, University of British Columbia, Canada), and recombinant IL-4 and IL-13 were purchased from Intergen and R & D Systems, respectively. Antiserum against STAT6, STAT3, Tyk2, and IL-4Rα (Western blotting) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiserum against JAK1, JAK3, Ser(P)-STAT3, and mAb against phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Other anti-phosphotyrosine Abs used in this study were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (sampler pack), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (mAb PY99), and Transduction Laboratories (RC20:HRP). Anti-mu-IL-4Rα mAb (immunoprecipitation and FACScan analysis) was purchased from Genzyme; anti-FLAG mAb soluble or conjugated to Sepharose beads was from Sigma; antiserum against glutathione S-transferase (GST) was from Molecular Probes, and glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pEB-13R (26Hilton D.J.

A. 1996; 93: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), a plasmid encoding the full-length IL-13Rα cloned into a pEF-BOS vector (33Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), was digested with XbaI generating two fragments of 5.4 and 1.2 kb. The 1.2-kb fragment, encoding the mature protein sequence for IL-13Rα, was purified from 0.8% agarose gels and ligated into pBluescriptIISK, creating the plasmid pBS-13Rα. To generate the plasmid pEB-13Δ386 that encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and 21 proximal amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a stop codon at position 386 of the protein sequence was cloned into the cDNA of IL-13Rα. Briefly, oligonucleotides 5′p-TTAAGATCATTATATTTCCTCCAATTCCTGATCCCGGGAAGATTTTTAAAGAATAGGTAGC-3′ and 5′pTTAAGCTACCTATTCTTTAAAAATCTTCCCGGGATCAGGAATTGGAGGAAATATAATGATC-3′ (where p indicates phosphate) were annealed and cloned into calf intestinal phosphatase-treated AflII-linearized pBS-13Rα. The new plasmid pBS-13Δ386 was digested with XbaI, and the 1.25-kb fragment was subcloned into the expression vector pEF-BOS. The plasmid pEB-13YF that encodes the full-length IL-13Rα with a mutation of Tyr-402 to Phe was generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (34Shimada A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 57: 157-165Google Scholar). Briefly, the wild-type 0.2-kbAflII-XbaI fragment of pBS-13Rα was replaced with the 0.2-kb AflII-XbaI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product generated using the following four primers: GGAGCAAAACTCCACCTTCTAC, GACATCTTTGAGAAACAATCC, GGATTGTTTCTCAAAGATGTC, and TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGATT. The new plasmid pBS-13YF carrying the mutated tyrosine codon was digested withXbaI, and the 1.2-kb fragment was subcloned into the expression vector pEF-BOS. The plasmid pGEX-13RCD that encodes the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα fused to GST was generated as follows: pBS-13Rα was digested with XbaI and AflII generating three fragments of 3.0, 1.0, and 0.2 kb. The 0.2-kb fragment, encoding the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα, was purified from 1.2% agarose gels, blunt-ended with Klenow polymerase, and cloned into a SmaI site in the polylinker of pGEX-4T-3. The identity of the constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. FD-5 and FDCP-1 cells, grown in RPMI containing 10% FCS, and either 2% LCCM or W3, respectively, were washed and resuspended in transfection buffer (25 mm Hepes; 0.75 mmNa2HPO4; 140 mm KCl; 5 mm NaCl; 2 mm MgCl2; 0.5% Ficoll 400) at a concentration of 1.3 × 107 cells/ml. For each transfection, 1 × 107 cells were mixed with 1 μg of pPGK/Neo, a plasmid conferring neomycin resistance, alone or together with 10 μg of either pEB-13R, pEB-13Δ386, or pEB-13YF cDNA, and were subjected to electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene-pulsar at 960 microfarads and 280 or 300 V for FD-5 or FDCP-1, respectively. In parallel, 107 cells were electroporated without DNA, to subsequently monitor neomycin-induced death, or with 1 μg of pPGK/Neo alone, to monitor potential transfection-induced phenotypic alterations. After transfection, these groups of cells were cultured in the appropriate media for 48 h and then transferred to selection media in 96 well-plates at 104 cells/well. FD-5 cells were selected in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 200 μg/ml G418, and 2% LCCM. FCDP-1 cells were selected in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 300 μg/ml G418, and 2% W3. Individual colonies of neomycin-resistant cells were cloned and propagated for assays (cell proliferation and protein tyrosine phosphorylation of whole cell lysates). Cells were tested for expression of wild-type (FD-13R or FDCP-13R), partially truncated IL-13Rα (FD-13Δ386 or FDCP-13Δ386), and mutated IL-13Rα (FD-13YF or FDCP-13YF) by FACScan analysis using M2, a mAb against FLAG, and goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC. A representative clone from each cell population was recloned by limit dilution and used for further experiments. Expression of the second functional chain of the receptor was tested by FACScan analysis using anti-IL-4Rα Ab and goat anti-rat IgG-FITC. FD-5 and FDCP-1 transfectants were washed three times with Hanks' buffered salts supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS and plated at 10,000 or 25,000 cells per well, respectively, in 96-well tissue culture plates in the presence of various concentrations of recombinant mu-IL-4 and recombinant mu-IL-13. As positive control, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml synthetic mu-GM-CSF. After 5 days' incubation for FD-5 transfectants and 2 days' incubation for FDCP-1 transfectants, MTT (3,4,5-dimethyltiazole-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added at a concentration of 375 μg/ml for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 6% SDS, 20%N,N-dimethylformamide, and the optical density was measured at 550 nm (35Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as a percentage of the maximal MTT incorporation observed in cultures stimulated with GM-CSF. Experiments were done in triplicate, and standard errors were less than 10%. Results are representative of several independent experiments. To investigate the biochemical effects of stimulation with different cytokines FD-5 transfectants were placed in RPMI, 10% FCS, 0.2% LCCM for 16 h, washed twice with serum/factor-free media containing 20 mm Hepes, and incubated at 5 × 107 cells/ml of the same media at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated at 37 °C with synthetic IL-4 (20 μg/ml), synthetic IL-13 (20 μg/ml) for 10 min, or left untreated. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 1 mm sodium molybdate; 10 mm sodium fluoride; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin; 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with antisera against JAK1, JAK3, Tyk2, STAT3, STAT6 or with mAbs against IL-4Rα or FLAG for 2–16 h at 4 °C followed by 1–2 h with Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer containing decreasing concentrations of detergent and heated in Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing dithiothreitol at a concentration of 40 mm final. The samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were then equilibrated in transfer buffer (20 mm Tris; 150 mm glycine; 20% methanol) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by electrophoresis toward the anode at 200 mA for 2 h in a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The PVDF membranes were blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) for 4–16 h at room temperature and incubated for 2 h with anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 (0.25 μg/ml) (or other anti-phosphotyrosine Abs as described in the text), anti-FLAG mAb (1 μg/ml), or antisera against JAK1 (1:1000), JAK3 (1:1000), Tyk2 (1:500), STAT3 (1:1000), STAT6 (1:2000), IL-4Rα (1:500), or Ser(P)-STAT3 (1:1000) in TBST, 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were further incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Denmark) and subsequently developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence assay as described by the manufacturer (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and anti-Ser(P)-STAT3 were stripped and blotted with the specific immunoprecipitating antibody. FD5–13R cells (3–6 × 106) were cultured overnight in a suboptimal concentration of LCCM, stimulated with IL-4 or IL-13, and lysed as described previously. Lysates of cells stimulated with IL-4 were immunoprecipitated with JAK1 or JAK3 antisera; lysates of cells stimulated with IL-13 were immunoprecipitated with Tyk2 antisera, as described previously. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer containing decreasing concentrations of detergent, twice more with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mmLiCl2, and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of either IL-13Rα cytoplasmic domain-GST fusion protein or GST protein alone. After 20 min at room temperature, SDS sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Samples were electrophoresed onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes, and phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. After32P-protein decay, membranes were washed with TBST and proteins immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) mAbs, as described previously. A duplicate membrane was treated with 1 m KOH at 55 °C for 2 h to dephosphorylate Thr/Ser residues (38Kamps M. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 176: 22-27Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The IL-13Rα cytoplasmic domain-GST fusion protein as well as GST protein alone were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. GST fusion proteins were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns and eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. Affinity purified proteins were typically 90–95% homogeneous as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. The expression plasmid pEB-13R (Fig.1 A, top) contains the coding sequence for the full-length IL-13Rα cDNA. The sequence encoding the carboxyl-terminal region of IL-13Rα was deleted by introduction of a stop codon at position 1159 of the cDNA. The new expression plasmid pEB-13Δ386 (Fig. 1 A, middle) encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and 22 proximal amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic domain including the Pro-rich region. A point mutation at position 1204 of the cDNA was introduced by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid generated in this way, pEB-13YF (Fig. 1 A, bottom), encodes a full-length IL-13Rα in which Tyr-402 has been substituted by Phe. The mutated and full-length receptor expression plasmids were used to transfect FD-5 and FCDP-1 cells. Both cell lines are unresponsive to IL-13 stimulation, but respond to IL-4, in the case of FD-5 growing continuously and in the case of FDCP-1 exhibiting prolonged survival but not long term growth. Establishment of FD-5 cells expressing the wild-type IL-13Rα (FD-13R) and propagation conditions were previously described (15Orchansky P.L. Ayres S.D. Hilton D.J. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22940-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For each mutated form of IL-13Rα transfected into FD-5 and FDCP-1 cells, neomycin-resistant colonies were individually cloned and analyzed for IL-13Rα expression by fluorometric studies using anti-FLAG mAb and FITC conjugated to goat anti-mouse antibody. FACS analysis of FD-5 clones showed that 4 out of 6 clones analyzed expressed IL-13Δ386 and 12 out of 12 clones analyzed expressed IL-13YF, all of them exhibiting the same level of receptor expression for each transfected population (results not shown). In the case of FDCP-1 cells, 6 out of 6 and 7 out of 12 clones analyzed expressed IL-13Δ386 and IL-13YF receptor, respectively, with similar levels of expression for each different population. Within each transfected cell type, each clone responded equally in terms of proliferation or survival in response to specific cytokines. Therefore, only one clone of each transfected type was used for further experiments. FD-5 and FDCP-1 cells transfected with pPGK/Neo alone responded normally to IL-4 in terms of proliferation and survival, indicating that expression of this plasmid did not interfere with IL-4 signaling. The transfected receptors were expressed as surface proteins as detected by FACScan analysis. Fig. 1 B shows that whereas FD-13R and FD-13YF cells express equivalent amounts of receptor protein, the levels of expression were 10-fold higher in FD-13Δ386 cells. This differential level of expression between wild-type and IL-13Δ386 receptor was also observed in FDCP-1 cells (Fig. 1 D).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using sequentially deleted DNA probes and nuclear extracts from AGS-B gastric cancer cells showed that the GAS-RE is actually composed of two overlapping binding sites (GAS-RE1, +1 to +19; and GAS-RE2, +11 to +27) that bind distinct nuclear factors. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that each element alone could confer gastrin responsiveness, but the presence of both elements was required for complete gastrin response. Stimulation of AGS-B cells with gastrin for 10–20 min resulted in a >2-fold increase in factor binding. The binding was inhibited by pretreatment of AGS-B cells with cycloheximide and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, indicating a requirement for protein synthesis and also indicating that activation occurs through the MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot analysis showed that GAS-RE1 bound a 52-kDa protein, whereas GAS-RE2 bound a 35-kDa protein. Hence, activation of histidine decarboxylase gene promoter activity by gastrin is most likely mediated by two separate nuclear factors.

Hence, activation of histidine decarboxylase gene promoter activity by gastrin is most likely mediated by two separate nuclear factors. Histamine, the major stimulant of acid secretion, is generated in the stomach through the action of the enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC) 1The abbreviations used are: HDC, histidine decarboxylase; CCK, cholecystokinin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAS-RE, gastrin response element; GAS-REBP, gastrin response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1Höcker M.

HDC is expressed at high levels in the enterochromaffin-like cells of the gastric mucosa, where HDC activity is tightly regulated by the level of the circulating peptide hormone gastrin. Binding of the peptide hormone gastrin to the CCK-B/gastrin receptor expressed on enterochromaffin-like cells leads to both histamine secretion and increased histamine production through activation of HDC enzymatic activity. In addition, activation of CCK/gastrin receptor signaling has been shown to lead to increased HDC mRNA abundance. Increased levels of HDC mRNA have been observed in hypergastrinemic rats (2Dimaline R. Sandvik A.K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,3Höcker M. Zhang Z.

The stimulation of HDC transcription by gastrin has been shown through experiments involving the transfection of human HDC promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs into the AGS-B cell line. The AGS-B cell line is a human gastric cancer cell line stably expressing the recombinant human CCK-B/gastrin receptor (3Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D.

The human gastrin receptor is known to be coupled through G proteins to phospholipase C, and gastrin-dependent activation of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor has been shown to induce phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and stimulation of protein kinase C pathways (8Seva C.

Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that stimulation by gastrin of AGS-B cells both transiently and stably transfected with the 1.8-kilobase human HDC-luciferase construct leads to an ∼4-fold increase in promoter activity (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the stimulation of the HDC promoter by gastrin appears to involve a protein kinase C-dependent, MAP kinase/ERK-dependent, and AP-1-dependent pathway (11Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: G822-G830Google Scholar, 14Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

However, whereas in most cases, the transcription factor AP-1 activates cellular promoters by binding to a cis-acting element called the TRE (5′-TGACTCA-3′), neither the rat nor the human HDC promoter contains a consensus TRE site (3Höcker M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Through deletion analysis of the human HDC promoter, we have recently shown that the cis-acting DNA sequence responsible for gastrin-mediated transactivation is located in a region (+2 to +24) downstream of the transcriptional start site (+1) (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This 23-base pair element is called the gastrin response element (GAS-RE). Although the GAS-RE encompasses a larger number of nucleotides than the majority of transcription factor-binding sites, removal of nucleotides from either the 5′- or 3′-end significantly reduces the response to gastrin (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays suggested the presence of only a single delayed complex. Gastrin stimulation of AGS-B cells increases binding of this protein complex to the GAS-RE probe, and competition studies using specific competitors or antibodies indicated that the nuclear factor(s) are most likely novel and do not include AP-1 (Fos/Jun) (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the precise binding site of the nuclear factor(s) to the GAS-RE was not fully characterized in this initial report. We have now carried out a more detailed investigation of the GAS-RE, including EMSA experiments with sequentially deleted DNA probes and promoter-luciferase constructs containing various portions of the GAS-RE ligated upstream of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. This study suggests that the GAS-RE is in fact composed of two overlapping transcription factor-binding sites (GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2) that together account for the full transcriptional response to gastrin stimulation through the binding of distinct nuclear factors. A series of oligonucleotides (both sense and antisense) containing gastrin response elements within region −4 to +27 of the human HDC promoter were used for this study (Table I). The numbering refers to the position of each nucleotide relative to the transcriptional start site (+1). Additional GAS-RE deletion oligonucleotides similar to those above were synthesized withBamHI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′-end of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides, respectively, for site-specific cloning. Annealed oligonucleotides were ligated upstream of the enhancerless thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus 1 in the construct pT81 (13Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. The Gal4-Elk-1 construct contains the Gal4 DNA-binding domain linked to the Elk-1 transactivation domain, and the 5×Gal-Luc construct contains five consensus Gal4 DNA-binding sites subcloned into p20-Luc (14Höcker M.

Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid/well in a six-well tissue culture plate by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (DNA transfection kit, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Cells were stimulated with gastrin 24 h post-transfection under serum-free conditions, and luciferase assays were done at 48 h. Relative induction (-fold increase) by gastrin was calculated by taking the ratio of luciferase activity in the presence of gastrin compared with luciferase activity in the unstimulated control. Results represented the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. When necessary, cells were serum-starved for 48 h in ultraculture medium, followed by stimulation with gastrin (10−7m) for different time periods prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. In some experiments, serum-starved cells were incubated with 10 or 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 1 and 2 h, respectively, or with 30 μm/ml MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059, New England Biolabs Inc.) for 5 h prior to stimulation with gastrin (10−7m) for 20 min. In cotransfection experiments performed with Gal4-Elk-1 and 5×Gal-Luc constructs, transfected cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to stimulation (with gastrin or PMA), and responsiveness was calculated as -fold increase in luciferase activity compared with untreated controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared from a variety of cell lines as described previously (3Höcker M. Zhang Z. Fenstermacher D.A. Tågerud S. Chulak M.B. Joseph D. Wang T.C. Am. J.

These cell lines included the following: AGS-B, a human gastric cancer cell line expressing the recombinant CCK-B/gastrin receptor (either stimulated with gastrin or unstimulated); AGS-0, human gastric cancer cells; COS-7, monkey kidney cells; BON, human pancreatic cells; KATO-3, human gastric carcinoma cells; PC12, rat pheochromocytoma cells; and S2, Schneider's Drosophilacells. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and EMSAs were performed with 5 μg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 20 μl in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dA-dT), and 10% glycerol. Mixtures were incubated with 10 fmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA at a constant current of 15 mA. Gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-AR film for appropriate times at room temperature. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with up to 100-fold excess of competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides at room temperature for 10 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. For gastrin stimulation assays, the density of the resulting bands was determined using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer with ImageQuant Version 3.22 software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Four sets of double-stranded oligonucleotides for UV probes GAS-RE1 WT, GAS-RE1 M1, GAS-RE2 WT, and GAS-RE2 M2 were Klenow end-labeled in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine. Crude nuclear extracts from AGS-B cells were incubated with probes in EMSA binding buffer for 30 min on ice, followed by exposure to UV light (312 nm) for 20 min. After UV cross-linking, the DNA-protein complexes were boiled for 5 min with 2× SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with 1× Tris/glycine electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine (pH 8.3), and 0.1% SDS. Prestained molecular mass markers were used to calculate the molecular mass of the proteins. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −80 °C. Nuclear extracts from AGS-B cells were prepared and quantitated. For each lane, 50 μg of nuclear extracts were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel. Prestained protein molecular mass markers were run to monitor electrophoretic transfer and to determine relative size (kilodaltons). Transfer to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane was done for 90 min at room temperature in a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 200 mA with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. After transfer, the blots were air-dried and subjected to the following procedure directly without performing guanidine hydrochloride denaturation/renaturation steps. After pretreatment with a solution of blocking buffer containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for at least 1 h, blots were probed for 1 h with radioactive GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 in binding buffer. Blots were washed with three changes of binding buffer over a period of 15 min, air-dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak X-AR film. In our initial study, we found that the HDC promoter sequence responsible for gastrin-stimulated transactivation could be localized to a region (+2 to +24) downstream of the transcriptional start site (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The entire 23-nucleotide sequence appeared to be essential for gastrin responsiveness inasmuch as removal of a few nucleotides at either the 3′- or 5′-end reduced gastrin responsiveness substantially (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region was also capable of relative high affinity binding to factors present in AGS-B nuclear extracts. To characterize the nucleotides essential for DNA binding, block mutagenesis (5 nucleotides/block) was performed on a +1/+27 labeled HDC probe, and factor binding was assessed using the EMSA. Surprisingly, a single block mutation of the +1/+27 sequence was not able to block binding entirely (data not shown). In contrast, all five sets of block mutations reduced responsiveness to gastrin and PMA when cloned upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase construct (data not shown). Since it appeared that there were mutations at either end of the DNA response element that reduced promoter responsiveness to gastrin but that did not inhibit factor binding entirely, this suggested to us the possibility of cooperative interactions between overlapping binding motifs. To identify these overlapping binding motifs, we carried out EMSA analysis using serial 5′- and 3′-deletions of our HDC gel shift probe. We started with the larger +1/+27 HDC probe since it appeared to show greater binding than the +2/+24 probe in EMSAs. Deletion from the 5′-end showed that the +11/+27 sequence still maintained significant binding, whereas deletion from the 3′-end showed that the +1/+19 sequence also retained significant binding (data not shown). Further deletions of these minimal elements led to substantial decreases in binding in EMSAs. Deletion of nucleotides from either end of the +1/+19 (Fig. 1 A) or +11/+27 (Fig.1 B) HDC probe reduced binding significantly. The +3/+19 probe bound a complex with an altered mobility, raising the possibility of either altered probe conformation (such as interruption of a palindromic structure) or binding of different protein factors (Fig.1 A). Decreased binding was seen with the +1/+17 probe, and no binding was observed with the +8/+19 probe (Fig. 1 A). In the case of the downstream element (+11 to +27), decreased binding was observed as the 3′-end was gradually deleted down to +24, and no binding was observed with the +11/+22 probe (Fig. 1 B). Decreased binding was also noted with removal of 3 nucleotides from the 5′-end with the +14/+27 probe (Fig. 1 B). Overall, these EMSA deletion experiments indicate at least two separate DNA-binding motifs, which we designated GAS-RE1 (+1 to +19) and GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27). Whereas competition with either GAS-RE1 or GAS-RE2 alone was not able to eliminate binding to the GAS-RE (+1 to +27), competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing both sequences (i.e. +1 to +27) was able to reduce binding entirely (Fig. 1 C). Since the gel shift complexes binding to GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 appeared to migrate in a similar pattern and location in EMSAs (Fig. 1 C), the possibility existed that the twocis-acting elements bound to identical or closely related nuclear factors. Consequently, we carried out cross-competition experiments using either the GAS-RE1 (+1 to +19) or GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27) sequence as a DNA probe and also as an unlabeled competitor (Fig.2). When GAS-RE1 was used as a labeled probe, GAS-RE2 competed, but to a much lesser extent than GAS-RE1 (Fig.2 A). Similarly, when GAS-RE2 was used as a labeled probe, GAS-RE1 competed, but again to a much lesser extent than GAS-RE2 (Fig.2 B). In each case, complete competition could be seen with a 100-fold excess of the corresponding wild-type probe, whereas only partial competition could be seen with a 100-fold excess of the non-identical probe. To identify the exact nucleotides with each DNA element required for factor binding, scanning mutagenesis was performed using 5-block nucleotide substitutions in GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2. Double-stranded wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides were used either as labeled probes in the EMSA (Fig. 3, A andB) or as unlabeled competitors (Fig. 3, C andD). In the case of GAS-RE1 (+1 to +19), the M1 mutation, changing +2CCCTT+6 to+2AAGAA+6, profoundly reduced binding to the labeled probe (Fig. 3 A) or markedly reduced the degree of competition (Fig. 3 B). In the case of GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27), the M2 mutation, changing +16GGCC+19 to+16CAAT+19, eliminated binding to the labeled probe (Fig. 3 C) and eliminated competition when used as an unlabeled competitor (Fig. 3 D). Thus, these mutational studies indicate that the nuclear factors bind GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 in a sequence-specific fashion and recognize distinct DNA sequences. Stimulation of AGS-B cells with maximal effective concentrations of gastrin (10−7m) led to increased factor binding to the entire GAS-RE (+1 to +27) with 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 1 C). To examine the time course and to determine whether this stimulation held true for both GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2, EMSA studies were repeated using the separate elements as probes. Gastrin stimulation led to increased factor binding to GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 as early as 10 min after stimulation (Fig.4). Examination of extracts after 3 and 5 min of gastrin stimulation showed no increase in factor binding at these earlier time points (data not shown). The intensity of the complexes reached a maximum at 20 min for GAS-RE2 and 40 min for GAS-RE1, but remained elevated for up to 60 min for both factors (Fig.4, C and D). Scanning densitometric analysis indicated that gastrin stimulation led to maximal increases in binding of 2.9-fold for GAS-RE1 (at 40 min) and 2.3-fold for GAS-RE2 (at 20 min) (Fig. 4, A and B). An extensive Internet-based homology search was done to compare the GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 promoter sequences with known transcription factor-binding sites. No homology to a known binding motif was found in our search. Since gastrin has been shown to stimulate HDC promoter activity through a MAP kinase/ERK-related pathway, we performed EMSA competition using as unlabeled competitors binding motifs for transcription factors known to be activated by MAP kinase, including AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, SP-1, EGR-1, CRE, and SRE. Although GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 were competed away by a 100-fold excess of wild-type competitors, they were not competed away by DNA sequences representing these known transcription factor-binding motifs (data not shown). The expression of these novel transcription factors was not restricted to gastric cells (Fig. 5, A andB); rat PC12 and Drosophila S2 cells did not appear to express these factors, although this may be due to species differences. To confirm that GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 each contribute to gastrin responsiveness by the HDC promoter, we generated a series of heterologous promoter constructs in which various HDC promoter sequences were cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase promoter in the pT81 luciferase construct (Fig.6). Fig. 6 A shows the effect on basal promoter activity. Both GAS-RE1 (+1 to +19) and GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27) resulted in significant (10-fold) increases in basal promoter activity, whereas two copies (2C) of each element resulted in only slightly greater enhancer activity compared with a single copy. In contrast, the full-length GAS-RE (+1 to +27) gave a much greater enhancer response (nearly 30-fold) than either element alone (Fig.6 A). Deletion of the full-length GAS-RE at either the 5′- or 3′-end resulted in a significant loss of enhancer activity. Single mutations (M) in either GAS-RE1 or GAS-RE2 reduced enhancer activity, whereas double mutations (DM; M1 in GAS-RE1 plus M2 in GAS-RE2) in the +1/+27 GAS-RE element completely eliminated enhancer activity (Fig. 6 A). In terms of gastrin responsiveness, the +1/+27 element gave the greatest (4.3-fold) response to gastrin, which was much greater than that observed with the previously identified GAS-RE (+2 to +24), which gave only a 2.2-fold response (Fig. 6 B). Deletion of the full-length GAS-RE (+1 to +27) at the 5′-end (to +2, +3, and +8) significantly reduced gastrin responsiveness. Nevertheless, the +11/+27 element still showed a 2.7-fold response to gastrin, and two copies of the +11/+27 element gave a 3.6-fold response to gastrin. Deletion of the +11/+27 element at the 3′-end to +11 to +22 reduced gastrin responsiveness close to that of pT81 (1.7-fold). The +1/+19 element gave a 3.5-fold response to gastrin, which was increased only slightly by addition of a second copy (Fig. 6 B). Mutation of the +1/+19 element (M1) reduced gastrin responsiveness by 80%, whereas mutation of the +11/+27 element (M2) also reduced gastrin responsiveness by 80%. Mutations of both elements (M1 and M2) completely eliminated gastrin responsiveness by the +1/+27 construct (Fig. 6 B). Thus, these functional studies confirm that each element (GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2) contributes to the gastrin responsiveness by the HDC promoter, but that full responsiveness requires both elements. The above experiments have demonstrated that gastrin stimulation leads to increased factor binding to GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2. To determine whether gastrin stimulation of factor binding requires new protein synthesis, we incubated serum-starved AGS-B cells with cycloheximide for either 1 or 2 h. Pretreatment of AGS-B cells with cycloheximide at a dose of 25 μg/ml for 1 h had little effect on basal binding, but inhibited induction of factor binding to GAS-RE1 (Fig.7 A) and GAS-RE2 (Fig.7 B). Identical results were obtained when cycloheximide was used at a dose of 10 μg/ml (data not shown). When AGS-B cells were pretreated with cycloheximide at a dose of 25 μg/ml for 2 h, gastrin induction of factor binding was inhibited, but basal factor binding was also reduced (Fig. 7, A and B). Previous studies have indicated that gastrin-mediated activation of HDC transcription occurs through an ERK-dependent pathway (14Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27015-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the ERK pathway in factor binding to GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2, we pretreated cells with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 prior to gastrin stimulation. Under these conditions, gastrin was unable to stimulate factor binding to GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 (Fig.8, A and B), indicating a key role for the MEK1/ERK pathway in activating these transcription factors. MEK1 inhibitor pretreatment of AGS-B cells transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs also blocked 58% of the HDC promoter activation by gastrin stimulation (data not shown). To determine whether the effect of cycloheximide was upstream or downstream of the ERK pathway, we tested the effect of protein synthesis inhibition on the Gal4-Elk-1 system. AGS-B cells were cotransfected with 2.0 μg of the Gal4-Elk-1 expression construct along with the 5×Gal-Luc reporter construct. Cells were incubated with or without cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to either gastrin or PMA stimulation (10−7m), and luciferase activity was measured. Preincubation with cycloheximide decreased activation of Gal4-Elk-1 by PMA from 15- to 2.2-fold and by gastrin from 2- to 1.5-fold, consistent with an inhibitory effect on ERK activation. To investigate the size of the nuclear factors that bind the GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2 sequences, we performed UV cross-linking studies using bromodeoxyuridine-substituted probes. The radiolabeled, bromodeoxyuridine-substituted probes were incubated with AGS-B nuclear extracts, exposed to UV light (312 nm), and then resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Mutant probes were used to assess the specificity of binding. Molecular masses for nuclear factors were calculated after subtracting the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide probes. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the GAS-RE1 wild-type probe bound a 52-kDa factor that was not observed with the mutant M1 probe. The GAS-RE2 (+11 to +27) wild-type probe bound a 35-kDa factor that was not seen with the mutant M2 probe (Fig.9 B). Southwestern blot analysis was performed as described previously (15Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm the UV cross-linking data (Fig.10). Equivalent amounts (∼50 μg) of crude nuclear extracts from AGS-B cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred by a Western blot technique to nitrocellulose filters. After transfer, the blot was cut into two identical strips, each containing a lane of AGS-B proteins. Blots were probed with three copies of either the GAS-RE1 (Fig. 10 A) or GAS-RE2 (Fig. 10 B) wild-type probe. These studies showed a single complex that could be observed with these probes. No complex was observed when mutant probes were used (data not shown). Comparison to size markers showed that the GAS-RE1 sequence bound a 52-kDa protein, whereas the GAS-RE2 sequence bound a smaller, 35-kDa protein. In this study, we have shown that at least two nuclear factors are responsible for mediating gastrin responsiveness by the human HDC promoter: GAS-REBP1 and GAS-REBP2. Our previous report noted only one nuclear complex binding to the GAS-RE (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but further deletion and mutational analysis of the human HDC promoter has now revealed overlapping DNA-binding sites (+1 to +19 and +11 to +27) that bind nuclear factors with distinct sizes and binding specificity. Each of these elements was shown to behave as a true enhancer when ligated upstream of a heterologous promoter, and full gastrin responsiveness required both cis-acting elements. Block mutations in minimal sequence motifs (CCCTT in GAS-RE1 and GGCC in GAS-RE2) that led to a reduction in promoter activity also were sufficient to abolish binding in gel mobility shift assays, UV cross-linking, or Southwestern blot assays. In addition, we have shown that gastrin stimulation led to a rapid increase in factor binding to both DNA elements; increased binding in EMSA could be observed as early at 10 min post-gastrin stimulation, with near maximal increases occurring at 20 min post-gastrin stimulation. Gastrin is a peptide hormone that is known to regulate a number of gastric functions (including acid secretion) through binding to the CCK-B/gastrin receptor, but downstream targets of gastrin-regulated signaling pathways, such as transcription factors, have not been as well defined. In addition to regulating HDC gene expression, gastrin has also been reported to activate the transcription of a number of growth factor-related genes, including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc (16Taniguchi T. Matsui T. Ito M. Murayama T. Tsukamoto T. Katakami Y. Chiba T. Chihara K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar, 17Todisco A. Takeuchi Y. Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Activation of c-fos transcription in AR4-2J cells appears to proceed through a MAP kinase pathway (17Todisco A. Takeuchi Y. Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gastrin has also been shown tostimulate translation of genes such as ornithine decarboxylase through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway possibly involving p70S6K and 4E-BP1 (18Pyronnet S. Gingras A.C.

We have recently shown that HDC transcription is activated by gastrin through an ERK-dependent pathway that requires protein kinase C and Raf-1, but that does not require Ras (11Höcker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.M. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: G822-G830Google Scholar). The HDC promoter can also be activated by oxidative stress (H2O2) through the GAS-RE and an ERK-dependent pathway that requires Ras (21Höcker M. Rosenberg I. Xavier R. Henihan R.J. Wiedenmann B. Rosewicz S. Podolsky D.K. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23046-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We now report that activation by gastrin of putative transcription factor complexes GAS-REBP1 and GAS-REBP2 requires an intact MEK1/MAP kinase pathway. PD98059, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 activation, completely inhibited the increase in factor binding to GAS-REs observed after gastrin stimulation. However, activation of the GAS-REBPs did not appear to occur solely through a post-translation event (e.g. phosphorylation). Pretreatment of AGS-B cells with cycloheximide resulted in marked inhibition of factor binding in response to gastrin stimulation, suggesting that new protein synthesis (perhaps of the GAS-REBPs) was also required. However, cycloheximide also inhibited gastrin- and PMA-mediated activation of Gal4-Elk-1, suggesting that the cycloheximide block may occur upstream of ERK activation in this system. Clearly, further studies will be required to determine whether gastrin-dependent HDC promoter activation actually requires increased production of the GAS-REBP factors. The gastrin response elements (GAS-RE1 and GAS-RE2) in the HDC promoter appear to represent novel transcription factor-binding sites. EMSA competition using double-stranded oligonucleotides representing known transcription factor-binding motifs yielded no useful clues as to the identity of the two factors. In addition, Internet-based TESS searches (12Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) showed no homology to any of the published transcription factor-binding sites. UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot assays showed that GAS-REBP1 is a 52-kDa protein, whereas GAS-REBP2 is a 35-kDa protein. Although a number of known transcription factors have reported in these size ranges, none appears to have similar specificity for these DNA sequences. The GAS-RE2 sequence, while GC-rich, does not bind a zinc finger as shown by lack of effect of EGTA chelation on binding (data not shown). Deletion studies with the GAS-RE1 sequence raise the possibility of a palindromic secondary structure since deletions that might be predicted to alter such structure lead to altered migration in EMSAs (Fig. 1 A). Since the two GAS-REs appear to have additive effects in terms of both basal promoter activity and transcriptional activation in response to gastrin stimulation, we believe that they may bind the nuclear factors GAS-REBP1 and GAS-REBP2 in some sort of cooperative fashion, although we cannot at this time completely exclude the possibility of competitive interactions. In summary, the nuclear factors GAS-REBP1 and GAS-REBP2 appear to represent novel regulators of HDC gene expression and mediate the transcriptional responses to CCK-B/gastrin receptor activation. In addition, as downstream targets of the MEK/MAP kinase pathway and factors that are expressed in many cell types (10Zhang Z. Höcker M. Koh T.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the GAS-REBPs may be involved in the regulation of other growth-related genes. Additional insight into the biology of the GAS-REBPs will most likely await further identification and characterization of the two factors, which, given our above results, may be possible through purification or affinity cloning techniques. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core of the Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease."

The role of vitamin D compounds and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type II receptor in modulating the smooth muscle phenotype of cultured mesangial cells was examined. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by the vitamin D analog 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (22-oxacalcitriol; OCT) rather than by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) in a dose-dependent manner. OCT-treated early passage mesangial cells (MC-E cells) had increased expression levels of type IV collagen and smooth muscle α actin mRNA, but 1,25(OH)2D3-treated MC-E cells did not. The addition of a TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody to the OCT-treated MC-E cells blocked this inhibitory effect for cell proliferation and attenuated the up-regulated mRNA levels. However, after exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or OCT, there was no significant difference in the secretion of active TGF-β. We next investigated whether TGF-β type II receptor (RII) was involved in this regulation. OCT treatment significantly increased the expression of the RII mRNA in MC-E cells.

Its physiological role is to regulate calcium metabolism. It was then reevaluated and came to be thought of as a kind of steroid hormone. The role of 1,25(OH)2D3 has also been recognized as being much broader and thus much more physiologically important than originally thought, as reflected by its effects on the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cells mainly including malignant and immune cells. Since the first report (1Abe E. Miyaura C. Sakagami H. Takeda M. Konno K. Yamazaki T. Yoshiki S. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4990-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) that 1,25(OH)2D3inhibited proliferation and induced the differentiation of murine myeloid leukemic M1 cells into monocyte macrophages, many studies have demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 is a potent modulator in suppressing proliferation and inducing the differentiation of numerous normal and tumor cells. However, the effective doses for these effects often cause hypercalcemia. To prevent this, many analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been synthesized. One of them, 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(22-oxacalcitriol, OCT), has a more potent differentiation-inducing effect (2Abe J. Morikawa M. Miyamoto K. Kaiho S. Fukushima M. Miyaura C. Abe E. Suda T. Nishii Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 226: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) than 1,25(OH)2D3 without inducing hypercalcemia. In the kidney, the anti-proliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been demonstrated in cultured mesangial cells (3Weinreich T. Merke J. Schonermark M. Reichel H. Diebold M. Hansch G.M. Ritz E. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 359-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, its differentiation-inducing effects have remained unknown. Mesangial cells (MCs) are uniquely differentiated cells, which acquire a smooth muscle-like phenotype, and are believed to be derived from mesenchymal cells (4Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that cultured mesangial cells in the early passages (MC-E) (<25) showed a smooth muscle cell phenotype such as low cell turnover, high levels of expression for type IV collagen (Col IV) and smooth muscle α actin (SMA), together with low expression of type I collagen (Col I). After multiple passages, mesangial cells in the late passages (MC-L) (>45) lost their smooth muscle phenotype and increased cell turnover (5Iehara N. Takeoka H. Tsuji H. Imabayashi T. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1330-1341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence is accumulating that suggests that MCs, during the process of glomerular injuries (such as inflammation), can proliferate and undergo a phenotypic modulation in which they markedly up-regulate their expression of smooth muscle-like proteins (i.e. SMA). Furthermore, MCs can develop fibroblast-like characteristics by secreting interstitial collagens (i.e.type I and III collagens) that are not normally present in the mesangial matrix (6Floege J.

Floege J. Yoshimura A. Iida H. Couser W.G. Alpers C.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2 (suppl.): 190-197Google Scholar). However, there is little information regarding the mechanisms that underlie this phenotypic change. TGF-β has widespread effects on extracellular matrix proliferation in many cultured cell lines and appears to play a role in the pathological accumulation of the extracellular matrix that accompanies inflammatory and fibrotic diseases such as glomerulonephritis (8Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Border W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). TGF-β may also have other important functions on glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells, including the regulation of cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and survival (apoptosis), as well as the modulation of the local and systemic immune response. Recent studies have shown that TGF-β overexpression in experimental and human kidney disease leads to progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring and renal failure (9Yamamoto T. Noble N.A.

Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 916-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The loss of responsiveness to the inhibitory effects of TGF-β has been implicated in the development of a variety of cancers. The signal transduction of TGF-β is regulated via a heteromeric complex of type I and type II TGF-β receptors (RI and RII). An attenuation of TGF-β receptor expression is likely to play a critical role in the escape from this growth regulation. Recent evidence indicates that a loss of RII is often associated with a failure to respond to autocrine and exogenous TGF-β. In some cancer cell lines, RII expression is certainly a critical determinant for conferring TGF-β tumor suppression as well as negative autocrine TGF-β growth functions. A study by Wu et al. (12Wu G. Fan R.S. Li W. Srinivas V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7749-7756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in human breast cancer cells demonstrated that increased RII mRNA and protein levels following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs contributed to TGF-β activity. It is generally accepted that 1,25(OH)2D3 works in context with TGF-β in controlling cell proliferation. However, with respect to cell differentiation, it is still undetermined how 1,25(OH)2D3 and TGF-β interact. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the MC phenotype in vitro. 1,25(OH)2D3 was purchased from Philips Duphar Co. (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and its synthetic analog OCT was generously supplied by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Stock solutions were prepared in absolute ethanol at 10−4m. Serial dilutions were then made in absolute ethanol and stored at −20 °C protected from light. These diluted solutions were added to the experimental culture medium at a final ethanol concentration of 1%. The control cells received 1% ethanol vehicle, which had no effect on cell proliferation (data not shown). A glomerular mesangial cell line was established from glomeruli isolated from normal, 4-week-old mice (C57BL/6JxSJL/J) and was identified according to the method previously described (13Doi T.

The mesangial cells were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes (Nunc) and maintained in B medium (a 3:1 mixture of minimal essential medium/F12 modified with trace elements) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 mg/ml, and 20% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific). The cells were passaged weekly with trypsin-EDTA. The cultured cells fulfilled the criteria generally accepted for glomerular MCs previously described (4Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Lab.

[3H]Thymidine incorporation was performed to assess the DNA synthesis rate. The mesangial cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the incubation continued for another 24 h. Various concentrations of compounds (1, 25(OH)2D3, OCT, or vehicle) and [3H]thymidine (1 m Ci/ml, 1 μCi/well, NEN Life Science Products) were then added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h in 2.0% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (16Doi T. Striker L.J. Elliot S.J. Conti F.G. Striker G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Total RNA was isolated from mesangial cells using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was analyzed by a RNase protection assay with the following probes. The RNA probes were prepared by linearizing the PvuII fragment of Col IV (α1) from p1234, the HindIII fragment of SMA from pSA2HE, the ApaI fragment of Col I (α2) from pGM101, and the EcoRI fragment of GAPDH from pMGAP1 (17Oberbaumer I.

A fragment of mouse RII cDNA (196 base pairs) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the primer pair 5′-GCAAGTTTTGCGATGTGAGA-3′ and 5′-GCATCTTCCAGAGTGAAGCC-3′, according to the sequence published by Suzuki et al. (20Suzuki A. Shioda N. Maeda T. Tada M. Ueno N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was confirmed to be the RII cDNA by DNA sequencing and was cloned into a pCR II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). After digesting the plasmid with SacI, an antisense riboprobe was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, which protects a 196-base pair fragment. The RNA probe (4 × 105 cpm) and the test RNA were hybridized overnight at 45 °C. RNase A (40 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml) were added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The RNase resistant fragments were analyzed by 3.5 or 7% polyacrylamide-8m urea gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (5Iehara N. Takeoka H. Tsuji H. Imabayashi T. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R.

The protected bands for each RNA probe had the same size as the coding sequence for the specific mRNA, thus providing evidence for their specificity, and were evaluated by densitometric analysis. The cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml and plated onto 24-well plates (500 μl/well) in the presence of either 10 μg/ml TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) or a control normal IgG. After 3 h of incubation different concentrations of vitamin D3 compounds were added as indicated. The cells were allowed to grow for 72 h without changing the medium followed by the determination of the [3H]thymidine incorporation as described above. The cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes and allowed to reach 70–80% confluency. The medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of fresh B medium. The cells were then treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, OCT, or vehicle only for 24 h. Following this treatment, the conditioned medium was collected, and the indicated volumes were used to treat mink lung epithelial cells plated on 96-well plates at a density of 1500 cells/well. In addition, a standard TGF-β growth inhibition curve was generated by treating the cells with various concentrations of TGF-β1. The mink lung epithelial cells were allowed to incubate for 3 days, at which time the medium was removed and replaced by 100 μl of fresh medium. The colonies were immediately visualized by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) for 2 h. The stained cells were solubilized with Me2SO (Sigma), and the relative cell numbers were determined by the resultant absorbance at 595 nm. The Col IV (α1) promoter/enhancer/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct (p56) has been previously described (22Burbelo P.D. Bruggeman L.A. Gabriel G.C. Klotman P.E. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22297-22302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construct SMP-1 contains 1074 base pairs of the proximal 5′-flanking region plus 43 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region of the SMA gene cloned into theSalI-BamHI site of the SV40 enhancer containing CAT vector pBLCAT3 (23Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Next, 4 × 105 cells were plated on a 60-mm dish and transfected with plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each transfection, 2 μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) (internal control for transfection efficiency) were used. Forty eight hours after the start of the transfection the cells were harvested and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity (24Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O.

CAT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or β-galactosidase (Promega) was used as the standard, and pSV0CAT and pSV2CAT were used for negative (0%) and positive (100%) controls, respectively (26Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). A correction factor for differences in the transfection efficiency was obtained by normalizing the CAT activity to the β-galactosidase activity and then subtracting the background level, as determined by transfection with pSV0CAT. The final value was expressed as the relative CAT activity. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test. The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its analog on the cell proliferation of MC-E and MC-L cells were investigated by assessing the [3H]thymidine incorporation following treatment by these compounds. Both 1,25(OH)2D3 and OCT inhibited DNA incorporation of the MC-E cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of OCT is more prominent than that of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.1 A). In contrast, these compounds did not significantly affect the MC-L cells (Fig.1 B). The mRNAs for SMA, Col IV, and GAPDH were easily detectable in the untreated MC-E cells (Fig. 2 A), whereas Col I mRNA was poorly detected. After exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or OCT, the OCT treatment showed an approximately 1.5- and 4-fold induction of SMA and Col IV mRNA respectively, whereas the expression levels of Col I remained unchanged. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment did not result in any change. In contrast, treatment with these compounds showed no change in the SMA and Col IV mRNA expression of the MC-L cells (Fig. 2 B); however, the Col I mRNA levels were increased 2.2-fold in the OCT-treated MC-L cells. The GAPDH mRNA levels were equivalent in all cells. Transcriptional activity was investigated by transiently transfecting cells with fusion constructs containing a promoter/enhancer/CAT reporter for each gene. The OCT-treated cells or control cells were transfected with the target constructs. The transcriptional activity of the SMA gene promoter was analyzed by the construct SMP-1, which contained the SMA promoter, the SV40 enhancer, and the CAT reporter gene. The CAT activity was increased 3.7-fold in the OCT-treated cells as compared with the control cells, demonstrating that OCT enhanced the transcriptional activity of the SMA gene. A p56 construct was used to evaluate the transcriptional activity of Col IV. OCT induced a 9.4-fold increase in CAT activity as compared with the control, thus indicating that OCT significantly stimulated the promoter activity of the Col IV (α1) gene (Fig. 3). These data suggest that increased mRNA levels for SMA and Col IV (α1) induced by OCT were because of increased promoter activity in their genes. To elucidate the correlation between TGF-β and vitamin D3 sensitivity, a TGF-β-neutralizing antibody assay was performed. At 10 μg/ml, the TGF-β-neutralizing antibody reversed the inhibitory effects of vitamin D3 and its analog OCT; the antibody generated an approximately 50% increase in DNA synthesis as compared with normal chicken IgG treatment, in a dose-dependent manner, on MC-E cells (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the MC-L cells did not respond to the TGF-β-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4 B), thus indicating a lack of induction of autocrine TGF-β activity. These results indicate that the proliferation inhibitory mechanisms of vitamin D3 involve the induction of TGF-β activity in MC-E cells. Moreover, the addition of TGF-β-neutralizing antibody attenuated the up-regulated mRNA levels (data not shown). The increased autocrine TGF-β activity could have resulted from the enhanced expression of TGF-β and/or its receptors. To test these possibilities, an inhibition bioassay on mink lung epithelial cells was performed. As a standard, the addition of TGF-β1 inhibited the proliferation of MC-E cells in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). Conditioned medium from 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−6m) or OCT (10−6m)-treated and -untreated MC-E cells was added to mink lung epithelial cells. After exposure to either treated or untreated conditioned medium, no significant differences in proliferation inhibition were observed in the mink lung epithelial cells (Fig. 5). Similarly, no significant differences in proliferation inhibitory effects were observed in the MC-L cells (data not shown). Moreover, the other conditioned medium, 10−10 or 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3 or OCT, resulted in no significant difference. These results demonstrated that vitamin D3 compounds did not alter the activation of secreted growth and/or inhibitory cytokines from MC-E cells, one of which is likely to be TGF-β1. Furthermore, these results also suggest that the enhanced TGF-β autocrine activity by the vitamin D3compounds did not result from the modulation of ligand activation. The other possibility for the increased autocrine TGF-β activity following treatment with vitamin D3 compounds was the induction of receptor expression; therefore, we determined whether 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analog could modulate the expression of RII mRNA. 1,25(OH)2D3(10−6m) or OCT (10−6m) were utilized to determine the kinetic effects on RII expression. MC-E cells untreated with vitamin D3 compounds expressed RII mRNA 6-fold higher than MC-L cells. After exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 and OCT, a 2.1- and 4.5-fold increase, respectively, in RII mRNA expression levels in MC-E cells was observed. On the other hand, OCT-treated MC-L cells showed a 1.8-fold increase in their RII mRNA levels, but no significant modulation was noted in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated MC-L cells (Fig. 6). MCs possess a specific smooth muscle phenotype including contractile properties, an extensive array of microfilaments, and the production of basement components. In several studies, cultured MCs exhibited an increasingly dedifferentiated phenotype as they were passaged (27Venkatachalam M.A. Kreisberg J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C48-C55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Floege J. Radeke H.R. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 360-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These dedifferentiated MCs can produce interstitial collagen and gain the capability to proliferate. In this study, we first demonstrated that a vitamin D3 analog could induce a smooth muscle phenotype in cultured MCs. The induction of smooth muscle phenotype could be related to TGF-β signaling. However, active TGF-β levels were not enhanced by the vitamin D3compounds in this study. The increased cellular responsiveness to TGF-β was correlated with a significant induction of RII expression by the vitamin D3 analog. This study suggests that the vitamin D3 analog may be a new modulator for the smooth muscle phenotype and that the mechanisms underlying this process are tightly related to the regulation of RII expression. The signal transduction of TGF-β is mediated via two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, RI and RII. RII is the primary binding protein for ligands and is the most important for signal transduction. RII transactivates RI, which transduces various signals via the Smad family (29Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 30Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H.

Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the levels of RII mRNA expression. The low expression of RII mRNA in the MC-L cells supports the connection that there was no inhibition of cell proliferation because of the vitamin D3 compounds. Increased RII mRNA expression was observed after treatment with OCT rather than 1,25(OH)2D3 in the MC-E cells, corresponding to the higher ability of OCT to inhibit cell proliferation. The TGF-β-neutralizing antibody prevented inhibitory effects of cell proliferation by vitamin D3 compounds. These effects seemed to be correlated with the increasing amounts in RII expression induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 or OCT. Therefore, these data suggest that TGF-β signal transduction significantly prevents these effects of vitamin D3compounds. Moreover, the stimulatory and inhibitory Smad families may alter the feedback after OCT treatment. Thus, 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analog can inhibit cell proliferation through the induction of negative autocrine TGF-β activity. However, the effective dose of 1,25(OH)2D3, which could induce negative autocrine TGF-β activity would also cause hypercalcemia, thus leading to unwanted adverse effects. To overcome this problem, 1,25(OH)2D3 analogs such as OCT have been developed that have increased potency and a reduced hypercalcemic effect (32Murayama E. Miyamoto K. Kubodera N. Mori T. Matsunaga I. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1986; 34: 4410-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that the analog OCT has similar effects as 1,25(OH)2D3 at lower concentrations, which make it an attractive and potential anti-proliferative agent against proliferative glomerulonephritis. The marked induction of differentiation caused by OCT was similar to the phenomena observed in leukemia cells, T cells, breast cancer cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes (2Abe J. Morikawa M.

To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the progression of glomerular injuries, it is indispensable to appreciate the phenotypic changes as well as the proliferation of mesangial cells. TGF-β has been implicated in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and other mesenchyme-derived cells during development (36Zentella A. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5176-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For example, the TGF-β treatment of human smooth muscle cells (37Bjorkerud S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 892-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), granulation tissue myofibroblasts (38Desmouliere A. Geinoz A. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar), and pericytes (39Verbeek M.M. Otte-Holler I. Wesseling P. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 372-382PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to increase the expression of SMA, a marker of differentiated smooth muscle cells (40Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for this phenotypic modulation and differentiation in cultured MCs is as yet poorly understood. Furthermore, OCT may offer an advantage in that the induction of the autocrine negative TGF-β activity occurs through RII and not the TGF-β ligand and thus could avoid damaging adjacent tissues. A dedifferentiated smooth muscle phenotype can be observed in cultured MCs after multiple passages. These dedifferentiated cells have decreased RII expression and have lost their responsiveness to TGF-β, which may be related to the dedifferentiation process. On the other hand, RII can be detected on MCs in vivo according to our recent observations. These findings suggest that RII could be a key regulator of MC differentiation and that OCT is an important modulator for RII expression. Further work is in progress to clarify the role of RII in the differentiation mechanisms of MCs in vivo andin vitro."

We recently purified a two-enzyme complex made up of two molecules of dimeric phosphoribulokinase (EC.2.7.1.19) (PRK) 1The abbreviations used are: PRK, phosphoribulokinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ru-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate1The abbreviations used are: PRK, phosphoribulokinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ru-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and two molecules of tetrameric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC.1.2.1.13) from the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells (13Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These enzymes are involved in the so-called Benson-Calvin cycle, responsible for the assimilation of carbon dioxide (14McDonald F.D. Buchanan B.B. Amez J. Photosynthesis. New Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1987: 175-197Google Scholar, 15Bowyer J.R. Leegood R.C. Dey P.M. Harbone J.B. Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1997: 49-110Crossref Google Scholar). Phosphoribulokinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the CO2 acceptor. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in this cycle catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate with NAD(P)H as a cofactor. The Benson-Calvin cycle is regulated by light via several mechanisms, including pH, the magnesium and metabolite concentrations, and the reduction of target enzymes by thioredoxins (16Heldt H.W.

The chloroplast enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoribulokinase are all suitable for studying how a signal (light) can act as a regulator (21Pradel J. Soulié J.M. Buc J. Meunier J.C. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 113: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Cadet F. Meunier J.C. Biochem.

In prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms, light regulates the PRK (octamer of 32 kDa subunits (24Runquist J.A. Harrison D.H. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) via positive allosteric activator NADH, whose intracellular concentration is light-dependent. AMP is also a negative effector (25Tabita R.F. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 155-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, light regulates eukaryotic PRK (dimer of 40 kDa) via breaking disulfide bridges (26Porter M.A. Stringer C. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

The sulfhydryl/disulfide exchange reactions between the target enzyme and thioredoxin activate the enzyme. The nonphysiological reducing agent, dithiothreitol, can mimic this effect in vitro. Contrary to a common belief, oxidized phosphoribulokinase may have quite significant activity when associated with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or when dissociated from this enzyme upon dilution of the complex (31Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so it may acquire new kinetic properties due to the conformation changes resulting from protein-protein interactions. There is little doubt that chloroplast phosphoribulokinase becomes reduced by the thioredoxin system (26Porter M.A. Stringer C. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

It has also been shown in vitro that reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or reduced thioredoxin cause the dissociation of the bi-enzyme complex (13Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may wonder whether there exists a reduced bi-enzyme complex that may have kinetic properties different from either its oxidized state or to the “free” oxidized and reduced forms of PRK. This study was therefore carried out to look for a reduced bi-enzyme complex and compare its properties. We have examined the influence of protein-protein interactions in this complex on reaction mechanism, substrate binding, and kinetic parameters and whether information is still transferred from reduced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to reduced phosphoribulokinase. The answers to these important questions should provide a better understanding of carbon metabolism, as it is well documented that the enzymes are predominantly in a reduced state in illuminated chloroplasts. Ru-5-P, xylulose 5-phosphate, and RuBP were obtained from Sigma. Ribose 5-phosphate, ATP, and DTT were supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The wild type WM3− strain of C. reinhardtii was mixotrophically grown at 25 °C on Tris-acetate-phosphate medium at a light intensity of about 2500 lux (34Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Source Book. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. 1st Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 25-31Google Scholar). The bi-enzyme complex made up of PRK and GAPDH and the isolated PRK were purified as described previously (13Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PRK activity was continuously monitored in a spectrophotometric assay in which generation of ADP was coupled to NADH oxidation via phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (35Gontero B. Cardenas M.L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213934) Google Scholar). The experimental data were fitted to the equations developed in the text, with Simplex (37Nelder J.A. Mead R. Computer J. 1965; 7: 308-313Crossref Google Scholar) or Marquardt (38Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) algorithms using a VAX computer. The bi-enzyme complex was not dissociated by incubation with 5 mm DTT for 1 h, and the integrity of the complex was checked by electrophoresis under native conditions (data not shown). The PRK activity of this mixture was then monitored using fixed concentrations of both substrates (ATP and Ru-5-P) without reducing agents (Fig. 1). The lag was similar to the curve obtained with the bi-enzyme complex under the oxidized state (31Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was probably due to dissociation of the bi-enzyme complex upon dilution in the assay cuvette. It corresponds to the conversion of the PRK inserted in the complex in a dissociated form, the so-called metastable PRK. This curve may be fitted to q=PTp(1)t+(p(1)−p(2))k*(e−k*t−1)Equation 1 where q is the product of the reaction catalyzed by PRK, and k* is the apparent dissociation rate constant of the bi-enzyme complex. p(1) is the steady-state rate, andp(2) is the initial velocity. The parameter p(1) is the rate of the metastable form of PRK, and p(2) is the rate of the PRK in the complex. P T is the total protein concentration. This equation is similar to an expression given by Neet and Ainslie (39Neet K.E. Ainslie G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 192-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) in a different context (31Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The distribution of the residuals was much better when the bi-enzyme complex was assumed to be active, which implies p(2) ≠ 0. The metastable form was more active than the PRK in the complex (Fig. 1). The effects of the substrates on the apparent dissociation rate constant (k*) of the complex to the metastable form of PRK (Fig. 2) were examined. Ru-5-P tended to stabilize the complex, whereas ATP only slightly destabilized it. We then measured the kinetic parameters of the PRK in the complex and the reduced metastable form. Another form of PRK, the isolated stable form, can be obtained during purification (13Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This form may also be reduced by DTT, and its kinetic parameters can be measured. All the enzyme forms followed Michaelis-Menten law with both substrates (Ru-5-P and ATP), (Table I). These data also allow comparison of the oxidized and reduced states of these various forms of PRK. The reduced metastable PRK seemed to be more stable than the oxidized form. Oxidizing the reduced metastable form with glutathione and reducing it again with DTT gave the same values for the kinetic parameters as those of the stable reduced enzyme (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters for the different forms of PRK in oxidized and reduced statesKinetic parametersOxido-reduction statesEnzyme formsRu-5-PATPK m(μm)Stable PRK11589OxidizedPRK inserted in the complex3046Metastable PRK5948Stable PRK5555ReducedPRK inserted in the complex6160Metastable PRK9451k cat(s−1/site)Stable PRK0.0620.065OxidizedPRK inserted in the complex3.253.25Metastable PRK56.356.5Stable PRK23.323ReducedPRK inserted in the complex32.432.7Metastable PRK300303.8k cat/K mStable PRK0.540.73(mm−1s−1/site)OxidizedPRK inserted in the complex10870Metastable PRK9541177Stable PRK424418ReducedPRK inserted in the complex531545Metastable PRK31915957The parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Open table in a new tab The parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Experiments were done at least 10 times, and the S.E. on all parameters was less than 5%. We determined the mechanism of substrate binding to PRK using inhibition by one of the products (RuBP) of the reduced enzymes. The method of alternative substrates, which can discriminate between homeomorphic kinetic models (40Ricard J. Noat G. Got C. Borel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was used instead of inhibition by ADP. Various concentrations of RuBP were placed in the assay cuvette with one substrate concentration held constant and the other varied (Fig.3). The reaction was started by adding reduced complex. This product is competitive relative to Ru-5-P and noncompetitive relative to ATP for the stable reduced enzyme but was noncompetitive for both substrates for reduced PRK. When it was in the bi-enzyme complex and in the metastable state (it is impossible to discriminate between random and ordered sequential kinetic mechanism), an alternative substrate (S 1′) to Ru-5-P (S 1) such as xylulose 5-phosphate or ribose-5-phosphate was used. The rate expressions do not take into account the order in which products (ADP or RuBP) are released in the method of alternative substrates. Kinetic experiments were performed with the ATP concentration constant and variable concentrations of Ru-5-P or alternative substrates. The data were fitted using the Dalziel formalism (41Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar), [E]0V=Î¦0+Î¦1[S1]+Î¦2[S2]+Î¦12[S1][S2]Equation 2 where [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration,V the maximal velocity, and the parameters (Φn) correspond to the Dalziel coefficients. S 1 is Ru-5-P, and S 2 is ATP. With an alternative substrate, S 1 becomesS′1, and the (Φn) coefficients become Φ′n. These Dalziel coefficients, a priori, are quite different. Nonetheless, constraints between these parameters may emerge using the models shown in Fig. 4(40Ricard J. Noat G. Got C. Borel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Figure 4Possible two-substrate kinetic mechanisms with an alternative substrate.

For an ordered model with S1 binding after S2 (Fig. 4 B), there are two constraints, Φ2 = Φ′ 2and Φ12/Φ1 = Φ′12/Φ′1. For a random mechanism (Fig.4 C), the mathematical development only leads to Φ12/Φ1 = Φ′12/Φ′1. All (Φn) and (Φ′n) parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to Dalziel equations (Table II).Table IIDalziel coefficients with alternative substratesSubstratesStable reduced PRKReduced PRK inserted in the complexMetastable reduced PRKΦ2(Φ12/Φ1)Φ2(Φ12/Φ1)Φ2(Φ12/Φ1)Ru-5-P7.76 × 10−4 ± 1.2 × 10−42.5 × 10−2 ± 5.2 × 10−30.11 ± 0.064.3 × 10−5 ± 2.3 × 10−60.028 ± 7 × 10−3Ri5P9 × 10−4 ± 1.5 × 10−41.2 × 10−2 ± 4.2 × 10−30.12 ± 0.023.7 × 10−5 ± 4.7 × 10−60.023 ± 4 × 10−3Xu5P1.3 × 10−3 ± 2.1 × 10−41.7 × 10−2 ± 5.3 × 10−30.13 ± 0.014.8 × 10−5 ± 1.3 × 10−50.028 ± 6.7 × 10−3All these parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to Dalziel equations.

Ri5P, ribose 5-phosphate; Xu5P, xylulose 5-phosphate. None of the constraints mentioned above was found with the stable reduced PRK. This, plus the product inhibition data, point to Ru-5-P binding first and RuBP being the last product to be released. The situations were quite different for reduced PRK in the complex and the metastable form. The parameters Φ2 and Φ′2were not required in Dalziel equation for reduced, complexed PRK. Thus, Φ12/Φ1 = Φ′12/Φ′1 and, therefore, the models B and C could account for the results obtained with the complex. The double-reciprocal plots of the ATP intersect on the rate axis indicated that ATP was bound first (data not shown). The inhibition study, and particularly the noncompetitive inhibition of RuBP relative to Ru-5-P, also supported this conclusion. We therefore adopted the ordered model (Fig. 4 B) with ATP binding first. The constraints obtained with the reduced metastable PRK and the results of RuBP inhibition indicated that the mechanism is ordered, with ATP binding first and ADP being the last product to be released. Therefore, the PRK in the complex and the PRK resulting from the dissociation of the complex have the same kinetic mechanism. The complex and metastable PRKs also behave quite similarly with regard to RuBP inhibition. These results indicated that PRK bore the imprinting from GAPDH or retained for a while the conformation it had in the complex. But the kinetic parameters (K m andk cat) were different. The kinetic parameters and the kinetic mechanism of the metastable form were different from those of the stable one. The differences between the kinetic parameters were used to quantify the imprinting effect of GAPDH on PRK, which altered the kinetic parameters. Thermodynamic analysis (42Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) can be used to express the K m and k cat with stabilization-destabilization energy terms which take into account the protein-protein interactions; thus, K¯μ=K¯ςexp(−(Ψ0,γ−Ψ1,γ)/RT)Equation 3 and kμ=kςexp(−(Ψ1,γ−Ψ0,τ)/RT)Equation 4 where K μ, K ς ,k μ, and k ς are the apparent association constants (equivalent to 1/K m) of the substrates (either ATP or Ru-5-P) and the catalytic constants (k cat) of the metastable (μ) and stable (ς) forms of PRK. Similarly, the catalytic efficiency of the metastable form ( K μ k μ) may be defined as the following. K¯μkμ=K¯ςkςexp(−(Ψ0,γ−Ψ0,τ)/RT)Equation 5 The differences (ψ0γ − ψ1,γ), (ψ1,γ − ψ0,τ), and (ψ0,γ − ψ0,τ) are stabilization-destabilization energies. They therefore reflect the apparent free energies of substrate binding (ΔG) and activation (ΔG≠) associated with the reaction catalyzed by the stable and the metastable forms of PRK (TableIII). The imprinting effect of GAPDH on PRK may be assessed through thermodynamic boxes, which associate the free energies of the processes catalyzed by the two forms of PRK (Fig.5).Table IIIThermodynamic parameters for stable and metastable reduced PRKRu-5-PATPΨ0,γ − Ψ1,γ(kJ/mol)1.24 ± 0.18± 0.2Ψ1,γ − Ψ0,τ (kJ/mol)−6.08 ± 0.2−6.1 ± 0.2Ψ0,γ − Ψ0,τ (kJ/mol)−4.84 ± 0.12−6.35 ± 0.16ΔGς (kJ/mol)−23.5 ± 0.4−23.53 ± 0.42ΔGμ (kJ/mol)−22.26 ± 0.02−23.7 ± 0.02ΔGς≠(kJ/mol)63.81 ± 0.0763.84 ± 0.12ΔGμ≠ (kJ/mol)57.73 ± 0.0357.74 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab We have shown that PRK may exist in a reduced stable or metastable form and as part of a bi-enzyme complex. The reduced bi-enzyme complex can depolymerize in vitro to a metastable form. This conversion is substrate-dependent and tends to be prevented by Ru-5-P rather than ATP. Dissociation is due to dilution, as it also occurs with the oxidized bi-enzyme complex (31Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The rate of conversion (k*) is faster than that of the oxidized enzyme; reduction weakens the bi-enzyme complex (13Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For instance, at 1 mmATP and 1 mm Ru-5-P, the value of k* is about 0.1 min−1 for the oxidized bi-enzyme complex and up to 1 min−1 for the reduced one. Thus, the conversion of the complex to the metastable form of PRK is 10-fold faster under reducing conditions than under oxidizing conditions. Although oxidized PRK is active when bound to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, reduced PRK is much more active (Table I). All the reduced forms of PRK are more active than their oxidized counterparts. But the K m values of the oxidized and reduced PRK are very similar. The increase ink cat, with no major change inK m, results in a greater catalytic efficiency. This is without doubt of physiological relevance, since PRK is in a reduced state upon illumination (18Faske M. Holtgrefe S. Ocheretina O. Meister M. Backhausen J.E. Scheibe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Porter M.A. Stringer C. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

The published kinetic parameters of the isolated reduced PRK are quite similar to those we obtained with the metastable reduced form. The K mand the k cat for the metastable enzyme are quite similar to those of Roesler and Ogren (43Roesler K.R. Ogren W.L Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Extraction and purification are usually done in 10 mm DTT, which destroys the bi-enzyme complex. Hence, the authors probably studied the metastable reduced form. This form of the enzyme persists for some time in the presence of DTT, and conversion to the stable form is slowed down. The kinetic parameters of the oxidized reduced PRK are similar to those of the oxidized stable PRK. If this form is reduced again with DTT, the kinetic parameters are those of the reduced stable enzyme, which is less active. Thus, PRK is influenced by being a partner of GAPDH in a supramolecular unit. The stable oxidized PRK and PRK in the complex have different kinetic properties because information is transferred between PRK and GAPDH via conformation changes (5Ricard J. Gontero B. Avilan L. Lebreton S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1231-1248Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 42Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have not detected any difference in the kinetic parameters (K m andk cat) of the stable reduced form of PRK and the PRK in the complex, but this does not rule out the possibility that information is transferred, since the kinetic mechanism is dramatically changed. Ru-5-P binds first to the stable reduced form, but ATP is the first substrate when this enzyme is bound to GAPDH. The simplest explanation for this is that GAPDH is involved. The metastable form even seems to retain the “memory” or the “imprint” (5Ricard J. Gontero B. Avilan L. Lebreton S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1231-1248Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) of GAPDH for a while after its release from the bi-enzyme complex and behaves according to the ordered kinetic model, with ATP binding first. Therefore, not only is information transferred between GAPDH and PRK, but there is also a imprinting by GAPDH on PRK. The catalytic efficiency of the metastable form of PRK (Table I) is 10-fold greater than that of the isolated reduced PRK. This is probably due to the memory of a conformation change that results from the interaction between PRK and GAPDH. The difference between the catalytic constants of the metastable PRK and of PRK in the bi-enzyme complex results from the greater flexibility of the metastable enzyme in solution. This flexibility is compatible with the great freedom required for catalysis. The information transfer corresponds to stabilization-destabilization energies, which come from a conformation change in PRK within the complex. These energies are stored during association and are used after disruption via the imprinting effect. The difference in free activation energies (Table III) of the metastable and stable reduced forms of PRK corresponds to energy transferred from GAPDH to PRK by imprinting. This stabilization energy (−6 kJ/mol) helps lower the energy barrier during catalysis. Thermodynamic analysis also shows that imprinting has no effect on the apparent pseudo-affinity constant for ATP and only a slight effect on that for Ru-5-P. This effect relies on a destabilization energy (1.24 kJ/mol). Despite this destabilization energy, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) expressed by- K μkμ is higher for metastable PRK than for the stable form. The difference (ψ0,γ − ψ0,τ) responsible for a best catalytic efficiency corresponds to a fraction (around −5.5 kJ/mol) of the energy stored by PRK when associated with GAPDH. PRK and GAPDH are associated and use ATP and NADPH produced by the primary phase of photosynthesis. Thus, the bi-enzyme complex may allow concerted regulation of these two enzymes and, therefore, may be defined as a “unit control.” As a consequence, the study of isolated enzymes, although necessary, must be biased. The “unit control” that is the bi-enzyme complex is the starting point of regulation by light. Even if the complex dissociates, a conformation change resulting from a depolymerization in vitro probably governs regulation. Therefore, the effects of pH, metabolites, and thioredoxin activation must all be examined using this supramolecular entity. One possible function of this enzyme complex in eukaryotic cells may be to maintain, permanently or temporarily, some enzymes in a state of “super reactivity.” The protein-protein interactions between PRK and GAPDH may well provide for the fine regulation of the Benson-Calvin cycle.

Other studies suggested that the NGF/NGFR and the FGF/FGFR transduction pathways are interdependent. For example, in the early stages of embryonic chicken development, FGFR mRNAs are expressed, and the decline of their presence is accompanied by NGFR mRNA expression and, ultimately, by a new round of de novo FGFR transcription (7Heuer J.G. von Bartheld C.S. Kinoshita Y. Evers P.C. Bothwell M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 283-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, FGF-2 stimulates NGFR gene promoter activity in a human neuroblastoma-derived cell line (8Taiji M. Taiji K. Deyerle K.L. Bothwell M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and acts in synergy with NGF in neuronal stem cell differentiation and proliferation (9Cattaneo E. McKay R. Nature. 1990; 347: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations imply that in the nervous system NGF and FGFs intervene alternatively and sequentially in neuronal differentiation and are, to some extent, interdependent and co-regulated. The PC12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma-derived cell line differentiates either into sympathetic neuron-like cells or into chromaffin-like cells (10Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). NGF, FGF-1, or FGF-2 differentiate PC12 cells into cells morphologically and biochemically resembling sympathetic neurons (11Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell.

NGF signal transduction is mediated through the activation of tyrosine kinase cell surface receptors (13Scimeca J.C. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NGF transduction pathways proceeded through p21ras (14Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S.

Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). The activation of the MAPK by NGF is insufficient, however, to mediate differentiation of PC12 cells (17Vaillancourt R.R. Heasly L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that other transduction pathways involving Shc, phospholipase C-γ, or yet unidentified MAPK kinase-dependent pathways (18Obermeier A.

FGFs also signal through the activation of tyrosine kinase cell surface receptors. Four different structurally related FGF receptor sub-families (FGFR-1 to FGFR-4) have been identified, but little is known about the intracellular downstream signaling. However, it seems to involve Grb2/Sos and the MAPK pathway (20Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

We report that FGFRs expression and activity are modulated by NGF. Furthermore, we show that endogenous FGF-2 expression is induced by NGF and participates in FGFR activation. Finally, we demonstrate that the NGF-induced transduction pathways involving FGFRs depend upon SLP/FRS activation and sustained MAPK activity. The hypothesis that in the nervous system, FGFR and FGF-2 are part of NGF signaling is discussed.

The 2′-amino-2′-deoxypyrimidine-containing RNA (31Jellinek D. Green L.S. Bell C. Lynott C.K. Gill N. Vargeese C. Kirshenheuter G. McGee D.P.C. Abesinghe P. Pieken W. Shapiro R. Rifkin D.B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11363-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was further stabilized against nucleases by substituting 9 ribopurines with 2′-deoxy-2′-O-methylpurines and adding phosphorothioate caps to the 5′ and 3′ ends. These changes were incorporated in ligand NX-286: (5′-P)GGUGUGUGGAAGA CAGC GGG U GG UUC(3′-P), where (5′-P) and (3′-P) represent the phosphorothioate caps (5′-d(TsTsTsTsTs) and d(TsTsTsTsTs-3′), with “s”representing the phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage), 2′-amino-2′-deoxypyrimidine nucleotides are italicized, and 2′-deoxy-2′-O-methylpurine nucleotides are underlined. NX-286 binds to FGF-2 with a K d of 0.8 ± 0.2 × 10−9 and to NGF with a K d>10−6m. The sequence-scrambled analogue of this ligand, scNX-286, (5′P) AGGU GGGAGCGUG G UU GA CGUGUGC A(3′P)), or vascular endothelial growth factor ligand, NX-213 (32Green L.S. Jellinek D. Bell C.

(Lond.). 1995; 2: 683-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), binds to FGF-2 with about 103-fold lower affinity and was used as a control. The different FGF-2 binding molecules were added 10 min before NGF or FGF-2 treatment at 100–500 nm. Human recombinant FGF-2 (Synergen, Boulder, CO; 10 μg) was iodinated with 1 mCi of125I (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) by the Iodo-Gen method (Pierce) to a specific activity of about 7.5 × 104 cpm/ng. Murine 2.5 S NGF (Promega, Madison, WI; 10 μg) was iodinated by the same method to a specific activity of about 1.85 × 105 cpm/ng. After treatment with 30 ng/ml NGF in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% horse serum (maintained throughout this work) for the indicated periods of time, cells were treated as described previously (29Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The determination of the number of FGF-2 binding sites and the dissociation constants was analyzed according to Scatchard (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for 125I-NGF binding except that cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH. Cross-linking experiments were performed and analyzed as described (29Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The quantity of protein used in each experiment was normalized to and corresponded to that of 106 cells. Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 cells. RNA/106 cells along the first 96 h of differentiation was quantified and used as a standard (8.5 μg up to 15 μg in PC12 or PCN1 cells). RNA was then subjected to Northern blot experiments with the indicated [α-32P]dCTP random primed-labeled probes. Cells (1 to 3 × 107) were treated as described by Rabin et al. (24Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Proteins (corresponding to 106 cells) were either directly fractionated by a 15% SDS-PAGE or, alternatively, first adsorbed overnight at 4 °C on 100 μl of 50% heparin-Sepharose solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Conditioned media were incubated with 100 μl of 50% heparin-Sepharose solution. The heparin-Sepharose slurry was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, washed twice in the same buffer, and electrophoresed. P13suc-1-agarose capture on membrane fractions and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (24Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim P.Y. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Isolated protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto ImmobilonP. The membrane was incubated with antibodies raised against either 18-kDa FGF-2 (Ref. 29Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar; 1:150) or the specific high molecular weight region of FGF-2 (Ref. 29Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar; 1:150). The other antibodies utilized in this study were anti-ERK-1, -ERK-2, -FRS-2, -Grb2, -FGFR-1, and -FGFR-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-Shc (34Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W-J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), anti-phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs). Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence. NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) was used as recommended by the manufacturer to label 8 × 106 cells either before or after a 5-min treatment by NGF. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Lysates were incubated with anti-FGF-2 antibodies for 16–20 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. Immuno complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto ImmobilonP, then biotinylated proteins were revealed with the Vector Biotin/Avidin System (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and detected by chemiluminescence. Phosphorylation of the myelin basic protein by ERK-1 or ERK-2 immunocomplexes was done as described elsewhere (35Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that FGFRs are present before the initiation of differentiation of PC12 cells (31Jellinek D. Green L.S. Bell C. Lynott C.K. Gill N. Vargeese C. Kirshenheuter G. McGee D.P.C. Abesinghe P. Pieken W. Shapiro R. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. Janjic N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11363-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To monitor the evolution of the FGFRs in the early stages of NGF-induced differentiation, we carried out binding experiments with 125I-FGF-2 on PC12 cells treated for 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h with NGF. No competition between FGF-2 and NGF was observed (data not shown). After 2 h of NGF treatment, the level of FGF-2 binding to low affinity binding sites (proteo-heparan sulfates) increased by 7-fold and returned to the initial level after 24 h (Fig.1 A) as described previously (36Katoh-Semba R. Oohira A. Kashiwamata S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Binding of FGF-2 to its high affinity sites after NGF treatment resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in binding detected after 6 h, maybe because of a cooperation with low affinity binding sites and at 48 h (Fig. 1 A). No change in FGF-2 binding was observed when cells were treated with EGF (not shown). To characterize the membrane-associated molecules that bind FGF-2, cross-linking experiments were carried out during NGF treatment as indicated above. Fig. 1 B depicts a ∼157-kDa cross-linked complex, and similar to the binding experiments, the abundance of this complex was highest at 6 and 48 h. Cross-linking of 125I-FGF-2 was competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled FGF-2 (not shown). Additional bands of lower molecular weight were detected during NGF treatment (121 kDa more so at 48 h; 103 kDa at 2, 6, 12, and 48 h and, 83 kDa at 2 and 6 h; Fig. 1 B). The number and dissociation constants (K d) of125I-FGF-2 binding to FGF receptors were determined by Scatchard analysis (33Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar) in either untreated or 48-h NGF-treated cells. Two classes of receptor binding sites (class 1: K d = 134 ± 27 pm, number of sites = 1.6 ± 0.7 fmol/106 cells; class 2: K d = 877 ± 125 pm, number of sites = 5.12 ± 1.1 fmol/106 cells) were detected in untreated PC12 cells. After NGF treatment (48 h), the following binding values were observed: class 1, K d = 160 ± 11 pm, number of sites = 3.6 ± 0.2 fmol/106 cells; class 2:K d = 457 ± 55 pm, number of sites = 7.7 ± 2 fmol/106 cells (Fig.1 C). 125I-FGF-2 cross-linked material from untreated or NGF-treated cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR antibodies. FGFR-1 (∼160 kDa) and FGFR-2 (∼157 kDa) were principally present in PC12 cells under NGF treatment at 48 and 6 h, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Northern blotting experiments with either one of the four specific probes for FGFR-1 to FGFR-4 was performed. The FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 probes hybridized to the blots (Fig. 2 B) but not the FGFR-3 or the FGFR-4 probes (not shown). One 4-kb FGFR-1 and two FGFR-2 (2.3 kb and 2.9 kb) transcripts were identified. FGFR-1 mRNA was present before NGF stimulation, and its quantity increased by 2–3-fold during the first 60 min of NGF treatment and subsequently decreased to the initial level. The 2.9-kb FGFR-2 mRNA was present after 10 min of NGF treatment and disappeared after 60 min (Fig. 2 B). The 2.3-kb transcript was present in untreated cells, and its amount increased between 30 to 60 min and dramatically decreased between 2 and 6 h. A sudden increase of the 2.9-kb mRNA after 48 h was also observed, and its presence might be required for survival. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that FGFR-2 exon IIIc was present in PC12 cells before NGF induction, and both IIIb and IIIc exons were present after 72 h of NGF or FGF treatment (data not shown). Activation of FGFRs was assessed in PC12 cells at early times after NGF treatment. Interestingly FGFR-1 as well as FGFR-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated after 10 min up to 2 h of NGF stimulation (Fig. 2 C). PC12 cells were electroporated with a cDNA encoding a dominant negative FGFR-2, which inhibits signaling not only of an identical FGFR but also of the other FGFRs (37Ueno H. Gunn M. Dell K. Tseng Jr., A. Williams L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1470-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNFGFR-2-expressing clones were identified by125I-FGF-2 binding (not shown) and cross-linking (Fig.3). Of 13 DN clones studied, 3 clones (DN21, DN62, and DN63) exhibited high levels of DN receptor (10–15-fold when compared with PC12 or PCN control cells), 6 (DN23, DN24, DN61, DN66, DN67, and DN68) exhibited medium levels of DN receptor (4–6-fold), and 4 (DN22, DN64, DN65, and DN69) exhibited low levels (1–2-fold). In addition to the truncated FGFR-2 monomer, a higher molecular weight band was detected by cross-linking experiments (Fig. 3, CL). This band corresponds to multimeric complexes (homodimers of DNFGFR-2 receptors; heterodimers DNFGFR-2 and endogenous FGF receptors) and may also include endogenous FGF receptor monomers. Moreover, no change in NGFR expression was detected in DN-expressing cells by 125I-NGF binding experiments (not shown). In Fig.3, an example of each class of FGFR-DN-expressing cells (DN21, DN24, and DN64) and PCN1 control cells is shown. Experiments described below were done with cells from three clones of each DN receptor expression level (DN21, DN62, and DN63 for high; DN23, DN24, and DN61 for medium; DN22, DN64 and DN65 for low DN expression levels) and two clones harboring the G418-resistance vectors (PCN1 and PCN2). FGFR-1 as well as FGFR-2 was phosphorylated similarly in PC12, and in PCN1 (as shown in Fig. 2 C) cells after 10 min of NGF treatment, but in DN21 cells, no phosphorylation was detectable (Fig.4 A). Neurite outgrowth in the presence of NGF for up to 10 days was measured in PC12, PCN1 and 2, DN21, DN24, and DN64 cells. With all of the clones studied, the number of cells with neurites reached a plateau after 96 h (Figs. 3 and4 B). Parental PC12 cells, PCN1, and PCN2 (data not shown) exhibited the same neurite outgrowth pattern. The morphology of PCN1, DN21, DN24, and DN64 was compared (Fig. 3). Neurite outgrowth of DN21 was the most strongly inhibited (70% at 48 h) upon NGF treatment, DN64 was the most weakly inhibited (45%), and DN24 exhibited an intermediary outgrowth pattern (60%); the quantification of this effect was performed by neurite-counting and reported in Fig.4 B. The percentage of cells with neurites did not significantly change over a 10-day period from the percentage estimated at day 4 (data not shown). A total of 11 clones were studied in the neurite outgrowth assay as indicated (9 clones expressing DNFGFR-2, 2 control clones expressing the geneticin-resistance gene only), and the number of cells with neurites after 4 or 10 days of NGF treatment is reported in Table I. These data indicate that inhibition of neurite outgrowth was observed in all DNFGFR-2 cell clones and that the degree of inhibition was correlated with the expression of DNFGFR-2. About 76 ± 3.7% of PC12 cells exhibited neurites upon FGF-2 treatment. The neurite outgrowth results were very similar with PCN1 or PCN2 cells. Upon FGF-2 treatment, DN21 and DN24 cells did not differentiate (<1% cells with neurites; not shown), and DN64 exhibited some neurite outgrowth (5–10% of the control; not shown). As other phenotypic differentiation marker, we analyzed peripherin mRNA expression in RNAs isolated from PCN1 or DN21 cells after NGF treatment during indicated periods of time (Fig.4 C). PCN1 cells exhibited a 2–3-fold increase in 73 mRNA levels after 12 h (Fig. 4 C) as described previously for PC12 cells (38Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The increase in peripherin mRNA level in DN21 cells was moderate and somewhat retarded (24–48 h; Fig.4 C).Figure 4Effect of DNFGFR-2 expression on NGF-induced differentiation.

After 5 days in culture in the presence of NGF, medium was replaced, and fresh NGF was added. NA stands for not applicable. FGF-2 expression was studied by Western blotting of cell extracts and culture media of cells stimulated by NGF. Practically no FGF-2 was detectable in cell extracts of nonstimulated PC12 or PCN1 control cells. After 5 min of NGF treatment, an 18-kDa FGF-2 isoform was detected in cell extracts (Fig.5 A). FGF-2 was present for up to 96 h with peaks at 1–6 h and at 48–96 h. In DN21 cell extracts, 18-kDa FGF-2 was present in the cell extracts before NGF treatment and disappeared 60 min after (Fig. 5 A). In the PCN1-conditioned media, an 18-kDa FGF-2 species was detected from 6–12 h only, with a peak at 24 h. A 15-kDa FGF-2-related protein with apparition kinetics identical to FGF-2 was also revealed (Fig.5 A). Higher molecular mass bands were detected on Western blots by either anti-18-kDa or anti-high molecular weight FGF-2 antibodies at constant levels in PCN1 and DN21 cellular extracts (not shown). Because FGF-2 was detectable in the medium only after 6–12 h of NGF treatment, we assessed the presence of FGF-2 on the cell surface. PC12 cells, treated or not by NGF, were cell surface-biotinylated, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FGF-2 antibodies. NGF induced in 10 min the appearance of an 18-kDa FGF-2 and a 15-kDa FGF-2-related protein on the cell surface (Fig. 5 B), quantities of which declined from 30 min on. The functional significance of extracellular or surface cell FGF-2 in induction of neuritogenesis was investigated by using anti-FGF-2 antibodies or an RNA oligonucleotide ligand that specifically binds FGF-2 (NX-286 (31Jellinek D.

Our preliminary structural analyses using diffraction data collected for the two proteins crambin and savinase show meaningful deviations from the conventional independent spherical atom approximation. A noise-reduction averaging technique enables bonding details of electron distributions in proteins to be revealed experimentally for the first time. We move one step closer to imaging directly the fine details of the electronic structure on which the biological function of a protein is based. The principles underlying all molecular recognition processes and enzymatic reactions are based on chemistry involving the outer shell electrons of molecules, functional groups, or atoms (1Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of electronic structure is a prerequisite for a deeper chemical understanding of biological processes. Precise electron distributions may be obtained from quantum mechanical calculations. Schrödinger's equation provides the theoretical basis for the determination of wave functions from which the electron density may be computed. However even with rather extreme approximations, the numerical complexity of this approach excludes the possibility of modeling entire macromolecules and their interactions. A qualitative image of electron distributions may also be obtained experimentally by the diffraction of x-rays from a crystal. The extent of the data (the number of unique reflections) in reciprocal (diffraction) space is quantified by the nominal resolution. There is an inverse relationship between direct space (the crystal) and diffraction space (the measurements): long range features of the molecule correspond to low resolution diffraction data, short range to high resolution. The minimum separation between the individual features in the electron density map, i.e. the level of detail, is approximately equal to the nominal resolution of the data multiplied by 0.7 (2James R.W. Acta Crystallogr. 1948; 1: 132-134Crossref Google Scholar). Additional smearing of the electron density results from atomic vibration and static disorder and may increase this factor to about 1.1 (3Swanson S.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1988; 44: 437-442Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Roughly speaking, to resolve two points separated by 1.0-Å distance requires x-ray data extending to 1.0-Å resolution. Observed distributions of core electrons are very well approximated by the spherical atomic density models employed routinely in crystallography. However, valence electrons show deviations from spherical symmetry, and their detection requires very high resolution diffraction data. Deformation density arising from such deviations can commonly be observed for small molecules. In proteins, deformation density is generally not visible because of a number of factors. Macromolecules are flexible polymers and considerably disordered. Vibration of the atoms spreads the distribution of the electrons. The effect of this is two-fold. First, the resolution of the x-ray crystal diffraction is typically lower than that required to experimentally observe valence electrons (4Jelsch C. Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Aubry A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1306-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, modeling atomic vibration by isotropic or anisotropic atomic displacement parameters at least partially takes up the effects of the bonding electron features (4Jelsch C. Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Aubry A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1306-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Wiest R. Benard M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2713-2715Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Particularly at high resolution, the standard crystallographic modeling, i.e. the approximation of the electron density distribution by a set of spherically symmetric atom-centered densities, cannot correctly account for important features such as bonding or lone pair electrons. The fundamental observation of chemistry that properties of groups of atoms are to some extent conserved has led to an elegant approach to modeling electron density in macromolecules. Namely, the electron density multipole parameters obtained from small molecules have been proposed to be transferable to macromolecules (6Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Lachekar H. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 6242-6250Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This may be viewed as a crystallographic adaptation of Bader's theory of atoms in molecules (7Bader R.F.W. Atoms in Molecules. A Quantum Theory. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar). Although the transferability has been demonstrated to give good results for polypeptides, its applicability to proteins has not previously been shown. We show here that good quality x-ray diffraction data to atomic resolution (8Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19251) Google Scholar) do permit detection of bonding electron information in proteins. We employ a simple technique of noise reduction for an averaged peptide bond to reveal this bonding information. Relevant experimental details are presented in Table I. X-ray data were collected using synchrotron radiation from the DORIS storage ring (EMBL Hamburg, DESY) and a MAR Research imaging plate and processed using the HKL suite (9Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The models were refined using SHELXL (10Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The procedures used were those routinely applied in protein crystallography. Full description of the structures, together with data collection and refinement will be published elsewhere.Table IExperimental detailsCrystal structurecrambinsavinaseTemperature (K)100110Resolution (Å)0.670.90Crystallographic R factor (%)7.911.1Mean main chain atomic displacement parameters (Å2)3.06.3Number of peptide units averaged40229 Open table in a new tab The extraction of bonding information relies on the fundamentally repetitive nature of macromolecular polymers. Proteins consist of linear chains of amino acids with a backbone built from a set of repeating peptide units. The electron density for the peptides repeats along the chain, and this fact was used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Provided the electron density distribution for all peptide units only differs in the level of statistical noise present, averaging ofN such units is expected to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of √ N. Although density for peptide units is not exactly the same over the protein chain and, in addition, some systematic errors always remain, averaging the peptide plane density proved to be powerful for the extraction of non-spherical valence information. Self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) calculations on a simple dipeptide model were carried out at Hartree-Fock level with a medium sized split valence basis set (HF/6–31+G) with the GAMESS software package (11Schmidt M.W.

Chem. 1993; 14: 1347-1363Crossref Scopus (19363) Google Scholar). The first example concerns the 46-residue plant protein crambin from Crambe abyssinica (12Teeter M.M. Hendrickson W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Teeter M.M. Mazer J.A. L'Italien J.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5437-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Its structure at 130 K was previously reported at 0.83-Å resolution with data from a rotating anode x-ray source (14Teeter M.M. Roe S.M. Heo N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 292-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We collected synchrotron diffraction data to 0.67 Å at 100 K, and the model has been refined preliminarily against the complete set of unique reflections, TableI. The densities for individual amino acid residues show no significant evidence of deviation from the spherical atom approximation. However, exploiting the repetitive structure by superimposing the electron density of 40 peptide units (excluding the five peptides modeled with two conformations) does reveal detailed features. The averaged density, Fig. 1, shows two peaks on both sides of the atoms within the peptide plane. These correspond to the highly populated regions of (ϕ, ψ) conformational space for l-amino acids (15Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar), one of each pair representing a CB atom, the other the N or C atoms of the adjacent residues. In addition, a build-up of electron density between the atoms along the bonds is apparent. Features in the averaged difference map, Fig.2, are even more prominent. They provide clear experimental observation of the bonding electrons in the peptide moiety, namely the ς electrons in the middle of the CA—C, C—N, and N—CA bonds. Bonding density outside the peptide unit is visible next to the two CA atoms. Weaker density is visible for the C—O bond and even a trace of the N—H bonding density. With imagination, one can see traces of the lone pairs of the carbonyl oxygen. We approximated the peaks in the middle of the bonds between non-hydrogen atoms by a three-dimensional Gaussian function, and we estimated their content to be around 0.02 to 0.03 electrons. These values are lower than the comparable values for small molecules, typically about 0.4 to 0.5 electrons (5Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Wiest R. Benard M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2713-2715Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Souhassou M. Lecomte C. Ghermani N.-E. Rohmer M.-M. Roland W. Benard M. Blessing R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2371-2382Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) because of the lower resolution. For comparison, we have calculated the deformation density of a peptide plane with purely theoretical methods, Fig.3, as outlined above. Although this level of density detail is well beyond the scope of any x-ray diffraction experiment, we feel that the striking qualitative resemblance justifies our approach. The agreement exceeded our expectations and demonstrates the level of detail that can be extracted from diffraction data. It has now become feasible to image features as small as a fraction of an electron, thus recovering otherwise lost information. We extended our analysis to a 27-kDa protein, savinase, a subtilisin-like proteinase (17Betzel C. Klupsch S. Papendorf G. Hasturp S. Branner S. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), where the data only extended to a resolution of 0.90 Å, Table I. Despite the lower resolution, the larger molecular weight of savinase enhances the effectiveness of the density averaging. The results from savinase corroborate those obtained for crambin, with clearly visible bonding density, Fig.4. Because of the more limited resolution and higher atomic displacement parameters, the bonding density is more pronounced for the longer bonds, CA—C and N—CA, and overlaps somewhat with the bonding density outside the peptide unit. The peaks in the middle of the bonds C—O, C—N, and N—H are smaller but still clearly visible. The traces of lone pair electrons have vanished. For the first time, bonding electrons have been observed experimentally for macromolecules. These results are qualitatively in good agreement with theoretical studies. Very high resolution x-ray data from crystals with low disorder and thermal motion are essential. Fortunately, this is now feasible not only for a small protein like crambin but for much larger proteins. The advent of high intensity synchrotron radiation sources, efficient two-dimensional detectors and cryogenic freezing techniques permits crystallographic x-ray data collection of unprecedented quality. By the middle of 1995, there were about 30 x-ray crystal data sets recorded for proteins at atomic (1.2 Å or higher) resolution (18Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By the end of 1998, there were about 130 such data sets collected on EMBL Hamburg beam lines alone. The proteins vary in size from 5–6 kDa (crambin or rubredoxin (19Dauter Z. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. B. 1992; 48: 42-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) up to about 280 kDa for a heterohexameric methyl coenzyme M reductase. 1W. Grabarse, M. Goubeaud, R. K. Thauer, V. S. Lamzin, and U. Ermler, manuscript in preparation. Comparative studies of theoretical models for the electron density can now be performed for macromolecules, and modified non-spherical scattering factors may be derived. The repeating peptide motif allows an important means of enhancing the weak signal by averaging within the backbone. The methodological advance of averaging was thus essential for the unmasking of the bonding electron signal. This method may be extended to at least some of the side chains. One can also envision averaging the densities for a set of proteins. There is clearly a need to develop more elaborate methods to extract subtle information present in the x-ray diffraction data. Ideally one would like to visualize directly the valence electron density for an atomic group of interest,e.g. in an enzyme active site. Exploitation of the techniques presented here will have an important biological impact because all macromolecular recognition and enzymatic processes are consequences of the valence electron distribution of interacting atoms or functional groups. Elucidation of detailed electronic structure is clearly beneficial for a deeper understanding of the chemical reactions underlying biological processes. The fine but subtle details of the stereochemical and electronic environment of key atoms are critical to function, catalysis, or ligand interactions. They are also crucial in knowledge-based drug design, enhancement of substrate stereoselectivity, and development of biological molecules with desired and directed properties. This work moves us one important step closer to these goals. We thank NOVO Nordisk (Denmark) for the provision of savinase samples."

To test the hypothesis that the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin is due to a decrease in the inhibition of PP1 by the phosphatase inhibitors, we have investigated the effects of insulin on glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles from wild-type mice and mice lacking Inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 as a result of targeted disruption of the genes encoding the two proteins. Insulin increased glycogen synthase activity and the synthesis of glycogen to the same extent in wild-type and knockout mice, indicating that neither Inhibitor-1 nor DARPP-32 is required for the full stimulatory effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. Glycogen synthase is an excellent in vitro substrate for protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), which is potently inhibited by the phosphorylated forms of DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, M r = 32,000) and Inhibitor-1.

Insulin increased glycogen synthase activity and the synthesis of glycogen to the same extent in wild-type and knockout mice, indicating that neither Inhibitor-1 nor DARPP-32 is required for the full stimulatory effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. Insulin lowers blood glucose by inhibiting hepatic glucose output and by increasing the uptake of glucose by various target tissues. In lean individuals, skeletal muscle represents the largest mass of insulin-sensitive tissue, and the majority of the glucose taken up in response to insulin following a meal is converted to muscle glycogen (1Jue T. Rothman D.L. Tavitian B.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Shulman G.I. Rothman D.L. Jue T. Stein P. DeFronzo R.A. Shulman R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulation of glycogen deposition in skeletal muscle is of particular importance in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis both by increasing glucose entry into muscle fibers and by increasing conversion of the intracellular glucose into glycogen. This response involves activation of glucose transport and glycogen synthase. Glycogen synthase catalyzes the reaction in which glucose from UDP-glucose is incorporated into glycogen. The enzyme is subject to complex control by both allosteric and covalent mechanisms (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle glycogen synthase may be phosphorylated in 10 or more sites, which are clustered in regions near the NH2 and COOH termini (4Cohen P. Boyer P. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 461-497Google Scholar). Insulin activates the enzyme by promoting dephosphorylation of sites in both regions (5Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Skurat A.V. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12491-12497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In general, phosphorylation decreases glycogen synthase activity (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the allosteric effector, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), 1The abbreviations used are: G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; DARPP-32, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein,M r = 32,000; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; G1P, glucose 1-phosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; PP1G, a form of PP1 containing a catalytic subunit bound to RGL; PTG, a PP1-targeting subunit; RGL, muscle glycogen-binding regulatory subunit of PP1G. is able to activate fully even highly phosphorylated forms of the enzyme. When provided with sufficient substrate, nonphosphorylated glycogen synthase is fully active even in the absence of G6P (7Roach P.J. Larner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 110-112Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Consequently, the activation of glycogen synthase may be monitored by the increase in the activity ratio (−G6P/+G6P). Despite several decades of investigation, the mechanism by which insulin activates glycogen synthase is still not clear. The multisite dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase is suggestive of phosphatase activation. Indeed, insulin has been shown to increase the activity of PP1 (8Cohen P. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that is capable of dephosphorylating both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sites in glycogen synthase. The action of PP1 in cells is dependent on its subcellular localization, which is determined by different regulatory/targeting subunits. RGL (also known as the G subunit or GM) and PTG are two glycogen-binding subunits that target PP1 to glycogen particles in skeletal muscle (9Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These glycogen-bound forms of PP1 are believed to be responsible for the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase, which is also bound to glycogen. PP1 activity is controlled by two related heat-stable proteins, Inhibitor-1 (11Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and DARPP-32 (13Strålfors P. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Inhibitor-1 (I-1) is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including skeletal muscle (12Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). DARPP-32 is expressed in certain neurons (14Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), kidney, and adipocytes (15Meister B. Fried G. Hökfelt T. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8713-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The nonphosphorylated forms of I-1 and DARPP-32 are essentially devoid of PP1 inhibitory activity, but both proteins become potent inhibitors of PP1 after phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (13Strålfors P. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was recently proposed that the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is mediated by activation of PP1 via a mechanism involving decreased susceptibility of the PTG-bound form of the phosphatase to inhibition by DARPP-32 (16Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 182: 65-71Google Scholar). If this mechanism were to apply to skeletal muscle, the most important site of insulin-stimulated glycogen deposition, then the effect of insulin would presumably depend on I-1, as skeletal muscle does not express DARPP-32 (15Meister B. Fried G. Hökfelt T. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8713-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we have compared the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis in muscles from wild-type mice and mice lacking I-1 and DARPP-32 as a result of targeted-disruption of the genes encoding the two proteins. Mice lacking I-1 were generated by targeted disruption of the I-1 gene. The preparation of these animals and additional phenotypic characterization will be described in detail elsewhere. 2P. B. Allen, Ø. Hvalby, V. Jensen, M. L. Errington, M. Ramsay, F. A. Chaudhry, T. V. P. Bliss, J. Storm-Mathisen, R. G. M. Morris, and P. Greengard, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the I-1 gene was disrupted in the E14 embryonic stem cell line (18Thompson S. Clarke A.R. Pow A.M. Hooper M.L. Melton D.W. Cell. 1989; 56: 313-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) by using a targeting vector containing 1.5 kilobases (5′) and 5.5 kilobases (3′) of I-1 locus genomic DNA flanking a neomycin resistance gene(PGK-neo). Homologous recombination at the endogenous locus resulted in replacement of a 400-bp genomic fragment withPGK-neo. The deleted genomic fragment contains the I-1 exon encoding the initiation of translation. Correctly targeted clones were identified by the shift of a genomic restriction fragment from 10.1 to 11.5 kilobases, as determined by Southern (DNA) blot analysis. After C57BL/6J blastocyst injection and embryo transfer, chimeric offspring were crossed to C57BL/6J females, and those mice carrying the mutation were further backcrossed to C57BL/6J for five generations. Male I-1 knockout mice and wild-type littermates 5–8 months of age were selected from the offspring of heterozygous breeding pairs. To generate mice lacking both I-1 and DARPP-32, homozygous I-1 knockout mice were bred with homozygous DARPP-32 knockout mice (19Fienberg A.A. Hiroi N. Mermelstein P.G. Song W.J. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Cheramy A. O'Callaghan J.P. Miller D.B. Cole D.G. Corbett R. Haile C.N. Cooper D.C. Onn S.P. Grace A.A. Ouimet C.C. White F.J. Hyman S.E. Surmeier D.J. Girault J.A. Nestler E.J. Greengard P. Science. 1998; 281: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The F-1 offspring were intercrossed to generate wild-type and double knockout lines (129/Ola-C57BL/6J, backcrossed to C57BL/6J for five generations). Male mice from these lines were age-matched and studied at 4–8 months. For all mice used, genotype was determined by Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA. To confirm the presence/absence of the protein(s), skeletal muscle extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then probed with polyclonal antibodies to I-1 (20Gustafson E.L. Girault J.A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Compar. Neurol. 1991; 310: 170-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and glycogen synthase (21Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), or monoclonal ascites to DARPP-32 (22Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Media used for muscle incubations were continuously gassed by bubbling with a 19:1 mixture of O2:CO2. Hemidiaphragm and extensor digitorum (EDL) muscles were incubated at 30 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (30 ml/muscle) for 30 min to remove endogenous hormones. The muscles were then incubated without or with either 250 milliunits/ml insulin (Humulin, Eli Lilly Co.) or 10 μmepinephrine at 37 °C in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3) containing 5 mm glucose. To terminate the incubations, the muscles were blotted on tissue paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen tissues were manually ground with a porcelain mortar and pestle that had been chilled in liquid nitrogen. Samples (approximately 25 mg) of powdered muscle were homogenized at 0 °C using a tissue grinder (Teflon-glass) in 500 μl of Homogenization Buffer (100 mm KF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μm leupeptin, 1.5 μm aprotinin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 30 °C). The homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatants were retained for analyses. The protein content of the extracts was measured and adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml by adding Homogenization Buffer. Glycogen synthase activity was measured by the method of Thomas et al. (23Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (30 μl) were added to solutions (60 μl) containing 10 mg/ml rabbit liver glycogen, 20 mm EDTA, 25 mm KF, 10 mm UDP-[1-14C]glucose (100,000 cpm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 30 °C) and incubated without or with 10 mm G6P at 30 °C for 20 min. The glycogen synthase activity ratio was determined by dividing the activity measured without added G6P by the activity measured in the presence of 10 mm G6P (total activity). Phosphorylase activity was measured in the direction of glycogen synthesis from [U-14C]G1P by using the method of Gilboe et al. (24Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Samples (30 μl) of extracts were added to solutions (60 μl) containing 10 mg/ml rabbit liver glycogen, 200 mmKF, 100 mm [U-14C]G1P (50,000 cpm, NEN Life Science Products), and incubated without or with 5 mm5′-AMP at 30 °C for 20 min. The activity ratio was determined by dividing the activity measured without 5′-AMP by the activity measured in the presence of 5′-AMP. The amount of glucose incorporated into glycogen was measured as described previously (25Smith R.L. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2201-2207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the incubation to remove endogenous hormones, muscles were incubated in medium containing 5 mmd-[U-14C]glucose (ICN, Irvine, CA). Samples of muscles were weighed, then dissolved by heating for 45 min at 100 °C in 30% KOH (1 ml/100 mg of tissue). Ethanol was added to a final concentration of 70%, and the glycogen was allowed to precipitate at −20 °C. After 8 h, the samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min to pellet the glycogen. The glycogen pellets were washed four times with 66% ethanol before the amount of 14C-labeled glycogen was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Relative levels of I-1 and DARPP-32 in diaphragm muscles of wild-type and I-1 knock-out mice were assessed by immunoblotting (Fig.1). I-1 from wild-type mice was readily detected as a protein of apparent M r = 29,000. As expected, I-1 protein was absent in muscles from mice in which the I-1 gene had been disrupted by targeted gene disruption. No DARPP-32 was observed in the wild-type muscle extracts (Fig. 1, middle blot), although the protein was readily detected in mouse brain extract (BE). The amount of glycogen synthase was unaffected by the I-1 gene deletion in muscles from I-1 knockout mice (Fig.1, lower blot). As skeletal muscle does not express DARPP-32, it is clear that the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in this tissue cannot be explained by a decrease in the susceptibility of the PTG-bound form of PP1 to DARPP-32, as has been suggested to occur in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17Mastick C.C. Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 182: 65-71Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that the effect of insulin in skeletal muscle is mediated by the DARPP-32-homologue, I-1, the effect of insulin on the glycogen synthase activity ratio was assessed in diaphragms from I-1 knockout mice (Fig.2). Insulin increased the activity ratio in these muscles from 0.22 to 0.41. In muscles from wild-type mice, insulin increased the activity ratio from 0.20 to 0.44. Thus, the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase were almost identical in I-1 knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. The stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin involves multiple steps. To determine whether I-1 was essential for the overall process of glycogen synthesis, we assessed the rates of [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen in diaphragm muscles from wild-type and I-1 knockout mice (Fig.3). Basal rates of14C-labeled glycogen synthesis were not significantly different in muscles from wild-type and I-1 knockout animals. Insulin increased 14C-labeled glycogen accumulation by approximately 9-fold in muscles from wild-type mice. Insulin was equally effective in increasing 14C-labeled glycogen synthesis in muscles from the I-1 knockout animals. Thus, I-1 is not an essential component of signal transduction pathway leading to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis. A potential problem in interpreting results from knockout animals is that the absence of a gene product during development may result in compensatory expression of another functionally related protein. For this reason, we considered the possibility that expression of DARPP-32 might be induced in the I-1 knockout animals. This did not appear to be the case, as DARPP-32 was not detected in muscles from the I-1 knockout animals (Fig. 1, middle blot). Nevertheless, to be certain that the activation of glycogen synthase did not depend on either I-1 or DARPP-32, experiments were performed using muscles from animals that lacked both I-1 and DARPP-32. The activation of glycogen synthase in muscles from the double knockout animals was indistinguishable from that observed in muscles from the wild-type control animals (Fig. 4). The effect of insulin on incorporation of glucose into glycogen was assessed in EDL muscles from the same animals (Fig. 5). Basal rates of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen were almost identical in muscles from wild-type and double knockout mice. Insulin increased [U-14C]glucose into glycogen by approximately 2-fold in muscles from both groups of animals. The stimulation of [14C]glycogen synthesis by insulin was lower in the EDL muscles than in diaphragm (Fig. 3). This difference is most likely due to the different fiber type composition of the two muscles. Diaphragm is composed primarily of oxidative fiber types, which are more responsive to insulin than fast-glycolytic fibers, which comprise approximately half of the fibers in the EDL (26Ariano M.A. Armstrong R.B. Edgerton V.R. J. Histochem. 1973; 21: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of insulin on synthesis of [14C]glycogen in I-1/DARPP-32 knockout mice. EDL muscles from I-1/DARPP-32 knockout and wild-type mice were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min without (CONTROL) or with (INSULIN) 20 milliunits/ml insulin in medium containing [14C]glucose. The amount of [14C]glycogen synthesized (in nmol/min/g wet weight) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The results are mean values ± S.E. for muscles obtained from five experiments performed on different days (*,p < 0.05, control versusinsulin-stimulated).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possibility that insulin might control glycogen metabolism by decreasing the phosphorylation of I-1 in skeletal muscle has been investigated previously. Khatra et al. (27Khatra B.S. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 227: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) observed no effect of insulin on I-1 phosphorylation in perfused rat hindlimb. In contrast, Foulkes et al. (28Foulkes J.G. Jefferson L.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that insulin decreased the phosphorylation of I-1 in hindlimb muscles in a perfused hemicorpus model. Later, it was found that I-1 phosphorylation was elevated in the hemicorpus model due to circulating epinephrine and that the effect of insulin to decrease I-1 phosphorylation was dependent on the presence of the β-adrenergic agonist (29Dietz M.R. Chiasson J.L. Soderling T.R. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2301-2307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we were unable to use the I-1 knockout mice to investigate the role of I-1 in the inactivation of glycogen synthase in response to epinephrine because epinephrine was without effect on the glycogen synthase activity in either the wild-type or I-1 knockout muscles. Epinephrine did activate phosphorylase and the response was essentially identical in muscles from the wild-type and I-1 knockout mice (Fig. 6). It is not clear why glycogen synthase was not inactivated by epinephrine in the mouse muscles. Nevertheless, it is well established that insulin activates glycogen synthase in isolated muscles incubated without epinephrine (30Lawrence Jr., J.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 39: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and that the effect of insulin is not inhibited by the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (29Dietz M.R. Chiasson J.L.

Biochem. 1982; 124: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, previous findings indicate that the direct activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in skeletal muscle does not depend on decreased phosphorylation of I-1. The concept that targeting subunits might mediate insulin action on glycogen synthase arose from investigations of PP1G, a form of PP1 that is targeted to glycogen by RGL (33Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of RGLin site 1 increased glycogen synthase phosphatase activity (34Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Subsequently, injecting rabbits with insulin was reported to increase site 1 phosphorylation (35Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Identification of an insulin-activated kinase that phosphorylated this site as p90rsk(36Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) apparently linked the activation of glycogen synthase to the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as p90rsk was known to be activated by MAP kinase. However, findings with activators and inhibitors of MAP kinase and p90rsk indicated that activation of these two kinases were neither necessary nor sufficient for the activation of glycogen synthase (21Azpiazu I.

A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The recent finding that insulin is able to activate glycogen synthase in muscles of mice lacking RGL provides yet another reason to question the role of PP1G in the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin (41DePaoli-Roach A.A. Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Zhang H. Yang J. Kennedy A. Miami Nature Biotechnology Short Reports, Abstract S70. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1999Google Scholar). Thus, the PTG-bound form of PP1 is becoming a more attractive candidate for a target of insulin action. Although our results would be consistent with a role of this form of the phosphatase in the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin, our findings demonstrate that neither I-1 nor DARPP-32 is required for the full stimulatory effects of insulin on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle. An important implication is that the model proposed for the activation of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes involving decreased inhibition of PTG-bound form of PP1 by DARPP-32 (42Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) cannot explain the activation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle, the most important site of insulin-stimulated glycogen deposition."

Because of their instability, however, the glycols have not previously been characterized. Instead, the impetus has been placed on the primary decomposition products of 2'-deoxycytidine glycols, which includes 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine, and 2'-deoxyuridine glycols. Here, we have identified one of the four possible diastereomers of 2'-deoxycytidine glycols by product analyses of decomposition products, (1)H NMR, and mass spectrometry. This glycol was observed to decompose with a half-life of 50 min at 37 degrees C in buffered neutral solutions and preferentially undergo dehydration to 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine. The rate of decomposition was strongly dependent on pH (2-10) and the concentration of phosphate ion (10-300 mM). Next, we report on the deamination of cytosine glycols to uracil glycols in oxidized DNA using acid hydrolysis and high performance liquid chromatography analysis with electrochemical detection to monitor 5-hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil. The results showed that the lifetime of cytosine glycols is greatly enhanced in DNA (34-fold; half-life, 28 h), and that deamination accounts for at least one-third of the total decomposition. The relatively long lifetime of cytosine glycols in DNA suggests that this important class of DNA oxidation products will be significantly involved in repair and mutagenesis processes."
https://openalex.org/W2026606498,"In the Albers-Post model, occlusion of K+ in the E 2 conformer of the enzyme (E) is an obligatory step of Na+/K+-ATPase reaction. If this were so the ratio (Na+/K+-ATPase activity)/(concentration of occluded species) should be equal to the rate constant for deocclusion. We tested this prediction in a partially purified Na+/K+-ATPase from pig kidney by means of rapid filtration to measure the occlusion using the K+ congener Rb+. Assuming that always two Rb+ are occluded per enzyme, the steady-state levels of occluded forms and the kinetics of deocclusion were adequately described by the Albers-Post model over a very wide range of [ATP] and [Rb+]. The same happened with the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis. However, the value of the parameters that gave best fit differed from those for occlusion in such a way that the ratio (Na+/K+-ATPase activity)/(concentration of occluded species) became much larger than the rate constant for deocclusion when [Rb+] <10 mm. This points to the presence of an extra ATP hydrolysis that is not Na+-ATPase activity and that does not involve occlusion. A possible way of explaining this is to posit that the binding of a single Rb+ increases ATP hydrolysis without occlusion.

The active transport of Na+ and K+ across cell membranes is mediated by the Na+/K+-pump, which is an intrinsic membrane transport system, identical with the Na+/K+-ATPase (for a recent review and references see Ref. 1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). There is abundant evidence (2Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol.

Glynn I.M. Nature. 1979; 280: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or submitted to extensive washings (6Forbush III, B. J. Biol.

This type of binding is called occlusion because it is believed that the ions are trapped in a domain of the enzyme that restricts their access to the bulk of the solvent. Occlusion of K+ through the direct route (where, presumably, K+ enters the enzyme from the cytoplasmic side) can be obtained by just mixing enzyme and K+ in the absence of Na+ and ATP and was first described by Beaugé and Glynn (3Beaugé L.A. Glynn I.M. Nature. 1979; 280: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since then, the properties of the species occluded through this process have been studied extensively (see reviews by Forbush (7Forbush III, B. Skou J.C. Nørby J.G. Maunsbach A.B. Esmann M. The Na+,K+-Pump. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 229-248Google Scholar), Glynn and Richards (10Glynn I.M. Richards D.E. Curr. Top. Membr.

The release of K+ or its congeners from their occluded states (deocclusion) is considerably accelerated by binding of ATP at a site with low affinity relative to the active site and where ATP does not seem to undergo hydrolysis (6Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Karlish S.J.D. Yates D.W. Glynn I.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 525: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This process is the cause of most of the increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity with increasing ATP concentration (13Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. Ellory C. The Sodium Pump. Company of Biologists Ltd., Cambridge, UK1985: 443-455Google Scholar). Occlusion of Na+ has also been detected (5Glynn I.M. Howland J.L. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 368: 453-469Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Esmann M. Skou J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the occlusion site for Na+ is in the same domain but in a different conformation, as the K+ site (7Forbush III, B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+occlusion seems to occur at a stage of the ATP hydrolysis cycle that is different from that which occludes K+, suggesting that occlusions of the two cations are mutually exclusive events. In the present study we expand the information about the Na+/K+-ATPase reaction, using the congener86Rb+ as a probe for K+ and performing direct measurements of the steady-state concentration levels of the intermediates containing occluded Rb+(Rbocc). In these experiments Rbocc was formed through the so-called physiological route, i.e. during the turnover of the Na+/K+-ATPase. In this condition K+ enters the enzyme presumably from the extracellular side to activate the catalysis of the hydrolysis of ATP (16Blostein R. Chu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3035-3043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brief reports of measurements of this type of occlusion have been given by Glynn and Richards (4Glynn I.M. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 330: 17-43Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Glynn et al. (5Glynn I.M. Howland J.L. Richards D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 368: 453-469Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and Forbush (6Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rossi and Nørby (9Rossi R.C. Nørby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have studied the pre-steady-state kinetics of Tl+ occlusion via the physiological route using a similar technique as that in the present paper. The measurements we are reporting here were made possible by the development of a new technique (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 17Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for the isolation in the millisecond time scale and quantitative determination of the intermediates containing occluded cations. The method is used during both steady-state turnover and in transient state experiments with the Na+/K+-pump. With the same enzyme preparations and under the same experimental conditions, we have also measured the steady-state ATPase activity, v t, and the rate coefficient, k deocc, for deocclusion of Rb+ from Rbocc. These can be analyzed as part of the Albers-Post model; a simplified version is shown in Fig.1. The results presented here show that the kinetics of the species containing occluded Rb+, i.e. E occ and E occATP, could be quantitatively described by the scheme in Fig. 1. We showed that the intermediates holding occluded Rb+ were only kinetically obligatory for the ATPase reaction at saturating concentrations of Rb+. We found, however, that even at concentrations of Rb+ that were sufficiently high as to drive the reaction totally away from the pathway that generates Na+-ATPase activity, a significant part of the hydrolysis bypassed the occluded forms. We show that a possible reason for this is that the phosphoenzyme containing only one Rb+(E 2PRb) dephosphorylates, without leading to occlusion of Rb+, with a rate coefficient whose value lies between those for dephosphorylation of E 2P andE 2PRb2. At this point, it seems convenient to include the theoretical grounds that underlie the experiments in which we tested whether the enzyme species containing occluded Rb+ are obligatory intermediates in the reaction cycle. To illustrate this, let us take the elementary reaction A↔ B in Scheme FSI as one of the steps of the enzyme reaction. The possibility that the step A ↔ B can be bypassed with the rate v other during the overall reaction is important for the argument to follow, whereas the order of addition of substrate(s) and the release of product(s) are not. If n pathways participate in the A ↔B transition, then in steady state the overall rate (v t) of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme can be written as Equation 1. vt=∑i=1nkf,i[Ai]−∑i=1nkb,i[Bi]+votherEquation 1 where A i and B i are each of the n states of A and B, andk f,i and k b,i are the rate constants for their transitions. If the conversion of A toB were irreversible, then Σk b,i[B i] = 0, and Equation 1 is reduced to Equation2, vt=∑i=1nkf,i[Ai]+votherEquation 2 which, dividing both sides by [A] = Σ[A i] becomes Equation 3: vt[A]=∑i=1nkf,i[Ai][A]+vother[A]Equation 3 Equation 3 shows that the ratio between the steady-state overall velocity, v t, and the total concentration, [A], of the intermediates at this step will be a linear, weighted combination of the rate constants involved in their transformation, plus a term related to alternative reaction pathways,v other/[A]. Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 provide a criterion to test if a family of intermediates (here, the A is) are obligatory participants of the enzyme reaction. If this were the case, thenv other would be 0 and the ratiov t/[A] would be equal to the rate coefficient for the reaction A → B. The experimental investigation of this criterion will be in many cases hampered by difficulties in the measurement of the concentration of the enzyme intermediates and in the direct determination of the rate constants of their reactions. In the case of the intermediates that hold occluded K+ or its congeners, these difficulties can be circumvented because newly available procedures (Refs. 9Rossi R.C. Nørby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 17Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures” of this paper) make it possible to estimate with accuracy their steady-state levels and to follow the time courses of their release of occluded Rb+. The ratio between steady-state ATPase activity (v t) and the total concentration of the conformer(s) of the enzyme holding the occluded Rb+, [E occT] = [E occ] + [E occATP], would be given by (see Fig. 1 and Equation 3) Equation 4: vt[EoccT]=vocc[EoccT]+vother[EoccT]Equation 4 where v occ is the activity through the occlusion producing pathway, and under irreversibility conditions, it can be calculated as the sum of the rates of the deocclusion pathways as shown in Equation 5: vocc=k0[Eocc]+k∞[EoccATP]Equation 5 From the definition of [E occT] and considering that ATP binds to E occ to formE occATP with an apparent dissociation constantK ATP = [ATP] × [E occ]/[E occATP], Equation 4 becomes Equation 6: vt[EoccT]=k0KATP+k∞[ATP]KATP+[ATP]+vother[EoccT]Equation 6 A well known example of the eventual contribution tov t of the pathways that do not includeE occT (v other in Equation 6) is the Na+-ATPase activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase (see e.g. Ref. 13Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. Ellory C. The Sodium Pump. Company of Biologists Ltd., Cambridge, UK1985: 443-455Google Scholar). In the absence of Rb+, hydrolysis of ATP proceeds with a rate that is about 5–10% of V max for Na+/Rb+-ATPase. Referring to Fig. 1 and the conditions of the present study, this rate will bev other = v t =k 40 × [E 2P] and almost all the enzyme will be in the form of E 2P. At subsaturating concentrations of Rb+ the speciesE 2PRb is also present, andv other must be expressed as Equation 7: vother=k40[E2P]+k41[E2PRb].Equation 7 At saturating Rb+ concentrations,v other = 0 because both [E 2P] and [E 2PRb] become 0, and all the reaction flux proceeds through the formation and breakdown of the occluded forms. Under this condition (see Equation8), vt[EoccT]=vocc[EoccT]=k0KATP+k∞[ATP]KATP+[ATP]Equation 8 Thus, at saturating [Rb+],v t /[E occT] as a function of [ATP] should be a rectangular hyperbola, increasing from k 0 to k ∞ as [ATP] goes from 0 to ∞, respectively, with half-maximal effect for [ATP] = K ATP. Note thatK ATP will be larger than or equal to the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of ATP fromE occATP, depending on whether rapid equilibrium holds or not for this reaction. A preliminary report of some of the results given here has been published (18Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Kaufman S.B. Nørby J.G. Schwarzbaum P.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase was partially purified from pig kidney (19Jensen J. Nørby J.G. Ottolenghi P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 346: 219-241Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The specific activity at the time of preparation was 23–25 (μmol Pi) min−1 (mg protein)−1, measured under optimal conditions (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, and 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C). This corresponds to an ADP-binding site concentration of 2.4–2.7 nmol (mg of protein)−1. [γ-32P]ATP was synthesized using the procedure of Glynn and Chappell (20Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), except that no unlabeled orthophosphate (Pi) was added. Carrier-free [32P]Pi was from the Comisión Nacional de Energı́a Atómica (Argentina). [86Rb]RbCl was from NEN Life Science Products. ATP, enzymes, and reagents for the synthesis of [γ-32P]ATP were from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. All incubations were performed at 25 °C in media containing 150 mm NaCl, enough MgCl2 to give a final concentration of free Mg2+ of 0.5 mm, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4 (at 25 °C), and the amounts of RbCl and ATP indicated for each experiment. In all cases before starting a reaction, the components to be mixed were diluted in these media. ATPase activity was determined according to Schwarzbaum et al. (21Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), measuring the amount of [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP. The enzyme concentration was never lower than 4 μg/ml in order to approach that used in the determination of occluded rubidium ions. For this reason incubation times were short (between 30 s and 1 min) to avoid the hydrolysis of more than 10% of the ATP during the assay and to ensure initial rate conditions. Control experiments showed that activity was independent of the enzyme concentration from 4 to 200 μg/ml and that it was unaffected by the passage of the enzyme through the rapid mixing apparatus described below. Na+/Rb+- and Na+-ATPase activities were calculated as the difference between total activity and the activity either in the same media but with 1 mm ouabain or in media in which all the Na+ was replaced by K+. The latter procedure was applied when the reaction times were less than 1 min because at high [Rb+], the onset of the inhibition by ouabain is not fast enough to ensure complete inhibition. The inorganic phosphate detected under these conditions was practically identical to that measured in the reagent blanks indicating that the concentration of ATPases other than the Na+/K+-ATPase was negligible. This was performed according to Schwarzbaum et al. (21Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The technique was similar to that developed by Rossi and Nørby (9Rossi R.C. Nørby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that86Rb+ was used instead of204Tl+ and by Rossi et al. (17Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G.

Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar is shown in (Fig.2). It includes a rapid mixing apparatus (RMA) 1The abbreviations used are: RMA, rapid-mixing apparatus; QWC, quenching-and-washing chamber connected to a quenching-and-washing chamber (QWC) through a suitable polyethylene tubing. Reactions took place at 25 °C in the RMA and are quenched after the appropriate time by injecting the reaction mixture into the QWC at a flow rate of 1–5 ml s−1. During the injection process, the fluid was mixed with an ice-cold washing solution flowing at a rate of 30–40 ml/s and then filtered through a Millipore filter (AA, 0.8 μm pore size) placed in the QWC in order to retain the enzyme-containing membrane fragments. To ensure that the initial temperature in the QWC was 1–2 °C and that the flow was constant, about 50 ml of washing solution was allowed to run through the filter prior to the injection of the reaction mixture, and 240 ml of washing solution was applied to the filter from that moment. The composition of the washing solution was 30 mm KCl, 20 mmimidazole- HCl, pH 7.4 at 0 °C. The procedure is devised to slow down instantaneously the reactions by means of the sudden drop in both the temperature and the concentration of ligands, like ATP, that might accelerate deocclusion. The quenching time was 3–4 ms, even when the reactions were performed in media with 2.5 mm ATP (17Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the washing effectively removes the unbound86Rb+. After the washing solution was drained, the filter was removed, dried under an incandescent lamp, and counted for radioactivity in a β-scintillation counter. Blanks were estimated from the amount of radioactive Rb+retained by the filters in experiments where occlusion was prevented by omitting ATP during the enzyme reactions. Otherwise the conditions were the same. As shown by Rossi et al. (17Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the blanks were linearly related to the Rb+ concentration from 0 to 10 mm; they rarely exceeded 10% of the amount of occluded86Rb+ (and generally were much smaller) and were independent of the mass of enzyme employed. The steady-state amount of occluded Rb+ was estimated by mixing equal volumes of a suspension of Na+/K+-ATPase in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm free Mg2+, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4 (at 25 °C), with the same buffer containing ATP and 86Rb+. Generally, the reaction mixture was incubated for 3 s before being injected into the QWC. Control experiments using aging times of 5–10 s showed no variation in the level of occluded rubidium with respect to the results obtained at 3 s. To measure the rate of release of occluded Rb+, Na+/K+-ATPase containing occluded rubidium ions was formed as described above. It was then mixed with enough of a similar solution, but lacking 86Rb+ to cause a 20-fold isotopic dilution of 86Rb+. After the appropriate aging times, the resulting mixture was injected into the QWC, and the occluded 86Rb+ remaining in the enzyme was measured as described above. To attain the isotopic dilution of 86Rb+, 1 volume of86Rb+-containing enzyme was mixed either with 20 volumes of a solution with unlabeled Rb+ at the same concentration or with 1 volume of a solution with 20 times higher concentration of unlabeled Rb+. Both procedures gave similar results for the rate of deocclusion, provided that the rest of the conditions remained unchanged. Note that 150 mm NaCl was present in all solutions. These were obtained using the Solve routine of Mathematica®, version 2.2.1 for Windows®. Where indicated, results of steady-state ATPase activity and steady-state occluded rubidium were adjusted by nonlinear regression using commercial programs (Excel 5.0 for Windows and Sigma-Plot 2.0 for Windows). Equations were derived from the solutions for [E occT] and v t in Table I (Equations 9–11). These are shown in Equations 18 and 19, Rbocc=a0[Rb+]2+a1[Rb+]2[ATP]d0,0+d0,1[Rb+]+d0,2[Rb+]2+d1,0[ATP]+d1,1[ATP][Rb+]+[ATP][Rb+]2Equation 18 for occluded rubidium and vt=b0,0+b0,1[Rb+]+b0,2[Rb+]2+b1,0[ATP]+b1,1[ATP][Rb+]+b1,2[ATP][Rb+]2d0,0+d0,1[Rb+]+d0,2[Rb+]2+d1,0[ATP]+d1,1[ATP][Rb+]+[ATP][Rb+]2Equation 19 for ATPase activity. Notice that the mathematical form of these equations corresponds to that of Equations 9 and 10, respectively, after dividing both numerator and denominator byD 1,2, and rearranging the numerators by lumpingE T with rate and equilibrium constants into coefficients a i,j and b i. Additionally, in Equation 18 it is assumed that Rbocc is strictly proportional to [E occT],i.e. that rubidium is occluded into the enzyme with a fixed stoichiometry (cf. Equation 9).Table IThe equations for the steady-state levels of [EoccT] and vt according to the scheme in Fig. 1QuantityEquationEq.

Open table in a new tab Equations for [E occT] andv t were obtained for model in Fig. 1 assuming that (i) ATP and Na+ concentrations are high enough to saturate the formation E 1ATP, E 1P, and the occlusion of Na+ in E 1P; (ii) phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are irreversible because of the absence of products; (iii) deocclusion is irreversible because all the experiments were performed in media with high concentrations of Na+ (see “Experimental Procedures”); (iv) the binding of Rb+ to E 2P and to E 2PRb and of ATP to E occ take place in rapid equilibrium. After inspection of duplicate errors in large samples of data, we used statistical weights 1/v t2 forv t and 1 for Rbocc. When values of parameters were nonsignificantly different from 0 (i.e.whose mean ± S.E. interval included 0), their corresponding terms were eliminated from the equation, giving rise to equations with less number of parameters. To evaluate the significance of eliminating parameters and choose among different equations, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC = N × ln(S) + 2 ×P, with N = number of data,P = number of parameters, and S = sum of weighted square errors of residuals) (22Yamaoka K. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1978; 6: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) was applied. The best fitting equation was considered the one that showed the lowest AIC value. The present paper investigates the role of occluded Rb+ (acting as a congener of K+) in the reaction mechanism of Na+/K+-ATPase. Our fast quenching procedure with a time resolution of a few milliseconds has allowed us to determine quantitatively the concentration of occluded Rb+ (Rbocc) formed via the physiological route, that is by the Rb+-activated dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme E 2P. We have used the procedure to measure the steady-state level of Rbocc and the rate of deocclusion of Rb+ at 25 °C. We compared these measurements with estimations of steady-state Na+/Rb+-ATPase activity carried out in parallel experiments under exactly the same reaction conditions. To complete the information, we also measured the Na+-ATPase activity in steady state. In all the experiments, [NaCl] was 150 mm, [free Mg2+] was 0.5 mm, and the pH was kept at 7.4 with 20 mm imidazole HCl. The concentrations of Rb+ and ATP depended on each experiment and are given in the legend of each figure. The results were analyzed using the scheme in Fig. 1, which shows in more detail that part of the Albers-Post model involved in the formation and breakdown of the intermediates of the Na+/K+-ATPase that are supposed to hold occluded Rb+. As it is clear from the inspection of Fig. 1, the amount of enzyme containing occluded Rb+(E occ and E occATP) is a function of the concentrations of Rb+ and ATP. The effect of ATP is 2-fold since the nucleotide not only provides the phosphate of the phosphoenzyme intermediates, but it also accelerates deocclusion by binding to E occ. TableI shows the equations generated by the analytical solution of the scheme in Fig. 1, for the particular conditions of our experiments, and the meaning of each of its coefficients in terms of rate and/or equilibrium constants. By using the equations for [E occT] andv t in Table I, the overall ratiov t/[E occT] will be as indicated in Equations 20 and 21: vt[EoccT]=k0KATP+k∞[ATP]KATP+[ATP]1f([Rb+])Equation 20 with f([Rb+])=k42[Rb+]2k40KRb1KRb2+k41KRb2[Rb+]+k42[Rb+]2Equation 21 It is obvious that for saturating [Rb+],i.e. [Rb+] → ∞,f([Rb+]) = 1, and Equation 20 is then identical with the general Equation 8. At subsaturating [Rb+], f([Rb+]) < 1, signifying that v other >0 under these conditions. Rbocc was measured during steady-state hydrolysis in three series of experiments. First, it was determined within a broad range of ATP (10–960 μm) and Rb+ (0.1–2.5 mm) concentrations with the results shown in Fig. 3, A andB. Second, the same measurements were focused in the low ATP concentration range (1–10 μm, Fig.4) to cover in more detail this region. These experiments were performed in media with 0.5–20 mmRb+ and allowed us to obtain reliable, extrapolated values for Rbocc at [ATP] = 0 (see below). Third, the high [ATP] concentration range was explored in media with up to 2.5 mm ATP and up to 10 mm Rb+ to procure dependable extrapolated values for Rbocc when [ATP] → ∞. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.5.Figure 4Rbocc as a function of 1–10 μm [ATP]. Media contained either 0.5 (●), 1 (○), 2.5 (▴), 5 (■), 10 (▪), or 20 (▵) mm Rb+.

https://openalex.org/W1978873524,"To determine the catalytic role of Gln190, a member of the highly conserved LPQG motif in Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of this residue to generate Q190N and Q190A. Both mutant proteins exhibited a significant loss in their polymerase and pyrophosphorolysis activities with a more pronounced effect noted with the Gln → Asn substitution. The catalytic efficiencies of the mutants exhibited a 40–70-fold reduction with poly(rC) and poly(dC) templates in the presence of Mg2+ and a 10–20-fold reduction with poly(rA) template in the presence of Mn2+. Interestingly, the K m for NTP exhibited only a moderate 3–10-fold increase irrespective of the template-primer and the metal ion. Photoaffinity labeling of both the mutant and the WT enzymes exhibited an identical affinity for RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA template-primers. However, unlike the WT enzyme, the mutant enzymes exhibited a significantly reduced ability to catalyze the nucleotidyltransferase reaction on the covalently immobilized template-primer. An examination of the rate constants for the first and the second nucleotide for the mutant enzymes indicated dissimilar rates, indicating that Gln190 may be involved in a rate-limiting, conformational change step both before and after the phosphodiester bond formation. Furthermore, the processivity of DNA synthesis by the mutant enzymes was decreased severely, which may result from the lower catalytic efficiency as well as translocation defect.

Alignment of the primary amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence of the genes coding for various DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases (RTs) 1The abbreviations used are: RT(s), reverse transcriptase(s); HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; MuLV, Moloney murine leukemia virus; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, primer binding site; PPi, pyrophosphate has permitted identification of certain conserved motifs and residues in these enzymes (1Johnson M.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 716-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) took the sequence homology analysis a step further by comparing the three-dimensional structures of the catalytic domains of the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT and demonstrated spatial equivalence of 10 amino acid residues, implying their functional equivalence. The extension of this analysis to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) RT revealed the identification of spatially equivalent conserved residues in this enzyme as well (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The possible functional contribution of some of these residues to the catalytic reaction, based partly on the information available in other members of DNA polymerases, was postulated (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Georgiadis M.M. Jessen S.M. Ogata C.M. Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because we have been studying the structure-function relationship in MuLV RT to understand its catalytic mechanism, these conserved residues in MuLV RT provided ideal targets for experimental verification of their projected roles and for exploring the differences, if any, in their participation in the catalytic mechanism of other RTs. One of the many residues suggested by three-dimensional structural comparison which we investigated was Arg110 of MuLV RT, a projected counterpart of Arg72 of HIV-1 RT and Lys758 of E. coli DNA polymerase I. A detailed biochemical analysis of the properties of the Arg110 to Lys, Ala, and Glu mutants clearly demonstrated that arginine was indispensable for the catalytic reaction. The arginine side chain was implicated further in the crucial conformational change step before and after the phosphodiester bond formation step (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, a substitution of Phe155 with valine (equivalent of Tyr115 of HIV-1 RT), based on its projected interaction with the sugar moiety of dNTP (5Georgiadis M.M. Jessen S.M. Ogata C.M. Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Hendrickson W.A.

As a continuation of our analysis of the roles played by various residues in the catalytic mechanism of MuLV RT, we describe here the results of mutation of the highly conserved- Gln190 of MuLV RT, which is spatially equivalent to Gln151 of HIV-1 RT. Gln190 is located in the LPQG motif within loop β9-αH in the polymerase active site of MuLV RT. Individual members of the LPQG motif in HIV-1 RT have been shown to be essential for the polymerase function (7Larder B.A. Kemp S.D.

A detailed analysis of the enzymatic properties of the mutant and the wild type (WT) enzymes was then carried out. Results presented in this paper suggest that Gln is an essential residue for the catalytic function of MuLV RT. The properties of the conservative mutant Q190N, however, appear to differ significantly from its counterpart in HIV-1 RT (9Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Kaushik N. Harris D. Rege N. Modak M.J. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas Q190N of MuLV RT is nearly inactive. Detailed biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins suggests its involvement in the possible stabilization of the ternary complex both before and after bond formation. The Mutagen-M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Sequenase and DNA sequencing reagents were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Restriction endonucleases, MS2 RNA, and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HPLC-purified dNTPs were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 32P/3H-Labeled dNTPs were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Fast flow chelating Sepharose (iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sequencing primers, synthetic template-primers, and oligonucleotides containing the desired mutational changes were purchased from the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of this school. MuLV RT from the overexpression clone was induced, extracted, and purified as described previously (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Four oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1) containing an azidophenacyl group attached to the phosphate backbone having a thio substitution at a desired position were synthesized essentially as described (11Mayer A.N. Barany F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The individual azidophenacyl oligonucleotides were purified on a C18 column attached to HPLC, labeled at its 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP, and annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide. Uracil-containing bacteriophage M13mp19 carrying a KpnI and SalI fragment (847 base pairs) of the MuLV RT coding sequence was used as the template for the site-directed mutagenesis (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Q190N and Q190A were created using mutagenic primers and the Bio-Rad Mutagen-M13in vitro mutagenesis kit. This method is based on the procedure described by Kunkel et al. (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). After ascertaining the mutation in M13 by DNA sequencing, the KpnI and SalI fragment was subcloned into the MuLV RT expression plasmid, pET-28a-MRT (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The WT and mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity by metal affinity chromatography. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford colorimetric assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) as well as by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies were carried out as described by Majumdar et al. (14Majumdar C. Abbotts J. Broder S. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15657-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using homopolymeric poly(rA)·(dT)18, poly(rC)·(dG)18, or poly(dC)·(dG)18 as template-primers and dTTP or dGTP as nucleotide substrates. K m andk cat values were determined at saturating template-primer concentrations (250 nm). A synthetic 30-mer RNA template and 30-mer DNA primer corresponding to the primer binding site sequence of HIV-1 RNA was used as an RNase H substrate (see Fig. 1). The 30-mer RNA was labeled at its 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was then annealed to the complementary 30-mer DNA in a 1:1 ratio. The reaction mix for the RNase H assay contained a 2 nm RNA:DNA hybrid, approximately 100 nm enzyme, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 unit of RNasin in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min and mixed with an equal volume of Sanger's gel loading buffer (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The products of the RNase H reaction were resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and the gel was scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cross-linking of the desired template or primer to enzyme was carried out as described previously (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Six different template-primers were used for cross-linking, which included poly(rA)·(dT)18, self-annealing 37-mer DNA, and four template-primers containing an azidophenacyl photoprobe attached to a specific nucleotide in either one of the two strands (see Fig. 1). The (dT)18, 37-mer, and the phenacyled template-primers were 5′-end labeled using [γ-32p]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the standard protocol (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.S. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The purified oligomers were annealed to equimolar amounts of the corresponding strands and used in the cross-linking experiments. Typically, 0.8 μm enzyme was incubated with 50 nm annealed template-primer (2 × 104 cpm/pmol) on ice for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples containing poly(rA)·(dT)18 or self-annealing 37-mer DNA were exposed to 254 nm UV irradiation in a Spectrolinker (Spectronic Corp.) at a dose of 3,750 mJ/cm2, and the samples containing the azidophenacyl moiety-attached template-primers were irradiated at 312 nm UV for a fixed time of 1 min. Template-primer cross-linked enzyme species were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by scanning the gel on a PhosphorImager; the extent of cross-linking was quantitated by ImageQuant software. Nucleotidyltransferase activity of the enzyme, covalently cross-linked to template-primer, was measured as described previously (17Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme was first cross-linked with template-primer in a reaction mixture containing 30 pmol of enzyme, 30 pmol of unlabeled template-primer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 25 μl. The nucleotidyltransferase reaction was then initiated by the addition of 0.5 m NaCl together with 10 μCi of complementary [α-32P]dNTP in a final volume of 50 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-gel loading buffer. The cross-linked species were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the associated radioactivity was quantitated on a PhosphorImager. MS2 RNA and its complementary 20-mer primer (Fig. 1) were used for this study. The first and second template nucleotides to be copied are dC and dA, respectively. Rates of incorporation of the first nucleotide were measured by using the 5′-32P-labeled 20-mer primer annealed to the MS2 RNA template. The primer extension in the presence of dGTP by the WT MuLV RT and its mutant derivatives was assessed by gel analysis. Briefly, the WT (2 ng) or mutant enzymes (100 ng) were incubated with 50 nm template-primer in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm dGTP. In the case of WT enzyme, reactions were carried out at 10 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 s. In the case of two mutant enzymes, reactions were carried out at 23 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s. The rates of the second nucleotide addition were determined in a similar manner except that the reaction mixture contained 500 μm dTTP in addition to 500 μm dGTP. The reaction products were analyzed on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The primer extension products catalyzed by the WT and mutant enzymes were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using the ImageQuant software as described by Polesky et al. (18Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 21-mer product generated by the addition of one nucleotide to the labeled 20-mer primer represented the first nucleotide addition. Similarly, the extension of the 21-mer primer to 22-mer represented the second nucleotide incorporation. The amount of template-primer substrate remaining unutilized as a function of time was determined by subtracting the amount of product formed from the initial (total) amount of template-primer (TP), and a plot of log ((TP)unutilized/(TP)total) versustime was constructed. The slope was calculated by fitting the data for the first and second nucleotide incorporation using the Microsoft Excel program. Heteropolymeric RNA·DNA template-primer was employed to study the processivity of the WT and mutant enzymes. Extension of an 18-mer DNA primer that is complementary to the primer binding site (PBS) region of the HIV genome was 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5 pmol of gel-purified PBS 18-mer primer was annealed to 5 pmol of the 496-base long PBS-containing RNA that was prepared by the transcription reaction as described by Chowdhury et al. (4Chowdhury K. Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16610-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 nm primer termini, 500 μm each of the four dNTPs, 50 nm WT enzyme or 250 nm mutant enzyme, and 0.5 μg/μl heparin as the trap in a final volume of 12 μl. The enzyme was preincubated with the template-primer for 1 min at room temperature, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of dNTPs together with the heparin trap. The samples were incubated at 25 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were taken at 5 and 10 min and mixed with an equal volume of Sanger's gel loading solution. The effectiveness of the trap was assessed by preincubation of the enzyme with the template-primer in the presence of heparin. Unlimited synthesis was measured in the absence of heparin in the reaction mixture. The reaction products were resolved on a denaturing 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Each product band was quantitated, and processivity was calculated as described by Gardner et al. (19Gardner L.P. Mookhtiar K.A. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2908-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by determining the fraction of the total product of a specific length, extended by nucleotide addition. The assay was adapted from the protocol published by Astatke et al. (20Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphorolysis activity was measured by monitoring the reduction in the length of the 5′-labeled primer in the presence of PPi. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm PPi(in the form of Na-PPi), 2 nm PBS RNA/18-mer or PBS DNA/18-mer, with the 18-mer primer containing the 32P label at its 5′-end and 100 nm WT enzyme or 400 nm mutant enzyme in a total volume of 6 μl. After incubation at 25 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by addition of Sanger's gel loading solution. The reaction products were analyzed on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. The recombinant protein representing the WT MuLV RT and its two Gln190 mutant derivatives were purified from cell extracts using metal affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutant enzymes exhibited a purity of greater than 95%. The level of their expression, their solubility, and chromatographic characteristics were identical with those of the WT enzyme. We performed far-UV CD analysis of the WT and mutant enzymes and observed nearly identical spectra for both species (Fig.2 A). This observation indicates that no significant change in the secondary structure of the mutant enzymes had occurred. In addition, we found that both mutants and the WT MuLV RT have nearly identical RNase H activity (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that the substitution at position Gln190 has not caused any significant change in the overall protein structure. Furthermore, results also indicate that Gln190 is not required in the catalysis of RNase H activity; hence alterations in the polymerase function of the mutants described appear to reflect the absence of glutamine side chain at position 190 in MuLV RT. To determine the reasons for the loss of activity by mutant enzymes, we first examined the steady-state kinetic parameters, i.e. k cat for the polymerase reaction andK m for dNTP utilization for both the mutant and the WT proteins. Homopolymeric template-primers, poly(rA)·(dT)18, poly(rC)·(dG)18, and poly(dC)·(dG)18, were used in these studies. Saturating concentrations of template-primer were used to mimic the first-order conditions for dNTP substrates. The rates of incorporation of α-32P- or 3H-labeled dNTP into the product with increasing concentrations of dNTP were measured, and thek cat for the polymerase reaction andK m for dNTP utilization were determined by Eadie-Hofstee plots from the rate data (TableI). Results show that substitution of Gln190 by both Ala and Asn caused about a 20-fold decrease in k cat and a 3-fold increase in theK m for dGTP with poly(dC)·(dG)18. In contrast, with poly(rC)·(dG)18, the decrease ink cat was less severe (5–9-fold), but a significant increase in K m (5–7-fold) was observed, suggesting that subtle differences exist in the participation of Gln190 in the catalytic reaction directed by the DNA or RNA template. However, the increase in K m for dNTP alone does not account for the significant loss of catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) noted with both Q190N and Q190A, suggesting that the participation of Gln190 may be at a step beyond that of substrate binding, with Mg2+ as the divalent cation in the polymerase reaction. In the presence of Mn2+ as an effective metal cofactor, a significant increase (∼10-fold) in theK m for TTP with poly(rA)·(dT)18 was found for the Q190N mutant. Interestingly, both mutants exhibited only a marginal 2–4-fold decrease in k cat. This suggests that Gln190 may participate in substrate binding in the presence of Mn2+. Thus the differential participation of this residue in the polymerase reaction appears to be dependent on the type of the divalent cation.Table IKinetic parametersEnzymePoly(rA) · (dT)18/TTPPoly(rC) · (dG)18/dGTPPoly(dC) · (dG)18/dGTPK m(TTP)k catk cat/K mK m(dGTP)k catk cat/K mk catk catk cat/K mμmS−1S−1m−1μmS−1S−1m−1μmS−1S−1m−1WT16.88.95.3 × 10530.90.451.5 × 10424.82.61.1 × 105Q190N167.94.12.5 × 104141.00.0483.4 × 10281.00.141.7 × 103Q190A40.72.04.9 × 104212.80.0833.9 × 10271.40.152.1 × 103The steady-state kinetic parameters for the wild type MuLV RT and its mutant derivatives were determined with the indicated template-primer and corresponding dNTP substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mn2+ was used in poly(rA) · (dT)18 studies, and Mg2+ was used in other studies.

To explore the role of Gln190 in the binding of template-primer, we carried out UV-mediated cross-linking of the WT and the mutant enzymes to various radiolabeled template-primers. We expected that a possible defect in the binding of the template-primer, either DNA or RNA, by the mutant enzymes would result in the reduction in the cross-linking of all or some template-primers. For this experiment, we utilized six different template-primers as follows. Four of them were constituted by synthetic 26/18-mer DNAs containing an azidophenacyl group at specific nucleotide positions either in the template or primer strand (see Fig. 1); their cross-linking to the enzyme was carried out at 312 nm. The two other template primers were the poly(rA)·(dT)18 and the 37-mer DNA, which were cross-linked at 254 nm (21Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21828-21834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cross-linked species were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Both Q190N and Q190A mutant enzymes as well as the WT enzyme exhibited nearly identical amounts of cross-linked radiolabeled template-primer (Fig. 3). This scenario was noted with all of the template-primers, including 26/18-mer combinations, where the photoaffinity group was placed at the +1 and −2 position of the template nucleotide, at the 3′-OH-containing primer nucleotide itself (+1), or at the +4 primer nucleotide position (see Fig. 1). The efficiency of the cross-linking of enzymes to different template-primers was variable, but very little or no change between the WT and two mutant enzymes for the same template-primer was apparent. Therefore, the loss of activity seen with mutant enzymes is not at the level of template-primer binding. The specificity of the cross-linking as being representative of template-primer binding was judged from the following experiments. The cross-linking of all of the above template-primers with all three enzymes was found to be sensitive to the presence of a high ionic strength of the cross-linking medium (>0.3 m) and could be competed out with poly(dC)·(dG)15 but not with poly(dC) or (dG)15 alone (data not shown). Because the Gln190 mutants and the WT enzyme showed no difference in their binding affinity to RNA·DNA or DNA·DNA templates and only a moderate change in K m for dNTP was observed, it seemed likely that the significant reduction in the polymerase activity was probably the result of a defect at a step beyond that of substrate binding. To obtain evidence in support of this notion, we examined the ability of the mutant enzymes cross-linked with the template-primer to catalyze the addition of dNTP onto the immobilized template-primer. Previous studies have shown that the WT Klenow fragment, HIV-1 RT, and MuLV RT, covalently cross-linked with the template-primer, can catalyze the addition of a single complementary nucleotide onto the 3′-OH terminus of the immobilized template-primer (4Chowdhury K.

Results shown in Fig. 4, A andB, indicate that mutant enzyme-template-primer (RNA·DNA) complexes were inefficient in catalyzing the addition of the complementary nucleotide [α-32P]TTP. The Q190N mutant protein appeared to be the least active, which is consistent with the lowest k cat value noted for this protein. Similar results were obtained when enzymes were linked covalently to azidophenacyl-containing template-primers and assessed for theirin situ nucleotidyltransferase activity (Fig. 4,C–F). The observations that both mutant enzymes exhibit significant reduction in the overall catalytic efficiency for the polymerase reaction, especially with Mg2+, and that a severe impairment in the catalysis of in situnucleotidyltransferase reaction, which qualitatively measures only a single nucleotide addition, strongly indicate the requirement of Gln190 in the conformational change step before the chemical step of the polymerase reaction. Comparative analysis of the rates of incorporation of the individual dNTP and its α-thio derivative was carried out using RNA template. Results indicated that the mutant enzymes utilized dNTPs and their respective α-thio derivatives with similar efficiencies (data not shown). These results rule out the possibility of the defect in the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation by the mutant polymerase. To probe further the role of Gln190 in the polymerase reaction scheme beyond the steps of initial substrates binding and the bond formation, we determined the rate constants for the first and the second nucleotide addition by the WT and mutant enzymes directed by RNA template. In the reaction scheme (24Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4835-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a conformational change step is implied both before and after the chemical step of bond formation. A step requiring conformational change after the bond formation can be assessed by the determination of the rates of successive nu"
