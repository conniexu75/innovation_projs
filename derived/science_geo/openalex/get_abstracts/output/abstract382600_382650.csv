https://openalex.org/W2012686113,"One of the fundamental goals in proteomics and cell biology is to identify the functions of proteins in various cellular organelles and pathways. Information of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful insights for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular network systems. Most of the existing methods in predicting plant protein subcellular localization can only cover three or four location sites, and none of them can be used to deal with multiplex plant proteins that can simultaneously exist at two, or move between, two or more different location sites. Actually, such multiplex proteins might have special biological functions worthy of particular notice. The present study was devoted to improve the existing plant protein subcellular location predictors from the aforementioned two aspects. A new predictor called “Plant-mPLoc” is developed by integrating the gene ontology information, functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information through three different modes of pseudo amino acid composition. It can be used to identify plant proteins among the following 12 location sites: (1) cell membrane, (2) cell wall, (3) chloroplast, (4) cytoplasm, (5) endoplasmic reticulum, (6) extracellular, (7) Golgi apparatus, (8) mitochondrion, (9) nucleus, (10) peroxisome, (11) plastid, and (12) vacuole. Compared with the existing methods for predicting plant protein subcellular localization, the new predictor is much more powerful and flexible. Particularly, it also has the capacity to deal with multiple-location proteins, which is beyond the reach of any existing predictors specialized for identifying plant protein subcellular localization. As a user-friendly web-server, Plant-mPLoc is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/. Moreover, for the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results. It is anticipated that the Plant-mPLoc predictor as presented in this paper will become a very useful tool in plant science as well as all the relevant areas."
https://openalex.org/W2043746859,"A number of studies have reported the existence of cancer stem cells in human melanomas, each one capable of producing a tumour. Boiko et al. examined a broad spectrum of clinical samples taken from melanomas and report that the neural crest stem-cell marker CD271 is a marker for cancer stem cells, allowing the identification and prospective isolation of melanoma cancer stem cells. In this work, the neural crest stem cell marker CD271 is implicated as a cancer stem cell marker, allowing identification and prospective isolation of melanoma cancer stem cells. The question of whether tumorigenic cancer stem cells exist in human melanomas has arisen in the last few years1. Here we show that in melanomas, tumour stem cells (MTSCs, for melanoma tumour stem cells) can be isolated prospectively as a highly enriched CD271+ MTSC population using a process that maximizes viable cell transplantation1,2. The tumours sampled in this study were taken from a broad spectrum of sites and stages. High-viability cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and re-suspended in a matrigel vehicle were implanted into T-, B- and natural-killer-deficient Rag2−/−γc−/− mice. The CD271+ subset of cells was the tumour-initiating population in 90% (nine out of ten) of melanomas tested. Transplantation of isolated CD271+ melanoma cells into engrafted human skin or bone in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice resulted in melanoma; however, melanoma did not develop after transplantation of isolated CD271− cells. We also show that in mice, tumours derived from transplanted human CD271+ melanoma cells were capable of metastatsis in vivo. CD271+ melanoma cells lacked expression of TYR, MART1 and MAGE in 86%, 69% and 68% of melanoma patients, respectively, which helps to explain why T-cell therapies directed at these antigens usually result in only temporary tumour shrinkage."
https://openalex.org/W2041980962,"Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most highly prevalent human autoimmune diseases, leading to disfiguring hair loss due to the collapse of immune privilege of the hair follicle and subsequent autoimmune attack. The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P <or= 5 x 10(-7)). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity."

https://openalex.org/W2026529460,"Erasing Markers Epigenetic reprogramming of the mammalian genome, which involves the removal and replacement of the various regulatory epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation, occurs during germ cell differentiation and during early zygotic development. This process is also critical during the experimental generation of stem cells, but the factors and pathways that control epigenetic reprogramming are not well understood. Hajkova et al. (p. 78 ) investigated the erasure of DNA methylation during germ cell differentiation and during early zygotic development in the developing mouse and found that factors involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which helps repair damaged DNA, were involved. Furthermore, inhibitors of BER resulted in the retention of DNA methylation in the zygote."
https://openalex.org/W1975043059,"Cardiac hypertrophy and failure are characterized by transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression. Adult cardiomyocytes in mice primarily express α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC, also known as Myh6), whereas embryonic cardiomyocytes express β-MHC (also known as Myh7). Cardiac stress triggers adult hearts to undergo hypertrophy and a shift from α-MHC to fetal β-MHC expression. Here we show that Brg1, a chromatin-remodelling protein, has a critical role in regulating cardiac growth, differentiation and gene expression. In embryos, Brg1 promotes myocyte proliferation by maintaining Bmp10 and suppressing p57kip2 expression. It preserves fetal cardiac differentiation by interacting with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) to repress α-MHC and activate β-MHC. In adults, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4) is turned off in cardiomyocytes. It is reactivated by cardiac stresses and forms a complex with its embryonic partners, HDAC and PARP, to induce a pathological α-MHC to β-MHC shift. Preventing Brg1 re-expression decreases hypertrophy and reverses this MHC switch. BRG1 is activated in certain patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, its level correlating with disease severity and MHC changes. Our studies show that Brg1 maintains cardiomyocytes in an embryonic state, and demonstrate an epigenetic mechanism by which three classes of chromatin-modifying factors—Brg1, HDAC and PARP—cooperate to control developmental and pathological gene expression. In pathological cardiac hypertrophy, the heart gains muscle mass but not pumping power. There is reduced expression of the adult (alpha) isoform of the ATPase molecular motor myosin heavy chain and increased expression of the fetal (beta) form. This altered balance impairs heart function and can lead to heart failure. Hang et al. have determined the mechanism regulating this switch in expression. Experiments in mice show that when the adult heart is under stress, the machinery that maintains cardiac myocytes in an embryonic state of differentiation — regulated by the developmental chromatin-modifying complex Brg1/BAF — is re-activated and cardiac myocytes regress to the fetal form. In human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brg1 levels correlate with disease severity and with myosin heavy-chain changes, suggesting that this developmental epigenetic regulator plays a role in the human disease. Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with a decrease in expression of the adult isoform of the molecular motor myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) and the induction of expression of its fetal isoform (β-MHC). Here the authors reveal the mechanism regulating this switch in expression, which impairs heart function. Cardiac stress in adult hearts reactivates the developmental chromatin-modifying complex Brg1/BAF, which interacts with histone deacetylase and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase to induce a pathological α-MHC-to-β-MHC shift."
https://openalex.org/W2023097449,"It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information-about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of +/-2.2-4.5 mV-variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains. However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code."
https://openalex.org/W2035575208,"The development of multicellular organisms relies on the coordinated control of cell divisions leading to proper patterning and growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying pattern formation, particularly the regulation of formative cell divisions, remain poorly understood. In Arabidopsis, formative divisions generating the root ground tissue are controlled by SHORTROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR). Here we show, using cell-type-specific transcriptional effects of SHR and SCR combined with data from chromatin immunoprecipitation-based microarray experiments, that SHR regulates the spatiotemporal activation of specific genes involved in cell division. Coincident with the onset of a specific formative division, SHR and SCR directly activate a D-type cyclin; furthermore, altering the expression of this cyclin resulted in formative division defects. Our results indicate that proper pattern formation is achieved through transcriptional regulation of specific cell-cycle genes in a cell-type- and developmental-stage-specific context. Taken together, we provide evidence for a direct link between developmental regulators, specific components of the cell-cycle machinery and organ patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2170505338,"The identities of the regulators that mediate commitment of hematopoietic precursors to the T lymphocyte lineage have been unknown. The last stage of T lineage commitment in vivo involves mechanisms to suppress natural killer cell potential, to suppress myeloid and dendritic cell potential, and to silence the stem cell or progenitor cell regulatory functions that initially provide T cell receptor-independent self-renewal capability. The zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is T cell-specific in expression among hematopoietic cell types and is first expressed in precursors immediately before T lineage commitment. We found that Bcl11b is necessary for T lineage commitment in mice and is specifically required both to repress natural killer cell-associated genes and to down-regulate a battery of stem cell or progenitor cell genes at the pivotal stage of commitment."

https://openalex.org/W2022969625,"One Two T T cells develop in the thymus, where they proceed through several developmental stages, losing alternative lineage potential as they progress. The molecular regulation of this developmental process, however, is not fully understood (see the Perspective by Di Santo ). P. Li et al. (p. 85 , published online 10 June), L. Li et al. (p. 89 ), and Ikawa et al. (p. 93 ) now identify expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b as the earliest checkpoint in T cell development in mice. Genetic deletion of Bcl11b in developing T cells inhibited commitment to the T cell lineage. Under conditions that should have stimulated T lineage differentiation, Bcl11b -deficient T cell progenitors failed to up-regulate genes associated with lineage-committed T cells and maintained stem cell– and progenitor cell–associated gene expression. In both developing and committed T cells, loss of Bcl11b resulted in the generation of cells that resembled natural killer (NK) cells in both phenotype and function. These NK-like cells could be expanded easily in vitro and possessed antitumor cytotoxicity, but they did not exhibit cytotoxicity against normal cells and were not tumorigenic. Because T cells are much easier to obtain from human patients than NK cells, deletion of Bcl11b in T cells may thus provide a source of easy-to-grow NK cells for cell-based antitumor therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2028155117,"Generally, F-box proteins are the substrate recognition subunits of SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes, which mediate the timely proteolysis of important eukaryotic regulatory proteins. Mammalian genomes encode roughly 70 F-box proteins, but only a handful have established functions. The F-box protein family obtained its name from Cyclin F (also called Fbxo1), in which the F-box motif (the approximately 40-amino-acid domain required for binding to Skp1) was first described. Cyclin F, which is encoded by an essential gene, also contains a cyclin box domain, but in contrast to most cyclins, it does not bind or activate any cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). However, like other cyclins, Cyclin F oscillates during the cell cycle, with protein levels peaking in G2. Despite its essential nature and status as the founding member of the F-box protein family, Cyclin F remains an orphan protein, whose functions are unknown. Starting from an unbiased screen, we identified CP110, a protein that is essential for centrosome duplication, as an interactor and substrate of Cyclin F. Using a mode of substrate binding distinct from other F-box protein-substrate pairs, CP110 and Cyclin F physically associate on the centrioles during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and CP110 is ubiquitylated by the SCF(Cyclin F) ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to its degradation. siRNA-mediated depletion of Cyclin F in G2 induces centrosomal and mitotic abnormalities, such as multipolar spindles and asymmetric, bipolar spindles with lagging chromosomes. These phenotypes were reverted by co-silencing CP110 and were recapitulated by expressing a stable mutant of CP110 that cannot bind Cyclin F. Finally, expression of a stable CP110 mutant in cultured cells also promotes the formation of micronuclei, a hallmark of chromosome instability. We propose that SCF(Cyclin F)-mediated degradation of CP110 is required for the fidelity of mitosis and genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1977497204,"The tumor suppressor p53 is activated by stress and leads to cellular outcomes such as apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Its activation must be highly sensitive to ensure that cells react appropriately to damage. However, proliferating cells often encounter transient damage during normal growth, where cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis may be unfavorable. How does the p53 pathway achieve the right balance between high sensitivity and tolerance to intrinsic damage? Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy of individual human cells, we found that proliferating cells show spontaneous pulses of p53, which are triggered by an excitable mechanism during cell-cycle phases associated with intrinsic DNA damage. However, in the absence of sustained damage, posttranslational modifications keep p53 inactive, preventing it from inducing p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest. Our approach of quantifying basal dynamics in individual cells can now be used to study how other pathways in human cells achieve sensitivity in noisy environments."

Pathways have thus evolved that can recognize and repair DSBs before they reek havoc in the cell. Hicks et al. (p. 82 ) show that this repair can come at a price. DSBs were induced in the budding yeast genome. Repair of a break was accompanied by a massive increase in the rate of mutation in the vicinity of the break. The mutations generated displayed a specific “signature” that included the copying of divergent sequences from other chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2136995216,"Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellar explosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. This one-parameter behavior allows SNe Ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standard candles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating Universe. Recent investigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of SNe Ia is more complicated. Theoretically, it has been suggested that the initial thermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the white-dwarf (WD) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the explosion. Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of SNe Ia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. Here we report that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions from which an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our findings suggest that the spectral evolution diversity is no longer a concern in using SNe Ia as cosmological standard candles. Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from the centre of is a generic feature of SNe Ia."
https://openalex.org/W2016216215,"Mammalian colon harbors trillions of bacteria, yet there is no undue inflammatory response by the host against these bacteria under normal conditions. The bacterial fermentation products acetate, propionate, and butyrate are believed, at least in part, to be responsible for these immunosuppressive effects. Dendritic cells play an essential role in presentation of antigens to T lymphocytes and initiation of adaptive immune responses. Here we report that butyrate and propionate block the generation of dendritic cells from bone marrow stem cells, without affecting the generation of granulocytes. This effect is dependent on the Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter Slc5a8, which transports butyrate and propionate into cells, and on the ability of these two bacterial metabolites to inhibit histone deacetylases. Acetate, which is also a substrate for Slc5a8 but not an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, does not affect dendritic cell development, indicating the essential role of histone deacetylase inhibition in the process. The blockade of dendritic cell development by butyrate and propionate is associated with decreased expression of the transcription factors PU.1 and RelB. Butyrate also elicits its biologic effects through its ability to activate the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr109a, but this mechanism is not involved in butyrate-induced blockade of dendritic cell development. The participation of Slc5a8 and the non-involvement of Gpr109a in butyrate effects have been substantiated using bone marrow cells obtained from Slc5a8(-/-) and Gpr109a(-/-) mice. These findings uncover an important mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory functions of the bacterial fermentation products butyrate and propionate."
https://openalex.org/W2066082047,"Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes with essential functions in DNA replication, recombination and transcription. They change DNA topology by forming a transient covalent cleavage complex with a gate-DNA duplex that allows transport of a second duplex though the gate. Despite its biological importance and targeting by anticancer and antibacterial drugs, cleavage complex formation and reversal is not understood for any type II enzyme. To address the mechanism, we have used X-ray crystallography to study sequential states in the formation and reversal of a DNA cleavage complex by topoisomerase IV from Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterial type II enzyme involved in chromosome segregation. A high resolution structure of the complex captured by a novel antibacterial dione reveals two drug molecules intercalated at a cleaved B-form DNA gate and anchored by drug-specific protein contacts. Dione release generated drug-free cleaved and resealed DNA complexes in which the DNA gate instead adopts an unusual A/B-form helical conformation with a Mg2+ ion repositioned to coordinate each scissile phosphodiester group and promote reversible cleavage by active-site tyrosines. These structures, the first for putative reaction intermediates of a type II topoisomerase, suggest how a type II enzyme reseals DNA during its normal reaction cycle and illuminate aspects of drug arrest important for the development of new topoisomerase-targeting therapeutics."

Although the annual incidence of sepsis is still rising, the exact cause of Gram-negative bacteria-associated sepsis is not clear. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), constitutively secreted from Gram-negative bacteria, are nano-sized spherical bilayered proteolipids. Using a mouse model, we showed that intraperitoneal injection of OMVs derived from intestinal Escherichia coli induced lethality. Furthermore, OMVs induced host responses which resemble a clinically relevant condition like sepsis that was characterized by piloerection, eye exudates, hypothermia, tachypnea, leukopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dysfunction of the lungs, hypotension, and systemic induction of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Our study revealed a previously unidentified causative microbial signal in the pathogenesis of sepsis, suggesting OMVs as a new therapeutic target to prevent and/or treat severe sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2048362660,"Diabrotica virgifera virgifera larvae are root-feeding insects and significant pests to maize in North America and Europe. Little is known regarding how plants respond to insect attack of roots, thus complicating the selection for plant defense targets. Diabrotica virgifera virgifera is the most successful species in its genus and is the only Diabrotica beetle harboring an almost species-wide Wolbachia infection. Diabrotica virgifera virgifera are infected with Wolbachia and the typical gut flora found in soil-living, phytophagous insects. Diabrotica virgifera virgifera larvae cannot be reared aseptically and thus, it is not possible to observe the response of maize to effects of insect gut flora or other transient microbes. Because Wolbachia are heritable, it is possible to investigate whether Wolbachia infection affects the regulation of maize defenses. To answer if the success of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera is the result of microbial infection, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera were treated with antibiotics to eliminate Wolbachia and a microarray experiment was performed. Direct comparisons made between the response of maize root tissue to the feeding of antibiotic treated and untreated Diabrotica virgifera virgifera show down-regulation of plant defenses in the untreated insects compared to the antibiotic treated and control treatments. Results were confirmed via QRT-PCR. Biological and behavioral assays indicate that microbes have integrated into Diabrotica virgifera virgifera physiology without inducing negative effects and that antibiotic treatment did not affect the behavior or biology of the insect. The expression data and suggest that the pressure of microbes, which are most likely Wolbachia, mediate the down-regulation of many maize defenses via their insect hosts. This is the first report of a potential link between a microbial symbiont of an insect and a silencing effect in the insect host plant. This is also the first expression profile for a plant attacked by a root-feeding insect."

One approach involves using stage transition analysis to characterize sleep continuity.We analyzed hypnograms from Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) participants using the following stage designations: wake after sleep onset (WASO), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and REM sleep. We show that individual patient hypnograms contain insufficient number of bouts to adequately describe the transition kinetics, necessitating pooling of data. We compared a control group of individuals free of medications, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), medical co-morbidities, or sleepiness (n = 374) with mild (n = 496) or severe OSA (n = 338). WASO, REM sleep, and NREM sleep bout durations exhibited multi-exponential temporal dynamics. The presence of OSA accelerated the ""decay"" rate of NREM and REM sleep bouts, resulting in instability manifesting as shorter bouts and increased number of stage transitions. For WASO bouts, previously attributed to a power law process, a multi-exponential decay described the data well. Simulations demonstrated that a multi-exponential process can mimic a power law distribution.OSA alters sleep architecture dynamics by decreasing the temporal stability of NREM and REM sleep bouts. Multi-exponential fitting is superior to routine mono-exponential fitting, and may thus provide improved predictive metrics of sleep continuity. However, because a single night of sleep contains insufficient transitions to characterize these dynamics, extended monitoring of sleep, probably at home, would be necessary for individualized clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W1989909978,"Calreticulin (CRT) is a ubiquitous ER protein involved in multiple cellular processes in animals, such as protein folding and calcium homeostasis. Like in animals, plants have evolved divergent CRTs, but their physiological functions are less understood. Arabidopsis contains three CRT proteins, where the two CRTs AtCRT1a and CRT1b represent one subgroup, and AtCRT3 a divergent member.Through expression of single Arabidopsis family members in CRT-deficient mouse fibroblasts we show that both subgroups have retained basic CRT functions, including ER Ca2+-holding potential and putative chaperone capabilities. However, other more general cellular defects due to the absence of CRT in the fibroblasts, such as cell adhesion deficiencies, were not fully restored. Furthermore, in planta expression, protein localization and mutant analyses revealed that the three Arabidopsis CRTs have acquired specialized functions. The AtCRT1a and CRT1b family members appear to be components of a general ER chaperone network. In contrast, and as recently shown, AtCRT3 is associated with immune responses, and is essential for responsiveness to the bacterial Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) elf18, derived from elongation factor (EF)-Tu. Whereas constitutively expressed AtCRT1a fully complemented Atcrt1b mutants, AtCRT3 did not.We conclude that the physiological functions of the two CRT subgroups in Arabidopsis have diverged, resulting in a role for AtCRT3 in PAMP associated responses, and possibly more general chaperone functions for AtCRT1a and CRT1b."
https://openalex.org/W2016055688,"The epicardium has key functions during myocardial development, by contributing to the formation of coronary endothelial and smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and potentially cardiomyocytes. The epicardium plays a morphogenetic role by emitting signals to promote and maintain cardiomyocyte proliferation. In a regenerative context, the adult epicardium might comprise a progenitor cell population that can be induced to contribute to cardiac repair. Although some genes involved in epicardial function have been identified, a detailed molecular profile of epicardial gene expression has not been available.Using laser capture microscopy, we isolated the epicardial layer from the adult murine heart before or after cardiac infarction in wildtype mice and mice expressing a transgenic IGF-1 propeptide (mIGF-1) that enhances cardiac repair, and analyzed the transcription profile using DNA microarrays.Expression of epithelial genes such as basonuclin, dermokine, and glycoprotein M6A are highly enriched in the epicardial layer, which maintains expression of selected embryonic genes involved in epicardial development in mIGF-1 transgenic hearts. After myocardial infarct, a subset of differentially expressed genes are down-regulated in the epicardium representing an epicardium-specific signature that responds to injury.This study presents the description of the murine epicardial transcriptome obtained from snap frozen tissues, providing essential information for further analysis of this important cardiac cell layer."

It also modulates cellular signaling and perturbs host interferon responses. The multifunctional characteristics of NS5A are mostly attributed to its ability to interact with various cellular proteins. This study aimed to identify the novel cellular factors that interact with NS5A and decipher the significance of this interaction in viral replication. The NS5A-interacting proteins were purified by the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure from cells expressing NS5A and identified by mass spectrometry. The chaperone protein Hsp72 was identified herein. In vivo protein-protein interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and an in situ proximity ligation assay. In addition to NS5A, Hsp72 was also associated with other members of the replicase complex, NS3 and NS5B, suggesting that it might be directly involved in the HCV replication complex. Hsp72 plays a positive regulatory role in HCV RNA replication by increasing levels of the replicase complex, which was attributed either to the increased stability of the viral proteins in the replicase complex or to the enhanced translational activity of the internal ribosome entry site of HCV. The fact that the host chaperone protein Hsp72 is involved in HCV RNA replication may represent a therapeutic target for controlling virus production."
https://openalex.org/W1969335454,"During transendothelial migration, leukocytes use adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, to adhere to the endothelium. ICAM-1 is a dynamic molecule that is localized in the apical membrane of the endothelium and clusters upon binding to leukocytes. However, not much is known about the regulation of ICAM-1 clustering and whether membrane dynamics are linked to the ability of ICAM-1 to cluster and bind leukocyte integrins. Therefore, we studied the dynamics of endothelial ICAM-1 under non-clustered and clustered conditions.Detailed scanning electron and fluorescent microscopy showed that the apical surface of endothelial cells constitutively forms small filopodia-like protrusions that are positive for ICAM-1 and freely move within the lateral plane of the membrane. Clustering of ICAM-1, using anti-ICAM-1 antibody-coated beads, efficiently and rapidly recruits ICAM-1. Using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP), we found that clustering increased the immobile fraction of ICAM-1, compared to non-clustered ICAM-1. This shift required the intracellular portion of ICAM-1. Moreover, biochemical assays showed that ICAM-1 clustering recruited beta-actin and filamin. Cytochalasin B, which interferes with actin polymerization, delayed the clustering of ICAM-1. In addition, we could show that cytochalasin B decreased the immobile fraction of clustered ICAM-1-GFP, but had no effect on non-clustered ICAM-1. Also, the motor protein myosin-II is recruited to ICAM-1 adhesion sites and its inhibition increased the immobile fraction of both non-clustered and clustered ICAM-1. Finally, blocking Rac1 activation, the formation of lipid rafts, myosin-II activity or actin polymerization, but not Src, reduced the adhesive function of ICAM-1, tested under physiological flow conditions.Together, these findings indicate that ICAM-1 clustering is regulated in an inside-out fashion through the actin cytoskeleton. Overall, these data indicate that signaling events within the endothelium are required for efficient ICAM-1-mediated leukocyte adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2078741425,"Background In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). Methods We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. Results Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. Conclusion Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2133741199,"Background Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, has caused many millions of human deaths and still poses a serious threat to global public health. Timely and reliable detection of such a dangerous pathogen is of critical importance. Lysis by specific bacteriophages remains an essential method of Y. pestis detection and plague diagnostics. Methodology/Principal Findings The objective of this work was to develop an alternative to conventional phage lysis tests – a rapid and highly sensitive method of indirect detection of live Y. pestis cells based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) monitoring of amplification of reporter Y. pestis-specific bacteriophages. Plague diagnostic phages φA1122 and L-413C were shown to be highly effective diagnostic tools for the detection and identification of Y. pestis by using qPCR with primers specific for phage DNA. The template DNA extraction step that usually precedes qPCR was omitted. φA1122-specific qPCR enabled the detection of an initial bacterial concentration of 103 CFU/ml (equivalent to as few as one Y. pestis cell per 1-µl sample) in four hours. L-413C-mediated detection of Y. pestis was less sensitive (up to 100 bacteria per sample) but more specific, and thus we propose parallel qPCR for the two phages as a rapid and reliable method of Y. pestis identification. Importantly, φA1122 propagated in simulated clinical blood specimens containing EDTA and its titer rise was detected by both a standard plating test and qPCR. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we developed a novel assay for detection and identification of Y. pestis using amplification of specific phages monitored by qPCR. The method is simple, rapid, highly sensitive, and specific and allows the detection of only live bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2064286176,"Background The functional role of ELR-positive CXC chemokines during viral – induced demyelination was assessed. Inoculation of the neuroattenuated JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the CNS of susceptible mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis that evolves into a chronic demyelinating disease, modeling white matter pathology observed in the human demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis. Methodology/Principal Findings JHMV infection induced the rapid and sustained expression of transcripts specific for the ELR (+) chemokine ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as their binding receptor CXCR2, which was enriched within the spinal cord during chronic infection. Inhibiting CXCR2 signaling with neutralizing antiserum significantly (p<0.03) delayed clinical recovery. Moreover, CXCR2 neutralization was associated with an increase in the severity of demyelination that was independent of viral recrudescence or modulation of neuroinflammation. Rather, blocking CXCR2 was associated with increased numbers of apoptotic cells primarily within white matter tracts, suggesting that oligodendrocytes were affected. JHMV infection of enriched oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures revealed that apoptosis was associated with elevated expression of cleaved caspase 3 and muted Bcl-2 expression. Inclusion of CXCL1 within JHMV infected cultures restricted caspase 3 cleavage and increased Bcl-2 expression that was associated with a significant (p<0.001) decrease in apoptosis. CXCR2 deficient oligodendrocytes were refractory to CXCL1 mediated protection from JHMV – induced apoptosis, readily activating caspase 3 and down regulating Bcl-2. Conclusion/Significance These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for CXCR2 signaling in protecting oligodendrocyte lineage cells from apoptosis during inflammatory demyelination initiated by viral infection of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1992453819,"In humans the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1L is involved in the biogenesis of membrane proteins and facilitates the insertion of both mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded proteins from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane. The C-terminal ∼100-amino acid tail of Oxa1L (Oxa1L-CTT) binds to mitochondrial ribosomes and plays a role in the co-translational insertion of mitochondria-synthesized proteins into the inner membrane. Contrary to suggestions made for yeast Oxa1p, our results indicate that the C-terminal tail of human Oxa1L does not form a coiled-coil helical structure in solution. The Oxa1L-CTT exists primarily as a monomer in solution but forms dimers and tetramers at high salt concentrations. The binding of Oxa1L-CTT to mitochondrial ribosomes is an enthalpy-driven process with a Kd of 0.3–0.8 μm and a stoichiometry of 2. Oxa1L-CTT cross-links to mammalian mitochondrial homologs of the bacterial ribosomal proteins L13, L20, and L28 and to mammalian mitochondrial specific ribosomal proteins MRPL48, MRPL49, and MRPL51. Oxa1L-CTT does not cross-link to proteins decorating the conventional exit tunnel of the bacterial large ribosomal subunit (L22, L23, L24, and L29).

Oxa1L-CTT does not cross-link to proteins decorating the conventional exit tunnel of the bacterial large ribosomal subunit (L22, L23, L24, and L29). Mammalian mitochondria synthesize 13 proteins, all of which are inserted into the respiratory chain complexes in the inner membrane. These hydrophobic polypeptides are integrated into the membrane during or immediately after their synthesis on mitochondrial ribosomes. Members of the Oxa1 evolutionarily conserved family of proteins including mammalian mitochondrial Oxa1L, yeast mitochondrial Oxa1p, chloroplast Alb3, and bacterial YidC are involved in the insertion of hydrophobic proteins into membranes (1Luirink J.

Both of these proteins bind to yeast mitochondrial ribosomes and facilitate the insertion of mitochondrial translation products into the inner membrane. Mammalian systems have a clear homolog of Oxa1p (Oxa1L). Mammals do not have a convincing member of the Mba1 family, although it has been suggested that the role of yeast Mba1 may be played by ribosomal protein MRPL45 in mammals (8Smits P. Smeitink J.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Huynen M.A. Ettema T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4686-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A number of studies have been carried out on yeast and Neurospora crassa Oxa1p. These proteins contain an N-terminal region located in the intermembrane space, 5 transmembrane helices, and a C-terminal tail of about 90 amino acids located in the mitochondrial matrix (4Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Sääf A. Monné M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the C-terminal tail binds to mitochondrial ribosomes and plays an important role in the insertion of newly synthesized mitochondrial polypeptides into the inner membrane (4Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies indicate that yeast Oxa1p is located close to Mrp20 (a homolog of bacterial L23) and MrpL40 (the homolog of L24), both of which are located near the exit tunnel on the large subunit (6Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Jia L. Kaur J. Stuart R.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 1792-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It can also be cross-linked to nascent chains (11Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ribosomes from different organisms are structurally quite diverse (12Pel H.J. Grivell L.A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Kitakawa M. Isono K. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are composed of only 25–30% RNA contributed by two rRNAs, 12 S in the small subunit and 16 S in the large subunit. The bulk of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome consists of proteins (14Pietromonaco S.F. Denslow N.D. O'Brien T.W. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes are 55 S particles and have ∼79 proteins, of which 42 have homologs in prokaryotic ribosomes, whereas 35 are specific for mitochondrial ribosomes. Twenty of these proteins have no clear homologs in yeast mitochondrial ribosomes (15Graack H.R. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 433-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating a significant divergence between the protein composition of mitochondrial ribosomes from higher and lower eukaryotes. These differences may lead to significant alterations in the interaction of mitochondrial ribosomes from different sources with the machinery required for the insertion of mitochondrial translation products into the inner membrane. Stiburek et al. (16Stiburek L. Fornuskova D. Wenchich L. Pejznochova M. Hansikova H. Zeman J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) recently reported that human Oxa1L exists as a 600–700-kDa heterooligomeric complex in mitochondria from human embryonic kidney cells. Knockdown of human Oxa1L damages the biogenesis of the F1F0-ATP synthase and of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) without altering the content of Complexes III or IV. These effects are distinct from those observed in yeast in which the assembly of Complex IV is strongly affected by mutations in Oxa1p (17He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the current report, we have examined the structure of the C-terminal tail of human Oxa1L (Oxa1L-CTT) and analyzed its interaction with the mitochondrial ribosome. High purity chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. A rabbit polyclonal primary antibody to Oxa1L-CTT was made by Pacific Immunology Corp. Secondary antibody, HRP-labeled anti-rabbit antibody, was purchased from GE Healthcare. Protein free blocking agent and dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) 2The abbreviations used are: DMSdimethyl suberimidateRUresonance unitsTFEtrifluoroethanolNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. were purchased from Pierce. Bovine mitochondria, mitochondrial 55 S ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (28 S and 39 S) were prepared as described previously (18Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA clone of human Oxa1L was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC number 10961183, IMAGE 40017377). This cDNA corresponds to the major isoform of Oxa1L in humans (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Q15070; NCBI Q15070). This isoform is present in two variants in humans. One of these has a series of 4 Ser residues near the C terminus (residues 419–422), whereas the other has a series of 5 Ser residues in this location. The construct used in these studies has 436 amino acid residues in the coding region including the import signal and 5 Ser residues (amino acids 419–423) in the C-terminal tail. dimethyl suberimidate resonance units trifluoroethanol nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The cDNA (encompassing amino acids 334–436 of Oxa1L) was amplified out of the pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector using forward primer GGAATTGGCCATATGCGGATTCCAGCAGTACGC and reverse primer CCTTAACTCGAGGCCAAGTGTGTCGTGCCAGGG. The forward primer provides an N-terminal Met. The PCR product was purified and digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the pET21 (c+) vector (Novagen), providing a His6 tag at the C terminus of the expressed protein. This construct was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and the nucleotide sequence of the inserted DNA was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid was subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pArgU218 (19Koc E.C. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35541-35549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for expression. The purification of Oxa1L-CTT was carried out basically as described previously for IF3mt (19Koc E.C. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35541-35549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Bhargava K. Spremulli L.L.

Methods Enzymol. 2007; 430: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using Ni-NTA resins and followed by HPLC purification on a TSKgel SP-5PW column (supplemental Materials and Methods and Fig. S1). The isolated protein is greater than 98% pure. Oxa1L-CTT (14 μm) was incubated in the presence and absence of DMS (1.44 mm) in a 15-μl reaction mixture at the indicated concentrations of KCl in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, and 2 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 25 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 1.5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, giving a final Tris concentration of 91 mm. An equal volume of 2× SDS loading dye was added to the reaction mixtures. Samples were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) and probed with Oxa1L-CTT polyclonal antibody using the ECL Western blotting method as described (22Emdadul Haque M. Grasso D. Miller C. Spremulli L.L. Saada A. Mitochondrion. 2008; 8: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CD spectra were obtained using an Applied Photophysics PiStar-180 spectropolarimeter (Surrey, UK) with a thermostated quartz cell of 1.0-mm path length located in the University North Carolina Macromolecular Interactions Facility. CD spectra were obtained by averaging 50,000 acquisitions with intervals of 0.5 nm from 260 to 190 nm. For CD measurements, protein (0.5 mg/ml) was exchanged into a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. Control buffer spectra were subtracted from the spectra of the protein samples. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge using 6 sector cells at 20 °C by recording the absorbance at 280 nm. Protein concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/ml (24–78 μm), and the corresponding buffer blanks were run in parallel in sample cells at 24,000 rpm until equilibrium was reached (4 h). The offset values were determined by meniscus depletion method by spinning the samples at 48,000 rpm. The absorbance versus the radial distribution profiles were analyzed globally using least squares nonlinear curve fitting (program NONLIN). The absorption equilibrium constant units were converted to molar units using the molar extinction coefficient (12,700 mol−1 cm−1) based on the amino acid composition of Oxa1L-CTT. The interaction of Oxa1L-CTT with the large subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (39 S) was determined using a Biacore 2000 biosensor instrument (located in the UNC Macromolecular Interactions Facility) with an L1 sensor chip (23Nakajima H. Kiyokawa N. Katagiri Y.U. Taguchi T. Suzuki T. Sekino T. Mimori K. Ebata T. Saito M. Nakao H. Takeda T. Fujimoto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42915-42922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Before use, the L1 chip was cleaned with 20 mm CHAPS in running buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by injecting 10 μl at 10 μl/min. After surface cleaning, different amounts of ligands (39 S, 28 S, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)), diluted in running buffer, were injected into three different flow cells. Samples (70 μl of 0.01 μm 39 S, 100 μl of 0.009 μm 28 S, or 60 μl of 3.75 μm BSA) were injected at 5 μl/min until the surfaces were saturated with the ligands as indicated by no further increases in resonance units (RU). All of these materials (ligands) stick on the L1 surface without any loss of RU even after prolonged washing. For analyte binding to the ligands, different amounts of Oxa1L-CTT were injected into the cells. The RU values were recorded for the interaction of Oxa1L-CTT with 39 S subunits, 28 S subunits, and BSA as a function of Oxa1L-CTT concentration. The nonspecific binding surface BSA was used as the control surface. The RU change due to the binding Oxa1L to 39 S or 28 S subunits was obtained by subtracting the RU of the control surface (BSA). Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a ITC200 MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA) with 4 μm 55 S ribosomes and 80 μm Oxa1L-CTT. Ribosome and protein samples were extensively dialyzed in buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol) immediately before the experiments were performed. All solutions were degassed before being loaded into the cell and the titration syringe. After an initial 90-s delay, a series of 2-μl samples of the Oxa1L-CTT solution was injected into the cell containing the ribosomes. The temperature was kept constant at 25 °C, and the mixing speed was 1000 rpm. The reference power was set to 5 μcal/s. Each peak in the power versus time plot was integrated and normalized per mol of injected protein, corrected for heats of ligand dilution by averaging the last three data points and subtracting the average, and plotted against the molar ratio of Oxa1L-CTT to ribosomes. The data were analyzed using MicroCal origin provided by the MicroCal system with a one site binding model. A sample of 39 S ribosomal subunits (20 pmol) was mixed with 400 pmol (4 μm final concentration) of Oxa1L-CTT in cross-linking buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated in 100 μl for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of DMS (0.2 mm). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The cross-linked products were separated from uncross-linked Oxa1L-CTT by layering the reaction mixture on a 30% sucrose cushion in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride buffer followed by centrifugation (Ti70.1 rotor, 42,000 rpm for 12 h). The pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and 8 m urea) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 20 μl of Ni-NTA resin in Buffer A was added to the solution followed by rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. The ribosomal proteins cross-linked to Oxa1L-CTT bound to the Ni-NTA, and unbound proteins were removed by 3 washes of 400 μl each with Buffer A and 2 washes of 400 μl each with Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NH4Cl, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride). The bound proteins were eluted with 2 aliquots of 50 μl each of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, and 250 mm imidazole). A control sample for the identification of ribosomal proteins bound nonspecifically to the Ni-NTA resin was prepared in an identical manner except that Oxa1L-CTT was omitted from the incubation mixture. The cross-linked proteins from both the control sample and the Oxa1L-CTT sample were digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C (24Miller J.L. Koc H. Koc E.C. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The digested samples were lyophilized using a speed vacuum concentrator. The digested peptides (control sample and Oxa1L-CTT cross-linked sample) were dissolved in 20 μl of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid solution and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis as described previously (24Miller J.L. Koc H. Koc E.C. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Miller J.L. Cimen H. Koc H. Koc E.C. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 4789-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tandem MS spectra obtained by fragmenting a peptide by collision-induced dissociation were acquired using a capillary liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) system that consisted of a Surveyor HPLC pump, a Surveyor Micro AS autosampler, and an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). The spectra (peaks) were analyzed using a site-licensed Mascot data base searching program. Individual ion scores of greater than 35 indicate identity or extensive sequence homology when MS/MS data are queried against a data base consisting of mitochondrial ribosomal protein sequences. To explore the structure of human Oxa1L-CTT, a construct encompassing amino acids 333–436 (Fig. 1B) was cloned into a vector carrying a C-terminal His6 tag and expressed in E. coli. The protein was highly expressed (0.8 mg/g of cells or 6.5 mg/liter of culture) and purified to near homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity and strong cation exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). Secondary structure predictions for Oxa1L-CTT (Fig. 1B) indicated that there would be a long α-helical region encompassing residues 40–61 (underlined sequence in Fig. 1B). In addition, several short helical segments were predicted. Further insight into the possible structure of the CTT was obtained using the Rosetta structure prediction protocol (26Bradley P. Misura K.M. Baker D. Science. 2005; 309: 1868-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) to develop a potential three-dimensional structure for Oxa1L-CTT (Fig. 1C). The predicted structure includes the major helical segment encompassing residues 40–61 of the tail as well as several shorter helical segments. Significant regions were not predicted to form traditional secondary structural elements. Previous work (4Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) suggested that the CTT of yeast Oxa1p forms a coiled-coil structure. The tendency of the C-terminal tails to form coiled-coil structures was predicted for Oxa1 from several organisms including yeast, human, bovine, and mouse using the COILS program (27Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil-forming tendency of the four proteins in a 14-residue window is plotted as a function of the position of the amino acid in the primary sequence (Fig. 1D). Yeast Oxa1p is predicted to have nearly a 100% probability of forming a coiled-coil. In mammals, the probability of coiled-coil helix-forming propensity varied from 0.7 to 1 even though human, bovine, and mouse Oxa1 possess more than 90% identity. Very similar results were obtained using a 21-residue window. However, with the MultiCoil (28Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), PairCoil (29Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), or PairCoil2 (30McDonnell A.V. Jiang T. Keating A.E. Berger B. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) programs and a 21-residue window, the probability of coiled-coil formation ranges from 0.4 for the yeast protein to 0.1 for human Oxa1L-CTT. Thus, these programs suggest that the propensity for coiled-coil formation of mammalian Oxa1L-CTT is quite low. To obtain experimental evidence for or against the tendency of human Oxa1L-CTT to form a coiled-coil, a CD analysis was carried out. The molar ellipticity ratio [θ222/θ208] has been used as a criterion in many proteins to determine the presence of coiled-coil helices. The ratio [θ222/θ208] is about 0.83 for non-interacting helices, whereas it is 1.03 for two-stranded coiled-coil helices (31Choy N. Raussens V. Narayanaswami V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 2A, the molar ellipticity ratio [θ222/θ208] for the Oxa1L-CTT examined at several different protein concentrations is 0.52, clearly indicating that this region of Oxa1L does not form a coiled-coil. Similar results were obtained at a variety of salt concentrations (Fig. 2B). This idea is compatible with the modeled structure of the Oxa1L-CTT (Fig. 1C), which predicts a long helical segment that does not interact in solution. Generally, coiled-coil-forming proteins have a tendency to induce helical content with increasing protein concentrations and increasing ionic strength (33Cánaves J.M. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34214-34221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that Oxa1L-CTT does not behave like a typical coiled-coil protein. The % α-helix and β-sheet content were calculated from the CD data using the CDPro program (34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). The CD data were fit using three algorithms (CDSSTR, CONTIL, and SELCON) in CDPro (34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). The outputs obtained from all three algorithms gave very similar values (supplemental Table 1) and indicate that the C-terminal tail is 16–20% α-helical in aqueous solutions at all of the protein and salt concentrations tested. This value is in reasonable agreement with α-helices predicted by computational methods, which suggested a helical content of 25–30%. Further investigation into the potential for Oxa1L-CTT to form a coiled-coil structure was obtained using trifluoroethanol (TFE). This co-solvent is known to disrupt coiled-coil interactions in proteins leading to non-interacting single helices. It can also induce more stable helices in single α-helical segments (35Lau S.Y. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Frère V. Sourgen F. Monnot M. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The helical content of Oxa1L-CTT increased with increasing concentration of TFE (Fig. 2C and supplemental Table 1). The ratio of θ222/θ208 increased from 0.5 to 0.75 with increasing concentrations of TFE. If a coiled-coil were present, then the tertiary structure should be disrupted at high TFE concentration. These results support the conclusion that Oxa1L-CTT does not contain a coiled-coil structural motif. As indicated in supplemental Table S1, TFE induces additional secondary helical structure in Oxa1L-CTT perhaps by stabilizing the helices predicted to form in this protein. This result is supported by tryptophan anisotropy changes upon the addition of TFE to Oxa1L-CTT as described in supplemental Materials and Methods and Fig. S2. Finally, Oxa1L-CTT displays non-cooperative thermal and denaturant unfolding profiles, which also suggest the presence of a straight helix rather than a coiled-coil helical structure (supplemental Results and Fig. S3). Studies in N. crassa have indicated that Oxa1p forms oligomers and may exist as a tetramer (37Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Cryo-EM studies have suggested that yeast Oxa1p binds to E. coli ribosomes in a dimeric form (38Kohler R. Boehringer D. Greber B. Bingel-Erlenmeyer R. Collinson I. Schaffitzel C. Ban N. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of mammalian Oxa1L is unknown. In the mitochondrial inner membrane it exists as a complex with a molecular mass of ∼700 kDa (16Stiburek L. Fornuskova D. Wenchich L. Pejznochova M. Hansikova H. Zeman J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) most likely consisting of an Oxa1L oligomer complexed with other proteins. It is not known whether this protein binds to the ribosome as a monomer or oligomer. To assess the potential ability of Oxa1L-CTT to promote the oligomerization of Oxa1L, we have analyzed its oligomeric state and the strength of the oligomerization by sedimentation equilibrium using analytical ultracentrifugation. The oligomeric state of Oxa1L-CTT was initially tested at low salt concentrations (50 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2) with data collected at two rotor speeds and at three different protein concentrations (Fig. 3A). Good agreement was obtained when the data were fit globally to the equation for a single species. The molecular mass varied from 12.5 and 13.0 kDa at 18,000 and 24,000 rpm, respectively. Thus, at low salt concentrations, the C-terminal tail of Oxa1L is predominantly monomeric. As the KCl concentration was raised to 200 and 300 mm, there was a clear increase in the molecular mass (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S2). The data from these runs were fit to a single species with reasonable variance values (testing goodness of fit) but there was a clear increase in the molecular mass of Oxa1L-CTT with increasing KCl concentrations (supplemental Table S2). At higher salt concentrations, significant improvements in the fits were obtained using a monomer-dimer-tetramer model (considering the theoretical mass of Oxa1L-CTT as 12,700 based on the amino acid composition). The strength of oligomerization of Oxa1L-CTT is in the μm range and clearly depends on the salt concentration (supplemental Table S2). Because Oxa1L-CTT is highly basic (pI = 10.7), it is reasonable that its oligomerization would be stabilized by monovalent ions. To obtain further insights into the oligomerization of Oxa1L-CTT, chemical cross-linking has been carried out using DMS, a homobifunctional cross-linker that reacts with amine groups. For optimization, cross-linking was done with different concentrations of DMS at a fixed concentration of Oxa1L-CTT (data not shown). The salt-dependent formation of Oxa1L-CTT oligomers (dimer and tetramer bands) was visualized by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). This analysis clearly shows the formation of significant amounts of the dimeric species and a lower amount of the tetramer. The dimeric and tetrameric products increased with increasing KCl concentrations as observed for oligomer formation in analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3A). We further characterized the solution behavior of the Oxa1L-CTT and the effects of salt on its hydrodynamic radius using size-exclusion chromatography followed by multiangle light scattering measurements (supplemental Materials and Methods and Fig. S4). The light scattering results are consistent with the analytical ultracentrifugation and DMS cross-linking results and indicate that Oxa1L-CTT can form oligomers. The interaction between Oxa1L-CTT and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits was examined using surface plasmon resonance. Normally one would like to couple the small protein ligand (Oxa1L-CTT) to the surface and flow the larger binding partner (the ribosomal subunits) through. However, Oxa1L-CTT was deactivated after amine coupling, and the interaction of 39 S subunits with Oxa1L-CTT could not be measured using the traditional CM5 chip. As an alternative, the L1 chip was used. These chips are generally used to capture liposomes or lipid bilayers. However, we observed that it was possible to capture mitochondrial 28 S or 39 S subunits on L1 chips. In addition, a control chip was prepared using BSA. Ribosomes and BSA bound tightly to the L1 chip, and there was very little change in RU over a prolonged period of washing in the running buffer. Different concentrations of Oxa1L- CTT were then injected onto the surface, and the RU change was recorded. The sensogram profiles (data not shown) ind"

We examined the efficacy of post transplant administration of a specific CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) in improving animal survival and in enhancing donor hematopoietic cell engraftment using a congeneic mouse transplantation model. AMD3100 was administered subcutaneously at 5 mg/kg body weight 3 times a week beginning at day +2 post-transplant. Post-transplant administration of AMD3100 significantly improves animal survival. AMD3100 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Furthermore, post transplant administration of AMD3100 selectively enhances donor cell engraftment and promotes recovery of all donor cell lineages (myeloid cells, T and B lymphocytes, erythrocytes and platelets). This enhancement results from a combined effect of increased marrow niche availability and greater cell division induced by AMD3100. Our studies shed new lights into the biological roles of SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction in hematopoietic stem cell engraftment following transplantation and in transplant-related mortality. Our results indicate that AMD3100 provides a novel approach for enhancing hematological recovery following transplantation, and will likely benefit patients undergoing transplantation."

We previously reported poor repair of bulky DNA-lesions in rodent testicular cells.We studied the fate of DNA lesions in the male germ line. B[a]PDE-N(2)-dG adducts were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and de novo mutations were measured in the cII-transgene, in Big Blue mice exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P; 3 x 50 mg/kg bw, i.p.). Spermatozoa were harvested at various time-points following exposure, to study the consequences of exposure during the different stages of spermatogenesis. B[a]PDE-N(2)-dG adducts induced by exposure of spermatocytes or later stages of spermatogenesis persisted at high levels in the resulting spermatozoa. Spermatozoa originating from exposed spermatogonia did not contain DNA adducts; however de novo mutations had been induced (p = 0.029), specifically GC-TA transversions, characteristic of B[a]P mutagenesis. Moreover, a specific spectrum of spontaneous mutations was consistently observed in spermatozoa.A temporal pattern of genotoxic consequences following exposure was identified, with an initial increase in DNA adduct levels in spermatozoa, believed to influence fertility, followed by induction of germ line de novo mutations with possible consequences for the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2042854067,"Stabilization strategies adopted by proteins under extreme conditions are very complex and involve various kinds of interactions. Recent studies have shown that a large proportion of proteins have their N- and C-terminal elements in close contact and suggested they play a role in protein folding and stability. However, the biological significance of this contact remains elusive.In the present study, we investigate the role of N- and C-terminal residue interaction using a family 10 xylanase (BSX) with a TIM-barrel structure that shows stability under high temperature, alkali pH, and protease and SDS treatment. Based on crystal structure, an aromatic cluster was identified that involves Phe4, Trp6 and Tyr343 holding the N- and C-terminus together; this is a unique and important feature of this protein that might be crucial for folding and stability under poly-extreme conditions.A series of mutants was created to disrupt this aromatic cluster formation and study the loss of stability and function under given conditions. While the deletions of Phe4 resulted in loss of stability, removal of Trp6 and Tyr343 affected in vivo folding and activity. Alanine substitution with Phe4, Trp6 and Tyr343 drastically decreased stability under all parameters studied. Importantly, substitution of Phe4 with Trp increased stability in SDS treatment. Mass spectrometry results of limited proteolysis further demonstrated that the Arg344 residue is highly susceptible to trypsin digestion in sensitive mutants such as DeltaF4, W6A and Y343A, suggesting again that disruption of the Phe4-Trp6-Tyr343 (F-W-Y) cluster destabilizes the N- and C-terminal interaction. Our results underscore the importance of N- and C-terminal contact through aromatic interactions in protein folding and stability under extreme conditions, and these results may be useful to improve the stability of other proteins under suboptimal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2075812173,"Emerging evidence suggests that DNA methylation plays an expansive role in the central nervous system (CNS). Large-scale whole genome DNA methylation profiling of the normal human brain offers tremendous potential in understanding the role of DNA methylation in brain development and function.Using methylation-sensitive SNP chip analysis (MSNP), we performed whole genome DNA methylation profiling of the prefrontal, occipital, and temporal regions of cerebral cortex, as well as cerebellum. These data provide an unbiased representation of CpG sites comprising 377,509 CpG dinucleotides within both the genic and intergenic euchromatic region of the genome. Our large-scale genome DNA methylation profiling reveals that the prefrontal, occipital, and temporal regions of the cerebral cortex compared to cerebellum have markedly different DNA methylation signatures, with the cerebral cortex being hypermethylated and cerebellum being hypomethylated. Such differences were observed in distinct genomic regions, including genes involved in CNS function. The MSNP data were validated for a subset of these genes, by performing bisulfite cloning and sequencing and confirming that prefrontal, occipital, and temporal cortices are significantly more methylated as compared to the cerebellum.These findings are consistent with known developmental differences in nucleosome repeat lengths in cerebral and cerebellar cortices, with cerebrum exhibiting shorter repeat lengths than cerebellum. Our observed differences in DNA methylation profiles in these regions underscores the potential role of DNA methylation in chromatin structure and organization in CNS, reflecting functional specialization within cortical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2045401720,"High predictive validity--that is, a strong association between the outcome of peer review (usually, reviewers' ratings) and the scientific quality of a manuscript submitted to a journal (measured as citations of the later published paper)--does not as a rule suffice to demonstrate the usefulness of peer review for the selection of manuscripts. To assess usefulness, it is important to include in addition the base rate (proportion of submissions that are fundamentally suitable for publication) and the selection rate (the proportion of submissions accepted).Taking the example of the high-impact journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), we present a general approach for determining the usefulness of peer reviews for the selection of manuscripts for publication. The results of our study show that peer review is useful: 78% of the submissions accepted by AC-IE are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on one review, 69% of the submissions are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on two reviews, and 65% of the submissions are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on three reviews.The paper points out through what changes in the selection rate, base rate or validity coefficient a higher success rate (utility) in the AC-IE selection process could be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2027893274,"There is currently no way to verify the quality of a multiple sequence alignment that is independent of the assumptions used to build it. Sequence alignments are typically evaluated by a number of established criteria: sequence conservation, the number of aligned residues, the frequency of gaps, and the probable correct gap placement. Covariation analysis is used to find putatively important residue pairs in a sequence alignment. Different alignments of the same protein family give different results demonstrating that covariation depends on the quality of the sequence alignment. We thus hypothesized that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses.We show that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses as systematic sequence alignment errors are present even in hand-curated structure-based alignment datasets like those from the Conserved Domain Database. We show that current non-parametric covariation statistics are sensitive to sequence misalignments and that this sensitivity can be used to identify systematic alignment errors. We demonstrate that removing alignment errors due to 1) improper structure alignment, 2) the presence of paralogous sequences, and 3) partial or otherwise erroneous sequences, improves contact prediction by covariation analysis. Finally we describe two non-parametric covariation statistics that are less sensitive to sequence alignment errors than those described previously in the literature.Protein alignments with errors lead to false positive and false negative conclusions (incorrect assignment of covariation and conservation, respectively). Covariation analysis can provide a verification step, independent of traditional criteria, to identify systematic misalignments in protein alignments. Two non-parametric statistics are shown to be somewhat insensitive to misalignment errors, providing increased confidence in contact prediction when analyzing alignments with erroneous regions because of an emphasis on they emphasize pairwise covariation over group covariation."
https://openalex.org/W1983157757,"Messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) are used to transport mRNAs along neuronal dendrites to their site of translation. Numerous mRNA-binding and regulatory proteins within mRNPs finely regulate the fate of bound-mRNAs. Their specific combination defines different types of mRNPs that in turn are related to specific synaptic functions. One of these mRNA-binding proteins, Staufen2 (Stau2), was shown to transport dendritic mRNAs along microtubules. Its knockdown expression in neurons was shown to change spine morphology and synaptic functions. To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which Stau2 modulates synaptic function in neurons, it is important to identify and characterize protein co-factors that regulate the fate of Stau2-containing mRNPs. To this end, a proteomic approach was used to identify co-immunoprecipitated proteins in Staufen2-containing mRNPs isolated from embryonic rat brains. The proteomic approach identified mRNA-binding proteins (PABPC1, hnRNP H1, YB1 and hsc70), proteins of the cytoskeleton (alpha- and beta-tubulin) and RUFY3 a poorly characterized protein. While PABPC1 and YB1 associate with Stau2-containing mRNPs through RNAs, hsc70 is directly bound to Stau2 and this interaction is regulated by ATP. PABPC1 and YB1 proteins formed puncta in dendrites of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. However, they poorly co-localized with Stau2 in the large dendritic complexes suggesting that they are rather components of Stau2-containing mRNA particles. All together, these results represent a further step in the characterization of Stau2-containing mRNPs in neurons and provide new tools to study and understand how Stau2-containing mRNPs are transported, translationally silenced during transport and/or locally expressed according to cell needs."

In addition, knockout mice have contributed significantly to our understanding of the roles of specific molecules and cytokines in these models. However, results can vary significantly depending on the mouse strain used in the model, and in particularly in understanding the effect of specific knockouts. For example, it can be equivocal as to whether specific gene knockouts affect the susceptibility of the mice to developing the disease, or lead to resistance. Here we used a house dust mite model of allergic airway inflammation to examine the response of two strains of mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) which differ in their responses in allergic airway inflammation. We demonstrate an algorithm that can facilitate the understanding of the behavior of these models with regards to susceptibility (to allergic airway inflammation) (Saai) or resistance (Raai) in this model. We verify that both C57BL/6 and BALB/c develop disease, but BALB/c mice have higher Saai for development. We then use this approach to show that the absence of the Tec family kinase Itk, which regulates the production of Th2 cytokines, leads to Raai in the C57BL/6 background, but decreases Saai on the BALB/c background. We suggest that the use of such approaches could clarify the behavior of various knockout mice in modeling allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1975676092,"TIA-1-related (TIAR) protein is a shuttling RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism. While in the nucleus TIAR participates to alternative splicing events, in the cytoplasm TIAR acts as a translational repressor on specific transcripts such as those containing AU-Rich Elements (AREs). Due to its ability to assemble abortive pre-initiation complexes coalescing into cytoplasmic granules called stress granules, TIAR is also involved in the general translational arrest observed in cells exposed to environmental stress. However, the in vivo role of this protein has not been studied so far mainly due to severe embryonic lethality upon tiar invalidation.To examine potential TIAR tissue-specificity in various cellular contexts, either embryonic or adult, we constructed a TIAR transgenic allele (loxPGFPloxPTIAR) allowing the conditional expression of TIAR protein upon Cre recombinase activity. Here, we report the role of TIAR during mouse embryogenesis. We observed that early TIAR overexpression led to low transgene transmission associated with embryonic lethality starting at early post-implantation stages. Interestingly, while pre-implantation steps evolved correctly in utero, in vitro cultured embryos were very sensitive to culture medium. Control and transgenic embryos developed equally well in the G2 medium, whereas culture in M16 medium led to the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha that accumulated in cytoplasmic granules precluding transgenic blastocyst hatching. Our results thus reveal a differential TIAR-mediated embryonic response following artificial or natural growth environment.This study reports the importance of the tightly balanced expression of the RNA-binding protein TIAR for normal embryonic development, thereby emphasizing the role of post-transcriptional regulations in early embryonic programming."
https://openalex.org/W2020923609,"Phagocytosis is a complex multistep process requiring diverse signaling and regulatory molecules. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a small GTPase, is known to regulate membrane trafficking and the actin cytoskeketon at the plasma membrane and functions as a regulatory molecule of phagocytosis. ARF activity is regulated by cycling between GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms. ARF activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that facilitate GTP binding. We had earlier reported a 100-kDa ARF-GEF, termed ARF-guanine nucleotide exchange protein 100, GEP100, that preferentially activates ARF6 and was also described by Dunphy et al. (Dunphy, J. L., Moravec, R., Ly, K., Lasell, T. K., Melancon, P., and Casanova, J. E. (2006) Curr. Biol. 16, 315-320) as brefeldin A-resistant ARF-GEF2 (BRAG2). We have now examined a role for GEP100 in phagocytosis. Stable depletion of GEP100 decreased phagocytosis of serum-treated zymosan and IgG-coated latex beads by human monocyte-macrophage-like U937 cells differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Decrease of phagocytic activity by RNAi was not rescued by GEP100ΔSec7, a deletion mutant lacking the ARF-activating domain. GEP100-depleted cells also exhibited reduced F-actin fibers around internalized particles. Attachment of these particles to cells and amounts of C3bi and Fcγ receptors, however, were not affected by GEP100 depletion. On immunofluorescence microscopy, GEP100 and ARF6 were concentrated and partially colocalized around internalized particles. Phagocytosis by GEP100-depleted cells was not further affected by depletion of ARF6. Phagocytic activity of GEP100-depleted cells was, however, rescued by expression of the constitutively active ARF6Q67N mutant but not by the dominant-negative ARF6T27N mutant. These data are consistent with the conclusion that GEP100 functions in phagocytosis via its role in ARF6-dependent actin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2024944047,"Background As HIV-related deaths increase in a population the usual association between low socioeconomic status and child mortality may change, particularly as death rates from other causes decline. Methods/Principal Findings As part of a demographic surveillance system in northern Malawi in 2002-6, covering a population of 32,000, information was collected on socio-economic status of the households. Deaths were classified as HIV/AIDS-related or not by verbal autopsy. Poisson regression models were used to assess the association of socio-economic indicators with all-cause mortality, AIDS-mortality and non-AIDS mortality among children. There were 195 deaths in infants, 109 in children aged 1–4 years, and 38 in children aged 5–15. All-cause child mortality in infants and 1–4 year olds was similar in households with higher and lower socio-economic status. In infants 13% of deaths were attributed to AIDS, and there were no clear trends with socio-economic status for AIDS or non-AIDS causes. For 1–4 year olds 27% of deaths were attributed to AIDS. AIDS mortality was higher among those with better built houses, and lowest in those with income from farming and fishing, whereas non-AIDS mortality was higher in those with worse built houses, lowest in those with income from employment, and decreased with increasing household assets. Conclusions/Significance In this population, since HIV infection among adults was initially more common among the less poor, childhood mortality patterns have changed. The usual gap in survival between the poor and the less poor has been lost, but because the less poor have been disproportionately affected by HIV, rather than because of relative improvement in the survival of the poorest."
https://openalex.org/W2034668581,"MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a direct substrate of p38 MAPK, plays key roles in multiple physiological functions in mitosis. Here, we show for the first time the unique distribution pattern of MK2 in meiosis. Phospho-MK2 was localized on bipolar spindle minus ends and along the interstitial axes of homologous chromosomes extending over centromere regions and arm regions at metaphase of first meiosis (MI stage) in mouse oocytes. At metaphase of second meiosis (MII stage), p-MK2 was localized on the bipolar spindle minus ends and at the inner centromere region of sister chromatids as dots. Knockdown or inhibition of MK2 resulted in spindle defects. Spindles were surrounded by irregular nondisjunction chromosomes, which were arranged in an amphitelic or syntelic/monotelic manner, or chromosomes detached from the spindles. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments were impaired in MK2-deficient oocytes because spindle microtubules became unstable in response to cold treatment. In addition, homologous chromosome segregation and meiosis progression were inhibited in these oocytes. Our data suggest that MK2 may be essential for functional meiotic bipolar spindle formation, chromosome segregation and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments."
