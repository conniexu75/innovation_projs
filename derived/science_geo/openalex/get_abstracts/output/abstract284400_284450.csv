https://openalex.org/W2170039023,"Feeding currents of free-swimming calanoid copepods, observed through an expanded krypton laser beam and a back-focus dark-field optical system, show that these planktonic animals generate a double shear field to help in detecting food. The interrelation between flow field, perception of food items, and body orientation explains why these animals are generally negatively buoyant."
https://openalex.org/W2018559125,"Segments taken from the basal 15 to 20 millimeters of the two innermost leaves of an orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) genotype produced somatic (nonzygotic) embryos directly from mesophyll cells without an intervening callus when cultured on an agar medium with 30 micromolar 3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid (dicamba). This demonstration of high-frequency embryogenesis from mesophyll cells in Gramineae is strong evidence for totipotency of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079087679,"The tokamak is a prototype fusion device in which a toroidal Magnetic field is used to confine a hot plasma. Coherent waves, excited near the plasma edge, can be used to transport energy into the plasma in order to heat it to the temperatures required for thermonuclear fusion. In addition, tokamak plasmas are known to exhibit high levels of turbulent density fluctuations, which can transport particles and energy out of the plasma. Recently, experiments have been conducted to elucidate the nature of both the coherent waves and the turbulence. The experiments provide insight into a broad range of interesting linear and nonlinear plasma phenomena and into many of the processes that determine such practical things as plasma heating and confinement."
https://openalex.org/W1985188954,"Females of the tropical cockroach Xestoblatta hamata feed on urates offered by the male after copulation. Females on nitrogen-deficient diets ingest and transfer to their maturing oocytes more male-derived uric acid than do females on high-protein diets. In isolated females, the greatest uptake of uric acid by the ovaries occurs during the mating stage in the reproductive cycle. Uric acid from males contributes significantly to the female's nitrogen pool and may help shorten the time between mating and oviposition. In both field and laboratory experiments males choose high-protein foods and dietary uric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2091211846,"Abdominal coremata in male Estigmene acrea (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) are inflated and displayed in aggregations to which females and males are attracted and where mating occurs (leks). Female E. acrea also release a sex pheromone which attracts males. These two mating behaviors occur in the same populations at different peak times on the same nights. Thus male lek formation and female calling occur in the same species, and the male coremata, or related structures, appear to be integrally associated with lek behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2046311073,A dilute solution of potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate induces oviposition in artificial eggs by the egg parasitoids Trichogramma pretiosum and T. minutum. The ability to obtain large numbers of eggs through the use of this inexpensive solution is a major advance toward the development of diets and the large-scale production of Trichogramma spp. in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W74682090,"UA-1 and UA-2 are code names for two groups of physicists at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), together comprising almost 200 researchers. From data collected in two 3-month-long runs last fall and spring, the groups have collected 100 intermediate vector bosons (90 W's and 10 Z/sup 0/'s) whose properties so far fit the predictions of the unified quantum field theory of the electromagnetic and weak forces. Although the number of events is short of staggering, the discovery is immensely important. Physicists have been looking for the W for about 50 years. The Z/sup 0/ is crucial to the success of the method by which the two forces were melded into one - the electro-weak force."
https://openalex.org/W2066319605,"Orthopyroxene lamellae exsolved from augite on (100) are shown to grow by a two-step process involving (i) the diffusion of calcium and (magnesium, iron) to form clinohypersthene and (ii) the inversion of clinohypersthene to orthopyroxene, probably by glide twinning. If complete inversion is prevented by cooling or steep concentration gradients, the two-step process produces orthopyroxene with narrow margins of clinohypersthene. Measured elemental concentration gradients at (100) lamellar interfaces support this mechanism."
