https://openalex.org/W1580814042,"Carbamyl-P synthetase (EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydro-orotase (EC 3.5.2.3), the first three enzymes of the de novo pathway for synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, have been co-purified as a single oligomeric protein from a mutant line of hamster cells selected for its ability to resist N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a potent and specific inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase. All three enzymes overaccum,late in the mutant cells (Kempe, T.D., Swyryd, E.A., Bruist, M., and Stark, G.R. (1976) Cell 9, 541-550) and the oligomer represents nearly 10% of the total cellular protein. Tens of milligrams of oligomer have been purified to homogeneity by a simple and rapid procedure, with recovery of about 50% of all three activities. The pure protein contains only one size of polypeptide, Mr approximately 200,000, as revealed by electrophoresis in danaturing gels. All three enzyme activities are associated with this polypeptide, indicating that it is multifunctional. Further evidence for a multifunctional protein is provided by titration of the oligomer with radioactive PALA, which reveals that the number of PALA binding sites approximately equals the number of polypeptide chains. The isolated multifunctional protein is a mixture of trimers and hexamers."
https://openalex.org/W1489292103,"An enzyme that hydrolyzes the O-glycosidic linkage between alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and serine or threonine in mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins was purified by chromatography on an Affi-Gel 202 column or isoelectric focusing from filtrates of Diplococcus pneumoniae cultures. The final preparations were free of protease and a wide range of other glycosidase activities. The preparation obtained by isoelectric focusing was shown to consist of a single protein by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. This preparation had an apparent molecular weight of about 160,000, determined by gel filtration, an optimum pH of 7.6, and an isoelectric point in the range pH 8 to 9. The enzyme releases the disaccharide Gal-GalNAc from a variety of glycopeptide and glycoprotein substrates and appears to have a specific requirement for an unsubstituted galactose in the nonreducing terminus and an alpha linkage between N-acetylgalactosamine and the aglycone. This is the only endoenzyme known capable of cleaving the linkage between a carbohydrate and serine or threonine residues in glycoproteins. The ability of this enzyme to act on macromolecular substrates and its pH optimum makes it ideally suited to explore the distribution and function of mucin-type glycoproteins on normal and cancer cell surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2048619611,"beta-Adrenergic antagonists injected into the amygdala complex of rats trained in a passive avoidance task produced time-dependent and dose-dependent decreases in retention of the task. In addition, the effects observed with beta-adrenergic antagonists were both stereospecific and reversed by norepinephrine. The results support a role for an amygdala beta-adrenergic system in memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2432179967,"1. The membrane-integrated portion (TF0) of the proton translocating ATPase complex (TF0-F1) of the thermophilic bacterium PS3 was highly purified. Its proton-conducting activity was investigated in vesicles reconstituted from TF0 and phospholipids (TF0 vesicles). 2. The rate of proton conduction through TF0 was proportional to the membrane potential imposed (6H+ uptake/s/TF0 molecule with 103 mV at pH 8.0). The pH profile of the rate revealed that a proton, not a hydroxy ion, was the true substrate conducted and that there was a monoprotic proton binding site in TF0 (pKa = 6.8). The temperature coefficient of proton conductance of TF0 showed a considerable variation depending on the phospholipids of the vesicles with respective transition temperatures. 3. Passive proton conduction through TF0 was inhibited stoichiometrically by addition of either the soluble ATPase portion (TF1) of TF0-F1, or an energy transfer inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or an antibody against TF0. 4. The proton conductance of TF0 was concluded to represent its intrinsic activity in the original TF0-F1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1514852301,"The activity of yeast phosphofructokinase assayed in vitro at physiological concentrations of known substrates and effectors is 100-fold lower than the glycolytic flux observed in vivo. Phosphate synergistically with AMP activates the enzyme to a level within the range of the physiological needs. The activation by phosphate is pH-dependent: the activation is 100-fold at pH 6.4 while no effect is observed at pH 7.5. The activation by AMP, phosphate, or both together is primarily due to changes in the affinity of the enzyme for fructose-6-P. Under conditions similar to those prevailing in glycolysing yeast (pH 6.4, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NH4+) the apparent affinity constant for fructose-6-P (S0.5) decreases from 3 to 1.4 mM upon addition of 1 mM AMP or 10 mM phosphate; if both activators are present together, S0.5 is further decreased to 0.2 mM. In all cases the cooperativity toward fructose-6-P remains unchanged. These results are consistent with a model for phosphofructokinase where two conformations, with different affinities for fructose-6-P and ATP, will present the same affinity for AMP and phosphate. AMP would diminish the affinity for ATP at the regulatory site and phosphate would increase the affinity for fructose-6-P. The results obtained indicate that the activity of phosphofructokinase in the shift glycolysis-gluconeogenesis is mainly regulated by changes in the concentration of fructose-6-P."

https://openalex.org/W2088653619,"Previous perfusion studies of the human jejunum suggested that conjugated folate is hydrolyzed on the mucosal surface. The techniques of cell fractionation and DEAE and gel chromatography led to the identification of two separate folate conjugase activities in human jejunal mucosa: one membrane-bound and concentrated in the brush border, the other soluble and intracellular. These enzyme activities exhibit different pH optima, molecular weights, and inhibition characteristics. Folate conjugase in the brush border may accomplish the initial digestion of dietary pteroylpolyglutamates."
https://openalex.org/W1488666929,"The oxygen-dependent photooxidation of NADPH in the presence of hematoporphyrin in D2O results in the production of enzymatically active NADP+. The reaction is not inhibited by benzoate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase, or catalase. Moreover, addition of either potassium superoxide or H2O2 does not potentiate the reaction. This suggests OH-, H2O2, and O-2 are not likely to be the reactive oxygen species in this system. The oxidation is inhibited by various singlet oxygen quenchers and inhibitors such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 2,5-dimethylfuran plus methanol, histidine, and methionine. In addition, the rate of oxidation in H2O is less than one-fifth of that in D2O. The results suggest a singlet oxygen-mediated process. During the oxidation, no superoxide radical production could be detected with either ferricytochrome c or nitroblue tetrazolium. However, H2O2 has been found as one of the products. These observations are consistent with an oxidation-reduction reaction between singlet oxygen and NADPH to form H2O2 and NADP+, catalyzed by the light-activated photosensitizer hematoporphyrin."

https://openalex.org/W97769542,"Neurotensin was iodinated at equimolar concentrations of peptide, iodide, and chloramine-T, producing a labeled peptide with a specific activity of 1000 to 2000 Ci/mmol. Rat mast cells specifically and reversibly bound 1.27 pmol of neurotensin/10(6) cells with a reversible affinity, KD, of 154 nM. Optimum specific binding occurred betwen pH 6.8 and 7.2 under hypotonic conditions and dropped sharply as buffer concentration increased beyond 10 mM. The divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ prevented binding with 50% inhibition at 1.5 and 4 mM, respectively. Binding was strongly and equally inhibited by the sodium and potassium salts of chloride, bromide, and iodide, and to a lesser degree by LiCl. Maximum binding of 125I-neurotensin occurred within 10 min at 0 degrees, and within 1.5 to 2 min binding was reduced to half-maximum in the presence of excess unlabeled neurotensin or upon 20-fold dilution in buffer. Both CaCl2 and NaCl were able to dissociate 60% of the total bound neurotensin: half the label bound was removed in 4 to 6 min. EDTA inhibited the binding only at high concentrations and no requirement was found for sulfhydryl groups, ATP, or a glycoprotein in the binding of neurotensin."

https://openalex.org/W1479976296,The electrical and chemical components of the electrochemical proton gradient of submitochondrial particles can be monitored simultaneously by continuously recording optical signals from the probes oxonol-VI and 9-aminoacridine. Either respiration or ATP hydrolysis causes a red shift in the absorption spectrum of oxonol-VI indicative of a membrane potential and a decrease of the fluorescence of 9-aminoacridine indicative of a pH gradient. The magnitude of the membrane potential and pH gradient formed by respiring submitochondrial particles can be modulated by the thermodynamic phosphorylation potential (deltaGp) of the adenine nucleotide system. deltaGp is the Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis and is defined by the relationship deltaGp = -deltaG'o + RTln([ATP]/[ADP][Pi] where deltaG'o is the standard free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Increasing values of deltaGp cause an increase in the steady state magnitudes of both the membrane potential and pH gradient. Thermodynamic phosphorylation potential titration experiments indicate that the electrochemical proton gradient normally maintained by respiring submitochondrial particles has an energy equivalent to 10.5 to 10.9 kcal/mol.

https://openalex.org/W1582510651,"Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) was purified from fresh human plasma by affinity, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The protein gave a single band in overloaded analytical disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight was 54,000 and E1%/1 cm at 280 nm, corrected for thyroxine (T4) absorbance, was 6.17. Six preparations of TBG contained from 0.09 to 0.64 mol of T4/mol; the TBG used in this study contained 0.19 mol of T4 and was able to bind an additional 0.85 mol. The carbohydrate composition was determined and accounted for 23% of the molecular weight. Four lines of chemical and physical evidence failed to demonstrate subunits. These included quantitative COOH-terminal amino acid analysis, peptide mapping and amino acid composition, treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and denaturation of the reduced, alkylated protein with guanidine. From these data, we conclude that TBG is a single polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1511156825,"When the crude mitochondrial fraction of rat brain was homogenized with distilled water and centrifuged, most of guanylate cyclase activity was detected in the soluble fraction. The total guanylate cyclase activity recovered in the soluble fraction was 5- to 8-fold higher than that of the crude mitochondrial fraction. The greater recovery of guanylate cyclase activity was found to be due to a release of an endogenous activating factor for guanylate cyclase. The activating factor was partially purified by acid extraction followed by a gel filtration and ion exchange resin columns. The factor was a dialyzable small molecule. The molecular weight was estimated to be between 300 and 600 by a Sephadex G-15 column and Diaflo ultrafilter membranes. It was stable in dilute acids, but labile in alkaline solution. It was readily soluble in water, but insoluble in organic solvents. Treatment with various enzymes, so far as tested, failed to abolish the activity. The activating factor stimulated the initial velocity of the reaction. It altered neither the Km value for GTP nor the dependency of the enzyme on divalent metals. The activation by the factor was due to an increase in the Vmax of the reaction. The activation was prevented by lysolecithin, Lubrol PX, hydroxylamine, methylhydroxylamine, or hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1580608537,"Facilitated diffusion of [14C]lactose into inverted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli was measured using HgCl2 as a stopping reagent and polylysine to flocculate the vesicles for filtration. Equilibration of lactose between the internal and external volumes required expression of the y gene of the lac operon and was inhibited by thiodigalactoside or by prior incubation with N-ethylmaleimde or HgCl2. The initial rate of uptake was saturable, with a Kt of 0.95 mM. Counterflow of [14C]lactose was demonstrated in either direction. ATP hydrolysis or respiration drove the efflux of internal lactose. The effect of ATP required addition of F1 coupling factor (ATPase) from E. coli when lactose transport was studied in F1-deficient inverted vesicles. Accumulation of lactose against a concentration gradient was achieved by forming an artificial electrochemical proton gradient consisting of a membrane potential negative inside or a pH gradient basic inside. Addition of ATP inhibited this proton driven uptake showing that it occurred in inverted vesicles. It was concluded that the lactose-proton co-transport protein (M protein) is qualitatively symmetrical with respect to the facilitated diffusion of lactose and the coupling of proton and lactose transport."

https://openalex.org/W1513035163,"The rates of reaction of myoglobin with carbon monoxide at low pH are reported. The pH versus rate profile of these kinetics resembles that found for heme model compounds, revealing an increase in combination rate at low pH. These facts suggest that CO binding by myoglobin changes from a mechanism of direct ligant association at pH 5 to a mechanism, similar to that proposed for heme model compounds, which assumes a tetracoordinated intermediate as a result of the protonation of the proximal imidazole."

https://openalex.org/W2052855744,Deuterolysis experiments suggest that hydrogen cyanide polymers rather than aminoacetonitriles are major precursors of alpha-amino acids obtained from spark reactions and other studies on chemical evolution. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the original heteropolypeptides on the earth were synthesized spontaneously from hydrogen cyanide and water without the intervening formation of alpha-amino acids.
https://openalex.org/W2061316170,"Repeated administration of flurazepam reduced stage 4 sleep (high delta-wave concentration) but produced a greater increase in stage 2 duration so that total sleep time was increased. Computer analysis revealed that the increased amount of stage 2 (low delta-wave concentration) sleep provided a number and duration of delta waves sufficient to offset the loss of delta activity in stage 4. However, the amplitude of the average delta wave was reduced. These results demonstrate the value of direct quantification of delta-wave activity, the variable that underlies visual classification of slow-wave sleep into stages 2 to 4. They also give rise to new hypotheses regarding the relative absence of side effects in spite of profound stage 4 suppression by flurazepam and the mechanisms by which total sleep time is increased by this drug."

https://openalex.org/W1486708736,"Glucose-6-phosphatase (glucose-6-phosphohydrolase and its associated phosphotransferase activities) was determined in brain tissue and in several preparations derived from brain tissue. These included purified capillaries and established cell lines of neuronal or glial origin. Since it has been suggested that glucose-6-phosphatase may be involved in sugar transport, the characteristics of that process were examined in these preparations. The pattern of uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in four cell lines was shown to involve transport of the analog across the cell membrane that was more rapid than the subsequent phosphorylation of the sugar in the intracellular compartment. In the remaining cell lines and in purified capillaries, phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose was at least as rapid as uptake. No differences could be found between the cells in these two categories with respect to amount or localization of glucose-6-phosphatase, ability to phosphorylate 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, or ability to phosphorylate extracellular and intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In the course of these experiments, it was found that there was a rapid efflux of 2-deoxy-D-glucose from cells that had taken up this sugar. The efflux involves a dephosphorylation step catalyzed by intracellular phosphatase that releases free sugar in the cytoplasm. Glucose-6-phosphatase thus probably has no major role in the phosphorylation of glucose in brain cells, but acts in the more conventional sense, i.e. as a phosphohydrolase."

https://openalex.org/W1507776034,"Treatment of human erythrocytes with phospholipid vesicles induces a selective membrane permeability defect which leads to osmotic lysis. The defective cells exhibit a massive sodium ion leak while maintaining normal impermeability to other cations, anions, and neutral small molecules. The sodium ion influx and resulting hemolysis may be inhibited by increased pH, by tetrodotoxin, and by reintroduction of vesicle-extracted proteins into the cell. These characteristics suggest that phospholipid vesicle treatment destroys the cell by disrupting a membrane protein system involved in regulation of cation permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1666900670,"Horseradish peroxidase can be reconstituted with cobalt porphyrin to give a cobaltic holoenzyme having physicochemical properties quite similar to those of the native ferric protein. The cobaltic protein (Co3+HRP) can be reduced to the cobaltous form (CoHRP), the analogue of ferroperoxidase and the reduced cobalt protein can bind O2 to form an analogue of oxyferroperoxidase (Compound III). Since both the CoHRP and oxy-CoHRP are EPR-visible, the cobalt has been used to probe the nature of the heme crevice in these two protein forms. The occurrence of a three-line 14N superhyperfine pattern in the spectrum of the former unambiguously shows that in the divalent state of the protein the proximal axial ligand is a nitrogenous base. The spectrum of the latter shows a uniquely large Aparallel(59Co) = 23.2 G. Although we confirm the reported failure of the Co3+HRP to catalyze peroxide-dependent oxidations of classical peroxidase substrates (Gjessing, E.C., and Sumner, J.B. (1942) Arch. Biochem. 1, 1), the oxy-CoHRP does undergo oxidation-reduction reactions analogous to those exhibited in the cytochrome P-450 catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1629453918,"Structural parameters of rhodopsin in disc membrane preparations from frog and cattle were studied by hydrogen exchange methods. The method measures the exchange of protein amide hydrogens with water and can distinguish protons which are internally bonded from those which are hydrogen-bonded to water. The results show that about 70% of rhodopsin's peptide group protons are exposed to water. The identification of these groups as free peptides was made initially on the usual basis of the identity of their exchange rate with the well characterized free peptide rate; other experiments specifically excluded contributions from lipids, protein side chains, adventitious mucopolysaccharides, and intradisc water. In contrast to rhodopsin, other proteins generally have only 20 to 40% free peptide groups. Apparently rhodopsin has some unusual structural feature. Our results together with available information on rhodopsin suggest that a considerable length of its polypeptide chain is arranged at the surface of a channel of water penetrating into the membrane. Physicochemical considerations indicate that such a channel would have to be quite wide, 10 to 12 A or more, to explain the hydrogen exchange results."
https://openalex.org/W2087124153,"In the enzymatic hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids, tetrahydrobiopterin is the essential cofactor. Regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin requires dihydropteridine reductase, without which there should be a deficiency of hydroxylated amino acids and their products, biogenic amines. Assay of biopsied brain cortex of a patient with a deficiency of dihydropteridine reductases showed low concentrations of serotonin and dopamine, and this was reflected in the concentrations of their major metabolites measured in cerebrospinal fluid from lumbar, ventricular, and subarachnoid spaces. The metabolite concentrations were restored to normal, or above normal, by treatment with specific amino acids which bypass the metabolic block at the hydroxylation step. It is postulated that the seizures and neurological deterioration of the patient were related to a deficiency in the synthesis of biogenic amine neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W160782080,"Oxidized and reduced manganese cytochromes c, Mn Cyt c+ and Mn Cyt c, have been synthesized. Mn Cyt c+ and Fe Cyt c+ have identical electrophoretic and ion exchange mobilities. Mn Cyt c+ does not bind F-, CN-, or N3- ions; Mn Cyt c does not bind CO or O2. Mn Cyt c is very rapidly autooxidized by O2 even at -50 degrees. The manganese ion is readily dissociated from Mn Cyt c at acidic pH values. Both Mn Cyt c and Mn Cyt c+ are high spin complexes with 3d5 S = 5/2 and 3d4 S = 2 electronic configurations, respectively. The epr spectrum of Mn Cyt c is rhombic with (formula: see text). Both oxidized and reduced Mn Cyt c react with NO; the former reaction is reversible and the product has the following epr spectral parameters: (formula: see text). There is no superhyperfine interaction observable with the NO ligand, and the unpaired electron density is estimated to be mostly in the metal ion d xy orbital. The structure is best formulated as Mn Cyt c (NO)+. The half-reduction potential of Mn Cyt c is + 60 +/- 40 mV. It is neither oxidized by cytochrome oxidase nor reduced by NADH, NADPH, or succinate cytochrome reductase. These physical, chemical, and enzymic properties of manganese cytochromes c suggest a five-coordinate metalloporphyrin prosthetic group with the manganese ion situated significantly out-of-plane toward the side of His-18."

https://openalex.org/W1573147813,"The kinetic mechanism of the sheep brain glutamine synthetase has been examined by both initial rate kinetics using the glutamate analog beta-glutamate and by isotope exchange measurements at equilibrium. Results of the initial rate studies were compatible with a number of sequential mechanisms but not with a partially or fully ordered rapid equilibrium or a ping-pong mechanism. Kinetic parameters at 37 degrees and pH 7.2 were K beta-Glu = 16 mM, KATP = 0.28 mM, and KNH2OH = 1.4 mM. For all equilibrium exchanges studied (ATP in equilibrium ADP, ATP in equilibrium Pi, and Glu in equilibrium Gln), the rate of exchange rose smoothly to a maximum as all substrates and products were simultaneously raised in a constant ratio. This result is in accord with a random order of substrate addition. A brief treatment of equilibrium exchange rates in cases where all substrate/product pairs are varied together is also presented."

https://openalex.org/W102456356,"Upon removal of the nucleus from rat hepatoma tissue culture cells, levels of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase no longer change in response to withdrawal of glucocorticoids. The rate of tyrosine aminotransferase degradation is drastically reduced in rat hepatoma tissue culture cytoplasts leading to stabilization of pre-existing levels of tyrosine aminotransferase. Moreover, the rate of synthesis of the enzyme in cytoplasts is very low near that observed in uninduced whole cells. These effects of enucleation occur very rapidly and appear to be specific for tyrosine aminotransferase and a small number of other unstable hepatoma proteins. A nuclear effect is thus directly involved in the control of tyrosine aminotransferase degradation and synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1495926950,"The adenylate energy charge of human ejaculated spermatozoa was studied when the sperm motility was perturbed by varying pH, prolonged incubation, and caffeine. Between pH 8 and 9, which was optimal for the sperm motility, the energy charge was in the physiological range of 0.8 to 0.9. Above pH 9, the mobility, ATP content, and adenine nucleotide pool declined rapidly but the energy charge was maintained slightly below 0.8. Below pH 8, the motility also dropped drastically, but the ATP, nucleotide pool, and energy charge fell only slightly. Prolonged incubations of the spermatozoa decreased the motility, ATP, and nucleotide pool. However, the energy charge would remain above 0.6. Caffeine stimulation of the motility caused a rapid fall of ATP and the reduction of the physiological energy charge by 0.2 unit, unless glucose was added. Imidazole which reduced the caffeine-stimulated motility did not alter the physiological energy charge of the spermatozoa. The study showed that the spermatozoa could maintain the energy charge above 0.6 under stress."
https://openalex.org/W69611900,"Membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase of Bacillus licheniformis 749/c is derepressed by glucose in complex and chemically defined media. In the presence of lactate, pyruvate, or succinate the synthesis is repressed. The lactate repression neither affects total protein synthesis nor inhibits penicillinase synthesis. Thus, carbon sources specifically influence alkaline phosphatase synthesis. Although variations in the inorganic phosphate content of the growth media directly affect alkaline phosphatase synthesis, the intracellular inorganic and total phosphate pools appear to be unrelated to its repression or derepression. During lactate repression there is preferential incorporation of lactate molecules into glycogen, whereas no such incorporation could be detected from glucose. Net glycogen synthesis remains the same in glucose- or lactate-grown cells. It is postulated that, in phosphate-deficient growth medium, gluconeogenic metabolism regulates alkaline phosphatase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606538939,"Hydrogen exchange studies of rhodopsin in disc membranes demonstrated that photolysis induces changes in the protein itself. Two different altered forms were detected. A late photointermediate in the bleaching sequence, which can be identified with metarhodopsin II, displays accelerated exchange. Subsequently, at the stage of fully bleached opsin, exchange becomes even slower than in rhodopsin. These changes involve only a small fraction of the protein's internally hydrogen-bonded peptide groups. The unusually large fraction of exposed peptide hydrogens observed previously for rhodopsin is unaltered in the photolyzed forms."

https://openalex.org/W1520288587,"After T4 bacteriophage infects Escherichia coli, a peptide tau, produced under the control of a phage gene, binds to the host valyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9) and thereby changes several of its physicochemical properties. The interaction of tau with the host enzyme was investigated in vitro after extensively purifying the factor from T4-infected E. coli using a rapid purification procedure. The tau preparation migrated as a single, protein-staining band with a molecular weight of 11,000 during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purified peptide completely converted partially purified valyl-tRNA synthetase from uninfected E. coli into the form present in cell-free extracts prepared from virus-infected bacteria. The enzyme modified in vitro also exhibited the enhanced affinity for tRNA characteristic of the viral form of valyl-tRNA synthetase. The addition of bulk tRNA from E. coli B, tRNAVal, or tRNA1Val to enzyme modified in vitro increased its sedimentation rate to that of enzyme prepared from phage-infected cells. Amino acid analysis of the purified tau peptide revealed a relatively high concentration of the amino acids lysine and alanine, and a lack of detectable proline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine."
