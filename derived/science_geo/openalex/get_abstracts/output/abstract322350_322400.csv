https://openalex.org/W2004940580,"In 1984, four climatic sequences combined to produce what may be a major anoxic catastrophe in the northern Chesapeake Bay, sufficient to severely threaten the major benthic species. These sequences are (i) the highest late-winter streamflow on record from the Susquehanna River watershed; (ii) streamflows from the Susquehanna River for the consecutive months of June, July, and August that are higher by 2 standard deviations than the respective monthly mean values measured over the last 34 years; (iii) a stationary high in August off the Atlantic Coast; and (iv) an absence of strong storm events in summer. An empirical equation is proposed for the prediction of the monthly trend of dissolved oxygen decrease in terms of a temperature-dependent subpycnoclinal respiration and a modified estuarine Richardson number. As of 23 August 1984, the summer pycnocline of the northern bay had eroded upward from its historically recorded depth below 10 meters to an abnormally shallow 5 meters, with higher stratification than in earlier years. Dissolved oxygen concentrations directly below the pycnocline decreased to zero during June, 2 months earlier than for previous wet years. At present, oxygen-deficient waters containing significant concentrations of hydrogen sulfide have penetrated into Eastern Bay and the Choptank and Potomac rivers. Because most remaining shellfish-spawning and seed-bed areas in these tributaries are located at depths between 4 and 8 meters, the continued absence of major destratifying events will prolong the present anoxic trend and may result in high benthic mortalities."

In the study reported here observations of the effect were made by using electromagnetic signals instead of portable clocks to make clock comparisons. Global Positioning System satellites transmit signals that can be viewed simultaneously from remote stations on the earth; thus an around-the-world Sagnac experiment can be performed with electromagnetic signals. The effect is larger than that occurring when portable clocks are used. The average error over a 3-month experiment was only 5 nanoseconds."

https://openalex.org/W198875761,"Studies prompted by the accident at Three Mile Island which indicate that radiation released by a severe accident may be less than expected could have implications for nuclear regulation, emergency planning, and nuclear reactor design, but critics are not convinced. They contend that uncertainties in estimates of what would happen due to the diversity of plant designs are too great to provide a basis of altering regulations. The lack of radioactive iodine in the environment around Three Mile Island shows that the original predictions were faulty because they did not allow for iodine binding to cesium in the less volatile and less soluble form of cesium iodide. Three studies agree that increased estimates of containment strength, the possibility that some plant features will retain fission products, and the chemical form of several fission products that favor retention rather than release now lower estimates of radioactive releases. 1 figure."

https://openalex.org/W1997348531,"(1) Premature reversal of direction of heart-beat in Bombyx was induced in spinning larvae and those about to spin by blocking the 3 most posterior pairs of spiracles with Brunswick black, in accordance with the experiments of Yokoyama. (2) This method and the injection of lactic and other acids paralyze the muscles of the body wall and heart in that region, thus preventing forward and permitting backward beating. (3) Attempts to produce periodic reversal in the larva in the early days of the 5th stage by Yokoyama's methods failed. (4) The application of ether, alcohol, or xylol to the 3 posterior pairs of spiracles, or immersion of these segments in alcohol, was effective in inducing premature reversal at the close of the 5th stage, exclusively forward beating being resumed as soon as narcosis disappeared. (5) Amputation of the posterior end of the body of the larva, including the end of the dorsal vessel in abdominal segments 7 and 8, did not prevent forward peristalsis. (6) Amputation of head and thorax from the abdomen of a pupa did not interfere with normal periodic reversal in the abdomen. (7) Thus periodic reversal in the dorsal vessel takes place without the intervention of any terminal ganglia. (8) The suggestion of Yokoyama and earlier writers (Bataillon, Fischer) that general acidosis initiates normal backward beating is not corroborated. (9) The metabolic gradient of the larval dorsal vessel is never lost, but intermittently neutralized in the prepupa, pupa and adult by increased metabolic action at two other points: the central node (in the young pupa) and the aorta with its mesothoracic pulsating vesicle (in the adult). (10) These gradients are adaptations to the large influx of hemolymph into the dorsal vessel at three principal regions."

https://openalex.org/W1988742922,"For many years radiologists have debated the question whether equal doses of X rays of different wave-lengths produce the same or different quantitative biological effects, a problem of practical importance in therapy. The chief obstacles in deciding the matter were the lack of a standard unit of X-ray intensity, the lack of adequate measuring apparatus, and the highly variable character of the biological materials which were used in making the tests. The adoption of a standard unit, the Roentgen, now permits an accurate definition of dosage, where previously none was possible. The question now is this: When a definite number of r units, measured by an air ionisation chamber, is delivered to a suitable material, will the amount of effect which is produced vary with the wave-length of the beam, that is, with the voltage. An almost ideal biological material consists of the eggs of the wild fruit fly, Drosophila. These eggs when freshly laid are comparatively sensitive, and are remarkably uniform in response..."

https://openalex.org/W1993254802,"Introductory It is the purpose of this paper to point out some apparent discrepancies between the observations of geodesists on isostasy and the inferences which some radiologists have drawn as to the great age of certain specimens of minerals. It seems well to begin by reviewing the results of isostatic investigations, in order to estimate the degree of confidence to which they are entitled; and recent advances in radiology demand similar attention. Correlation of these widely distinct researches is possible because it happens that the emission of heat by a globe whose excess temperature is due solely to radioactivity obeys Fourier’s law exactly as does that emitted by a hot but radioinactive globe. It is thus easy to plot the distribution of temperature in a globe which at the consistentior status had a high temperature due in part to radioactivity and in part to compression, the diagram being strictly analogous . . ."
