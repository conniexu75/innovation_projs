These enzymes display a preference for Asp in the P1 position of substrates. To clarify differences in the biological roles of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) family proteases, we have examined in detail the specificities beyond the P1 position of caspase-1, −2, −3, −4, −6, and −7 toward minimal length peptide substrates in vitro We find differences and similarities between the enzymes that suggest a functional subgrouping of the family different from that based on overall sequence alignment. The primary specificities of ICE homologs explain many observed enzyme preferences for macromolecular substrates and can be used to support predictions of their natural function(s). The results also suggest the design of optimal peptidic substrates and inhibitors.

Each is an intracellular cysteine protease that shares with the serine protease granzyme B specificity for Asp in the P1 position of substrates. The specific biological roles and interrelationships of these enzymes are for the most part unknown and are areas of active investigation in many laboratories. interleukin-1β converting enzyme interleukin-1β high performance liquid chromatography p-nitroanilide aminomethylcoumarin acetyl amide aldehyde. A role for caspase-1 in inflammation is supported by several lines of evidence. Caspase-1-deficient mice, and cells derived from those animals, are deficient in IL-1β maturation and are resistant to endotoxic shock (20Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C.

Peptidic inhibitors of caspase-1 can be effective in blocking maturation and release of IL-1β by cultured cells (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P.

The selectivity of the inhibitors employed in these studies among the caspases has not been demonstrated, and so the precise role of each caspase in inflammation is uncertain. Nevertheless the results uphold the promise of caspase-1 and/or its homologs as targets for anti-inflammatory drug discovery. Caspases play important roles in apoptosis signaling and effector mechanisms. Sequence alignments reveal homology with Ced-3 (26Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R.

A bacterial invasin induces apoptosis by binding to and activating caspase-1 specifically (31Chen Y. Smith M.R. Thirumalai K. Zychlinsky A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3853-3860Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is necessary and sufficient for apoptosis in one acellular model (6Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M.

Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Google Scholar). A hallmark of apoptosis is the proteolytic inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar), and several caspases can catalyze that cleavage (7Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beider D.R. Poirier G.G.

Fas-induced apoptosis is characterized by an early, transient “caspase-1-like” protease activity followed by a “caspase-3-like” activity (42Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Google Scholar), suggesting an ordered activation cascade. Reconstitution experiments suggest that both caspase-3 and −7 are activated by caspase-6 (43Orth K. O'Rourke K.

Caspase-1 contains a site that is rapidly autodegraded in vitro, and cleavage at this site may represent a physiological mechanism of down-regulation (44Talanian R.V. Dang L.C. Ferenz C.R. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Welch J.P. Wong W.W. Brady K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21853-21858Google Scholar). To facilitate studies of the roles of caspase family proteases in inflammation and apoptosis, and to help elucidate protease-mediated mechanisms of signal transduction and regulation, we have characterized in detail the substrate preferences of caspase-1 and five of its homologs. We present here our findings of the specificities of each enzyme, which suggest the design of novel specific peptidic substrates and inhibitors, and help to predict the biological roles of these enzymes. Underivatized peptides (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA) were prepared by standard solid-phase methods, purified to ≥95% by HPLC, and confirmed by low resolution mass spectrometry. Concentrations of stock solutions in Me2SO were determined in duplicate as described (45Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Google Scholar). Chromogenic and fluorogenic peptides were from California Peptide Research (Napa, CA). Concentrations of chromogenic peptide stock solutions were determined in duplicate as described (46Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Google Scholar). Concentrations of fluorogenic peptide stocks were determined in duplicate by UV absorbance using ϵ325 = 15,990 in aqueous buffer at pH 7.5. Caspase-1, −2, −3, and −4, containing N-terminal His tags to facilitate purification, were prepared as described (9Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Allen H. Banach D. Bump N. Hackett M.

Mankovich J.A. Brady K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14910-14916Google Scholar). Caspase-1 contained the stability-enhancing point mutation D381E (47Dang L.C. Talanian R.V. Banach D. Hackett M.H. Gilmore J.L. Hays S.J. Mankovich J.A. Brady K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14910-14916Google Scholar). Caspase-6 (Mch2α) (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742Google Scholar) beginning at Ala-2, or caspase-7 beginning at Ala-23, with amino-terminal polyhistidine tags (MGHHHHHHGSG), were subcloned into a pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) derivative under control of the Lambda PL promoter. Amino-terminal coding sequences were modified to reflect Escherichia coli codon preferences. To increase soluble expression the proteases were coexpressed with the bacterial chaperones groES and groEL (48Amrein K.E. Takas B. Stieger M. Molnos J. Flint N.A. Burn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1048-1052Google Scholar). The groESL operon, under control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-inducible Ptac promoter, was cloned into a pACYC177 (49Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Google Scholar) derivative encoding LacI and the temperature-sensitive repressor cI857 inserted into the β-lactamase gene. Both plasmids were stably maintained in the same bacterial cell. Simultaneous expression of the chaperones and proteases were induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to 2 mM and temperature shift from 30°C to 40°C at A600 = 0.6. The bacteria were harvested at t = 5 h, and the proteases were purified as described (47Dang L.C. Talanian R.V. Banach D. Hackett M.H. Gilmore J.L. Hays S.J. Mankovich J.A. Brady K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14910-14916Google Scholar). Peptide cleavage assays were modeled on those of Howard et al. (50Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Thornberry N. Ding G.J. Limjuco G. Weidner J. Salley J.P. Hogquist K.A. Chaplin D.D. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2964-2969Google Scholar). Substrate concentration depletion during the reaction is described by Equation 1.d[S]dt=Vmax[S][S]+Km(Eq. 1) which solves to the general case.[S]t[S]0e(S)−[S]0/Km=e−Vmant/Km(Eq. 2) Assuming [S] ≪ Km, Equation 2 reduces to the following equation.[S]t[S]0=e−kt(Eq. 3) where k is the apparent first order substrate cleavage rate constant equal to Vmax/Km. Assays contained in 810 μl: 100 mM sodium acetate at pH 6.2 (for caspase-2) or 100 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 (all others), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.3-10 μg of purified enzymes. After a 30-min preincubation at 30°C, substrates were added to 10 μM (except as noted). At 10-min intervals for 60 min, 110-μl aliquots were stopped with 11 μl of 3 M HCl. Samples were analyzed by HPLC using a 250 × 4.6 mm C18 reverse phase column (Vydak, Hesperia, CA) and a linear gradient of MeCN/H2O with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, monitoring at 214 nm. The identical elution times of one of the two product peaks for each peptide in a series confirmed cleavage at the same site despite amino acid variations. The area under the substrate peaks (arbitrary units) was plotted versus time and fitted to Equation 3. Relative Vmax/Km values (unitless) were obtained by normalizing apparent Vmax/Km values to 1.00 for a chosen peptide. Km values were determined for selected substrates and enzymes by fitting initial rates of peptide cleavage at various substrate concentrations from 10 to 250 μM to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Assays of chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate cleavage contained in 100 μl: 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 (fluorogenic substrates) or 3.0-200 (chromogenic substrates) ng of purified enzymes. After a 30-min preincubation at 30°C, substrates in Me2SO were added to various concentrations. For chromogenic substrates, enzyme-catalyzed release of p-nitroanilide was monitored at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). For fluorogenic substrates, Amc release was monitored at 460 nm using 385 nm excitation in a Labsystems (Needham Heights, MA) Fluoroskan Ascent fluorescence plate reader. Km and kcat values were determined from plots of activity versus substrate concentration. Absolute kcat values for chromogenic substrates were calculated using a standard curve determined with p-nitroanilide and are uncorrected for enzyme purity and percent activity. Assays of inhibitor potency were performed with fluorogenic substrates using nominal enzyme concentrations of 0.1 nM or less. Apparent Ki values were calculated by dividing IC50 values by (1 + [S]/Km). Building on previous work (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K.

Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar), toward a series of defined peptide sequence variants. We chose this rather than a combinatorial approach to obtain quantitative data on both optimal and suboptimal substrate sequences. Peptides were generally of minimal length, contained C-terminal Trp residues to facilitate detection and concentration determination, and were acetylated and amidated to avoid introduction of nonnatural charges. Sequence variants were selected to test hypotheses of substrate recognition and to explore the structural range of natural amino acids. Application of Equation 3 requires that [S]0≪ Km. Km values of each enzyme toward preferred peptide substrates were determined from the initial rates of peptide hydrolysis as a function of peptide concentration (Table I). All observed values were at least 10-fold greater than the peptide concentration utilized in the specificity studies (10 μM), confirming that the use of Equation 3 is appropriate. Caspase-1 and −4 specificities were tested using variants of Ac-YVADGW-Am, a preferred peptide substrate (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K.

In P4, caspase-1 and −4 prefer hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1), with the former preferring aromatics (consistent with IL-1β cleavage), and the latter, aliphatics. In P3, both enzymes prefer Glu. The crystal structure of caspase-3 in complex with Ac-DEVD-CHO (55Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P.

Ligands containing P3 Glu probably make analogous favorable contacts with caspase-1 and −4. In P2, a broad range of amino acids are tolerated by both enzymes, consistent with the observation from the caspase-1 and −3 crystal structures that side chains of amino acids in this position are solvent-exposed. As expected (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F.

In addition, we find that all of the aromatic and the thiol- and hydroxyl-containing amino acids were also efficiently cleaved. As predicted from the peptide cleavage results, the chromogenic tetrapeptide p-nitroanilides Ac-YEVD-pNA and Ac-LEVD-pNA were preferentially cleaved by caspase-1 and −4, respectively, with kcat/Km values considerably higher than related peptides, including in the former case the widely used substrate Ac-YVAD-pNA (Table II). In a survey of peptide substrates spanning known or suspected cleavage sites within caspases and their substrates, we found that only peptides containing VDQQD (caspase-2 residues 312-316) and LDVVD (caspase-6 residues 175-179) were cleaved by caspase-2, but peptides Ac-DQQDGW-Am and Ac-DVVDGW-Am were not. We examined the length dependence of peptide cleavage by caspase-2 (Table III) and found that, in contrast to caspase-1 (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar), caspase-2 requires a P5 residue in peptide substrates for efficient cleavage. Like caspase-1 (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar), efficient cleavage of peptides by caspase-2 did not require prime-side substrate residues (Table III). We therefore examined the substrate specificity of caspase-2 using sequence variants of Ac-VDQQDGW-Am (Fig. 2). Hydrophobic residues were preferred in the P5 position. Like caspase-3 and −7 (see below), caspase-2 displayed a strong preference for Asp in P4. In P3 and P2, Val and Ala, respectively, were preferred over Gln, but like caspase-1 and −4, Glu was a favored P3 substrate residue and in P2 a structurally wide range of amino acids were tolerated. The results suggested that optimal caspase-2 peptidic substrates and inhibitors would contain the sequence VDVAD, and consistent with that, Ac-VDVADGW-Am was cleaved at a correspondingly greater efficiency than either of the singly substituted peptides (not shown). We tested Ac-VDVAD-pNA as a caspase-2 substrate and found it was preferred by caspase-2, cleaved with a kcat/Km value similar to those of other enzymes and their preferred substrates (Table II). Ac-DEVD-pNA, widely used as a caspase-3 substrate, was poorly cleaved by caspase-2. Using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-VDVAD-Amc (Km = 80 μM), the pentapeptide aldehyde Ac-VDVAD-CHO inhibited caspase-2 with a Ki value of 3.5 nM. In contrast, the Ki of Ac-DEVD-CHO was 1.75 μM, again supporting the observed in vitro requirement of caspase-2 for a P5 peptide residue. Caspase-3 and −7 were probed in P4-P2 using the peptide variants designed for caspase-2. Length dependence experiments showed that for these enzymes a P5 residue was unnecessary for efficient cleavage, and the presence of the P5 Val residue in particular did not significantly affect cleavage rates. 2R. V. Talanian and C. Quinlan, unpublished results. The two enzymes displayed many similarities in their primary specificities. The P4 Asp preference of caspase-3 was almost absolute (Fig. 2), with peptides containing charge-conserving (Glu) or isosteric (Asn) substitutions cleaved poorly. Caspase-7 also displayed a strong preference for Asp in P4. Like the other caspases, both enzymes tolerated a broad range of amino acids in P3 but preferred Glu, again consistent with the structure of caspase-3 bound to Ac-DEVD-CHO (55Rotonda J.

https://openalex.org/W2066160116,"We have identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene necessary for the step in sphingolipid synthesis in which inositol phosphate is added to ceramide to form inositol-P-ceramide, a reaction catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol:ceramide phosphoinositol transferase (IPC synthase). This step should be an effective target for antifungal drugs. A key element in our experiments was the development of a procedure for isolating mutants defective in steps in sphingolipid synthesis downstream from the first step including a mutant defective in IPC synthase. An IPC synthase defect is supported by data showing a failure of the mutant strain to incorporate radioactive inositol or N-acetylsphinganine into sphingolipids and, by using an improved assay, a demonstration that the mutant strain lacks enzyme activity. Furthermore, the mutant accumulates ceramide when fed exogenous phytosphingosine as expected for a strain lacking IPC synthase activity. Ceramide accumulation is accompanied by cell death, suggesting the presence of a ceramide-activated death response in yeast. A gene, AUR1 (YKL004w), that complements the IPC synthase defect and restores enzyme activity and sphingolipid synthesis was isolated. Mutations in AUR1 had been shown previously to give resistance to the antifungal drug aureobasidin A, leading us to predict that the drug should inhibit IPC synthase activity. Our data show that the drug is a potent inhibitor of IPC synthase with an IC50 of about 0.2 nM. Fungal pathogens are an increasing threat to human health.

Now that IPC synthase has been shown to be the target for aureobasidin A, it should be possible to develop high throughput screens to identify new inhibitors of IPC synthase to combat fungal diseases. Fungal pathogens present an increasing threat to human health, particularly for immunocompromised individuals. Current drugs are not efficacious, cause serious side effects, and are becoming less useful because of increased resistance to them. Our research has focused on enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of phosphoinositol-containing sphingolipids that are present in fungi but absent in humans and, therefore, likely to offer unique targets for antifungal drugs. One enzyme meeting this criterion is inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (phosphatidylinositol:ceramide phosphoinositol transferase, IPC synthase) 1The abbreviations used are: IPCinositol phosphorylceramideAbAaureobasidin AAUR1a gene that can mutate to give resistance to AbAAur1pthe protein encoded by AUR1IPC-3IPC whose ceramide is N-hydroxyfattyacylphytosphingosineLcblong chain baseLcb1the Lcb1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferaseLCB1a gene encoding Lcb1Lcb2the Lcb2 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferaseLCB2a gene encoding Lcb2MIPCmannose inositol-P-ceramideM(IP)2Cmannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramidePHSphytosphingosinePIphosphatidylinositolSLCsphingolipid compensatoryCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidPYEDcomplex medium. which catalyzes the transfer of phosphoinositol from phosphatidylinositol to ceramide to give IPC (1Lester R.L.

Since sphingolipid synthesis is vital for growth and viability of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae it is likely that blockage of synthesis by a drug would efficiently inhibit growth and induce cell death. Besides S. cerevisiae, other fungi including the human pathogens Histoplasma capsulatum (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar) and Candida albicans (2Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain IPC. Other pathogenic fungi are likely to contain it as well since it has been found in all fungi studied to date (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). The sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway of S. cerevisiae is diagrammed in Fig. 1. Work presented in this paper focuses on the modification of the 1-hydroxyl of phytoceramide by the addition of myo-inositol phosphate to form IPC which is then mannosylated to yield mannose inositol-P-ceramide (MIPC). The final step in S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis is the addition of inositol-P to MIPC to yield the major sphingolipid mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide (M(IP)2C (3Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Steiner S. Smith S. Waechter C.J. Lester R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The later steps in sphingolipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1) are tentative because none of the enzymes have been purified, the reaction requirements are poorly defined, and the stoichiometry has not been determined (reviewed in Ref. 1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). We previously searched for mutants defective in sphingolipid synthesis by screening for cells requiring exogenous sphingoid long chain base for growth (Lcb− phenotype). Approximately 50 Lcb− mutants fell into only two complementation groups, designated LCB1 and LCB2 (6Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are necessary for serine palmitoyltransferase activity and are thought to encode subunits of the enzyme (8Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). No mutants were found for the next step, 3-ketosphinganine reductase, possibly because of accumulation of lethal concentrations of 3-ketosphinganine. Mutants defective in the later steps in sphingolipid synthesis, ceramide synthesis, and beyond, would not have been recovered because neither exogenous ceramide nor sphingolipids containing phosphoinositol were able to support growth of Lcb− mutants (7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, accumulation of ceramide should have inhibited growth since exogenous N-acetylceramide does inhibit growth of S. cerevisiae cells (9Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the experimental approach described here for isolating strains defective in the later steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis, the potential problems of growth inhibition and killing by the build up of a sphingolipid intermediate were circumvented by using a sphingolipid compensatory (SLC) strain. Unlike normal yeast strains that require sphingolipids for growth and viability, SLC strains can grow without making sphingolipids (11Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SLC strain 7R6 carries two mutations, a deletion of the lcb1 gene and a point mutation that creates the suppressor gene SLC1-1 (12Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suppressor gene enables cells, in the absence of exogenous long chain base, to make novel glycerophospholipids that are thought to compensate for one or more functions of sphingolipids essential for vegetative growth (13Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lcb1 mutation blocks the first committed step in sphingolipid synthesis, so no toxic sphingolipid intermediate should accumulate when cells are grown on medium lacking a long chain base. Thus if a gene encoding an enzyme later in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway is mutated, the strain should still be able to grow without making sphingolipids because of the SLC1-1 suppressor gene, and should not accumulate a toxic intermediate because of the lcb1 mutation. As we show here, our mutant isolation procedure worked as expected and allowed the isolation of a mutant S. cerevisiae strain defective in IPC synthase activity. In addition, a diploid version of the mutant strain made it possible to isolate a gene, AUR1, which complemented the IPC synthase defect and restored IPC synthase activity. Recent studies of drug resistance in S. cerevisiae had shown that mutations in AUR1 (14Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2765-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Hashida-Okado T. Ogawa A. Endo M. Yasumoto R. Takesako K. Kato I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar) confer resistance to the antifungal drug aureobasidin A (AbA), a cyclic depsipeptide produced by Aureobasidium pullulans R106. Because the function of the Aur1 protein was not known it was not clear why AbA was fungicidal. We show here that AbA is a potent inhibitor of IPC synthase and offer an explanation for its fungicidal activity. S. cerevisiae strains are: 7R6 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 lcb1::URA3 SLC1-1 ade1, Ref. 12Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

A diploid version of strain AG27-61 (termed AGD27-61) was made by transforming haploid cells with a plasmid (pHO-12, Ref. 17Russell D.W. Jensen R. Zoller M.J. Burke J. Errede B. Smith M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4281-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) carrying the HO endonuclease gene, responsible for switching of the mating type (18Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Leu+ transformants were streaked onto PYED plates and colonies containing MATa/MATα diploid cells were identified by their large, ellipsoidal morphology. Diploids were screened on defined medium lacking leucine for Leu− cells, indicating loss of the plasmid carrying the HO gene, and tested for transformation efficiency using pRS315 (LEU2 CEN4, Ref. 16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of pLCB1-5 began by inserting the S. cerevisiae ADE2 gene as a PstI-SpeI DNA fragment into pRS315 cut with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting plasmid was cut with NaeI and SacI and ligated to the LCB1 gene obtained from pTZ18-LCB1 (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as an NruI-SacI DNA fragment. pIPC1 was isolated from the recombinant DNA library described below in which the 4307-base pair insert corresponds to S. cerevisiae Chromosome XI between coordinates 432,813 and 437,119 as described in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base at Stanford University (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/).

DNA fragments of 5-10 kilobases were isolated from an agarose gel and ligated with 1 μg of BamHI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pRS315. Ligated DNA was purified using GeneClean (Bio-101, La Jolla, CA), electroporated into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and plasmid DNA was prepared from ampicillin-resistant colonies selected on Petri plates. Yeast were grown on modified PYED (buffered to pH 5.0, PYED-5.0) which contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-Peptone (Difco), 2 or 4% glucose, 50 mM sodium succinate (pH 5.0), inositol (50 mg/liter), and potassium phosphate monobasic (0.5 g/liter) (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), or on defined medium supplemented as described (19Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and containing, when necessary, 25 μM phytosphingosine (PHS). PYED buffered to pH 4.1 (PYED-4.1) was made by mixing 290 ml of autoclaved agar (2% for plates only), 300 ml of autoclaved yeast extract (1%) plus peptone (2%), 100 ml of filter sterilized glycylglycine (0.5 M, pH 3.1), 200 ml of glucose (20%), 10 ml of inositol (0.5%), and 100 ml of potassium phosphate monobasic (0.5%). In a previous publication (20Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) we erroneously referred to this medium as having a pH of 3, but the actual pH is 4.1. For some experiments indicated under “Results,” the agar in Petri plates was replaced with agarose (Fisher, BP160-500). Strain 7R6 was grown overnight in PYED plus 25 μM PHS (referred to here as the medium) and then mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate to give 20% killing (7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenized cells were diluted to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.4 with medium, incubated with shaking at 30°C for 7 h, during which time the A600 increased to 2.5, centrifuged, resuspended in 2 ml of medium, and sonicated using a microtip (Heat Systems-Ultrasonic) for 2 min to disrupt clumped cells. One ml of cells was layered on 4 ml of 30% sodium diatriazoate (7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 10°C in a Sorvall RT6000B centrifuge for 4 min at 2000 rpm. Most cells were at the interface but a faint pellet of dense cells was present at the bottom of the tube. The liquid was aspirated and the cell pellet was carefully resuspended in 0.5 ml of medium to avoid mixing with cells stuck to the side of the tube. Resuspended pellets from two tubes were mixed and re-centrifuged on 30% sodium diatriazoate. The cell pellet was resuspended in medium and about 500 cells were spread on PYED plates containing 25 μM PHS. Two days later only about 15 colonies per plate were visible, suggesting only 3% of the dense cells were viable. Sphingolipid synthesis was measured by growing cells to saturation at 30°C in PYED, diluting to an A600 of 0.1 with fresh PYED medium containing 10 μg/ml inositol and 10 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and grown overnight to saturation at 30°C. Cells were washed with 25 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) by centrifugation and resuspended in the same buffer at 50 A600 units/ml. A reaction containing 0.4 ml of 0.5% Tergitol, 0.4 ml of 0.5 M sodium succinate (pH 5.5), 0.1 ml of 40% glucose, and 10 μl of 2.5 mM PHS in 95% ethanol was initiated by addition of 0.2 ml of the radiolabeled cells. At time 0, a 0.2-ml sample and at 1.5 h a 0.5-ml sample of radiolabeled cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5% for 20 min at 0°C. Cells were centrifuged, washed 3 times with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and finally with water. Cell pellets were extracted with 1 ml of 95% ethanol:water:diethyl ether:pyridine:concentrated NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018, v/v) for 60 min at 60°C (21Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifuging while warm, a 0.5-ml sample of the supernatant fluid was evaporated under a stream of N2, dissolved in 1 ml of monomethylamine reagent, and heated for 30 min at 52°C to deacylate the acylester phospholipids (22Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochemical J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The sample was dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (16:16:5). Qualitative analysis of 25-μl samples was carried out by silica gel thin layer chromatography on 20-cm Whatman LK5 plates developed with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 N NH4OH (9:7:2). Radioactivity was measured by using a BioScan apparatus. Cellular conversion of [3H]N-acetylsphinganine to IPC was measured as follows. PYED medium was added to tubes containing solid [3H]N-acetylsphinganine (860 cpm/pmol) and the mixture was dissolved by treatment for 5 min in an ultrasonic water bath. Log phase cells, grown in PYED medium, were centrifuged, suspended in fresh medium and added to the radiolabeled medium to give a final cell density of 1.5 A600 units/ml. The final concentration of N-acetylsphinganine was 5.0 μM. At the indicated times, 1-ml samples were removed, quenched with trichloroacetic acid, and processed as in the inositol-labeling procedure. Qualitative analysis of 25-μl samples was carried out on 20-cm Whatman HP-K plates developed with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 N NH4OH (9:7:2). Each lane contained 2 nmol of IPC-3 (IPC with phytosphingosine and a monohydroxylated fatty acid, Ref. 1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar) internal standard. Radioactivity was measured by using a BioScan apparatus and the plates were sprayed with a 10% solution of CuSO4·5H20 in 8% H3PO4 and charred at 160°C to locate the IPC-3 standard. Quantification of radioactive products was achieved by ascending chromatography of 5-μl samples on Whatman SG-81 paper washed with EDTA (23Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and developed with chloroform, methanol, 4.2 N NH4OH (9:7:2). The lanes were cut into 1-cm zones and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The deacylated lipid extract from the 5-h incubation of [3H]N-acetylsphinganine with strain 7R6 was dried, sonicated with 50 μl of buffer, and treated with 1 μl of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Bacillus thuringiensis, 390 units/ml in 50% glycerol) for 19 h precisely as described previously (13Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (5 μl) of each reaction mixture were chromatographed on 20-cm Whatman HP-K plates (200 μ) and radioactivity was located by using a BioScan apparatus. We elected to develop a less time consuming assay for measuring IPC synthase activity than the published assay which uses chromatography to separate radiolabeled substrate from product, IPC (5Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 474-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ko J. Cheah S. Fischl A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5181-5183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The improved procedure separates the substrate and product by differential solvent extraction. A substrate mixture containing 50,000 cpm of [3H]N-acetylsphinganine and 20 nmol of N-acetylsphinganine, was added to a plastic tube, and dried using a stream of N2. The dry mixture was suspended in 50 μl of 0.2 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 20 μl of 20 mM CHAPS (Sigma), 40 μl of 5 mM aqueous phosphatidylinositol, membranes, and water to 200 μl of total volume. Typically 75-300 μg of membrane protein (25Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were added per reaction as the reaction was linear within this range. The reaction mixture was sonicated for 1 min in an ultrasonic water bath before addition of membranes and then incubated for 15 or 30 min at 30°C with gentle shaking. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2.8 ml of 96.43% methanol (final methanol concentration of 90%). After standing for 10 min the mixture was centrifuged at room temperature. Two ml of the supernatant fluid were mixed with 4 ml of tert-butyl methyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich, high performance liquid chromatography grade), then with 2 ml of water, followed by vortexing, and centrifugation. The lower phase containing the product of the reaction was extracted twice more with 4-ml portions of mock upper phase, prepared by mixing 2 parts of reaction mixture (lacking N-acetylsphinganine, phosphatidylinositol, and membranes) with 4 parts of tert-butyl methyl ether plus 2 parts of water. The volume of the lower phase was measured, and 1 ml was added to 4 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The mixture contained 4 g/liter of 2-(4′-t-butylphenyl)-5-(4′-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 3 g/liter of 2-(4′-biphenylyl)-6-phenylbenzoxazole, 33.3% Triton X-100, and 66.7% toluene. IPC synthase activity was expressed as picomoles of IPC made per min/mg of protein. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in PYED without long chain base, centrifuged, and suspended at an A600 of 0.2 in fresh medium containing 25 μM PHS. Cells were incubated at 30°C with shaking. At 0, 2, and 4 h 100 A600 units were treated with a final concentration of 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed several times by centrifugation with water, and the pellet was extracted with 5 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1) for 30 min at 50°C. The extract was dried and resuspended in 0.5 ml of chloroform and applied to a 1-ml column of Adsorbosil 100-200 mesh (Applied Sciences Inc.) in a Pasteur pipette packed in methanol and equilibrated with chloroform. After washing with 3 ml of chloroform, ceramides were eluted with 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (9:1) and the eluates dried. Samples as well as 5-20 nmol of ceramide 3 standard were dissolved in absolute ethanol and dried to remove traces of water. Perbenzoylation was achieved by treating each sample with 0.5 ml of benzoyl chloride:pyridine (1:9, v/v) (anhydrous, Aldrich) for 2 h at 70°C followed by addition of 1 ml of methanol and heating for 30 min at 70°C. After solvent removal, 1 ml of saturated sodium carbonate in methanol plus about 50 mg of solid sodium carbonate were added followed by extraction three times with 1 ml of hexane. The combined hexane extracts were evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 1.0 ml of hexane which was applied to a 1.0-ml column (in Pasteur pipette) of AG4-X4: acetate form, packed in water, equilibrated with absolute ethanol, then hexane. After elution with 3 ml of hexane, the eluates were dried and dissolved in 200 μl of hexane. The benzoylated ceramide (25 μl) was separated and quantified by chromatography on a 0.45 × 30-cm, 5-μm Lichrosorb Si 60 column, eluted with hexane:dioxane (93:7) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored at 228 nm. Data were integrated by using Millennium software (Waters and Co.). N-Acetylsphingosine (Matreya, Inc.) was reduced in ethanol with tritium gas (American Radiochemicals, Inc.) in the presence of Adams catalyst. The sample was dried, dissolved in 0.2 ml of chloroform, and applied to a 0.5 × 50-cm column of Adsorbosil (100/200 mesh) prewashed with chloroform:methanol (1:1) and equilibrated with chloroform. The elution schedule was: 14 ml of chloroform followed by chloroform:methanol (97:3), collecting 7-ml fractions. Fractions 11-16 were pooled, dried, dissolved in methanol, applied to silica gel thin layer plates (Whatman LK5), and developed with chloroform:methanol (95:5). The appropriate zone, located by autoradiography, was scraped and transferred to a syringe fitted with a Teflon filter (Acro LC3S, 0.45 μm, Gelman Sciences, Inc.). The [3H]N-acetylsphinganine was eluted with 8 ml of methanol. The thin layer chromatography step was repeated. The final product, with the same mobility as authentic N-acetylsphinganine prepared according to a published procedure (26Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3643-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), had a specific activity of 1.5 × 107 dpm/nmol. Yeast were transformed using LiOAc-treated cells (27Gietz R.D. Jean A.st. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 8: 1425Crossref Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad). To enrich for strains defective in sphingolipid synthesis we relied on the observation that a cell's density increases when sphingolipid synthesis is blocked, presumably because the ratio of proteins to lipids increases (7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When SLC strains are fed PHS they make sphingolipids and have a normal density. If, however, a mutation has blocked sphingolipid synthesis the cell's density should increase because sphingolipids will not be made in the presence of PHS. This strategy allowed enrichment for SLC cells having a higher density following growth in the presence of PHS. Putative mutants were screened to differentiate those specifically defective in sphingolipid synthesis from those defective in other lipid biosynthetic pathways which might also affect cell density. The screen was based upon the observation that strain 7R6 cannot grow at low pH when it lacks sphingolipids (no PHS present in the medium) but can grow when allowed to make sphingolipids (PHS present in the medium, Ref. 20Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, about 100 mutants unable to grow on PYED plates at pH 4.1 either in the presence or absence of 25 μM PHS were identified. Mutant strains were examined further for a defect specific to sphingolipid synthesis relative to glycerophospholipid synthesis by looking for decreased incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol-containing sphingolipids relative to phosphatidylinositol (28Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By this assay, two strains, AG27 and AG84, appeared to be specifically defective in sphingolipid synthesis. Both mutants tended to die rapidly even when stored in 15% glycerol at −70°C. To preserve the mutants, each was crossed to strain YPH2 and the resulting diploids were stored frozen. Eventually the original haploid AG27 strain could not be revived from a frozen stock, so haploid offspring having the same phenotypes as AG27 were obtained by sporulating the diploid and analyzing random spores. The phenotypes of AG27 are: Ura+, indicating the presence of the lcb1-Δ::URA3 allele; Lcb+, indicating the presence of the SLC1-1 suppressor gene; growth inhibition at 37°C on PYED plates containing 25 μM PHS, indicating a block in sphingolipid synthesis (20Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One such offspring, AG27-61, was used for the remainder of this research except for the data shown in Fig. 2, which were obtained using the original AG27 strain. Identical data to that shown in Fig. 2 were obtained using strain AG27-61 (data not shown). The specific defect in sphingolipid synthesis in strain AG27 was determined in three steps. First, an in vivo radi"
https://openalex.org/W2047664746,"Molluscum contagiosum virus proteins MC159 and MC160 and the equine herpesvirus 2 protein E8 share substantial homology to the death effector domain present in the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and the initiating death protease FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE) (caspase-8). FADD and FLICE participate in generating the death signal from both tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) and the CD-95 receptor. The flow of death signals from TNFR-1 occurs through the adaptor molecule tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to FADD to FLICE, whereas for CD-95 the receptor directly communicates with FADD and then FLICE. MC159 and E8 inhibited both TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced apoptosis as well as killing mediated by overexpression of the downstream adaptors TRADD and FADD. Neither viral molecule, however, inhibited FLICE-induced killing, consistent with an inhibitory action upstream of the active death protease. These data suggest the existence of a novel strategy employed by viruses to attenuate host immune killing mechanisms. Given that bovine herpesvirus 4 protein E1.1 and Kaposi's sarcoma associated-herpesvirus protein K13 also possess significant homology to the viral inhibitory molecules MC159, MC160, and E8, it may be that this class of proteins is used ubiquitously by viruses to evade host defense. Molluscum contagiosum virus proteins MC159 and MC160 and the equine herpesvirus 2 protein E8 share substantial homology to the death effector domain present in the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and the initiating death protease FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE) (caspase-8).

Cell suicide is a defense mechanism employed by host cells to inhibit viral replication and persistence. As a consequence, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to attenuate apoptosis (1Shen Y. Shenk T.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 105-111Google Scholar). For example, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes BHRF1, a homolog of the mammalian anti-apoptosis molecule bcl-2, and the cowpox virus encodes a serpin-like protein, CrmA, that blocks apoptosis by inhibiting proteases belonging to the caspase family. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is the only poxvirus family member still associated with human disease (2Baxby D. Epidemiol. Infect. 1988; 100: 321-334Google Scholar). It usually causes asymptomatic cutaneous neoplasms that can spontaneously regress. However, with the advent of immunocompromised populations, particularly those afflicted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, MCV infection has become a clinical challenge (3Gottlieb S.L. Myskowski P.L. Int. J. Dermatol. 1994; 33: 453-461Google Scholar). Unfortunately, due to the inability to grow the virus in tissue culture cells and the lack of a suitable animal model, little is known about host-virus relationships (4Buller R.M. Burnett J. Chen W. Kreider J. Virology. 1995; 213: 655-659Google Scholar). Equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV2) is a member of the γ-herpesvirus subfamily that also includes herpesvirus saimiri, EBV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and bovine herpesvirus 4 (5McGeoch D.J. Cook S. Dolan A. Jamieson P.E. Telford E.A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 443-458Google Scholar, 6Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Google Scholar). Although EHV2 is ubiquitously distributed and has been implicated as a pathogen in immunosuppressed states, its mode of evading the host immune response is uncertain. However, the recent availability of the MCV and EHV2 genome sequences has begun to identify genes that suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms (7Senkevich T.G. Bugert J.J. Sisler J.R. Koonin E.V. Darai G. Moss B. Science. 1996; 273: 813-816Google Scholar, 8Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-529Google Scholar). MCV, surprisingly, does not encode many of the immunoregulatory molecules present in other poxviruses, especially those that antagonize the host cytokine-mediated inflammatory response. These include CrmA and a soluble TNFR-like 1The abbreviations used are: TNFR-1tumor necrosis factor receptor 1FADDFas-associated death domain proteinFLICEFADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzymeTRADDtumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain proteinMCVmolluscum contagiosum virusEHV2equine herpesvirus 2KSHVKaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirusDEDdeath effector domain. molecule (7Senkevich T.G. Bugert J.J. Sisler J.R. Koonin E.V. Darai G. Moss B. Science. 1996; 273: 813-816Google Scholar). In contrast, EHV2 encodes an interleukin-10-like factor that may attenuate the host immune response (8Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 520-529Google Scholar). Regardless, MCV and EHV2 do not encode previously identified inhibitors of apoptosis (1Shen Y. Shenk T.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 105-111Google Scholar). Instead, MCV and EHV2 encode novel members of an emerging family of molecules characterized by the presence of a death effector domain (DED) originally identified in signaling molecules engaged by the death receptors TNFR-1 and CD-95 (7Senkevich T.G. Bugert J.J. Sisler J.R. Koonin E.V. Darai G. Moss B. Science. 1996; 273: 813-816Google Scholar, 8Telford E.A.R. Watson M.S. Aird H.C. Perry J. Davison A.J. J. Mol.

Both TNFR-1 and CD-95 contain a stretch of approximately 60-80 amino acids within their cytoplasmic domains termed the death domain. Upon activation the receptor death domains bind to corresponding death domains within the adaptor molecules TRADD (for TNFR-1) and FADD (for CD-95) (9Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Google Scholar, 10Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar, 11Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7795-7798Google Scholar, 12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar). Utilizing the same mechanism, TRADD is able in turn to recruit FADD to the TNFR-1 signaling complex (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar). FADD appears to play a central role as a conduit for death signals from both receptors as dominant negative versions that retain the death domain but lack the amino-terminal segment effectively attenuate both TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced killing (14Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Google Scholar). Since it is likely that the amino-terminal domain of FADD functions to engage downstream components of the death pathway, it has been termed the DED (14Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Google Scholar). The importance of this domain was dramatically underscored by the discovery of its presence within the prodomain of the death protease FLICE (15Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Google Scholar, 16Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 17Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar). It appears that the DED of FADD binds to the corresponding DED motif within the FLICE prodomain and thereby recruits this death protease to the receptor signaling complex. Therefore, a homophilic binding mechanism involving DEDs is responsible for assembly of the receptor death signaling complex. Disruption of such a complex by DED-containing viral gene products could potentially abrogate propagation of the death signal. Human embryonic kidney 293, 293T, and 293-EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Mammalian expression vectors encoding TNFR-1, CD-95, FADD, FLICE, MC159, MC160, E8, and CrmA were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The expression vector for TRADD was kindly provided by Dr. David Goeddel (Tularik, Inc.). Full-length FADD and truncated N-FADD were expressed as GST-fusion proteins as described previously (18Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled MC159 was obtained by in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Binding reactions were performed as described previously (18Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Google Scholar). Transient transfections of 293T cells were performed as described previously (19O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24921-24924Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 40 h following transfection, immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, and analyzed by immunoblotting. For CD-95, TRADD, and FLICE killing, experiments were performed in 293-EBNA cells and in 293 cells for TNFR-1 and FADD killing. cDNAs encoding putative apoptosis inducers (0.5-0.8 μg) and potential inhibitors (2.5 μg) were cotransfected in each experiment together with the reporter plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase. Cells were fixed and stained 24-30 h following transfection. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by calculating the fraction of round membrane-blebbed blue cells as a function of total blue cells. All assays were evaluated in duplicate and the mean and standard deviation calculated. MCV encodes two closely related proteins: MC159 and MC160 (6Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Google Scholar). The NH2 termini of the 241-amino acid protein MC159 and the 371-amino acid protein MC160 contain two motifs homologous to DEDs present at the NH2 terminus of FADD and repeated in tandem within the prodomain of FLICE (7Senkevich T.G. Bugert J.J. Sisler J.R. Koonin E.V. Darai G. Moss B. Science. 1996; 273: 813-816Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DED motif is also present within EHV2-encoded protein E8 (171 amino acids), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded protein K13 (139 amino acids), and bovine herpesvirus 4-encoded protein E1.1 (182 amino acids) (Fig. 1) (20Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Google Scholar, 21Lomonte P. Butlot M. van Santen V. Keil G.M. Pastoret P.P. Thirty E. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1835-1841Google Scholar). Unlike the MCV proteins, full-length E8, K13, and E1.1 encode only DED motifs. K13 encodes one complete and one incomplete DED, whereas E8 and E1.1 encode two DEDs. Each DED of these viral proteins contains a highly conserved module RXDL/I(L) (X is any amino acid) that is also conserved in the DEDs of FADD and FLICE. It appears that many other herpesviruses also encode DED-like molecules. Examples include the herpesvirus saimiri protein VG71 and human herpesvirus 6 protein U15 (22Albrecht J.C. Nicholas J. Biller D. Cameron K.R. Biesinger B. Newman C. Wittmann S. Craxton M.A. Coleman H. Fleckenstein B. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Google Scholar, 23Gompels V.A. Nicholas J. Lawrence G. Jones M. Thomson B.J. Martin M.E. Efstathious S. Craxton M. Macaulay H.A. Virology. 1995; 209: 29-51Google Scholar). The presence of DEDs within E8, MC159, and MC160 suggests that these viral proteins might potentially antagonize the FADD-FLICE interaction and thereby attenuate TNFR-1- and CD-95-mediated apoptosis. Indeed, overexpression of MC159 significantly inhibited TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced cell death (Fig. 2A). The degree of inhibition was substantially greater than that achieved with the catalytically inactive dominant-negative version of FLICE (data not shown) and comparable in potency with CrmA. MC160 also inhibited TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced cell death (Fig. 2B), as did E8 (Fig. 2C). Additional studies were undertaken to delineate the point at which MC159 and E8 were exerting their inhibitory effect on the TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced death pathways. As shown in Fig. 3, both MC159 and E8 significantly blocked both TRADD and FADD killing, suggesting that these inhibitors must function downstream of these adaptor molecules. In contrast, MC159 and E8 did not inhibit FLICE-induced death, suggesting that they must act upstream of active FLICE. The overexpression of FLICE zymogen results in autoactivation to the active protease that is potently inhibited by the viral serpin CrmA (Fig. 3C). Binding studies were undertaken to investigate the potential mechanism utilized by E8 and MC159 to attenuate TNFR-1- and CD-95-induced cell death (Fig. 4). Radiolabeled in vitro translated MC159 was precipitated with various GST-fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, including GST-FADD, GST-NFADD containing only the NH2-terminal DED (amino acid residues: 1-82), or GST alone (Fig. 4A). As expected from the homophilic binding nature of DEDs, MC159 strongly bound GST-FADD and GST-NFADD, but not GST alone. To demonstrate the association of the viral inhibitory molecules with FADD or FLICE in vivo, 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding epitope-tagged versions of the respective molecules (Fig. 4). Consistent with the in vitro binding results, MC159 precipitated with FADD (Fig. 4B), but not with FLICE (data not shown). Conversely, E8 strongly associated with FLICE (Fig. 4C), but not with FADD (data not shown). This binding specificity of MC159 and E8 suggested that distinct mechanisms were employed by these two inhibitors. MC159 binds to FADD and presumably blocks its interaction with FLICE. The reverse is probably true for E8 in that it binds FLICE and inhibits its interaction with FADD. However, when FLICE is overexpressed (upon transfection), the binding of E8 is unable to overcome the propensity of this caspase to autoactivate (Fig. 3C). Therefore, once FLICE is active, E8 has no inhibitory influence. Regardless, either mechanism would disrupt the assembly of the receptor·FADD· FLICE signaling complex and abrogate activation of downstream caspases. Further studies will be needed to substantiate these proposed mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2106963863,"Depolarizing concentrations of potassium promote the survival of many neuronal cell types including cerebellar granule cells. To begin to understand the intracellular mediators of neuronal survival, we have tested whether the survival-promoting effect of potassium depolarization on cerebellar granule cells is dependent on either mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) activity. In 7-day cerebellar granule cell cultures, potassium depolarization activated both MAP kinase and PI-3-K. Preventing the activation of MAP kinase with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 did not affect potassium saving. In contrast, the survival-promoting effect of 25 mM potassium was negated by the addition of 30 μM LY 294002 or 1 μM wortmannin, two distinct inhibitors of PI-3-K. The cell death induced by PI-3-K inhibition was indistinguishable from the cell death caused by potassium deprivation; LY 294002-induced death included nuclear condensation, was blocked by cycloheximide, and had the same time course as potassium deprivation-induced cell death. Cerebellar granule cells can also be maintained in serum-free medium containing either 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or 800 μM cAMP. PI-3-K inhibition completely blocked the survival-promoting activity of IGF-I, but had no effect on cAMP-mediated survival. These data indicate that the survival-promoting effects of depolarization and IGF-I, but not cAMP, require PI-3-K activity.

Cell death is a widespread event during development that, in the nervous system, is thought to match the size of neuronal populations with their targets (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Google Scholar). One mechanism for determining which neurons survive and which undergo programmed cell death is limiting the amount of neurotrophic factors (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Google Scholar). Another important mechanism for determining survival is electrical activity; removal of afferent input or pharmacological blockade of electrical activity causes the death of some types of developing neurons (2Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9774-9778Google Scholar, 3Maderdrut J.L. Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Brain Res. 1988; 444: 189-194Google Scholar, 4Ruijter J.M. Baker R.E. De J.B. Romijn H.J.

J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 243-250Google Scholar). In vitro, mimicking electrical activity with depolarizing concentrations of extracellular potassium promotes the survival of many types of neurons (for review, see Ref. 7Franklin J.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Google Scholar). Depolarization leads to the sustained activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium levels. The increase in intracellular calcium is important for survival because blockade of L-type calcium channels blocks K+-mediated survival (8Collins F. Lile J.D. Brain Res. 1989; 502: 99-108Google Scholar, 9Collins F. Schmidt M.F. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2582-2587Google Scholar, 10Franklin J.L. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Juhasz A. Deckwerth T.L.

Berg D.K. Dev. Biol. 1981; 87: 301-307Google Scholar), yet the intracellular pathways that mediate this survival are unknown. Dissociated cerebellar granule cells from early postnatal rats can be maintained in serum-containing medium by raising the extracellular potassium concentration to 25 mM (15Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Google Scholar). Dissociated granule cells develop characteristics of mature cerebellar granule cells in vivo including an extensive neuritic network, expression of excitatory amino acid receptors, and production and release of L-glutamate (16Burgoyne R.D. Graham M.E. Cambray D.M. J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 689-695Google Scholar). Removal of both potassium and serum from the culture medium triggers a cell death that is morphologically apoptotic, accompanied by DNA fragmentation, and dependent on macromolecular synthesis (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar). This programmed cell death (PCD) 1The abbreviations used are: PCDprogrammed cell deathMAPmitogen-activated proteinPI-3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseNGFnerve growth factorIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor ICPT-cAMPchlorophenylthio-cAMP.presumably mimics the naturally occurring death of 20-30% of granule cells (18Caddy K.W. Biscoe T.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 287: 167-201Google Scholar), thought to be important for matching the number of granule cells with Purkinje cells, that occurs during the third through fifth postnatal weeks (19Williams R.W. Herrup K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 423-453Google Scholar, 20Wetts R. Herrup K. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 10: 41-47Google Scholar). programmed cell death mitogen-activated protein phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nerve growth factor insulin-like growth factor I chlorophenylthio-cAMP. One possible mechanism by which depolarization could promote survival is by activating survival-promoting signaling pathways similar to those activated by neurotrophic factors. Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors activate several intracellular signaling pathways. Of these, the MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) pathways have been implicated in survival. In PC12 cells, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1 (AP/xtracellular signal-regulated kinase inase), an activator of MAP kinase, promotes survival in the absence of NGF (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Google Scholar). However, MAP kinase is not required for the survival of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons (22Virdee K. Talkovsky A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1801-1805Google Scholar, 23Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Google Scholar) or PC12 cells (24Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of PI-3-K blocks the survival-promoting effects of NGF in PC12 cells (24Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar). PI-3-K is a lipid kinase that mediates the mitogenic signal of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (25Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar). PI-3-K products are involved in regulating mitogenesis, membrane ruffling, glucose uptake, receptor sorting, and receptor down-regulation in response to growth factors (for review, see Ref. 26Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that PI-3-K activity is required for survival promotion by K+ depolarization and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The following cell culture media were used: K25+S (Eagle's basal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma; Mr cutoff = 10,000), 25 mM KCl, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), K25−S (Eagle's basal medium containing no serum, 25 mM KCl, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), K5−S (Eagle's basal medium containing no serum, 5 mM KCl, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The cell culture protocol used is extensively detailed by Miller and Johnson (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). In brief, cerebella were dissected from P7 Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), sliced into 1-mm pieces, and incubated at 37°C for 15 min in 0.30 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington). The tissue was then triturated in K25+S medium with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) using a flame-polished Pasteur pipette. The resulting cell suspension was spun at 500 × g for 6 min. The pellet was gently triturated in fresh K25+S medium and filtered through a Nitex filter (Tetko Inc., Elmsford, NY). Trypan blue exclusion was used to count the living neurons before plating 2-2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in either four-well (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) or 35-mm (Corning Inc.) dishes. Prior to plating, dishes were coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma, P2636). The granule cells were kept at 35°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air for 7 days. To reduce the number of non-neuronal cells, aphidicolin (3.3 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the medium 24 h after plating. The cultures were 98-99% pure granule cells; the culture conditions do not support the survival of other neuronal cell types (28Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Webb M. Balazs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 11: 177-189Google Scholar, 29Kingsbury A.E. Gallo V. Woodhams P.L. Balazs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 17: 17-25Google Scholar), and the non-neuronal contamination was 1-2% (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). All cultures were treated 7 days after plating. For survival studies, culture dishes were rinsed twice with K5−S medium before adding medium containing 25 mM potassium, LY 294002 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), wortmannin (Sigma), PD98059 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), 800 μM chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP; Boehringer Mannheim), or 100 ng/ml IGF-I (a generous gift from Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO) or a combination of these reagents. Cell viability was quantified from photomicrographs of representative fields of cells labeled with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Calcein AM is an acetoxymethyl ester fluorescein derivative that is cleaved and trapped inside viable cells that have nonspecific esterase activity (30Bozyczko C.D. McKenna B.W. Connors T.J. Neff N.T. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 50: 205-216Google Scholar). The photomicrographs were both taken and scored by a naive observer. Eight photomicrographs at a magnification × 200 were taken for each condition, and the number of calcein AM-positive cells was counted. Cellular nuclei were visualized by fixing cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were washed three times with K5−S medium, incubated at 35°C in 5% CO2 for 3 h, and then stimulated by adding concentrated factors directly to the culture medium. Cells were lysed in PI-3-K lysis buffer as described by Newberry and Pike (31Newberry E.P. Pike L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 253-259Google Scholar). Approximately 400 μg of lysate protein and 35 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to agarose (Calbiochem) were added to the samples and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, and 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) plus 1% Triton X-100; twice with 0.5 mM LiCl and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; and twice with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. PI-3-K activity was assayed in an in vitro kinase reaction, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography (32Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 159-166Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was identified based on its migration relative to that of a radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphate marker (33Hope H.M. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23648-23654Google Scholar). Radioactivity was visualized and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyville, CA). Samples were homogenized in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were incubated for 1 h at 25°C in Buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5.0% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then for 16 h at 4°C with a phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed in Buffer A (3 × 15 min) and incubated for 1 h in Buffer A containing a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.). This was followed by three washes (15 min/wash) in Buffer A; two washes (10 min/wash) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20; and two washes (10 min/wash) in 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. The blot was then incubated for 5 min in CDP-Star (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and exposed to x-ray film. Equal loading of samples was checked by stripping the blots and reprobing with an antibody that detects total MAP kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The membranes were stripped by incubation for 1 h at 25°C in 1.0% Tween 20, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.2. To verify that the blots were completely stripped, they were washed as described above and developed using the CDP-Star reagent. The blots were returned to Buffer A for 1 h and then probed as described above with the total MAP kinase antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. Cultures were incubated for 45-60 min in K25−S medium with 4 μM fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) and then washed three times with Locke's solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 2.7 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 5.6 mMD-glucose, and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 5 mM potassium, 25 mM potassium, or 25 mM potassium plus 30 μM LY 294002. After ∼1 h at 35°C, the cultures were transferred to the heated stage (35°C) of an inverted fluorescence microscope and illuminated with a 75-watt xenon lamp. Fields containing ∼50 neurons were viewed using a 1.3NA ×40 epifluorescent objective (Nikon Inc.). The cultures were alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm by switching the excitation filters. The fluorescent signal was detected by an intensified charge-coupled device camera that was connected to a personal computer for image acquisition and analysis (Metafluor, Universal Imaging Corp.). Data represent means ± S.D. for three independent experiments in which ratios were determined for 150-200 cells/condition/ experiment. To determine whether depolarizing concentrations of extracellular potassium increase MAP kinase or PI-3-K activity, cerebellar granule cells were switched to K5−S medium for 3 h before the medium was raised to 25 mM by the addition of 2.0 M K+. Serum-free medium was used in all experiments to isolate the survival-promoting activity of K+ alone; in granule cells, serum provides survival-promoting activity of unknown origin (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). For PI-3-K activity, neuronal cultures were lysed, immunoprecipitated with a phosphotyrosine antibody, and assayed for PI-3-K activity. Thirty min after treatment, the cultures in 25 mM potassium showed increased PI-3-K activity (Fig. 1A). In three independent experiments, PI-3-K activity from depolarized samples was 3.0 ± 0.2-fold above the controls. To verify that the observed signal was attributable to PI-3-K activity, 30 μM LY 294002, a PI-3-K inhibitor, was included in the in vitro labeling reaction (Fig. 1A, lane 5). LY 294002 does not inhibit phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which could contribute to the observed signal, nor does it have any effect on protein kinase C, protein kinase A, MAP kinase, S6 kinase, c-Src kinase, or diacylglycerol kinase (35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar). Potassium depolarization also caused an activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Samples lysed 15 min after treatment with 25 mM potassium were subjected to Western blot analysis. Probing the blot with a phospho-MAP kinase antibody showed that depolarization led to MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The blot was stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognizes both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the ERK1 and ERK2 (xtracellular signal-egulated inase) isoforms of MAP kinase to verify that different lanes contained comparable amounts of sample (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The finding that K+ increased both PI-3-K and MAP kinase activities raised the possibility that one or both of these pathways are important for granule cell survival. To determine whether the MAP kinase pathway is important for granule cell survival, cultures were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar, 37Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). Seven-day cultures were switched to K5−S medium for 2.5 h, treated for 30 min with PD98059, and then depolarized by the addition of potassium to 25 mM. To assure that the inhibition was sustained during the time the neurons would become irreversibly committed to die (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar), fresh medium and MEK inhibitor were added at 12 and 24 h. Forty-eight h after treatment, neuronal survival was quantified from photomicrographs of calcein AM-stained cultures. Inhibiting the activation of MAP kinase with either 30 or 100 μM PD98059 had no apparent effect on the ability of potassium to promote survival (Fig. 2A). Phospho-MAP kinase Western blots revealed that these doses of PD98059 were sufficient to inhibit MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2B), and this inhibition was sustained even 24 h after treatment. 2T. M. Miller, D. J. Creedon, and E. M. Johnson, Jr., unpublished observations.Thus, the events downstream of MAP kinase activation were not required for potassium-mediated survival of granule neurons. Since LY 294002 can block PI-3-K in intact cells (24Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar, 35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar), we also used this compound to determine whether PI-3-K activity is involved in the survival-promoting effect of K+ depolarization. Cultures were switched to K25−S medium either with or without LY 294002, and cell survival was assayed 48 h later by counting the number of cells in photomicrographs of calcein AM-stained cultures. LY 294002 induced a dose-dependent cell death of granule cells with an EC50 of ∼20 μM (Fig. 3A, closed squares). This dose-response curve is consistent with that of LY 294002 for inhibition of PI-3-K (35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar). When granule cells are switched to K5−S medium, the neurons die by apoptosis (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar). One property of this PCD is its inhibition by cycloheximide. LY 294002-induced cell death was also blocked by cycloheximide (Fig. 3A, open squares). The addition of cycloheximide concurrent with the PI-3-K inhibitor prevented the dose-dependent killing, indicating that inhibition of PI-3-K triggered PCD. Similar results were obtained with wortmannin, a fungal metabolite that also blocks PI-3-K. Wortmannin caused a dose-dependent killing (Fig. 3B, closed squares) that was blocked by cycloheximide (open squares). Because wortmannin is a labile compound (38Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Google Scholar), the culture medium was changed every 6 h during the first 24 h of treatment. Thus, two inhibitors of PI-3-K that act via distinct mechanisms block the survival-promoting ability of potassium depolarization. If this killing is truly caused by a disruption in a specific survival pathway, then the death induced by the PI-3-K inhibitors should share features of that induced by switching to K5−S medium. Because of the lability of wortmannin, these experiments were conducted with LY 294002. Switching to K5−S medium causes the programmed cell death of 60% of granule cells in 48 h (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar, 27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). To determine whether the cell death induced by PI-3-K inhibition had properties similar to PCD in K5−S medium, we used 30 μM LY 294002, a dose that caused a comparable amount of cell loss. We then compared the cell death caused by LY 294002 with that caused by K5−S medium based on several different criteria including dependence on macromolecular synthesis, morphology of the nuclei of dying cells, and time course of cell loss. Similar to PCD induced by K5−S medium, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) blocked the cell death induced by LY 294002 (Fig. 3A, open squares). Fig. 4 shows the phase-contrast (panels a-d) and the corresponding calcein AM-stained (panels e-h) images after 48 h and the bisbenzimide-stained nuclei (panels i-l) after 18 h of granule cells maintained in K25−S medium (panels a, e, and i), in K25−S medium plus 30 μM LY 294002 (panels b, f, and j), in K5−S medium (panels c, g, and k), or in K25−S medium plus 30 μM LY 294002 and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (panels d, h, and l). LY 294002 blocked the survival-promoting effect of 25 mM potassium (compare panels a and e and panels b and f) and led to a cell death that resembled the programmed cell death induced by K5−S medium (panels c and g). Cycloheximide prevented the LY 294002-induced cell death (panels d and h) as it prevents PCD in K5−S medium (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar). The nuclear morphology of granule cells treated with LY 294002 also resembled the nuclei of neurons undergoing K5−S medium-induced PCD. In contrast to the round and homogeneously stained nuclei of cells maintained in 25 mM K+ (panel i), the nuclei of neurons in K25−S medium plus LY 294002 (panel j) and those in K5−S medium (panel k) were condensed and fragmented, features typical of apoptotic nuclei. Again, however, cycloheximide was able to block the effects of PI-3-K inhibition. The nuclei of granule cells in K25−S medium plus LY 294002 and cycloheximide (panel l) were indistinguishable from controls (panel i). Further evidence that inhibition of PI-3-K is similar to removal of K+ was found in the time course of death. After 6, 12, 24, or 48 h, the number of remaining cells was assessed by counting photomicrographs of calcein AM-stained cultures. The resulting time course of cell loss was identical in cultures switched to K5−S medium or to K25−S medium plus LY 294002 (Fig. 5). Together, these results suggest that inhibiting PI-3-K mimicked the programmed cell death that accompanies a switch to low K+. Since the survival-promoting effect of potassium depolarization is critically dependent on an increase in intracellular calcium (15Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Google Scholar), we tested whether LY 294002 had any effect on the sustained rise in intracellular calcium in depolarized cells. Intracellular calcium was measured by determining 340/380 nm ratios for the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2. An increase in the 340/380 nm ratio is indicative of an increase in intracellular free calcium. K+ depolarization of granule cells caused an ∼2-fold increase in the 340/380 nm ratio that was not blocked by 30 μM LY 294002 (Fig. 6). Thus, blocking calcium channels or the sustained rise in intracellular calcium was not the mechanism by which LY 294002 blocked the survival-promoting activity of depolarizing concentrations of K+. In addition to potassium depolarization, cerebellar granule cells can be maintained in vitro in low K+ medium supplemented with either IGF-I or CPT-cAMP (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar). We found that, similar to K+ (Fig. 1), IGF-I (100 ng/ml) activated PI-3-K, whereas CPT-cAMP (800 μM) did not (Fig. 7A). In accordance with their ability to stimulate PI-3-K, LY 294002 blocked the survival-promoting effect of IGF-I and K+, but not that of CPT-cAMP (Fig. 7B). At 48 h, K5−S medium plus IGF-I or plus CPT-cAMP promoted granule cell survival comparable to K25−S medium. As with K25−S medium, LY 294002 reversed the saving effects of IGF-I. In fact, the dose-response curve for LY 294002 killing of IGF-maintained cells (Fig. 7C) mirrored the effect of LY 294002 on potassium-saved neurons (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells maintained in CPT-cAMP survived despite the presence of the PI-3-K inhibitor. Since IGF-I stimulates a tyrosine kinase receptor, the MAP kinase pathway is another candidate for survival-promoting activity. Like the potassium-maintained cells, however, MEK inhibition had no discernible effect on IGF-I saving (Fig. 7C, closed circles) or on CPT-cAMP-maintained neurons.2 The fact that IGF-I survival was blocked by LY 294002 implies that both K+ and IGF-I promote survival by signaling through PI-3-K, whereas CPT-cAMP appears to act downstream of PI-3-K or through a non-PI-3-K-dependent pathway. The failure of LY 294002 to block CPT-cAMP-mediated survival also provides additional evidence that LY 294002 is not generally toxic to cerebellar granule cells; these results support a role for PI-3-K in neuronal survival. In this study, we provide evidence for a link between K+ depolarization and a signaling pathway that promotes the survival of neurons. Depolarizing concentrations of extracellular potassium increased PI-3-K activity; that this activity is critical for survival is indicated by the ability of inhibitors of PI-3-K to block depolarization-mediated survival. The cell death resulting from inhibition of PI-3-K was indistinguishable from the programmed cell death triggered by lowering the K+ concentration. In both cases, cell death was dependent on macromolecular synthesis and accompanied by morphologically apoptotic nuclei. In addition, the time course of cell loss was identical, and the cell death was prevented by cAMP. These data strongly suggest that PI-3-K inhibition resulted in programmed cell death by specifically blocking the survival-promoting activity of K+ depolarization. The survival-promoting activity of IGF-I was also blocked by inhibition of PI-3-K. K+ depolarization and growth factors may therefore converge on PI-3-K to signal survival promotion. PI-3-K activity increases in response to several growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, colony-stimulating factor 1, nerve growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, stem cell growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (26Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Google Scholar). As previously reported in cell lines (39Backer J.M. Myers M.J. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 40Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Tartare S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7358-7364Google Scholar), we found that IGF-I increased PI-3-K activity in cerebellar granule neurons. Although both IGF-I and 25 mM potassium increased PI-3-K activity and inhibiting PI-3-K blocked their ability to promote survival, we did not directly test whether the rise in PI-3-K activity per se was critical for survival. Basal activity could augment other actions of these agents that result in survival. In the absence of 25 mM potassium or IGF-I, however, the basal PI-3-K activity was not sufficient to maintain the neurons. For growth factors, activation of PI-3-K is dependent on the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the growth factor receptor. Autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the receptor recruits the Src homology 2 domain (SH2) of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3-K. This leads to relocalization of PI-3-K to the membrane and activation of the catalytic p110 subunit. In contrast to other known growth factors, phosphorylation of the insulin or IGF-I receptor leads to phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, which serves as an SH2-docking protein for p85 (39Backer J.M. Myers M.J. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar, 40Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Tartare S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7358-7364Google Scholar, 41Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.-G. Sun X.-J. Chin D.J. Shoelson S.E. Miralpeix M. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8204-8212Google Scholar, 42Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Google Scholar). One mechanism by which potassium depolarization may increase PI-3-K activity is by causing phosphorylation events similar to those caused by growth factor receptors. Some evidence supports this hypothesis. For example, PYK2, a novel protein-tyrosine kinase, is rapidly phosphorylated in response to stimuli that increase intracellular calcium (43Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of PI-3-K may associate with this calcium-responsive protein-tyrosine kinase. Alternatively, PYK2 may activate PI-3-K by first activating Ras, which can be an upstream activator of PI-3-K (44Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodriguez V.P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Google Scholar). Potassium depolarization of PC12 cells results in phosphorylation of the adapter protein Shc and leads to the association of Shc with Grb2, causing Ras and MAP kinase activation (45Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Google Scholar, 46Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Google Scholar, 47Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (47Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Google Scholar). At this point, which of these phosphorylation events occurs in depolarized granule cells is unclear. In cultures of cortical neurons, depolarization promotes survival by stimulating the release of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor that serves as an autocrine or paracrine trophic agent (48Ghosh A. Carnahan J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1994; 263: 1618-1623Google Scholar). This contrasts with sympathetic neurons, however, in which potassium depolarization fails to induce the phosphorylation of growth factor receptors (10Franklin J.L. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Juhasz A. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 643-664Google Scholar). In granule cell cultures, antibodies to IGF-I, neurotrophin-3, NGF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor do not affect granule cell survival in depolarizing medium,2 suggesting that granule cells behave similarly to sympathetic neurons in this regard. Another mechanism whereby calcium may influence survival is by increasing calcium/calmodulin kinase activity. Inhibitors of calmodulin- or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity block K+-mediated survival (15Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Google Scholar, 49Hack N. Hidaka H. Wakefield M.J. Balazs R. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 9-20Google Scholar). However, these compounds may affect survival by blocking the sustained rise in intracellular calcium (10Franklin J.L. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Juhasz A. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 643-664Google Scholar). We found that LY 294002 did not interfere with increases in intracellular calcium after 1 h (Fig. 6), a time when inhibitors of calcium channels, such as nifedipine, will block calcium channels completely (10Franklin J.L. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Juhasz A. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 643-664Google Scholar). It is possible that LY 294002 affected calcium at later time points, but measurement of calcium at later time points would be difficult to interpret because the cells begin to degenerate within 6 h, and changes in metabolic parameters such as glucose uptake and protein synthesis occur within 2 h of the induction of apoptosis (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). In addition to our direct measurement of calcium at 1 h, two other pieces of evidence argue against LY 294002 affecting calcium. First, since the time course of death triggered by K5−S medium or by K25−S medium plus LY 294002 overlaps (Fig. 5), an LY 294002 effect on calcium would have to occur rapidly. If LY 294002 caused a delayed decrease in intracellular calcium that initiated PCD, we would expect to see a corresponding delay in the cell death time course, but this was not the case (Fig. 5). Second, LY 294002 blocked the survival-promoting effect of IGF-I, which does not elevate intracellular calcium (11Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Google Scholar). An indication that Ras is activated by depolarization is that depolarization activates the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 6) (45Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Google Scholar, 46Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Google Scholar, 47Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Google Scholar, 50Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1, an activator of MAP kinase, promotes survival in the absence of NGF (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Google Scholar). However, MAP kinase is not required for the survival of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons (22Virdee K. Talkovsky A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1801-1805Google Scholar, 23Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Google Scholar) or NGF-maintained PC12 cells (24Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our data demonstrate that MAP kinase was not required for survival because the MEK inhibitor, which blocks activation of MAP kinase, did not affect survival. The fact that PI-3-K inhibitors do not prevent the activation of MAP kinase2 yet lead to PCD (Fig. 3) indicates that MAP kinase activity was also not sufficient to promote granule neuron survival. Several possible downstream targets of PI-3-K may be involved in neuronal survival. Protein kinase C isozymes (51Zhang J. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Abrams C.S. Zhao W. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

We have found that glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and RNA synthesis decrease dramatically as granule cells (27Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar) and sympathetic neurons (65Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Google Scholar) undergo PCD and have suggested that this dramatic decrease in metabolic parameters is part of PCD in neurons. Inhibiting PI-3-K may specifically decrease metabolic functions maintained by either K+ depolarization or growth factors and thus trigger PCD. Although peripheral neurons are particularly dependent on growth factors for survival, neurons from the central nervous system may depend on a combination of trophic factors and electrical activity (66Meyer F.A. Kaplan M.R. Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 805-819Google Scholar). Our results highlight PI-3-K as an important intracellular mediator of survival promotion by either activity or trophic factors. PI-3-K is one of the pathways upon which neurons critically depend for survival in vitro and, perhaps, in vivo We thank Monsanto Co. for the generous gift of IGF-I; S. Handran and Dr. S.

As a starting point for structure-function analysis using a mutagenic approach, we used the strong and inducible heat shock promoter to direct high level expression of PMR1 from a multicopy plasmid. Yeast lysates were separated on sucrose density gradients, and fractions assayed for organellar markers. PMR1 is found in fractions containing the Golgi marker guanosine diphosphatase, and is associated with an ATP-dependent, protonophore-insensitive 45Ca2+ uptake activity. This activity is virtually abolished in the absence of the expression plasmid. Furthermore, replacement of the active site aspartate within the phosphorylation domain had the expected effect of abolishing Ca2+ transport activity entirely. Interestingly, the mutant enzymes (Asp-371 → Glu and Asp-371 → Asn) demonstrated proper targeting to the Golgi, unlike analogous mutations in the related yeast H+-ATPase. Detailed characterization of calcium transport by PMR1 showed that sensitivity to inhibitors (vanadate, thapsigargin, and cyclopiazonic acid) and affinity for substrates (MgATP and Ca2+) were different from the previously characterized sarco/endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases. PMR1 therefore represents a new and distinct P-type Ca2+-ATPase.

INTRODUCTIONThe rate of bone turnover has for years been estimated by measurement of different markers reflecting bone formation and bone resorption in urine and blood (1Delmas P.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 549-555Google Scholar). The traditional bone-resorption markers are urinary calcium and hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline, however, is not specific for bone (2Reid K.B.M. Porler R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 10-23Google Scholar), and its urinary excretion is influenced by diets rich in hydroxyproline (3Colwell A. Eastell R. Assiri A.M.A. Russel R.G.G. Christiansen C. Overgaard K. Osteoporosis 1990. Osteopress ApS, Copenhagen1990: 590-591Google Scholar), renal clearance, and metabolization (4Kivirikko K.I. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1970; 5: 93-163Google Scholar, 5Weiss P.H. Klein L. J. Clin.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Google Scholar). Pyr is found mainly in bone and cartilage (7Eyre D.R. Koop T.J. Vann Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Google Scholar, 8Eyre D.R. Dickson I.R. Van Ness K.P. J. Biochem. 1988; 252: 495-500Google Scholar) but also in collagen from most other connective tissues, whereas Dpyr is present mainly in bone and dentin (7Eyre D.R. Koop T.J. Vann Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Google Scholar). Although the pyridinium cross-links are not entirely bone-specific, they appear to be superior markers of bone resorption compared with hydroxyproline (1Delmas P.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 549-555Google Scholar).The pyridinium cross-links occur at two intermolecular sites, one linking two C-terminal telopeptides to residue 87 of the triple helix α1 or α2 chain and the other linking two N-terminal telopeptides to residue 930 of the triple helix α1 chain (9Kühn K. Furthmayr H. Immunochemistry of the Extracellular Matrix. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 1-30Google Scholar). The C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen consists of a 26-amino acid sequence (10Kadler K. Sheterline P. Protein Profiles: Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril-forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994: 512-637Google Scholar) and contains an Asp-Gly sequence that is a potential site for β-isomerization in proteins/peptides prone to β-isomerize (11Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Google Scholar, 12Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Hancock W.S. Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14262-14271Google Scholar). In the case of β-isomerization, the peptide backbone is transferred from the aspartyl α-carboxyl group to the side chain β-carboxyl group, resulting in a perturbation of the peptide backbone (11Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). β-Isomerization is generally believed to be associated with aging of proteins and peptides (13Galletti P. Ingrosso D. Manna C.

Blood Cells. 1988; 14: 103-117Google Scholar).Recently, new assays measuring urinary degradation products derived from the C-terminal telopeptide region of type I collagen have been developed (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H.

It has been shown that measurements of such fragments in urine reflects the rate of bone resorption in a number of metabolic bone diseases (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

However, little is known about these fragments, their size, and their possible relation to the degree of osteoclastic activity. So far, it is uncertain whether the fragments are further metabolized in the circulation, in the liver, or in the kidneys. Neither is it clear to what extent the fragments are cross-linked, what types of cross-links are dominant, and if certain fragments can be related to degradation of different connective tissues containing type I collagen. Finally, it is unknown whether the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly sequence is prone to undergo β-isomerization in type I collagen from bone and other connective tissues.The aim of the present study was to investigate the nature of degradation products derived from the C-terminal telopeptide region of type I collagen excreted into urine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma or Merck. Acetonitrile was from Rathburn, heptafluorobutyric acid was from Aldrich, and trifluoroacetic acid was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Synthetic peptides were from Schäfer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). The CrossLaps™ ELISA was from Osteometer BioTech A/S (Herlev, Denmark), CNBr-activated Sepharose™ 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and the Sep-Pak® C18 cartridges were from Waters (Milford, MA).SubjectsUrine samples were collected as second morning void between 8 and 10 a.m. from 36 children and 42 postmenopausal women aged 6-11 and 45-54 years of age, respectively. The urine used for immunoaffinity purification was first morning void from an 11-year-old boy. Informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983, and the investigation was approved by the ethical committee of Copenhagen County.MAbA7 ELISAThe MAbA7 ELISA is a competitive assay employing a peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody (MAbA7) reactive with peptide fragments derived from degradation of the C-terminal telopeptide (α1) region of human type I collagen. The assay was performed as described previously (16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar).CrossLaps ELISAThe CrossLaps ELISA is a competitive assay based on a polyclonal antibody reactive with degradation products derived from the C-terminal telopeptide region (α1) of human type I collagen. The assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer.Amino Acid AnalysisAmino acid composition analysis of EKAHDGGR, EKAHβDGGR, and urinary fragments derived from type I collagen was performed after acid hydrolysis by ion exchange chromatography combined with post-column derivatization as described previously (20Bakholdt V. Jensen A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Google Scholar).Peptide Sequence AnalysisN-terminal sequencing was performed on a 494A protein sequencer with an on-line 120 A analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and chemicals recommended by the manufacturer.Mass SpectrometryFreeze-dried material was redissolved in 20 μl of 30% acetonitrile (v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). A 0.5-μl aliquot was mixed with 0.5 μl of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix in the same solvent. The mixture (1 μl) was analyzed in a Biflex instrument in linear mode at 15 kV (Bruker-Franzer Analytic). Spectra were averaged from 40-100 laser-beam shots. Using the synthetic peptide PYDRISNSAFSDF-NH2 (1517.6 Da) and melittin (2846.5 Da) as external calibrators, the inaccuracy of the method was lower than 0.1%. The molecular mass of each molecule was determined as the mean value of several measurements estimated using different external standard curves.HPLC EquipmentThe chromatographic system consisted of two 510 pumps, a 717 autosampler, a scanning fluorescence detector, and an extended wavelength module equipped with a 214-nm cutoff filter (all from Waters). Purification of synthetic EKAHDGGR, EKAHβDGGR, and urinary fragments derived from type I collagen was performed at room temperature using a reverse-phase Delta Pak C18 column (3.9 mm × 150 mm; particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 30 nm; Waters). Data were collected on a personal computer and evaluated using the Maxima software from Waters. In the following, the effluents were monitored for peptide bonds at 214 nm and for fluorescent molecules at 380 nm (emission) using 297-nm light for excitation.Characterization of MAbA7 ELISA and CrossLaps ELISA Binding SpecificityPreparations of synthetic EKAHDGGR were contaminated with its corresponding β-isomerized form, EKAHβDGGR. Prior to evaluation of the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA binding specificity, EKAHDGGR and EKAHβDGGR were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using an isocratic gradient of 0.5% acetonitrile (v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The effluent was monitored for peptide bonds, collected in 1-ml fractions, freeze-dried, redissolved in PBS (1 ml), and measured in the two assays (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Determination of MAbA7 ELISA and CrossLaps binding specificity. A mixture of synthetic EKAHDGGR and its corresponding β-isomerized form, EKAHβDGGR, was separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using these two sequences, the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA were shown to measure only nonisomerized and β-isomerized fragments, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Production of Monoclonal AntibodyThe monoclonal antibody MAbA7, which is reactive with peptide fragments from the C-terminal telopeptide (α1) region of type I collagen, was produced, hybridomas were propagated, and monoclonal antibodies were purified as described previously (16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar).Immunoaffinity ChromatographyMonoclonal antibody MAbA7 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. Urine was diluted 1:3 (v/v) in PBS, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 M NaOH, and 800 ml of diluted urine was recirculated on a MAbA7-Sepharose column (14 cm3) for 24 h at 4°C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. After washing the column with 200 ml of PBS, pH 8.0, bound material was eluted using 20 ml of 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The eluted molecules were desalted using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge conditioned with 20 ml of 80% methanol (v/v) and equilibrated with 20 ml of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Bound material was washed with 20 ml of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and eluted with 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), freeze-dried, and stored at −20°C.Purification of Immunoaffinity Purified MaterialThe purification of immunoaffinity purified material was carried out using three consecutive reverse-phase HPLC steps.Step 1Freeze-dried material extracted from urine by immunoaffinity chromatography was redissolved in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v) and eluted from a Delta Pak C18 column with a 16-24% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (v/v) over 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two-ml fractions were collected and stored at −20°C. An aliquot (25 μl) from each fraction was freeze-dried, redissolved in PBS (200 μl), and assayed in the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA.Step 2Selected fractions from Step 1 containing high amounts of βCTX and αCTX as determined by CrossLaps ELISA and MAbA7 ELISA were freeze-dried, redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and further purified using a Delta Pak C18 column. The fragments were eluted with a 0 to 12% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 80 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two-ml fractions were collected and stored at −20°C. From each fraction an aliquot of 50 μl was freeze-dried, redissolved in PBS (200 μl), and assayed in the MAbA7 ELISA and CrossLaps ELISA.Step 3Selected fractions from Step 2 containing high amounts of βCTX and αCTX as determined by CrossLaps ELISA and MAbA7 ELISA were purified once more on a Delta Pak C18 column. Freeze-dried material was redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and eluted with a 1-5% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (240 μl) were collected, and an aliquot (10 μl) from each fraction was freeze-dried, redissolved in PBS (100 μl), and assayed in the MAbA7 ELISA and CrossLaps ELISA.Determination of Pyridinium Cross-LinksThe possible presence of the pyridinium cross-links Pyr and Dpyr was evaluated in fractions containing high levels of fragments reactive in the MAbA7 ELISA and CrossLaps ELISA by their fluorescence after acid hydrolysis and separation by reverse-phase HPLC (21Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Overgaard K. Christiansen C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 381-384Google Scholar).Purification and Collagenase Digestion of Type I Collagen from BoneTrabecular and cortical bone was obtained from bovine femurs from an embryo and a cow. Soft tissue surrounding the femur was removed, and the bone was cut into pieces. Trabecular bone was obtained from the femoral neck and cortical bone from the midshaft of the bones. The bone samples were washed extensively at 4°C with 0.14 M NaCl, 0.05 M Na2(SO4), pH 7.5, and subsequently extracted overnight at 4°C with 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5. After rinsing with water the bone was lyophilized and processed into fine powder using a Spex freezer mill (Spex Inc., Edison, NJ). The bone powder was defatted with acetone for 2 h, lyophilized, and demineralized in 0.5 M EDTA, 0.05 M Tris, 1% NaN3 (w/v), pH 7.5, in Spectrapor-4 dialysis tubing (Spectrum, Los Angeles, CA) for 72 h. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was rinsed in cold water, reconstituted in 0.05 M Tris, 0.036 M CaCl2, pH 7.5, and digested with 500:1 (w/w) bacterial collagenase 1A (Sigma C-9891) overnight at 37°C. The collagenase-treated collagen was centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 × g, and the supernatant was assayed for reactivity in the MAbA7 ELISA and in the CrossLaps ELISA.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified an Asp-Gly sequence within the C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen prone to undergo β-isomerization. The results presented here indicate that β-isomerization of this sequence takes place in vivo and that the degree of β-isomerization increases with increasing age of type I collagen molecules in bone.Around 90% of the protein in bone is type I collagen (30Termine J.D. Murray F.J. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 21-25Google Scholar). When bone is resorbed by osteoclasts, fragments of type I collagen are released into the circulation and to an unknown extent excreted into the urine. However, urinary degradation products of type I collagen might also be derived from nonskeletal sources, since type I collagen is widely distributed in most connective tissues throughout the body (30Termine J.D. Murray F.J. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 21-25Google Scholar). So far, little is known about the origin and biochemical structure of such urinary collagen-degradation products. In this context, it is interesting that the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA appear exclusively to measure urinary degradation products of type I collagen derived from osteoclastic resorption of bone (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H.

Res. 1995; 79: 780-785Google Scholar). A biological explanation for this phenomenon could be that certain fragments derived from mature type I collagen are protected against complete degradation by the liver and/or the kidney due to posttranslational modifications.The MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA both measure urinary degradation products (CTX) derived from the C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen (10Kadler K. Sheterline P. Protein Profiles: Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril-forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994: 512-637Google Scholar). The human C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain consists of a 26-amino acid sequence (Fig. 9) in which the amino acid Lys (K) at position 16 is a site involved in cross-linking of mature collagen (9Kühn K. Furthmayr H. Immunochemistry of the Extracellular Matrix. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 1-30Google Scholar, 22Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Google Scholar, 23Henkel W. Glanville R.W. Greifendorf D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 427-436Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides, it has been shown that only CTX fragments containing the sequence from residues 17-22 exposing a free Arg residue at position 23 are measured in the MAbA7 ELISA (16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar). Likewise, the CrossLaps ELISA also determines CTX fragments derived from the C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen containing the amino acid sequence from residues 17-22 (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar). Using synthetic EKAHDGGR and EKAHβDGGR, it is shown that the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA measure nonisomerized and β-isomerized peptides, respectively (Fig. 2).Fig. 9Schematic presentation of type I collagen showing the amino acid sequence of the human C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain. Type I collagen consists of two α1 chains and one α2 chain. The intact C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain consists of a 26-amino acid sequence (10Kadler K. Sheterline P. Protein Profiles: Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril-forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994: 512-637Google Scholar). Residue 16 can be involved in cross-linking (9Kühn K. Furthmayr H. Immunochemistry of the Extracellular Matrix. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 1-30Google Scholar). Only C-terminal telopeptides exposing a free C-terminal arginine (R) in position 22 is detected in the MAbA7 ELISA (16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar). In this study, the DG sequence (positions 19-20) was shown to be prone to β-isomerization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the present study, the two immunoassays in addition to traditional biochemical techniques were used to characterize the structure of type I collagen-degradation products. It was demonstrated that the Asp-Gly sequence (positions 19-20) within the human C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen may undergo β-isomerization. β-Isomerized CTX fragments were identified in collagenase digests of type I collagen from bone and in urine. The majority of the urinary fragments characterized were cross-linked and consisted of two αCTX sequences, one αCTX and one βCTX sequence, or two βCTX sequences.The conversion of the Asp-Gly linkage to a β-isomerized Asp-Gly linkage is illustrated in Fig. 1. The attack by a peptide backbone nitrogen on the side chain carbonyl group of an adjacent Asp residue can result in the formation of a five-member succinimide ring (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Google Scholar, 31Brennan T.V. Clarke S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 331-338Google Scholar). The succinimide ring is prone to hydrolysis, producing Asp-Gly and βAsp-Gly sequences (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Google Scholar). Succinimide intermediates can form and undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Google Scholar). Several factors are known to influence the formation rate of such succinimide intermediates. Among these are the primary structure of the fragment, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of proteins (11Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Google Scholar, 32Oliyai C. Borchardt R.T. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1994; 11: 751-758Google Scholar), pH (33Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Google Scholar) and temperature (32Oliyai C. Borchardt R.T. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1994; 11: 751-758Google Scholar, 33Tyler-Cross R. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22549-22556Google Scholar), and the protein microenvironment.The biological role of β-isomerization is not known yet. It is generally believed, however, that the degree of β-isomerization is associated with aging of proteins (13Galletti P. Ingrosso D. Manna C. Clemente G. Zappia V. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 313-325Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on results showing that the degree of β-isomerization in proteins and peptides prone to undergo this alteration increases with time (age) in vivo and in vitro (12Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Hancock W.S. Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14262-14271Google Scholar, 34Antigues A. Birkett A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4853-4858Google Scholar, 35Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Google Scholar). In addition, studies evaluating the function of proteins and peptides have revealed that increased β-isomerization is often accompanied by a decreased physiological protein/peptide activity (36Hayakawa Y. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 15-17Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of an intracellular methyltransferase repair system using β-isomerized molecules as substrate has been reported (25McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Google Scholar, 37Aswad D.W. Johnson B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 155-158Google Scholar), whereas extracellular repair systems, such as the methyltransferase system present in cells, has not (38Kim S. Galletti P. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 338-341Google Scholar). It is therefore improbable that a β-isomerized C-terminal telopeptide βAsp-Gly sequence will be enzymatically repaired in vivo, since type I collagen is an extracellular protein.Our results seem to confirm the suggested relationship between β-isomerization and tissue age, since the ratio αCTX/βCTX is high in collagenase digests of young bone compared with those of old bone. This relationship was further supported by our results showing that the relative amount of αCTX in the above fractions (Fig. 8) was higher in trabecular bone compared with cortical bone, two bone tissues characterized by high and low bone turnover, respectively (39Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the degree of β-isomerization of the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly site of type I collagen in bone is dependent on the age of the molecules in the bone tissue.In a previous study, Haley et al. (40Haley E.E. Corcoran B.J. Dorer F.E. Buchanan D.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3229-3235Google Scholar) were not able to show an increase in the number of β-isomerized Asp-Gly sequences from Achilles tendon per molecule of type I collagen with increasing age. In the same study, Haley et al. (40Haley E.E. Corcoran B.J. Dorer F.E. Buchanan D.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3229-3235Google Scholar) estimated the content of β-isomerized Asp-Gly sites to be between 0.8 and 1.9 per collagen molecule. The α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen both contain several Asp-Gly sites. Combined with our results, however, the number of β-isomerized Asp-Gly sites as estimated by Haley et al. indicate that the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly sequence (α1) probably is the only Asp-Gly sequence in type I collagen that is liable to undergo β-isomerization.Using synthetic peptides containing an Asp-Gly sequence, Gieger and Clarke (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Google Scholar) showed that at equilibrium in the absence of the methyltransferase repair system approximately 75% of the Asp-Gly sequences were converted to their corresponding isoform, βAsp-Gly. In our study 50% of the CTX Asp-Gly sequences were β-isomerized in urine from children, whereas 70-80% was β-isomerized in urine from adults and in collagenase digests from old trabecular and cortical bone. This seems to indicate that the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly sequence almost has reached equilibrium with respect to β-isomerization in old trabecular and cortical bone. Based on histological studies, it has been estimated that trabecular and cortical bone in adults are completely renewed within a period of 3 and 20 years, respectively (39Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Google Scholar). Accordingly, we suggest that the process of β-isomerization of the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly sequence of type I collagen in mineralized tissues such as bone almost has reached equilibrium within a period of 3 years.Clinical results obtained using the MAbA7 ELISA and the CrossLaps ELISA strongly indicate that both assays measure urinary fragments derived from resorption of bone (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar, 17Bonde M. Fledelius C. Qvist P. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 1639-1644Google Scholar, 18Bonde M. Qvist P.

Res. 1995; 79: 780-785Google Scholar). This assumption was further supported by the close resemblance between the various αCTX/βCTX levels found in urine and bone from young and old individuals, respectively. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the urinary ratio of αCTX/βCTX reflects the ratio in the resorbed bone. In this context, it is interesting that the urinary ratio found in patients with Paget's disease is markedly elevated compared with that of age-matched healthy controls (16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1997; 57: 73-83Google Scholar). Paget's disease is characterized by very high bone turnover in restricted areas of the skeleton, resulting in a disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone at the affected sites (41Siris E.S. Favus M.J. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of the Mineral Metabolism. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 375-384Google Scholar). If the hypothesis holds true that αCTX and βCTX reflect degradation of young and old bone, respectively, apparently the contribution of αCTX from the diseased areas of the skeleton is very high compared with βCTX. This is in keeping with the notion that the diseased areas in Paget's disease are characterized by a highly increased rate of bone turnover, probably resulting in degradation of relatively newly formed (young) bone.The urinary CTX fragments identified in this study were cross-linked by either pyridinium cross-links or an unknown nonfluorescent cross-link. The ratio between Pyr and Dpyr in bone is 3.5:1, whereas the ratio is higher than 10:1 in almost all other connective tissues containing these cross-links (8Eyre D.R. Dickson I.R. Van Ness K.P. J. Biochem. 1988; 252: 495-500Google Scholar). The pyridinium cross-links are normally excreted into urine in a Pyr/Dpyr ratio of 3.8-6.0, which is almost comparable to that found in bone. This indicates that the majority of the pyridinium cross-links in urine are derived mainly from bone. In the present study, the Pyr/Dpyr ratio was 3.8 in the mixture of CTX fragments extracted from urine by immunoaffinity, indicating that at least the fragments cross-linked by pyridinium cross-links were derived from bone (data not shown).In conclusion, we have identified an Asp-Gly sequence within the C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen prone to β-isomerization. The degree of β-isomerization at this site seems to increase with increasing age of type I collagen molecules in bone. The data further indicate that the degree of β-isomerization has almost reached equilibrium in old trabecular and cortical bone. In addition, our results seem to confirm previous clinical findings (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C.

INTRODUCTIONThe rate of bone turnover has for years been estimated by measurement of different markers reflecting bone formation and bone resorption in urine and blood (1Delmas P.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 549-555Google Scholar). The traditional bone-resorption markers are urinary calcium and hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline, however, is not specific for bone (2Reid K.B.M. Porler R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 10-23Google Scholar), and its urinary excretion is influenced by diets rich in hydroxyproline (3Colwell A. Eastell R. Assiri A.M.A. Russel R.G.G. Christiansen C. Overgaard K. Osteoporosis 1990. Osteopress ApS, Copenhagen1990: 590-591Google Scholar), renal clearance, and metabolization (4Kivirikko K.I. Int. Rev. Connect.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Google Scholar). Pyr is found mainly in bone and cartilage (7Eyre D.R. Koop T.J. Vann Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Google Scholar, 8Eyre D.R. Dickson I.R. Van Ness K.P. J. Biochem. 1988; 252: 495-500Google Scholar) but also in collagen from most other connective tissues, whereas Dpyr is present mainly in bone and dentin (7Eyre D.R. Koop T.J. Vann Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Google Scholar). Although the pyridinium cross-links are not entirely bone-specific, they appear to be superior markers of bone resorption compared with hydroxyproline (1Delmas P.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 549-555Google Scholar).The pyridinium cross-links occur at two intermolecular sites, one linking two C-terminal telopeptides to residue 87 of the triple helix α1 or α2 chain and the other linking two N-terminal telopeptides to residue 930 of the triple helix α1 chain (9Kühn K. Furthmayr H. Immunochemistry of the Extracellular Matrix. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 1-30Google Scholar). The C-terminal telopeptide α1 chain of type I collagen consists of a 26-amino acid sequence (10Kadler K. Sheterline P. Protein Profiles: Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril-forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994: 512-637Google Scholar) and contains an Asp-Gly sequence that is a potential site for β-isomerization in proteins/peptides prone to β-isomerize (11Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Google Scholar, 12Johnson B.A. Shirokawa J.M. Hancock W.S. Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14262-14271Google Scholar). In the case of β-isomerization, the peptide backbone is transferred from the aspartyl α-carboxyl group to the side chain β-carboxyl group, resulting in a perturbation of the peptide backbone (11Clarke S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 808-821Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). β-Isomerization is generally believed to be associated with aging of proteins and peptides (13Galletti P. Ingrosso D. Manna C. Clemente G. Zappia V. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 313-325Google Scholar, 14Lowenson J. Clarke S. Blood Cells. 1988; 14: 103-117Google Scholar).Recently, new assays measuring urinary degradation products derived from the C-terminal telopeptide region of type I collagen have been developed (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H.

It has been shown that measurements of such fragments in urine reflects the rate of bone resorption in a number of metabolic bone diseases (15Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Google Scholar, 16Fledelius C. Kolding I. Qvist P. Bonde M. Hassager C. Reginster J.-Y. Hejgaard J. Frøkier H. Christiansen C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

However, little is known about these fragments, their size, and their possible relation to the degree of osteoclastic activity. So far, it is uncertain whether the fragments are further metabolized in the circulation, in the liver, or in the kidneys. Neither is it clear to what extent the fragments are cross-linked, what types of cross-links are dominant, and if certain fragments can be related to degradation of different connective tissues containing type I collagen. Finally, it is unknown whether the C-terminal telopeptide Asp-Gly sequence is prone to undergo β-isomerization in type I collagen from bone and other connective tissues.The aim of the present study was to investigate the nature of degradation products derived from the C-terminal telopeptide region of type I collagen excreted into urine."

IRP-1 is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates iron metabolism following its activation by iron deficiency, nitric oxide, and administration of H2O2 or antimycin A, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (Hentze, M. W., and Kühn, L. C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 8175-8182). We show that 10 μM H2O2 suffice for complete IRP-1 activation within 60 min when H2O2 is generated extracellularly at steady-state. By contrast, rapid cellular H2O2 degradation necessitates a 5-10-fold higher bolus dose. To study IRP-1 responses to intracellular oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiration was inhibited with antimycin A (to generate oxidative stress by leakage of ROIs from complex III), or catalase was blocked with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (to diminish H2O2 degradation); in parallel, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used as a redox-sensitive probe to monitor intracellular H2O2 levels by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Catalase inhibition elevates intracellular H2O2, but surprisingly does not cause concomitant IRP-1 activation. Following antimycin A treatment, IRP-1 is activated, but the activation kinetics lag behind the rapid increase in detectable intracellular H2O2. IRP-1 is thus activated both by extra- and intracellular generation of ROIs. While extracellular H2O2 rapidly activates IRP-1 even without detectable increases in intracellular H2O2, intracellular H2O2 elevation is not sufficient for IRP-1 activation. IRP-1 thus represents a novel example of an H2O2-regulated protein that responds differentially to alterations of extra- and intracellular H2O2 levels.

This approach has the advantage of generating ceramide in the membrane at physiologically relevant concentrations and avoids some of the drawbacks of using exogenous ceramides. However, we have found that in many of these experiments, exogenously applied bacterial sphingomyelinase lacks substantial activity in inducing apoptosis and other responses. This suggests one of two possibilities: 1) that ceramide is not sufficient to induce those responses or 2) that there are distinct intracellular compartments where sphingomyelinase is activated leading to localized ceramide generation, thus implying that certain pools of ceramide are the biologically relevant or active pools. In this study, we wanted to examine these possibilities and to determine whether exogenously applied bacterial sphingomyelinase is biologically different from activation of “cellular” sphingomyelinase, thus yielding distinct pools of ceramide. To achieve this goal, we stably transfected Molt-4 leukemia cells with B. cereus sphingomyelinase under the control of an inducible promoter. We demonstrate that we could induce apoptosis only upon induction of transfected sphingomyelinase activity and not when bacterial sphingomyelinase was used exogenously. These data support the hypothesis that ceramide is biologically active and that the generation of ceramide intracellularly is distinct from ceramide generated at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. B. cereus was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 14579). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and RNA molecular weight markers were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Nick translation kit was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Taq polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Corp. Nitrocellulose and Zeta-probe blotting membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Anti-PARP anti-serum was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). G418, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Hygromycin B was purchased from Calbiochem. Genomic DNA was isolated from B. cereus cultured overnight at 30°C in brain heart infusion cultured medium (Sigma). For PCR amplification, the sense and antisense sequences used were 5′-CCTCTAGATGGAGGCATAGAAATAGCGC-3′ and 5′-AAACAACTTCATAGAAATAGTCG-3′, respectively. PCR amplification was performed at a denaturing temperature of 94°C for 1 min followed by annealing at 37°C for 2 min, and extension was at 72°C for 2 min for a total of 30 cycles. The amplified fragment (1000 base pairs) was separated by electrophoresis with a 0.8% agarose gel and purified by phenol extraction. For sequence confirmation, the purified insert was subcloned into the vector pBS (Stratagene), and its sequence was determined using the version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 1-kilobase fragment was then removed from pBS and blunt-ended by the Klenow fragment, NotI linkers were added, and the fragment was then cloned into a NotI-linearized pOP13CAT vector (Lac Switch Inducible Mammalian Expression System from Stratagene). The resultant plasmid was named Bacterial Sphingomyelinase-13 (BSM-13). To obtain stable transfectants, Molt-4 cells, grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES, were first transfected by electroporation with p3′SS vector (10 μg for 1 × 106 cells in 50 ml) using the Bio-Rad electroporation apparatus. Hygromycin (0.3 mg/ml) was added to the cells 48 h later and maintained as a selective pressure. The expression of the Lac repressor was monitored by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody (Stratagene). Upon obtaining a stable transfectant of the Lac repressor protein, the BSM-13 plasmid was then introduced by electroporation. In addition to hygromycin, selection pressure was further achieved with geneticin (0.2 mg/ml). The expression of the 1-kilobase fragment was examined by Northern blot. Stably transfected cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were rested for 2 h in RPMI containing 2% FBS and 25 mM HEPES prior to the addition of desired concentrations of IPTG. At the indicated times, cells were removed and assayed for viability (by trypan blue exclusion), ceramide content, sphingomyelinase activity and PARP proteolysis. The level of ceramide in the transfected cells was determined by the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay system essentially as described (22Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determining the activity of the neutral, magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase, cells (2 × 107) were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and disrupted by freezing and thawing (three times in methanol-dry ice bath) in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM B-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4°C, and the supernatant (post nuclear homogenate) was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g at 4°C. The resulting pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer. An aliquot of the membrane preparation was incubated for 30 min at 37°C with [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm, 10 nmol) in a mixed micelle assay containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (final volume, 100 μl). The radiolabeled product was extracted as described (3Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the acid sphingomyelinase activity, membranes were prepared from cells using a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The activity of acid sphingomyelinase was determined using a mixed micelle assay containing 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Transfected cells (5 × 106) were pelleted, resuspended in 133 μl of PBS and 23 μl of 5 × SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer, and boiled immediately. 15 μl of the cellular lysate was subjected to electrophoresis with a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blots were performed exactly as described in Ref. 23Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar. We initially set out to evaluate the ability of exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide and to induce apoptosis. Molt-4 leukemia cells were treated with B. cereus sphingomyelinase and evaluated for ceramide generation and for cell death. Fig. 1A shows that exogenously administered sphingomyelinase induced significant increases in cellular ceramide levels. Surprisingly, however, B. cereus sphingomyelinase failed to induce cell death in these cells at concentrations of up to 300 mU/ml and for as long as 24 h (Fig. 1B). Cellular sphingomyelinase activity has been demonstrated to increase in response to inducers of apoptosis and is believed to be the cause of intracellular ceramide generation. Exogenously used bacterial sphingomyelinase, despite causing elevation of ceramide levels, apparently did not induce cell death. Linardic and Hannun have demonstrated that exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase could not reach the so called signaling pool of sphingomyelin, which they suggested was on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (21Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore elected to stably transfect bacterial sphingomyelinase into cells and study its effects on ceramide generation and cell death when it was an integral part of the cell membrane. To do so we harvested genomic DNA from B. cereus and used it as a template to amplify the B. cereus sphingomyelinase gene by the polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides described under “Experimental Procedures.” We then subcloned the gene and sequenced it to demonstrate no PCR-induced mutations. The gene was cloned into the eukaryotic lac-operator-containing vector pOP13CAT from the Lac Switch inducible mammalian expression system (see “Methods”). This vector was then used to transfect Molt-4 cells that had already been stably transfected with the eukaryotic Lac repressor-expressing vector p3′SS. We then showed that sphingomyelinase activity was repressed in the presence of the Lac repressor. Upon induction by IPTG, this repression was removed, and enzyme activity was expressed. Sphingomyelinase activity was significantly increased within 1 h of IPTG treatment and peaked at 250% of control levels by 4 h (Fig. 2A). The induced sphingomyelinase activity was a neutral pH optimum membrane activity and was linear with protein concentration (Fig. 2B). Acidic sphingomyelinase activity did not change upon IPTG induction (Fig. 2C). Concomitant with the increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity, there was an increase in cellular ceramide levels such that ceramide levels were induced by IPTG (Fig. 2D) and were significantly higher than levels in vector transfected cells (Fig. 2E), indicating that they were due to sphingomyelinase induction and not a consequence of IPTG treatment. Because sphingomyelinase activity was increased and cellular ceramide levels were elevated in response to induction of the bacterial sphingomyelinase gene, we next evaluated its biological effects. Fig. 3 demonstrates that as early as 2 h after IPTG induction of sphingomyelinase activity, there was 20% cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion. By 8 h, close to 60% of the cells were unable to exclude trypan blue as compared with less than 10% of vector transfected cells. To demonstrate if the cell death occurring in response to induction of B. cereus sphingomyelinase was apoptotic, we assayed for cleavage of the known death substrate PARP (24Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated that ceramide induces PARP cleavage in Molt-4 cells (23Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), an effect also seen with chemotherapeutic agents and considered as an indicator of apoptosis. Fig. 4 shows that upon ceramide treatment, PARP was cleaved as expected to the characteristic 85-kDa fragment. Exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase (300 mU/ml) treatment failed to induce PARP cleavage. Induction of transfected sphingomyelinase, on the other hand, induced significant cleavage of PARP, such that partial PARP cleavage occurred within 3 h (data not shown), and significant cleavage of PARP was seen by 6 and 15 h of IPTG treatment, implying that this enzyme induces cell death by apoptosis. It is interesting to note that there is a faint base-line cleavage of PARP in transfected cells even before induction by IPTG, indicating that this promoter system is slightly leaky. It has become apparent from several studies that ceramide is sufficient to drive many aspects of cell growth suppression. This is based primarily on studies utilizing short chain ceramide analogues (1Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, 2Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) as well as studies that modulate metabolism of ceramide by inhibitors such as PDMP (12Rani C.S.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or D-MAPP (13Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In our hands, modulating ceramide levels by exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase failed to exert the biologic effects of growth regulation expected from increases in cellular levels of ceramide. This could be due to one of two reasons: first, that ceramide is not sufficient on its own to produce biological effects, or second, that ceramide functions in unique cellular compartments that the exogenous application of bacterial sphingomyelinase does not appear to modulate. Our data demonstrate clearly that bacterial sphingomyelinase, when applied exogenously to cells, fails to induce many of the biologic effects normally seen in association with activation of endogenous sphingomyelinase or induced by cell-permeable ceramides. On the other hand, upon stable transfection of bacterial sphingomyelinase into cells and induction of gene expression, we demonstrate the activation of a functional sphingomyelinase protein and a significant elevation of ceramide levels. Although the levels of ceramide achieved by inducing bacterial sphingomyelinase intracellularly are lower than those achieved by using exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase, it appears that the ceramide generated from transfected sphingomyelinase but not that generated from exogenous sphingomyelinase leads to apoptosis. Interestingly, several studies to date have demonstrated conflicting reports on the ability of exogenously applied bacterial sphingomyelinase to induce cellular effects. For example, Ji et al. have demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase can mimic TNF and C2-ceramide (albeit very modestly) and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a 23-kDa nuclear protein (25Ji L. Zhang G. Hirabayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 489-496Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Raines et al. have demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase can mimic TNFα and induce MAP kinase activation in HL60 cells (20Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sasaki et al. have also demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase induces MAP kinase activity, as does exogenous use of ceramide in NIH 3T3 cells (26Sasaki T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Ul M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, in most studies, exogenous ceramides do not appear to activate MAP kinase and preferentially activate jun kinase (or stress-activated protein kinase) (27Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Santana et al. have shown that bacterial sphingomyelinase as well as exogenous ceramide can partially mimic TNFα action in granulosa cells and cause inhibition of P-450 aromatase activity (28Santana P. Llanes L. Hernandez I. Gallardo G. Quintana J. Gonzalez J. Estevez F. De Galarreta C.R. Fanjul L.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2345-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tamura et al. have demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase can mimic NGF and inhibit neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, but the effects of ceramides were not evaluated (19Tamura H. Noto M. Kinoshita K. Ohkuma S. Ikezawa H. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Riboni et al. have demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase as well as exogenous ceramide can mimic retinoic acid and cause inhibition of cell proliferation, differentiation, and stimulation of neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (29Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Walev et al. have demonstrated only selective cytotoxic effects of bacterial sphingomyelinase on monocytic cells but not on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes (30Walev I. Weller U. Strauch S. Foster T. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2974-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); ceramide effects were also not tested. In our hands bacterial SMase failed to induce apoptosis in U937 cells, a monocytic leukemia cell line. Borchardt et al. demonstrated that bacterial sphingomyelinase caused elevation of ceramide levels but failed to inhibit growth of human T-cells (31Borchardt R.A. Lee W.T. Kalen A. Buckley R.H. Peters C. Schiff S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1994; 1212: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This resembles the failure of bacterial sphingomyelinase to induce growth arrest and cell death that we see. Again, these studies may be due to differential responses of different cell types or due to differential responses of different intracellular pathways to several potential pools of ceramide generation. Clearly there is a difference in cellular responses between exogenously applied bacterial SMase and short chain cell-permeable ceramides, particularly on modulation of growth arrest and apoptosis. There are several implications to these results. First, ceramide generated by activation of transfected sphingomyelinase appears to be sufficient to induce cellular effects of growth suppression. Second, these results support the existence of different intracellular pools of ceramide, such that when cells are treated with bacterial sphingomyelinase, it is able to cleave the sphingomyelin from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, but apparently there remains a part of sphingomyelin that is not accessible to exogenously applied sphingomyelinase. In fact, this is supported by evidence from HL60 cells (21Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in fibroblasts (32Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) where the pool of sphingomyelin that is hydrolyzed in response to inducers (such as vit D3 or TNFα) appears to be on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (or another compartment distinct from the outer leaflet pool of sphingomyelin) and not accessible to exogenous sphingomyelinase. This pool appears to be the signal transducing pool because when sphingomyelinase is transfected into cells, it is able to induce its cellular effects, implying that ceramide is generated intracellularly. If exogenous sphingomyelinase cleaves sphingomyelin and generates ceramide as seen by our data, then how come that ceramide appears to be biologically inactive? Several possibilities emerge. First, it is possible that the ceramide generated in the cell membrane is unable to flip and enter the cell, despite evidence to the contrary (33Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Second, ceramide may be metabolized quickly prior to its reaching the cellular compartment where it performs its biological activity. Third, the molecular species of this ceramide is distinct from the signaling ceramide. Finally, the “signaling” ceramide is generated and is active in a compartment distinct from the plasma membrane or in a specialized compartment within the plasma membrane. Obviously, extensive further investigation is required to sort out these possibilities.

Superoxide anions (O2−2) not only contribute to the localization of NO action by rapid inactivation, but also give rise to the formation of the potentially toxic species peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and other reactive nitrogen oxide species. The chemistry and biological effect of ONOO− depend on the relative rates of formation of NO and O2−2. However, the simultaneous quantification of NO and O2−2 has not been achieved yet due to their high rate of interaction, which is almost diffusion-controlled. A sensitive spectrophotometric assay was developed for the simultaneous quantification of NO and O2−2 in aqueous solution that is based on the NO-induced oxidation of oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) to methemoglobin and the O2−2-mediated reduction of ferricytochrome c Using a photodiode array photometer, spectral changes of either reaction were analyzed, and appropriate wavelengths were identified for the simultaneous monitoring of absorbance changes of the individual reactions. oxyHb oxidation was followed at 541.2 nm (isosbestic wavelength for the conversion of ferri- to ferrocytochrome c), and ferricytochrome c reduction was followed at 465 nm (wavelength at which absorbance changes during oxyHb to methemoglobin conversion were negligible), using 525 nm as the isosbestic point for both reactions. At final concentrations of 20 μM ferricytochrome c and 5 μM oxyHb, the molar extinction coefficients were determined to be ϵ465-525 = 7.3 mM−1 cm−1 and ϵ541.2-525 = 6.6 mM−1 cm−1, respectively. The rates of formation of either NO or O2−2 determined with the combined assay were virtually identical to those measured with the classical oxyhemoglobin and cytochrome c assays, respectively. The assay was successfully adapted to either kinetic or end point determination in a cuvette or continuous on-line measurement of both radicals in a flow-through system. Maximal assay sensitivity was ∼25 nM for NO and O2−2. Cross-reactivity with ONOO− was controlled for by the presence of L-methionine. Generation of NO from the NO donor spermine diazeniumdiolate could be reliably quantified in the presence and absence of low, equimolar, and high flux rates of O2−2. Likewise, O2−2 enzymatically generated from hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase could be specifically quantified with no difference in absolute rates in the presence or absence of concomitant NO generation at different flux rates. Nonenzymatic decomposition of 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (100 μM) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (37°C), was found to be associated with almost stoichiometric production of NO and O2−2 (1.24 μM NO/min and 1.12 μM O2−2/min). Assay selectivity and applicability to biological systems were demonstrated in cultured endothelial cells and isolated aortic tissue using calcium ionophore and NADH for stimulation of NO and O2−2 formation, respectively. Based on these data, a computer model was elaborated that successfully predicts the reaction of NO and O2−2 with hemoprotein and may thus help to further elucidate these reactions. In conclusion, the nitric oxide/superoxide assay allows the specific, sensitive, and simultaneous detection of NO and O2−2. The simulation model developed also allows the reliable prediction of the reaction between NO and O2−2 as well as their kinetic interaction with other biomolecules.

Surprisingly, this protein has no detectable desaturase activity with phytoene, hydroxyneurosporene, or ζ-carotene as substrates, but is rather a β-carotene ketolase that acts asymmetrically introducing a keto group on only one of the two β-ionone rings of β-carotene to generate echinenone.

Carotenoids are pigments that are synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms as essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus (1Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Plant Pigments. Academic Press, London1988: 133-182Google Scholar). They are also synthesized in heterotrophic growing bacteria and fungi. They participate in light collection in photosynthetic organisms and play a protective role against oxidation damage induced by strong oxidants produced in the photosynthetic membranes upon illumination (2Siefermann-Harms D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 69: 561-568Google Scholar). In plants and cyanobacteria, carotenoids are synthesized by a similar pathway, from the C40 precursor phytoene (Fig. 1). Phytoene is converted to ζ-carotene by two sequential desaturations catalyzed by the enzyme phytoene desaturase. ζ-Carotene is further oxidized by ζ-carotene desaturase to give lycopene, which is converted to β-carotene by lycopene cyclase (reviewed in Refs. 3Armstrong G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4795-4802Google Scholar, 4Hirschberg J. Chamovitz D. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1994: 559-579Google Scholar, 5Sandmann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 7-24Google Scholar). Phytoene desaturase from cyanobacteria and plants, which introduce only two double bonds to produce ζ-carotene, have no homology with the bacterial type phytoene desaturases, which introduce three or four double bonds, producing neurosporene or lycopene, respectively (6Sandmann G. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 444-447Google Scholar). Therefore a second enzyme (ζ-carotene desaturase) is required in cyanobacteria and plants for the production of lycopene from ζ-carotene. ζ-Carotene desaturase from plants is homologous to the plant and cyanobacterial type phytoene desaturases (7Albrecht M. Klein A. Hugueney P. Sandmann G. Kuntz M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 199-202Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the only cyanobacterial ζ-carotene desaturase identified, from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, is homologous to the bacterial type phytoene desaturases (8Linden H. Misawa N. Saito T. Sandmann G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 369-379Google Scholar). It has been suggested that plant and bacterial desaturases have independent evolutionary origins and that in cyanobacteria the bacterial type desaturase has been restricted to the last two dehydrogenation steps, while the plant type desaturase took over the function for the first two desaturation steps of phytoene. In Synechocystis no ζ-carotene desaturase has been identified so far. The carotenoid pattern of cyanobacteria is very diverse (4Hirschberg J. Chamovitz D. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1994: 559-579Google Scholar), but cyanobacteria are not able to synthesize α-carotene and its derivatives as well as epoxy carotenoids. In Synechocystis the major carotenoids accumulated are β-carotene, myxoxanthophyll, zeaxanthin, and echinenone (9Bramley P.M. Sandmann G. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2919-2922Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Férez I. Vioque A. Sandmann G. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 48: 185-190Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of those carotenoids is outlined in Fig. 1. None of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of myxoxanthophyll, zeaxanthin, and echinenone from β-carotene has been characterized, nor have their genes been cloned in cyanobacteria. The biosynthesis of zeaxanthin requires an hydroxylase that has been already characterized in some bacteria (11Misawa N. Nakagawa M. Kobayashi K. Yamano S. Izawa Y. Nakamura K. Harashima K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6704-6712Google Scholar, 12Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of myxoxanthophyll requires several unidentified enzymes, and some of them might be equivalent to the ones used in Rhodobacter for the synthesis of spheroidenone (13Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Google Scholar). Synechocystis is one of the very few species that accumulates echinenone in substantial amounts (9Bramley P.M. Sandmann G. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2919-2922Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of echinenone requires a ketolase that attacks only one of the β-rings of β-carotene. Genes coding for β-carotene ketolases were cloned and sequenced from two different bacteria (14Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Satomi Y. Saito T. Miki W. Ohtani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 867-876Google Scholar) and the green alga Haematococcus (15Kajiwara S. Kakizono T. Sato T. Kondo K. Ohtani T. Nishio N. Nagai S. Misawa N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 343-352Google Scholar, 16Lotan T. Hirschberg J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 125-128Google Scholar). However, all these related enzymes catalyze the simultaneous introduction of a keto group into position 4 of every ionone ring at each end of the molecule, yielding the symmetrically di-keto carotenoid canthaxanthin. Echinenone, with only one keto group, is found as a minor intermediate of the reaction (17Yokoyama A. Izumida H. Miki W. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1842-1844Google Scholar, 18Breitenbach J. Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Sandmann G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 241-246Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis genomic sequence (19Kotani H. Tanaka A. Kaneko T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 133-142Google Scholar) an ORF 1The abbreviations used are: ORFopen reading frameHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyμEmicroeinstein. (slr0088) has been found with significant homology to bacterial type carotene desaturases. Because it was possible that this protein was the Synechocystis ζ-carotene desaturase, we decided to undertake the cloning of the corresponding gene and the characterization of its function. Surprisingly slr0088 does not show any desaturase activity, but is rather a β-carotene ketolase that reacts asymmetrically on its substrate. We have demonstrated its function by functional complementation in Escherichia coli, by its in vitro activity, and by inactivation of the corresponding gene in Synechocystis open reading frame high performance liquid chromatography microeinstein. This new β-carotene ketolase from Synechocystis is unrelated in structure to the symmetrically acting ketolases characterized in algae and bacteria and catalyzes a different reaction. Therefore we have named its gene crtO to differentiate it from the symmetrically acting ketolase genes (crtW). All manipulations were performed by standard methods (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the manufacturers. Synechocystis cells were grown in BG11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Google Scholar) and DNA extracted as described (22Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Google Scholar). Southern blot was performed by standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). ORF slr0088 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction based on the available Synechocystis genomic sequence (19Kotani H. Tanaka A. Kaneko T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 133-142Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-AACAGAATCACCACCGATGTTGTC-3′) contains an EcoRI site (underlined) and overlaps the beginning of the coding sequence. The reverse primer (5′-AACAGATTACCAAAAACGACGTTG-3′) contains a BamHI site (underlined) and overlaps the 3′-end of the gene. A polymerase chain reaction product of the expected size was purified and treated with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in the polylinker of pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate plasmid pTRCRT-O. In this plasmid expression of the crtO gene is controlled by the inducible pTrc promoter of the vector. The amino end of the expected recombinant protein has two additional amino acids (MITTD… versus MITTD…). To inactivate the crtO gene, a 1.3-kilobase pair HincII fragment containing a kanamycin resistance gene (npt) from Tn5 (23Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Google Scholar) was used to replace an internal ClaI fragment of the crtO gene. A plasmid with the npt gene inserted in the opposite orientation to the crtO ORF was used to transform Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild type strain and cells were plated on kanamycin-containing plates. Transformants were grown on the same medium for several segregation rounds. Segregation was checked by Southern blot using as a probe an internal BstXI fragment from the crtO gene. Plasmid pTRCRT-O was introduced in E. coli JM101 containing different plasmids depending on the function to be tested (see Table I). Plasmid pACCRT-EB (24Linden H. Misawa N. Chamovitz D. Pecker I. Hirschberg J. Sandmann G. Z. Naturforsch. 1991; 46c: 1045-1051Google Scholar) contains the genes crtE and crtB from Erwinia Cells that carry this plasmid accumulate phytoene. Plasmid pACCRT-EBP (25Linden H. Vioque A. Sandmann G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 106: 99-104Google Scholar) contains the genes crtE and crtB from Erwinia and the crtP gene from Synechococcus, and in plasmid pACCRT-EBIRc the crtP gene is replaced by crtI from Rhodobacter capsulatus (26Raisig A. Bartley G. Scolnik P. Sandmann G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 559-564Google Scholar). Cells that carry these plasmids accumulate ζ-carotene and neurosporene, respectively. Plasmid pACCAR16ΔcrtX (14Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Satomi Y. Saito T. Miki W. Ohtani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 867-876Google Scholar) contains the genes crtE, crtB, crtI, and crtY from Erwinia Cells that carry this plasmid accumulate β-carotene. These four plasmids are all derivatives of vector pACYC184 carrying an origin of replication compatible with the origin of pTRCRT-O. Another vector used for complementation was pRKCRT-C that is derived from pRK404 and carries the crtC gene from R. capsulatus coding for a neurosporene hydratase. The transformants were cultivated at 28°C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml), and/or tetracycline (50 μg/ml) according to the plasmids present. Cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of 2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside before harvesting for carotenoid analysis.Table ICarotenoids accumulated in E. coli in the presence of pTRCRT-O in combination with several plasmids that contain carotenoid biosynthesis genesPlasmid(s)pTRCRT-OCarotenoids accumulatedpACCRT-EB−PhytoenepACCRT-EB+PhytoenepACCRT-EBP−ζ-CarotenepACCRT-EBP+ζ-CarotenepACCRT-EBIRc + pRKCRT-C−HydroxyneurosporenepACCRT-EBIRc + pRKCRT-C+HydroxyneurosporenepACCAR16ΔcrtX−β-CarotenepACCAR16ΔcrtX+Echinenone, canthaxanthin, and β-carotene Open table in a new tab Carotenoids were extracted from freeze-dried E. coli or Synechocystis 6803 cells with methanol containing 6% KOH by heating for 15 min at 60°C. After partitioning into 10% ether in petrol, the upper phase was collected, the solvent wad evaporated, and the residual carotenoids were resuspended in acetone. Separation and quantification of carotenoids were done by HPLC with a Nucleosil-C18 3μ column and acetonitrile/methanol/2-propanol (85:10:5, v/v) as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Spectra were recorded on-line at the elution peaks with a Kontron 440 photodiode array detector. For identification of carotenoids, authentic standards isolated and identified previously (9Bramley P.M. Sandmann G. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2919-2922Google Scholar) were used. Freshly harvested cells of JM101 carrying pCAR16ΔcrtX, which synthesize β-carotene, and of JM101 carrying pTRCRT-O, in which the ketolase gene is expressed, were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and disrupted in a French pressure cell at 95 MPa. Both homogenates were treated with DNase (5 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. One served as a source of substrate and the other as a source of enzyme. The assay consisted of 250 μl of each extract and 2 mM NADPH. Incubation was for 15 h at 30°C. The equivalent to 600 ng of β-carotene was provided by the pCAR16ΔcrtX extract. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 ml of methanol. After heating to 60°C, the carotenoids were extracted and separated by HPLC as described above. Synechocystis 6803 wild type and crtO− strains were cultured at 30°C in BG11 and bubbled with a continuous stream of 1.5% (v/v) CO2 in air under constant illumination (50 μE m−2 s−1). For the crtO− strain, the medium was supplemented with kanamycin to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. When the cultures reached a density of 0.2 absorbance unit at 580 nm, they were divided in two halves, one was maintained at 50 μE m−2 s−1 and the other was illuminated at 250 μE m−2 s−1. Oxygen evolution was periodically determined at 30°C upon irradiation with saturating white light by using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Chlorophyll was determined as described previously (27McKinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Google Scholar). Our interest in the biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids in cyanobacteria led us to identify the genes coding for the enzymes phytoene desaturase (crtP) and phytoene synthase from Synechocystis (28Martínez-Férez I.M. Vioque A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 981-983Google Scholar, 29Martínez-Férez I. Fernández-González B. Sandmann G. Vioque A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 145-152Google Scholar) and ζ-carotene desaturase (crtQ) from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (25Linden H. Vioque A. Sandmann G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 106: 99-104Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis genome data base an ORF (slr0088) with significant homology to bacterial type desaturase (crtI) genes has been identified. As the Anabaena crtQ gene is homologous to crtI rather than to the plant or cyanobacterial crtP genes (8Linden H. Misawa N. Saito T. Sandmann G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 369-379Google Scholar), we decided to explore the possibility that slr0088 was the Synechocystis ζ-carotene desaturase. The open reading frame identified as slr0088 in the Synechocystis genome was cloned by polymerase chain reaction and introduced in an expression vector for E. coli to generate plasmid pTRCRT-O. E. coli cells carrying plasmid pTRCRT-O synthesized a protein of the expected size (59 kDa) (not shown) upon induction with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. To test the function of the expressed protein, plasmid pTRCRT-O was introduced in E. coli in combination with several plasmids that allow the accumulation of different carotenoids (Table I). In E. coli cells that accumulate phytoene (containing pACCRT-EB), 1-hydroxyneurosporene (containing pACCRT-EBIRc and pRKCRT-C), and ζ-carotene (containing pACCRT-EBP), no desaturase activity could be detected when the crtO gene product was expressed. These results suggest that the crtO gene product is not a carotene desaturase, as are the enzymes encoded by crtI and crtD, nor is it related to the ζ-carotene desaturase gene from Anabaena, because no detectable desaturation products from phytoene, ζ-carotene, or 1-hydroxyneurosporene accumulated in E. coli cells that express crtO Alternatively crtO could be a carotene desaturase in Synechocystis that cannot be functionally expressed in E. coli, even though the protein is synthesized or that requires additional cofactors not present in E. coli However, when pTRCRT-O was introduced in E. coli cells that accumulate β-carotene due to the presence of pACCRTΔ16crtX, two additional carotenoids were observed, echinenone and canthaxanthin in lower amounts (Fig. 2). This result indicates that crtO is a β-carotene ketolase. Previously identified β-carotene ketolases produce the accumulation of canthaxanthin with little or none of echinenone. However, crtO produces the accumulation of much higher amounts of echinenone than it does of canthaxanthin. This correlates with the situation in Synechocystis that accumulates echinenone rather than canthaxanthin. We have confirmed the in vivo complementation results by showing that the crtO gene product can synthesize echinenone from β-carotene in vitro Cell homogenates from E. coli cells that express crtO can convert β-carotene to echinenone at a conversion rate of 12% in the presence of NADPH (Table II). Some formation of the di-keto derivative canthaxanthin (2% conversion) was also observed. This indicates that the specificity for β-carotene of the crude enzyme is not absolute. The reaction products echinenone and canthaxanthin were positively identified not only by co-chromatography with authentic standards but also by their absorbance spectra (Fig. 3). NADPH was required for activity.Table IIIn vitro conversion of β-carotene by homogenates from E. coli cells expressing crtOExtractsCarotenoid composition after reactionβ-CaroteneEchinenoneCanthaxanthinngpACCARΔ16crtX51000pACCARΔ16crtX + pTRCRT-O429629 Open table in a new tab To test the function of crtO in Synechocystis, we have inactivated the crtO gene by insertion of a kanamycin resistance casette (Fig. 4A). The inactivated copy of crtO could be completely segregated as tested by Southern blot (Fig. 4B), and cells lacking a functional crtO gene seem to be viable. The carotenoid composition of the crtO-deficient strain (crtO−) was compared with that of wild type Synechocystis (Fig. 5). Myxoxanthophyll, zeaxanthin, echinenone, and β-carotene were the main carotenoids identified in the wild type strain. In the mutant strain echinenone was absent, while there were wild type levels of the other carotenoids. No canthaxanthin was detected either in the wild type or in the crtO− strain, even when a different HPLC system optimized for the separation of canthaxanthin from zeaxanthin (18Breitenbach J. Misawa N. Kajiwara S. Sandmann G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 241-246Google Scholar) was used. This result indicates that crtO is required for echinenone biosynthesis in Synechocystis and, together with the previous results, clearly demonstrates that crtO is a β-carotene ketolase that acts asymmetrically to produce echinenone as the main product rather that of canthaxanthin.Fig. 5The crtO gene is required for echinenone biosynthesis in Synechocystis HPLC analysis of carotenoids pigments extracted from Synechocystis 6803 wild type strain (A) or crtO− strain (B). The carotenoids identified were myxoxanthophyll (1), zeaxanthin (2), β-cryptoxanthin (3), echinenone (4), and β-carotene (5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The previously described results show that we have been able to completely segregate a strain lacking crtO, and that this strain is deficient in echinenone biosynthesis. To study what could be the functional role of echinenone, we have analyzed the behavior of the crtO− strain when incubated under either low (50 μE m−2 s−1) or high (250 μE m−2 s−1) light intensity. Both wild type and crtO− strains have similar growth rates at low and at high light intensity. The photosynthetic rate (as measured by O2 evolution) of the crtO− strain is also similar to that of wild type at either low or high light intensity. Therefore incubation at high light intensity does not reveal any significant differences between both strains regarding the measured parameters. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is the organism of choice for genetical studies. It is naturally transformable, and genes can be easily inactivated by targeting and homologous recombination. Furthermore, the complete sequence of the Synechocystis genome is available (30Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Google Scholar). Several genes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway have been identified in Synechocystis The availability of the complete genome sequence gives us the opportunity to search for the so far unidentified genes of this pathway in a rational way. Among the open reading frames present in the Synechocystis genome, there is one with significant homology to bacterial type phytoene desaturases (slr0088). The only cyanobacterial ζ-carotene desaturase characterized so far is homologous to bacterial phytoene desaturases rather than to plant type phytoene desaturases, therefore it was reasonable to expect slr0088 to be the Synechocystis ζ-carotene desaturase. The results presented in this work clearly indicate that slr0088 is a β-carotene ketolase. This fact illustrates the risk of assuming functions for unknown ORFs based solely on weak homologies and indicates that functional studies are required to confirm the role of the expected protein product. The Synechocystis mutant strain lacking crtO does not accumulate echinenone, but has normal levels of β-carotene. Therefore crtO is not required for the desaturation steps necessary to produce β-carotene, excluding that crtO is the functional ζ-carotene desaturase in Synechocystis It should be noted that crtO is closely linked and in the same orientation as several other genes, possibly organized as an operon. Therefore inactivation of crtO could affect the expression of these other genes that could account for the phenotype observed. However, the function of those other genes is hypothetically unrelated to carotenoid biosynthesis (as deduced from sequence homologies), and some of them are expected to be essential. In any case a polar effect on genes placed downstream of crtO could not account for the in vitro activity of the crtO gene product and the complementation observed in E. coli As the plot in Fig. 6 clearly shows, crtO is homologous to bacterial type phytoene desaturases as exemplified by the Erwinia herbicola enzyme. The mechanism of carotene ketolases is not known in detail, but the symmetrically acting enzyme is most likely a dioxygenase. 2P. D. Fraser, University of London, personal communication. Although the in vitro formation of echinenone by the crtO-derived ketolase was carried out in cell homogenates, a dependence of the reaction on NADPH was observed. This may be an indication for a different reaction mechanism responsible for the introduction of the keto group, involving a monooxygenase-type of hydroxylation followed by dehydrogenation. crtO contains a nucleotide binding site at the amino end similar to the one in phytoene desaturases. This is most likely the site for the binding of the cofactor NADPH. The three symmetrically acting β-carotene ketolases characterized so far, two from bacteria and one from a green algae, are homologous among themselves. They can be aligned, and four conserved regions have been identified (15Kajiwara S. Kakizono T. Sato T. Kondo K. Ohtani T. Nishio N. Nagai S. Misawa N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 343-352Google Scholar). They do not contain a nucleotide binding site at their amino end. We have tried to identify in crtO regions of similarity with any of the four conserved domains in ketolases but there are no significant similarities (Fig. 6). Therefore crtO is a completely different enzyme, phylogenetically related to carotene desaturases rather than to ketolases. In addition crtO has also a different mechanism of substrate recognition, acting asymmetrically on β-carotene to introduce a keto group on only one of the β-ionone rings. In other words, crtO can use as substrate mainly β-carotene but echinenone very poorly. The previously identified β-carotene ketolases do not produce the accumulation of significant amounts of echinenone. When crtO is expressed in E. coli, about 10% of the ketocarotenoid produced is canthaxanthin. Therefore crtO has not a strict specificity for β-carotene but can, at a low rate, introduce a keto group in the second ionone ring of echinenone to generate canthaxanthin. However, this effect is due to the high level expression of the ketolase and is restricted to the heterologous environment in E. coli, because no significant canthaxanthin accumulation is seen in Synechocystis The availability of a Synechocystis mutant strain deficient in the biosynthesis of echinenone will allow the study of the function of this carotenoid. It has been suggested that echinenone is located close to the reaction centers in the thylakoid membrane in a related cyanobacterium (31Nonnengiesser K. Schuster A. Koenig F. Bot. Acta. 1996; 109: 105-124Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that the absence of echinenone has no effect on the growth rate or photosynthetic oxygen evolution at either low or high light. The specific role of echinenone in Synechocystis will require further investigation. Carotene ketolases and their genes are of significant biotechnological interest for the production of carotenoids of commercial interest (32Nelis H.J. De Leenheer A.P. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1991; 70: 181-191Google Scholar). The new β-carotene ketolase described here has a different substrate specificity of the previously known ketolases and therefore provides additional flexibility in the design of biotechnological procedures for the production of carotenoids of potential applied interest. The Synechocystis β-carotene ketolase could be useful for engineering of the biosynthesis of not only echinenone, but also other asymmetric carotenoids such as 3-hydroxyechinenone, 3′-hydroxyechinenone, and adonixanthin when expressed in combination with a carotenoid hydroxylase gene (crtZ)."
https://openalex.org/W1975242912,"Prolonged (>24 h) exposure to anti-IgM (an antigen surrogate that induces membrane cross-linking and apoptosis) induced a 3-fold increase in the mass of endogenous ceramide measured by <sup>32</sup>P labeling by diacylglycerol kinase and a 4-fold increase in ceramide as measured by metabolic labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitate in a B-lymphocyte cell line, WEHI 231. This correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Shorter exposure times to anti-IgM (up to 8 h) failed to elicit apoptosis and did not elicit increased ceramide formation. After 8 h, apoptosis occurs concomitantly with ceramide formation over the next 40 h. Further, we showed that exogenous ceramide mimicked anti-IgM-induced apoptosis and that apoptosis was potentiated in serum-free media. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of ceramide catabolism, <i>N</i>-oleoylethanolamine, increased both ceramide formation and apoptosis and accelerated apoptosis induced by anti-IgM. To examine further how ceramide metabolism is involved in apoptosis, we derived cell lines from a small population of cells resistant to <i>N</i>-oleoylethanolamine. These cell lines were selected based on an altered ceramide metabolic pathway, were resistant to apoptosis induced by anti-IgM, and showed no significant increase in ceramide when challenged with anti-IgM. The basis of this resistance was shown to be the failure to activate neutral sphingomyelinase activity following 24-h treatment with anti-IgM, in contrast to the 2-fold increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity observed in wild type cells. We have shown previously that transfection of WEHI cells with bcl-x<sub>L</sub> conferred resistance to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, whereas transfection with bcl-2 did not (Gottschalk, A., Boise, L., Thompson, C., and Quintans, J. (1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A</i> 91, 7350-7354). In this study, these bcl-x<sub>L</sub> transfectants also displayed increased resistance to exogenous <i>N</i>-acetylsphingosine (C<sub>2</sub>-ceramide) or <i>N</i>-hexanoylsphingosine (C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide). However, when challenged with anti-IgM the bcl-x<sub>L</sub> transfectants produced levels of ceramide similar to wild type cells, suggesting that ceramide formation is upstream of bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and that it is a major determinant of B-cell death."

Deletion of the first 29 amino acids of AL1 abolished DNA binding and DNA cleavage, demonstrating that an intact N terminus is required for both activities.

Bisaro D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8029-8033Google Scholar, 3Stanley J. Virology. 1995; 206: 707-712Google Scholar, 4Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 605-615Google Scholar). These properties make geminiviruses unusual among plant viruses, most of which have RNA genomes and/or replication intermediates. Geminiviruses encode only a few proteins for their replication and depend on the host DNA replication machinery. Thus, geminiviruses represent excellent model systems for studying DNA replication mechanisms in plant cells. Geminivirus genomes consist of either one or two circular DNA components. Each component contains divergent transcription units separated by a 5′-intergenic region. The intergenic region of all geminiviruses includes a hairpin motif with a conserved AT-rich loop sequence that contains the initiation site for (+) strand DNA replication (3Stanley J. Virology. 1995; 206: 707-712Google Scholar, 5Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Kammann M. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4445-4452Google Scholar, 6Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V.

A directly repeated sequence upstream from the hairpin is bound by the viral replication protein AL1 and is required for virus-specific DNA replication (8Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 405-416Google Scholar) of tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) 1The abbreviations used are: TGMVtomato golden mosaic virusBGMVbean golden mosaic virusTYLCVtomato yellow leaf curl virusGSTglutathione S-transferaseACMVAfrican cassava mosaic virus. and bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV). Similar motifs are found in a number of related geminivirus genomes (9Arguello-Astorga G.R. Guevara-Gonzalez R.G. Herrera-Estrella L.R. Rivera-Bustamante R.F. Virology. 1994; 203: 90-100Google Scholar), but their functional significance is not known. AL1 is the only viral protein required for replication of all geminiviruses (10Elmer J.S. Sunter G. Gardiner W.E. Brand L. Browning C.K. Bisaro D.M. Rogers S.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 225-234Google Scholar, 11Hanley-Bowdoin L. Elmer J.S. Rogers S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1446-1450Google Scholar). (For some geminiviruses, the AL1 homologue is designated C1.) Many geminiviruses also encode a second protein, AL3, which greatly enhances replication (10Elmer J.S. Sunter G. Gardiner W.E. Brand L. Browning C.K. Bisaro D.M. Rogers S.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 225-234Google Scholar, 12Sunter G. Hartitz M.D. Hormuzdi S.G. Brough C.L. Bisaro D.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 69-77Google Scholar). tomato golden mosaic virus bean golden mosaic virus tomato yellow leaf curl virus glutathione S-transferase African cassava mosaic virus. The AL1 protein plays key roles in viral DNA replication and transcription. AL1 confers virus-specific recognition of its cognate origin of replication (8Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 405-416Google Scholar) and initiates (+) strand DNA replication (6Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Rogers S.G. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3879-3883Google Scholar, 7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar). It represses its own expression at the level of transcription (13Eagle P.A. Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1157-1170Google Scholar) and can enhance transcription of late genes of some geminiviruses (14Hofer J.M.I. Dekker E.L. Reynolds H.V. Woolston C.J. Cox B.S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 213-223Google Scholar). In addition, AL1 induces expression of a host DNA synthesis protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, in nondividing plant cells (15Nagar S. Pedersen T.J. Carrick K. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Robertson D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 705-719Google Scholar). Multiple biochemical activities have been described for AL1/C1 proteins. The AL1 proteins of TGMV and BGMV bind double-stranded viral DNA in a site- and virus-specific manner (16Fontes E.P.B. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 597-608Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA binding activity has also been reported for TGMV AL1 (17Thommes P. Osman T.A.M. Hayes R.J. Buck K.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 95-99Google Scholar). The AL1/C1 proteins from tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), wheat dwarf virus, and TGMV cleave the (+) DNA strand in the conserved loop sequence of the hairpin (6Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Rogers S.G. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3879-3883Google Scholar, 7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking of TYLCV C1 to the 5′-end of the cleaved DNA has also been detected (6Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Rogers S.G. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3879-3883Google Scholar). In addition, ATP and GTPase activity has been demonstrated for TYLCV C1 (18Desbiez C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5640-5644Google Scholar). Last, multiple protein interactions have been detected for AL1/C1 proteins. TGMV AL1 interacts with itself, AL3, and RRB1, a maize retinoblastoma homologue (19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). 2R. A., Ach, T. Durfee, A. B. Miller, P. Taranto, L. Hanley-Bowdoin, P. C. Zambriski, and W. Gruissem, submitted for publication. Interactions between wheat dwarf virus C1 and retinoblastoma proteins from human and maize have also been reported (21Xie Q. Suarezlopez P. Gutierrez C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4073-4082Google Scholar, 22Collin S. Fernandezlobato M. Gooding P.S. Mullineaux P.M. Fenoll C. Virology. 1996; 219: 324-329Google Scholar, 23Grafi G. Burnett R.J. Helentjaris T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4900-4908Google Scholar). Recent experiments have begun to identify the functional domains of AL1. The first 211 amino acids of TYLCV C1 are sufficient to confer site-specific DNA cleavage in vitro (25Heyraud-Nitschke F. Schumacher S. Laufs J. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 910-916Google Scholar). This region contains three amino acid motifs that are conserved among all geminivirus AL1/C1 proteins and many rolling circle initiator proteins from other systems (26Koonin E.V. Ilyina T.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2763-2766Google Scholar, 27Ilyina T.V. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3279-3285Google Scholar). The third motif includes a conserved tyrosine residue that functions in the DNA cleavage and joining reaction and mediates covalent linkage to the 5′-end of nicked DNA (28Laufs J. Schumacher S. Geisler N. Jupin I. Gronenborn B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 258-262Google Scholar). The C terminus of AL1/C1 contains a fourth conserved motif, a P-loop, that is found in many NTP binding proteins (29Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8413-8440Google Scholar). Mutation of a lysine residue in the P-loop of TYLCV C1 reduced or abolished ATPase activity of the protein (18Desbiez C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5640-5644Google Scholar, 30Hanson S.F. Hoogstraten R.A. Ahlquist P. Gilbertson R.L. Russell D.R. Maxwell D.P. Virology. 1995; 211: 1-9Google Scholar). Mutations in the third DNA cleavage motif and the NTP binding sequence also interfered with geminivirus replication in vivo (18Desbiez C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5640-5644Google Scholar, 30Hanson S.F. Hoogstraten R.A. Ahlquist P. Gilbertson R.L. Russell D.R. Maxwell D.P. Virology. 1995; 211: 1-9Google Scholar). Genetic experiments using chimeric AL1 proteins mapped virus-specific origin recognition to the N-terminal third of AL1/C1 in TYLCV (31Jupin I. Hericourt F. Benz B. Gronenborn B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 116-120Google Scholar), beet curly top virus (32Choi I.R. Stenger D.C. Virology. 1995; 206: 904-912Google Scholar), TGMV, and BGMV. 3H. J. Gladfelter, P. A. Eagle, E. P. B. Fontes, and L. Hanley-Bowdoin, manuscript in preparation. However, the chimeric studies with TGMV and BGMV showed that interaction between the N terminus of AL1 and the cognate DNA binding motif is only part of the requirements for virus-specific origin recognition in vivo No biochemical studies have addressed the protein domain involved in AL1-DNA binding. There is also no information regarding the various AL1 protein-protein interaction domains. In this article, we identified the domains of TGMV AL1 that mediate protein oligomerization, DNA binding, and DNA cleavage. Coding sequences corresponding to authentic AL1 and AL1 fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) domain were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pMON27025 (7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar) for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells. The recombinant proteins were named according to their N- and C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1). For example, AL11-120 includes AL1 amino acids 1-120. The baculovirus expression vectors encoding GST (pNSB313), GST-AL11-352 (pNSB314), and authentic AL11-352 (pNSB244) have been described previously (7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar, 33Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Google Scholar). Open reading frames for C-terminal truncated AL1 proteins (Fig. 1A) were generated by inserting an XbaI linker into repaired restriction sites at TGMV A positions 2242 (SalI), 2059 (NcoI), and 1963 (EagI) to create in-frame stop codons. Truncated AL1 open reading frames were subcloned as BglII-HindIII fragments into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pMON27025 to give pNSB388 (AL11-120), pNSB517 (AL11-181), and pNSB392 (AL11-213). Plasmid pNSB310 was digested with SacI-SmaI and trimmed with T4 DNA polymerase to release a 699-base pair fragment containing the GST coding sequence. Baculovirus expression cassettes corresponding to GST-AL1 fusion proteins (Fig. 1B) were generated by cloning this fragment into filled NdeI sites of pNSB388, pNSB517, and pNSB392 to give pNSB534 (GST-AL11-120), pNSB547 (GST-AL11-181), and pNSB535 (GST-AL11-213), respectively. Coding sequences for N-terminal truncated AL1 proteins (Fig. 1A) were constructed by inserting an SphI linker into repaired restriction sites at TGMV A positions 2442 (SalI) and 2059 (NcoI) to create in-frame start codons. An SphI linker was also inserted into a repaired HindIII site of pMON27025 to make pNSB448. The truncated AL1 open reading frames were subcloned as SphI-EcoRI and SphI-BamHI fragments into the same sites of pNSB448 to give pNSB516 (AL1121-352) and pNSB469 (AL1182-352), respectively. Engineered restriction sites and an endogenous NcoI site at TGMV A position 2059 were used to create open reading frames for GST-AL1 fusion proteins lacking N-terminal AL1 sequences. The AL1 coding sequence was modified at TGMV A positions 2516-2517 using the primer 5′-GTAATTGAGAAAGTACTTCTTCTTTGGAC to introduce an ScaI site and create pNSB162 (34Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). A BstBI site was also introduced in the AL1 coding sequence by mutating TGMV A position 2404 using the primer 5′-GGCAGCAGTATTTTCCTTCGAACTGAATAAGC to make pNSB428. The ScaI-BamHI and BstBI-BamHI fragments from pNSB162 and pNSB428, respectively, were repaired with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) and fused in frame with the GST coding region of pNSB314 at an SmaI site. The resulting plasmids encoded GST-AL1 121-352 (pNSB564) and GST-AL166-352 (pNSB563). A trimmed SacI-SmaI fragment from pNSB310 containing the GST coding region was inserted into a repaired NdeI site of pNSB516 to give pNSB547, encoding GST-AL1182-352. Recombinant proteins were produced in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system according to published protocols (7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar, 19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). The GST-AL1 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar) and analyzed in vitro for various AL1 activities. Aliquots (3 μg) of the purified proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Protein extracts from Sf9 insect cells co-expressing authentic and GST-AL1 fusion proteins were also assayed for AL1 oligomerization by co-purification on glutathione-Sepharose (19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). Co-purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotting using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-AL1 antisera (19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). The relative molecular masses of full-length AL1 (AL11-352) and the C-terminal truncated proteins AL11-120 and AL11-181 were determined by size exclusion chromatography of extracts from insect cells infected with the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses. Extracts were prepared by mixing cells for 30 min at 4°C in column buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g Approximately 0.2 mg of protein (1 mg/mL) was applied to a 50 × 1-cm column of Sepharose CL-6B in column buffer, chromatographed at 0.2 ml/min, and eluted as 0.5-ml fractions. To determine the elution positions of the various AL1 proteins, 75 μl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-AL1 serum as described above. The column was calibrated with protein molecular weight markers (Sigma) individually diluted with column buffer. Ve values of protein standards were determined by monitoring the column effluent at A280. The V0 was determined from the elution volume of blue dextran. Relative molecular masses of AL1 proteins were estimated from linear regression analysis of Ve/V0 versus the logarithm of the molecular masses of the protein standards. DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNA cleavage assays were performed as described previously (7Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Google Scholar). For the binding assays, an 83-base pair EcoRI fragment containing the AL1-DNA binding motif (TGMV A positions 28-84) was isolated from pNSB378 and 3′-end-labeled using Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. The radiolabeled DNA was incubated with purified GST-AL1 fusion proteins for 1 h at room temperature. DNA and protein concentrations are provided in the figure legends. The bound and free probes were resolved on 1% agarose gels, dried on Whatman DE-81 paper, and analyzed by autoradiography. For DNA cleavage assays, a single-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTAATATTACCGGATGGCCGC) corresponding to the loop and right side of the hairpin structure in the TGMV (+) strand origin was 5′-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 5000 cpm of labeled DNA was incubated with 100 ng of purified GST-AL1 fusion protein in 10 μl of cleavage buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, and 2.5 mM dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by adding 6 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and heating to 90°C for 2 min. The reaction products were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. ATPase assays were performed essentially as described by Desbiez et al. (18Desbiez C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5640-5644Google Scholar). Approximately 300 ng of GST-AL1 fusion proteins were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 40 μM ATP, and 110 fmol [γ-32P]ATP. Free phosphate was extracted and measured according to the protocol described by Seto-Young and Perlin (35Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1383-1389Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction was stopped with 3 volume of 5% ammonium molybdate in 2 N SH2O4, and free phosphate was extracted with an equal volume of N-butanol. Radioactivity in a 50-μl aliquot was measured by liquid scintillation. Recent experiments showed that TGMV AL1 interacts with itself to form a multimeric complex (19Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Google Scholar). To map the AL1 oligomerization domain, we generated a series of truncated AL1 proteins (Fig. 1A) and assayed their ability to interact with a full-length AL1 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-AL11-352; Fig. 1B). The GST-AL11-352 and truncated AL1 proteins were co-expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and GST-AL11-352 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose resin. Total protein extracts from insect cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1-7) and proteins bound to glutathione resin (lanes 8-14) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by immunoblotting using antibodies against AL1 and GST. Full-length AL1 (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 8) and the C-terminal truncations AL11-213 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 9) and AL11-181 (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 10) co-purified with GST-AL11-352. However, further deletion to amino acid 120 in AL11-120 (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 11) abolished complex formation. Similarly, the N-terminal truncation AL1121-352 (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 12), co-purified with GST-AL11-352, whereas AL1182-352 (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 13) did not interact with GST-AL11-352. AL11-352 did not bind GST alone (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 14), establishing the specificity of AL1-AL1 protein interactions in this experiment. Together, these results located the AL1 oligomerization domain between amino acids 121 and 181. AL1 oligomerization was further examined by size exclusion chromatography through Sepharose CL-6B. The chromatographic properties of AL11-352 and AL11-181, both of which are predicted to oligomerize, were compared with those of AL11-120, which lacks the oligomerization domain. The column was calibrated with seven globular proteins of known molecular masses from 12.4 to 660 kDa. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a linear relationship between the elution volumes of the protein standards and the logarithms of their reported molecular masses. Immunoblot analysis indicated that AL11-352, AL11-181, and AL11-120 eluted with apparent molecular masses of 318, 156, and 13.7 kDa (Fig. 2B), respectively, whereas their predicted monomeric molecular masses are 40.5, 20.8, and 14.0 kDa. Thus, the elution profiles of AL11-352 and AL11-181 demonstrated that they form large protein complexes but that AL11-120 occurs as a monomer in solution, corroborating the glutathione affinity chromatography data (Fig. 2A). AL1 binds specifically to a directly repeated DNA sequence in the 5′-intergenic region of the TGMV genome (8Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 405-416Google Scholar, 33Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Google Scholar). We used purified GST fusion proteins truncated at AL1 amino acids 213, 181, and 120 (Fig. 1B) to map the C-terminal boundary of the AL1-DNA binding domain in vitro GST-AL11-352, the GST-AL1 truncations, or GST alone were expressed in insect cells and purified by binding to glutathione resin. The affinity-purified proteins were pure or highly enriched, as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3, lanes 1-5). The GST-AL1 proteins were tested for DNA binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays by titrating in a radiolabeled DNA fragment (TGMV A positions 28-84) that included the AL1 binding site, 5′GGTAGTAAGGTAG. Shifted complexes were observed with full-length GST-AL11-352 (Fig. 4A) and with the C-terminal truncated proteins GST-AL11-213 (Fig. 4B) and GST-AL11-181 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, no DNA binding was detected for GST-AL11-120 (Fig. 4D). Together, these results located the C-terminal boundary of the AL1-DNA binding domain between amino acids 121 and 181. These experiments uncovered two interesting aspects of AL1/DNA binding. First, full-length GST-AL11-352 (Fig. 4A) required nearly 4-fold more protein than GST-AL11-213 (Fig. 4B) and GST-AL11-181 (Fig. 4C) to show equivalent levels of DNA binding. Hence, the presence of AL1 amino acids 214-352 interfered with the efficiency of DNA binding. Second, the protein-DNA complexes formed by the truncated GST-AL1 proteins displayed only slightly increased mobilities in agarose gels (cf. Fig. 4, A-C) relative to complexes containing full-length GST-AL11-352. The small differences in mobility observed with agarose gels may reflect the large size of the AL1/DNA complexes demonstrated in Fig. 2B The N-terminal boundary of the AL1-DNA binding domain was mapped in vitro using GST-AL129-352 and GST-AL166-352 (Fig. 1B), which lacked the first 28 or 65 amino acids of AL1, respectively. GST-AL129-352 and GST-AL166-352 were each expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified using glutathione affinity chromatography. The glutathione-eluted proteins were pure or highly enriched, as shown by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). GST-AL11-352 (Fig. 3, lane 6) was co-electrophoresed for size comparison. The DNA binding activities of purified GST-AL11-352, GST-AL129-352, and GST-AL166-352 were compared using three concentrations of a radiolabeled TGMV A DNA fragment (positions 28-84) containing the AL1 binding site. Although shifted bands were readily detected for GST-AL11-352 at all three probe concentrations (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3), no bound DNA was observed for either GST-AL129-352 (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6) or GST-AL166-352 (Fig. 5A, lanes 7-9) under any reaction conditions. These results demonstrated that sequences within the first 28 amino acids of AL1 are essential for protein-DNA interaction. GST-AL129-352 and GST-AL166-352 were also analyzed for their ability to interact with authentic AL11-352 (Fig. 5B) to verify that the truncated proteins were properly folded and functional. The truncated GST-AL1 proteins were co-expressed with authentic AL1 in insect cells, extracted (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-4), and bound to glutathione resin (Fig. 5B, lanes 5-8). Immunoblot analysis showed that authentic AL11-352 co-purified with both GST-AL129-352 (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 6) and GST-AL166-352 (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 7), demonstrating AL1 oligomerization with the truncated proteins. Co-purification of AL11-352 with GST-AL11-352 (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 5) and GST (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 8) were analyzed in parallel as positive and negative controls, respectively, for specificity of interaction. Together, these results established that GST-AL129-352 (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 6) and GST-AL166-352 are competent for AL1 interaction but deficient for DNA binding. Thus, the functional domain for DNA binding is located between amino acids 1 and 181 and overlaps the AL1 oligomerization domain between amino acids 121 and 181. TGMV AL1 catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage of the (+) strand origin of replication. The truncated GST-AL1 fusion proteins were used to map the boundaries of the DNA cleavage domain. A radiolabeled, single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the origin nick site (TGMV A positions 129-151) was incubated with full-length GST-AL11-352 and GST fusions lacking AL1 C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 6A). The mobility of a marker corresponding to the cleavage product is shown (Fig. 6A, lane 7). Cleavage products were detected for GST-AL11-352 (Fig. 6A, lane 1), GST-AL11-213 (Fig. 6A, lane 2), GST-AL11-181 (Fig. 6A, lane 3), and GST-AL11-120 (Fig. 6A, lane 4). No cleavage product was seen with GST alone (Fig. 6A, lane 5) or in the absence of protein (Fig. 6A, lane 6), indicating that the nicking activity was specific to AL1. These results showed that the DNA cleavage domain of TGMV AL1 is in the first 120 amino acids of the protein, and that GST-AL11-120 was folded correctly and functional. Although GST-AL11-213 and GST-AL11-181 formed AL1 oligomers and bound DNA, neither activity was detected for GST-AL11-120 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). However, because GST-AL11-120 cleaved DNA, the loss of DNA and AL1 interactions can be attributed to deletion of essential amino acids for this activity and not to protein misfolding. The endonucleolytic activity of GST-AL11-120 also demonstrated that AL1 oligomerization is not required for DNA cleavage. Three amino acid motifs proposed to be part of the DNA cleavage domain are conserved in the N termini of geminivirus AL1/C1 proteins (Fig. 1A) and in the initiator proteins from other rolling circle replication systems (26Koonin E.V. Ilyina T.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2763-2766Google Scholar). GST-AL129-352, GST-AL166-352, and GST-AL1182-352, which sequentially delete each motif, were assayed for DNA cleavage activity (Fig. 6B). GST-AL11-352 specifically cleaved DNA containing the origin nick site (Fig. 6B, lane 1), whereas all three truncated proteins were deficient for DNA cleavage activity (Fig. 6B, lanes 2-4). Purified GST alone did not cleave DNA (Fig. 6B, lane 5), indicating that the product resulted specifically from AL1 activity. These results demonstrated that sequences in the first 28 amino acids of AL1, which contain motif I, are essential for DNA cleavage. The N-terminal truncation, GST-AL1182-352, was deficient for AL1-AL1 interaction and DNA cleavage and did not contain the domain responsible for DNA binding. To verify that GST-AL1182-352 was properly folded, we assayed for ATP hydroly"

Cyanobacteria, algae, and plants synthesize the well characterized Mg-tetrapyrrole chlorophyll a, whereas many anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria synthesize a related, but more reduced derivative known as bacteriochlorophyll a Analysis of Mg-tetrapyrrole intermediates that accumulate in various mutant strains of photosynthetic bacteria and algae have given rise to our current understanding of these pathways (1Bauer C.E. Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3919-3925Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1, both pathways utilize common intermediates from 5-aminolevulinate via Mg-protoporphyrin IX to chlorophyllide a At this point, these pathways diverge, with the final step of chlorophyll a synthesis accomplished by the enzyme chlorophyll synthase, which catalyzes esterification of chlorophyllide a with phytyl diphosphate in green plants and with geranylgeranyl diphosphate in greening etiolated seedlings (2Rüdiger W. Schoch S. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 451-463Google Scholar, 3Rüdiger W. Sundqvist C. Ryberg M. Pigment-Protein Complexes in Plastids: Synthesis and Assembly. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 219-240Google Scholar). Esterification is a precondition for stabilization of apoproteins and for accumulation of chlorophyll-protein complexes (4Eichacker L.A. Soll J. Lauterbach P. Rüdiger W. Klein R.R. Mullet J.E. J.

The bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthetic pathway is more complex, involving a multistep modification of the chlorophyllide a ring, giving rise to a more reduced structure known as bacteriochlorophyllide a (1Bauer C.E. Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3919-3925Google Scholar, 6Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowlski J. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Google Scholar). The final step of the bacteriochlorophyll a pathway involves esterification of bacteriochlorophyllide a catalyzed by the enzyme bacteriochlorophyll synthase (7Bollivar D.W. Wang S. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar). Bacteriochlorophyll a in most photosynthetic bacteria is esterified with phytol, but in some species, it contains geranylgeraniol instead (2Rüdiger W. Schoch S. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 451-463Google Scholar). Since the bacteriochlorophyll esterification reaction has not been previously carried out in vitro, it has not been determined whether the diphosphate derivatives of the respective alcohols are the true substrates in bacteria. Genetic studies on pigment biosynthesis in Rhodobacter capsulatus initially revealed the presence of a cluster of genes involved in bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Bauer C.E.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1082-1106Google Scholar). The roles of specific open reading frames in bacteriochlorophyll synthesis were determined by the construction of a defined set of interposon insertion mutations in sequenced open reading frames (6Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowlski J. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Google Scholar, 7Bollivar D.W. Wang S. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar) resulted in the accumulation of bacteriochlorophyllide a, indicating that orf304 (bchG) may encode for the enzyme bacteriochlorophyll a synthase, which is responsible for esterification of bacteriochlorophyllide with phytol. However, direct proof that bchG codes for a polypeptide that exhibits bacteriochlorophyll synthase activity has not been obtained. In this study, we heterologously expressed the R. capsulatus bchG gene product in Escherichia coli and demonstrate that assayable bacteriochlorophyll a synthase activity is present in cell-free extracts. We also cloned and overexpressed a bchG homolog (chlG) that was recently identified in the Synechocystis genome sequencing project (10Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Google Scholar, 11Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T.

Expression of the chlG gene product resulted in assayable chlorophyll synthase activity in E. coli extracts. These results conclusively demonstrate that the bchG and chlG genes do indeed code for bacteriochlorophyll and chlorophyll synthases, respectively. Overexpression of chlG and bchG was accomplished using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system described by Studier et al. (12Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). A chlG expression plasmid was constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. amplification of the sequenced chlG gene from Synechocystis sp.

Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA for use as a PCR template was isolated from lysed Synechocystis cells as described by Williams (13Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-CCTCTGACACACAAAATACCG) was designed to contain an NdeI restriction site (underlined) at the chlG translation start site. The reverse primer (5′-CGTTCAAATCCCCGCATGGCC) was designed to contain a BamHI restriction site (underlined) downstream from the end of the chlG open reading frame. PCR conditions were as follows: 10 mM Tricine buffer (14Ponce M.R. Micol J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 623Google Scholar), 0.3 mM dATP, 0.3 mM dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP, 0.3 mM dCTP, 20 μM forward primer, 20 μM reverse primer, and 1 μg of genomic chromosomal DNA. The PCR buffer cycle (PTC-100 programmable thermal controller, MJ Research, Inc.) was initiated with a “hot start,” which involved preincubation of the PCR buffer at 98°C for 4 min, followed by a reduction of reaction temperature to 80°C, at which point 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase were added to the reaction buffer. PCR amplification subsequently involved 30 cycles of 98°C for 45 s, 65°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The DNA segments were then blunt-ended by a 20-min incubation period at 65°C. The PCR-amplified chlG gene was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the PCR cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The chlG gene was then subsequently subcloned as an NdeI-BamHI restriction fragment into the T7 polymerase expression vector pET28a+ (Novagen Inc.), forming the construct pChlG. polymerase chain reaction N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine high pressure liquid chromatography. Construction of a bchG expression vector was accomplished essentially as described for the chlG expression vector. As a template for amplification, the plasmid pDB26 (6Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowlski J. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Google Scholar) was used at a concentration of 0.01 μg. The forward primer (5′-GACAGTGCCCAAGACCTTTCG) contained an NdeI restriction site, and the reverse primer (5′-ACAGCCAGCCCAGCGTCATACCG) contained an EcoRI restriction site. The amplified bchG gene was initially cloned into pCRII and subsequently subcloned into the expression vector pT7-7 (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar), forming the expression plasmid pBchG. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (12Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmids pChlG and pBchG, with the resulting constructs BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pChlG and BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pBchG, which were stored in 20% glycerol at −80°C. For overexpression of chlG and bchG, 10 ml of overnight cultures of the appropriate overexpression strain were subcultured into 1 liter of prewarmed Terrific Broth (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) supplemented with chloramphenicol at 35 μg/ml and ampicillin at 200 μg/ml and grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking to a density of 0.5 A650. T7 RNA polymerase expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Subsequent chlG or bchG expression was allowed to proceed for 3 h prior to harvesting cells by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The cells were washed by resuspension of the cell pellet in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation as described above. Cell pellets were stored at −80°C. Chlorophyllides a and b were prepared from leaves of Ailanthus altissima using the chlorophyllase reaction (16McFeeters R.F. Chichester C.O. Whitaker J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1971; 47: 609-618Google Scholar). Chlorophyllide a was purified by preparative column chromatography on Silica Gel C18 (reverse phase; Waters) with 60% acetone and 40% buffer (50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.8, and 1 mM Na2S2O4) according to Helfrich et al. (17Helfrich M. Schoch S. Lempert U. Cmiel E. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 267-275Google Scholar). Bacteriochlorophyllide a was prepared according to Fiedor et al. (18Fiedor L. Rosenbach-Belkin V. Scherz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22043-22047Google Scholar) with some modifications. As a source of chlorophyllase, leaves of A. altissima were used. Bacteriochlorophyll a from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (30 nmol), dissolved in 50 μl of acetone, was incubated with 500 μl of chlorophyllase extract, 2500 μl of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mM KCl and 0.24% Triton X-100, 75 μl of freshly prepared 500 mM sodium ascorbate in phosphate buffer, and 3 μl of pyridine for 60 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of acetone to a final concentration of 80%. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g The clear supernatant was extracted once with 0.5 volume of n-hexane to remove unreacted bacteriochlorophyll. The bacteriochlorophyllide was then extracted with ethyl acetate and used without further purification. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Gynkotek Model 480 equipped with a 20-μl injection loop, a Rosil C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), an ultraviolet-visible light source, and a fluorescence detector. The sample was injected and then eluted for 2 min with an acetone/water solvent mixture (70:30), followed by three different linear gradients (within 2 min to acetone/water (82:18), within 11 min to acetone/water (88:12), and within 4 min to 100% acetone). The column was then flushed with 100% acetone for 5 min and returned to the original acetone/water mixture (70:30) within 5 min. Fluorescence detection was set at 405 nm for excitation and at 675 nm for emission. Frozen (−80°C) cell paste of the various E. coli strains (1-1.5 ml) was thawed, and the material was then incubated with 20 μl of DNase (10 mg/ml in 5 mM MgCl2) for 60 min at room temperature, followed by two cycles of freezing and thawing. Aliquots of this bacterial lysate containing ∼8 mg of protein were diluted with 200 μl of reaction buffer (120 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 14 mM mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), 30 μl of 5 mM ATP, and 10 μl of 4 mM geranylgeranyl diphosphate or phytyl diphosphate. The reaction was then started by the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 mM chlorophyllide a or bacteriochlorophyllide a (in acetone). After vigorous mixing, the samples were incubated for 90 min at 26-28°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 750 μl of acetone, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g The clear supernatants were then used to quantitate esterified chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll by HPLC or by phase separation with n-hexane as described previously (17Helfrich M. Schoch S. Lempert U. Cmiel E. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 267-275Google Scholar). A series of experiments were performed to assay the esterification activity of protein extracts derived from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS that was transformed either with plasmid pChlG, which expresses the presumed chlorophyll synthase enzyme from Synechocystis, or with pBchG, which expresses the putative bacteriochlorophyll synthase from R. capsulatus Esterification of chlorophyllide a or bacteriochlorophyllide a does not change the UV-visible spectral properties, but does decrease the polarity of these pigments. This difference in polarity can be used for separation of product from substrate by HPLC or by phase separation (17Helfrich M. Schoch S. Lempert U. Cmiel E. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 267-275Google Scholar). To avoid allomerization or other modification of the product, the central magnesium was removed by acidification (forming pheophytin a from chlorophyll a) prior to HPLC analysis for esterification (19Rüdiger W. Benz J. Guthoff C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 193-200Google Scholar). HPLC-separated reaction products can easily identify the non-esterified pheophorbide a, pheophytin a esterified with geranylgeraniol, or pheophytin a esterified with phytol. Fig. 2A shows a typical HPLC separation profile of an assay involving chlorophyllide a and phytyl diphosphate incubated with an E. coli extract that was derived from the strain expressing the chlG gene product. This elution profile contains a large fraction of pheophytin esterified with phytol, which indicates that the extract indeed contains chlorophyll synthase activity. A similar experiment using geranylgeranyl diphosphate instead of phytyl diphosphate yielded a HPLC profile of pheophytin a esterified with geranylgeraniol (Fig. 2B). The enzyme activity is clearly due to the presence of the expressed chlG gene product in that no esterification was found with the same substrates that were incubated with an extract obtained from the nontransformed E. coli strain (Table I, control strain).Table I.Spectrophotometry of esterified pigments in the hexane phase after chlorophyll synthase reactionOverexpressed gene productSubstrates addedEsterificationChlide aaChlide a, chlorophyllide a; Bchlide a, bacteriochlorophyllide a, Phy-P2, phytyl diphosphate; GG-P2, geranylgeranyl diphosphate.Bchlide aPhy-P2GG-P2%None (control strain)+−+−0+−−+0−++−0−+−+0pChlG+−+−52+−−+22−++−<5+−−−<3pBChG+−+−<5−++−43−+−+23−+−−<3a Chlide a, chlorophyllide a; Bchlide a, bacteriochlorophyllide a, Phy-P2, phytyl diphosphate; GG-P2, geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Open table in a new tab Shown in Fig. 3 are the results of assays involving cell-free extract from the E. coli strain containing the expression plasmid pBchG. The HPLC elution profile demonstrates that this enzyme is capable of using either phytyl diphosphate (Fig. 3A) or geranylgeraniol diphosphate (Fig. 3B) as a substrate for esterifying bacteriochlorophyllide a Since this enzyme reaction has never been shown in vitro, we also checked the identity of the products by co-chromatography with authentic bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with either phytol or geranylgeraniol, the results of which indicated that there was indeed coelution (data not shown). Furthermore, we also observed identical absorption maxima at 359-361, 579-582, and 775-777 nm for both authentic bacteriochlorophyll a and the bacteriochlorophyll products generated from the esterification reactions (data not shown). This indicates that dehydrogenation to the corresponding chlorophyll derivatives did not take place. In an independent assay, reaction samples containing a mixture of non-esterified pigment (substrate) and esterified pigment (product) were phase-separated with hexane after treatment of the reaction mixture with ion-exchange resin (see Ref. 17Helfrich M. Schoch S. Lempert U. Cmiel E. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 267-275Google Scholar). The esterified pigment that was partitioned into the hexane phase was then assayed by spectrophotometry. The data in Table I also clearly show that considerable esterification of chlorophyllide a was obtained with E. coli extracts harboring plasmid pChlG. Phase separation assays of reactions involving extracts from the E. coli strain containing pBchG indicated considerable bacteriochlorophyll a synthase activity (Table I). Substrate specificity of the heterologously expressed enzymes was also investigated. In accordance with previous results on chlorophyll synthase from etiolated oat seedlings (20Benz J. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1981; 36: 51-57Google Scholar), the chlG gene product accepts chlorophyllide a, but not bacteriochlorophyllide a, as a substrate. Vice versa, the bchG gene product accepts bacteriochlorophyllide a, but not chlorophyllide a (Table I). The remarkable degree of substrate specificity was even more obvious when the reaction contained a 1:1 mixture of chlorophyllide a and bacteriochlorophyllide a (Fig. 4). In this case, extracts from cells expressing chlG esterified only chlorophyllide a (Fig. 4B), whereas extracts from cells expressing bchG esterified only bacteriochlorophyllide a (Fig. 4C). The marginal esterification of the “wrong” substrate detected when only this substrate was offered (see Table I) was not observed here, probably because the “true” substrate displaced the wrong substrate from the active center of the enzyme. We observed in a series of experiments that phytyl diphosphate is a better substrate than geranylgeranyl diphosphate for both chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll synthases (Table II). We also found that bacteriopheophorbide a (the magnesium-free derivative of bacteriochlorophyllide a) is not a suitable substrate for esterification with geranylgeranyl diphosphate or phytyl diphosphate by bacteriochlorophyll synthase (data not shown). Thus, the substrate specificity of both enzymes resembles that observed for chlorophyll a synthase from green plants (21Soll J. Schultz G. Rüdiger W. Benz J. Plant Physiol.

This is distinctly different from the activity observed with etiolated seedlings, which shows a marked preference for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (19Rüdiger W. Benz J. Guthoff C. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab This study provides the first direct experimental evidence that the bchG and chlG genes code for bacteriochlorophyll a and chlorophyll a synthases, respectively. In many respects, heterologously expressed chlorophyll a synthase from Synechocystis exhibits an activity that is indistinguishable from that reported for green plants (21Soll J. Schultz G. Rüdiger W. Benz J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1983; 71: 849-854Google Scholar). This includes the preferred specificity for phytyl diphosphate over geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate for esterification of chlorophyllide a It remains to be shown whether the differing specificity in etiolated plants is the result of a different environment of the same enzyme or whether another chlorophyll synthase exists in etiolated plants. Specificity for phytyl diphosphate was also observed with heterologously expressed bacteriochlorophyll a synthase. This latter result is surprising given that Bollivar et al. (7Bollivar D.W. Wang S. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar) observed that a mutation in the bchP gene, which is located just downstream from bchG, resulted in the exclusive accumulation of geranylgeraniol-esterified bacteriochlorophyll. It was concluded that bacteriochlorophyll a synthase most likely utilized geranylgeranyl diphosphate as a substrate, creating geranylgeraniol esterified bacteriochlorophyll a, and that the product of the bchP gene subsequently reduced bacteriochlorophyll to bacteriochlorophyll a via a three-step reduction reaction. Given our results, which indicate that bacteriochlorophyll a synthase prefers phytyl diphosphate as a substrate, the scenario outlined by Bollivar et al. (7Bollivar D.W. Wang S. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar) must be modified. We propose that bchP codes for an enzyme that is responsible for reducing geranylgeraniol (or geranylgeranyl diphosphate) to phytol (or phytyl diphosphate) before, as well as possibly after (22Shioi Y. Sasa T. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 340-343Google Scholar), esterification. In this scenario, a disruption of the bchP gene would result in the absence of a pool of phytyl diphosphate for use as a substrate in this reaction. This would give rise to geranylgeraniol esterified bacteriochlorophyll a as a consequence of geranylgeranyl diphosphate being the only available substrate for bacteriochlorophyll synthase. This hypothesis can be tested biochemically by heterologous expression of the bchP gene product in E. coli, followed by assaying cell-free extracts for the ability to reduce geranylgeraniol. In this regard, our control reactions (Table I) confirm that the E. coli extracts contain no significant pool of geranylgeranyl diphosphate or phytyl diphosphate (23White R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingrahm J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasani K.B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaecter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 637-641Google Scholar). As such, heterologous expression of bchP should be a feasible approach for studying its function. Another interesting observation is the remarkable specificity of these two enzymes for their respective Mg-tetrapyrrole substrates. These two enzymes exhibit a significant degree of sequence divergence (63.9% non-identity), which must provide enough difference in protein structure to differentiate different Mg-tetrapyrroles as appropriate substrates. Given the fact that chlorophyllide a is an intermediate in bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthesis (Fig. 1) and must be modified to bacteriochlorophyllide a before esterification, it is understandable that the bchG gene product must be able to differentiate between chlorophyllide and bacteriochlorophyllide. Our observation that these enzymes can faithfully distinguish these substrates also supports the finding of Lopez et al. (24Lopez J.C. Ryan S. Blankenship R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3369-3373Google Scholar) that Chloroflexis aurantiacus contains two homologs of bchG, one of which is proposed to be involved in bacteriochlorophyll a synthesis and the other in bacteriochlorophyll c synthesis. The additional specificity for bacteriochlorophyllide over bacteriopheophorbide indicates that bacteriopheophytin, which is present in purple bacterial reaction centers, must be derived by loss or extraction of magnesium from esterified bacteriochlorophyll a Heterologous expression of bacteriochlorophyll (or chlorophyll) biosynthesis genes in E. coli, coupled with demonstration of enzyme activity in cell-free extracts, provides unequivocal proof that previously genetically characterized open reading frames do indeed code for predicted enzymes. The results of this study complement those of Gibson et al. (25Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. vonWettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Google Scholar), who also utilized heterologous expression to demonstrate that the bchD, bchH, and bchI genes code for subunits of Mg-chelatase, and those of Bollivar et al. (26Bollivar D.W. Jiang Z.-Y. Bauer C.E. Beale S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5290-5296Google Scholar), who demonstrated that bchM codes for Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyltransferase. Several genes implicated in additional steps in the Mg-tetrapyrrole pathway, such as cyclopentone ring formation and 4-vinyl reduction, await similar analysis. We thank C.

We performed a detailed study of the role of glutathione in the intracellular trapping/accumulation of ascorbic acid in HL-60 cells. Uptake studies using HL-60 cells depleted of glutathione by treatment with L-buthionine-(S,R) sulfoximine and diethyl maleate, revealed no changes in the cells' ability to transport dehydroascorbic acid and accumulate ascorbic acid. Similar transport and accumulation rates were obtained using HL-60 cells containing intracellular glutathione concentrations from 6 mM to 1 μM. HL-60 cells, containing as little as 5 μM glutathione, were able to accumulate up to 150 mM ascorbic acid intracellularly when incubated with dehydroascorbic acid. Glutathione was capable of reducing dehydroascorbic acid by a direct chemical reaction, but only when present in a greater than 10-fold stoichiometric excess over dehydroascorbic acid. The accumulation of ascorbic acid by HL-60 cells was strongly temperature-dependent and was very inefficient at 16°C. On the other hand, the direct chemical reduction of dehydroascorbic acid by excess glutathione proceeded efficiently at temperatures of 16°C.

HepG2 cells express the IκB members IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBγ. In response to TNFα, Rel A·NF-κB1 translocation and DNA binding activity follows a biphasic profile, with an “early” induction (15-30 min), followed by a nadir to control levels at 60 min, and a “late” induction (>120 min). The early phase of Rel A·NF-κB1 translocation depends on simultaneous proteolysis of both IκBα and IκBβ isoforms; IκBγ is inert to TNFα treatment. The 60-min nadir is due to a rapid IκBα resynthesis that reassociates with Rel A and completely inhibits its DNA binding activity; the 60-min nadir is not observed when IκBα resynthesis is prevented by cycloheximide treatment.

Here we showed that the staphylolytic activity of LasA is inhibited by tetraethylenepentamine and 1,10-phenanthroline (zinc chelators) as well as excess Zn2+ and dithiothreitol. However, LasA was not inhibited by several serine or cysteine proteinase inhibitors including diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and N-ethylmaleimide. LasA staphylolytic activity was also insensitive to Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone or phosphoramidon. EDTA and EGTA were inhibitory only at concentrations greater than 20 mM. Without added inhibitors, LasA obtained by DEAE-cellulose fractionation was active toward β-casein, but the same cleavage patterns were observed with column fractions containing little or no LasA. The β-casein cleaving activity was fully blocked in the presence of inhibitors that did not affect staphylolytic activity. In the presence of such inhibitors, purified LasA was inactive toward acetyl-Ala4 and benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ala, but it degraded soluble recombinant human elastin as well as insoluble elastin. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of two fragments derived from soluble elastin indicated that both resulted from cleavages of Gly-Ala peptide bonds located within similar sequences, Pro-Gly-Val-Gly-Gly-Ala-Xaa (where Xaa is Phe or Gly).

INTRODUCTIONChemokines are a large family of chemotactic proteins which regulate leukocyte activation and recruitment to sites of inflammation. They can be divided into two main classes, the CXC- and the CC-chemokines based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues. Both CXC- and CC-chemokines bind to seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein coupled receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusHAhemagglutininNBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-ylMIPmacrophage inflammatory polypeptideCHOChinese hamster ovary. which in most cases are promiscuous in that they will bind more than one ligand with high affinity (1Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 209-213Google Scholar). Although receptor-mediated endocytosis of certain GPCRs such as the β2-adrenergic receptor has been well documented, the endocytic pathways utilized by most GPCRs are still uncharacterized. Following stimulation by agonist, the β2-adrenergic receptor is rapidly phosphorylated by a specific GPCR kinase. This uncouples the interaction between the receptor and the G-protein and allows binding of β-arrestin which acts as an adapter to recruit the receptor into clathrin-coated vesicles (2Goodman O.B.

Nature. 1996; 384: 529-534Google Scholar). This has raised the possibility of using chemokines therapeutically to block HIV entry. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of chemokines has not been studied in detail, but an understanding of this process is clearly important if we are to develop selective therapeutic agents which block HIV entry into cells. To this end we have studied the receptor-mediated endocytosis of CC-chemokines by CCR1 as a prototype for the CC-chemokine receptor family.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study CC-chemokine endocytosis we generated fluorescently labeled RANTES and MIP-1α using site-specific chemistry to attach the fluorophore specifically to the terminal amino group of the polypeptide chain (23Offord R.E. Gartner H. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 26Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J-J. Power C.A. Bacon K. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Google Scholar). Using this technique we conjugated rhodamine to MIP-1α and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl (NBD) to RANTES. These fluorescently labeled CC-chemokines retained their ability to bind specifically to CCR1 although the binding affinity was slightly reduced compared with the unmodified agonist (23Offord R.E. Gartner H. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 26Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J-J. Power C.A. Bacon K. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Google Scholar). Prior to using these ligands to study endocytosis we assessed their biological activity in chemotaxis assays. Rhodamine-MIP-1α acted as a full agonist and induced maximal chemotaxis at a concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 1A). However, NBD-RANTES had no biological activity in a chemotaxis assay. We have previously shown that modification of the amino terminus of RANTES has a profound influence on its biological properties (25Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A J. Montjovent M-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Google Scholar). Failure to cleave the initiating methionine from bacterially expressed RANTES (Met-RANTES) produced a protein which was devoid of agonist activity but was a potent antagonist. Similarly, conjugation of the fluorophore NBD to the amino terminus of RANTES also converted it from an agonist to an antagonist. As shown in Fig. 1B both Met-RANTES and NBD-RANTES can fully antagonize the chemotactic activity of RANTES on THP-1 cells.For endocytosis studies the human CCR1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and an HA epitope tag was placed at the extreme amino terminus. The tagged receptor was transfected into CHO cells, and lines stably expressing the receptor were cloned. Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the tagged CCR1 expressed in CHO cells (CHO-CCR1) retained high affinity ligand binding and ligand specificity (data not shown). In the initial experiments the fluorescent rhodamine-MIP-1α and NBD-RANTES were bound to CHO-CCR1 cells for 4 h at 4°C at a final concentration of 500 nM. Unbound ligand was washed off with ice-cold buffer prior to warming the cells to 37°C for timed periods up to 30 min (Fig. 2). The agonist, rhodamine-MIP-1α, was effectively internalized and accumulated in perinuclear vesicles (panels A-C) whereas the antagonist, NBD-RANTES, remained almost entirely on the cell surface (panels D-F). This is consistent with other GPCRs for which it has been shown that receptor internalization is dependent upon agonist stimulation and is inhibited by antagonists (4von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Google Scholar, 6Fonseca M.I. Button D.C. Brown R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8902-8909Google Scholar, 9Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17335-17342Google Scholar, 10Berry S.A. Shah M.C. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313Google Scholar). However, since we have made NBD-RANTES we were able to perform the experiment to study the effect of agonist stimulation upon the receptor-mediated endocytosis of a fluorescent antagonist. Binding of NBD-RANTES in the presence of an equimolar concentration of RANTES showed that the antagonist could be induced to cluster and internalize in the presence of agonist (panels G-I). Although the internalized antagonist appeared in more peripheral endosomes rather than in the perinuclear structures in which the agonist accumulated, this observation nonetheless demonstrated that agonist-bound receptor could induce the sequestration of antagonist-occupied receptor. These findings suggest that activation of the GPCR kinase by agonist will induce phosphorylation, and consequently sequestration, of receptors occupied by agonists or antagonists. The significance of this relates to how a virus uses a GPCR to gain entry to a cell. These findings suggest that HIV would not have to act as an agonist to be internalized via CC-chemokine receptors provided there is sufficient chemokine agonist present to induce receptor internalization. This is consistent with recent findings, using chimeric receptors, that the regions of CCR5 required for viral entry and for chemokine signal transduction are distinct (27Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Montecarlo F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F. Goldsmith M.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1924-1926Google Scholar). It may also explain the observation that in certain macrophage cultures addition of CC-chemokines actually enhances rather than inhibits HIV replication (28Schmidtmayerova H. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Nature. 1996; 382: 767Google Scholar).Fig. 2Receptor-mediated endocytosis of fluorescent chemokines. Chemokines were bound to the surface of CHO-CCR1 cells at 4°C. Unbound chemokine was washed off, and cells were either fixed immediately or rapidly warmed to 37°C for 15 or 30 min prior to fixation. Following fixation the cells were examined by confocal microscopy. Panels A, D, and G show chemokine distribution with no warmup, panels B, E, and H show distribution after a 15-min warmup, and panels C, F, and I show distribution after a 30-min warmup.

Rhodamine-MIP-1α was bound to CHO-CCR1 cells at 4°C, and receptor-bound ligand was subsequently allowed to internalize for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained using an antibody to the transferrin receptor (Fig. 3). Analysis of the cells by confocal microscopy revealed that at 4°C, the rhodamine-MIP-1α decorated the plasma membrane (panel B) whereas the transferrin receptor staining was both on the plasma membrane and in numerous endocytic vesicles (panel A). Following a 30-min warm up the rhodamine-MIP-1α was internalized into perinuclear endosomal vesicles (panel D) and showed an exact co-localization with the transferrin receptor (panel C). Since it is well documented that the transferrin receptor is a marker for the clathrin-coated pit endocytic pathway it is reasonable to conclude that the CCR1 is also internalized via this mechanism.Fig. 3Co-localization of rhodamine-MIP-1α with the transferrin receptor. Rhodamine-MIP-1α was bound to CHO-CCR1 cells at 4°C. Unbound chemokine was washed off, and the cells were either fixed immediately or warmed to 37°C for 30 min prior to fixation. Fixed cells were permeabilized and stained with a monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor (H68.4) followed by a goat anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. Dual staining of the transferrin receptor (panels A and C) and rhodamine-MIP-1α (panels B and D) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Panels A and B show distribution at 4°C, and panels C and D after a 30-min warmup to 37°C. (Bar = 10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As a final study we decided to examine the receptor redistribution following addition of agonist or antagonist. For these experiments various chemokines were added to CHO-CCR1 cells at 37°C for 30 min after which time the cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized, and the CCR1 receptor was visualized by staining with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4). The various chemokines were added at a concentration of either 50 nM or at 1 μM. Without chemokine addition the receptor was predominantly seen on the plasma membrane (panel A) and addition of the antagonists NBD-RANTES (panels B and C) or Met-RANTES (panels D and E) did not induce any significant receptor redistribution. However the agonists MIP-1α (panels F and G) and RANTES (panels H and I) both induced receptor sequestration, although MIP-1α appeared more effective in this respect than RANTES. Even at 50 nM, MIP-1α induced most of the CCR1 to redistribute from the plasma membrane to perinuclear vesicles, and at 1 μM receptor down-regulation was almost complete.Fig. 4CC-chemokine receptor 1 redistribution following addition of chemokine agonists and antagonists. CHO-CCR1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with a range of CC-chemokines. Following this period the cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the HA-tagged receptor was detected with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 followed a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibody and a streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate. Panel A, no chemokine addition; panel B, 50 nM NBD-RANTES; panel C, 1 μM NBD-RANTES; panel D, 50 nM Met-RANTES; panel E, 1 μM Met-RANTES; panel F, 50 nM MIP-1α; panel G, 1 μM MIP-1α; panel H, 50 nM RANTES; panel I, 1 μM RANTES.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These observations are the first detailed description of chemokine and chemokine receptor endocytosis, and they show that CCR1 is likely to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits. We demonstrate that both ligand and receptor accumulate in perinuclear endosomes and that receptor internalization is dependent upon agonist stimulation. Provided that all CC chemokine receptors behave like CCR1, does this give us any insight into how we might use chemokines as therapeutic agents to prevent HIV entry into cells? The protective effects of chemokines may be due to two factors. The chemokine may act as a competitive inhibitor preventing binding of the virus to the receptor or it may down-regulate surface receptors so that there are no receptors available for the virus. If the second explanation were true then antagonists, which do not induce receptor sequestration, would not be expected to block HIV entry. Recently published data (29Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J-L. Rousset D. Clark-Lewis I. Loetscher P. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Nature. 1996; 383: 400Google Scholar) and our own studies 3Simmons, G., Clapham, P. R., Picard, L., Offord, R. E., Rosenkilde, M. M., Schwartz, T. W., Buser, R., Wells, T. N. C., and Proudfoot, A. E. I. (1997) Science, in press. confirm that chemokine antagonists are effective at inhibiting HIV entry into target cells. Consequently our study strongly suggests that the observed HIV suppressive effects of chemokines are due to competitive inhibition for receptor binding and not due to receptor down-regulation. These findings have significant implications for the design and discovery of novel therapeutic agents targeted at blocking HIV entry into cells. INTRODUCTIONChemokines are a large family of chemotactic proteins which regulate leukocyte activation and recruitment to sites of inflammation. They can be divided into two main classes, the CXC- and the CC-chemokines based on the spacing of the first two cysteine residues. Both CXC- and CC-chemokines bind to seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein coupled receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusHAhemagglutininNBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-ylMIPmacrophage inflammatory polypeptideCHOChinese hamster ovary. which in most cases are promiscuous in that they will bind more than one ligand with high affinity (1Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 209-213Google Scholar). Although receptor-mediated endocytosis of certain GPCRs such as the β2-adrenergic receptor has been well documented, the endocytic pathways utilized by most GPCRs are still uncharacterized. Following stimulation by agonist, the β2-adrenergic receptor is rapidly phosphorylated by a specific GPCR kinase. This uncouples the interaction between the receptor and the G-protein and allows binding of β-arrestin which acts as an adapter to recruit the receptor into clathrin-coated vesicles (2Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that GPCRs are internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles, although this may not be a universal mechanism as alternative endocytic pathways have been described for a number of different ligands (3Raposo G.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study CC-chemokine endocytosis we generated fluorescently labeled RANTES and MIP-1α using site-specific chemistry to attach the fluorophore specifically to the terminal amino group of the polypeptide chain (23Offord R.E.

These fluorescently labeled CC-chemokines retained their ability to bind specifically to CCR1 although the binding affinity was slightly reduced compared with the unmodified agonist (23Offord R.E. Gartner H. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar, 26Alouani S. Gaertner H.F. Mermod J-J. Power C.A. Bacon K. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 328-334Google Scholar). Prior to using these ligands to study endocytosis we assessed their biological activity in chemotaxis assays. Rhodamine-MIP-1α acted as a full agonist and induced maximal chemotaxis at a concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 1A). However, NBD-RANTES had no biological activity in a chemotaxis assay. We have previously shown that modification of the amino terminus of RANTES has a profound influence on its biological properties (25Proudfoot A.E.I. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A J. Montjovent M-O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Google Scholar). Failure to cleave the initiating methionine from bacterially expressed RANTES (Met-RANTES) produced a protein which was devoid of agonist activity but was a potent antagonist. Similarly, conjugation of the fluorophore NBD to the amino terminus of RANTES also converted it from an agonist to an antagonist. As shown in Fig. 1B both Met-RANTES and NBD-RANTES can fully antagonize the chemotactic activity of RANTES on THP-1 cells.For endocytosis studies the human CCR1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and an HA epitope tag was placed at the extreme amino terminus. The tagged receptor was transfected into CHO cells, and lines stably expressing the receptor were cloned. Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the tagged CCR1 expressed in CHO cells (CHO-CCR1) retained high affinity ligand binding and ligand specificity (data not shown). In the initial experiments the fluorescent rhodamine-MIP-1α and NBD-RANTES were bound to CHO-CCR1 cells for 4 h at 4°C at a final concentration of 500 nM. Unbound ligand was washed off with ice-cold buffer prior to warming the cells to 37°C for timed periods up to 30 min (Fig. 2). The agonist, rhodamine-MIP-1α, was effectively internalized and accumulated in perinuclear vesicles (panels A-C) whereas the antagonist, NBD-RANTES, remained almost entirely on the cell surface (panels D-F). This is consistent with other GPCRs for which it has been shown that receptor internalization is dependent upon agonist stimulation and is inhibited by antagonists (4von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Google Scholar, 6Fonseca M.I. Button D.C. Brown R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8902-8909Google Scholar, 9Tolbert L.M. Lameh J. J. Biol.

However, since we have made NBD-RANTES we were able to perform the experiment to study the effect of agonist stimulation upon the receptor-mediated endocytosis of a fluorescent antagonist. Binding of NBD-RANTES in the presence of an equimolar concentration of RANTES showed that the antagonist could be induced to cluster and internalize in the presence of agonist (panels G-I). Although the internalized antagonist appeared in more peripheral endosomes rather than in the perinuclear structures in which the agonist accumulated, this observation nonetheless demonstrated that agonist-bound receptor could induce the sequestration of antagonist-occupied receptor. These findings suggest that activation of the GPCR kinase by agonist will induce phosphorylation, and consequently sequestration, of receptors occupied by agonists or antagonists. The significance of this relates to how a virus uses a GPCR to gain entry to a cell. These findings suggest that HIV would not have to act as an agonist to be internalized via CC-chemokine receptors provided there is sufficient chemokine agonist present to induce receptor internalization. This is consistent with recent findings, using chimeric receptors, that the regions of CCR5 required for viral entry and for chemokine signal transduction are distinct (27Atchison R.E. Gosling J. Montecarlo F.S. Franci C. Digilio L. Charo I.F. Goldsmith M.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1924-1926Google Scholar). It may also explain the observation that in certain macrophage cultures addition of CC-chemokines actually enhances rather than inhibits HIV replication (28Schmidtmayerova H. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Nature. 1996; 382: 767Google Scholar).To define the endocytic compartment into which rhodamine-MIP-1α was being delivered we performed dual-labeling studies with the transferrin receptor. Rhodamine-MIP-1α was bound to CHO-CCR1 cells at 4°C, and receptor-bound ligand was subsequently allowed to internalize for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained using an antibody to the transferrin receptor (Fig. 3). Analysis of the cells by confocal microscopy revealed that at 4°C, the rhodamine-MIP-1α decorated the plasma membrane (panel B) whereas the transferrin receptor staining was both on the plasma membrane and in numerous endocytic vesicles (panel A). Following a 30-min warm up the rhodamine-MIP-1α was internalized into perinuclear endosomal vesicles (panel D) and showed an exact co-localization with the transferrin receptor (panel C). Since it is well documented that the transferrin receptor is a marker for the clathrin-coated pit endocytic pathway it is reasonable to conclude that the CCR1 is also internalized via this mechanism.Fig. 3Co-localization of rhodamine-MIP-1α with the transferrin receptor. Rhodamine-MIP-1α was bound to CHO-CCR1 cells at 4°C. Unbound chemokine was washed off, and the cells were either fixed immediately or warmed to 37°C for 30 min prior to fixation. Fixed cells were permeabilized and stained with a monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor (H68.4) followed by a goat anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. Dual staining of the transferrin receptor (panels A and C) and rhodamine-MIP-1α (panels B and D) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Panels A and B show distribution at 4°C, and panels C and D after a 30-min warmup to 37°C. (Bar = 10 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As a final study we decided to examine the receptor redistribution following addition of agonist or antagonist. For these experiments various chemokines were added to CHO-CCR1 cells at 37°C for 30 min after which time the cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized, and the CCR1 receptor was visualized by staining with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4). The various chemokines were added at a concentration of either 50 nM or at 1 μM. Without chemokine addition the receptor was predominantly seen on the plasma membrane (panel A) and addition of the antagonists NBD-RANTES (panels B and C) or Met-RANTES (panels D and E) did not induce any significant receptor redistribution. However the agonists MIP-1α (panels F and G) and RANTES (panels H and I) both induced receptor sequestration, although MIP-1α appeared more effective in this respect than RANTES. Even at 50 nM, MIP-1α induced most of the CCR1 to redistribute from the plasma membrane to perinuclear vesicles, and at 1 μM receptor down-regulation was almost complete.Fig. 4CC-chemokine receptor 1 redistribution following addition of chemokine agonists and antagonists. CHO-CCR1 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with a range of CC-chemokines. Following this period the cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the HA-tagged receptor was detected with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 followed a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibody and a streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate. Panel A, no chemokine addition; panel B, 50 nM NBD-RANTES; panel C, 1 μM NBD-RANTES; panel D, 50 nM Met-RANTES; panel E, 1 μM Met-RANTES; panel F, 50 nM MIP-1α; panel G, 1 μM MIP-1α; panel H, 50 nM RANTES; panel I, 1 μM RANTES.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These observations are the first detailed description of chemokine and chemokine receptor endocytosis, and they show that CCR1 is likely to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits. We demonstrate that both ligand and receptor accumulate in perinuclear endosomes and that receptor internalization is dependent upon agonist stimulation. Provided that all CC chemokine receptors behave like CCR1, does this give us any insight into how we might use chemokines as therapeutic agents to prevent HIV entry into cells? The protective effects of chemokines may be due to two factors. The chemokine may act as a competitive inhibitor preventing binding of the virus to the receptor or it may down-regulate surface receptors so that there are no receptors available for the virus. If the second explanation were true then antagonists, which do not induce receptor sequestration, would not be expected to block HIV entry. Recently published data (29Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J-L. Rousset D. Clark-Lewis I. Loetscher P. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Nature. 1996; 383: 400Google Scholar) and our own studies 3Simmons, G., Clapham, P. R., Picard, L., Offord, R.

Consequently our study strongly suggests that the observed HIV suppressive effects of chemokines are due to competitive inhibition for receptor binding and not due to receptor down-regulation. These findings have significant implications for the design and discovery of novel therapeutic agents targeted at blocking HIV entry into cells. To study CC-chemokine endocytosis we generated fluorescently labeled RANTES and MIP-1α using site-specific chemistry to attach the fluorophore specifically to the terminal amino group of the polypeptide chain (23Offord R.E.

The C-terminal propeptide may be an important determinant of intracellular surfactant pool size. Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is synthesized exclusively by the alveolar type II epithelial cell. Surfactant is stored in large inclusions (lamellar bodies) that are secreted into the alveolar airspace by exocytosis. Newly secreted lamellar bodies unravel into a tubular network (tubular myelin) that subsequently adsorbs and spreads as a phospholipid-rich film that reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface. Rapid adsorption and spreading of the phospholipid film are critical and require the presence of specific proteins, in particular surfactant proteins B and C (1Yu S.H. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys.

Human SP-B is synthesized by the type II epithelial cell as a preproprotein of 381 amino acids. The mature peptide is generated by sequential cleavage of the signal peptide (23 amino acids), the N-terminal propeptide (177 residues), and the C-terminal propeptide (102 residues) (7Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L100-L108Google Scholar, 8O'Reilly M.A. Weaver T.E. Pilot-Matias T.J. Sarin V.K. Gazdar A.F. Whitsett J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 140-148Google Scholar). Propeptide cleavage occurs within the late endosome/multivesicular body which subsequently directs newly synthesized SP-B to the lamellar body (9Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M.G. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486Google Scholar); mature SP-B is also recycled from the alveolar airspace, via the endocytic pathway to the multivesicular body (10Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L699-L707Google Scholar). Previous in vitro evidence supports the concept that trafficking of the mature peptide through the biosynthetic pathway requires the N-terminal but not the C-terminal domain of the propeptide (11Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Bba-Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Google Scholar, 12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar). In the absence of both propeptide domains the mature peptide is degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum (11Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Bba-Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Google Scholar); however, an SP-B construct encoding both the N-terminal propeptide and the mature peptide (hSP-BΔc) produces a truncated proprotein that is sorted to the multivesicular body where the propeptide is appropriately cleaved to liberate mature SP-B (12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate that the N-terminal propeptide is required for the intracellular trafficking of SP-B; the function of the C-terminal propeptide, however, remains unknown. Lung morphogenesis and surfactant phospholipid synthesis in SP-B(−/−) mice proceed normally prior to birth (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar). However, lamellar body formation is disrupted, resulting in abnormal inclusions consisting of multivesicular bodies and disorganized lamellae. Neither mature lamellar bodies nor tubular myelin were detected in the SP-B(−/−) mice. In addition to effects on lamellar body biogenesis, SP-B deficiency resulted in aberrant processing of the SP-C proprotein leading to accumulation of an Mr = 11,000 processing intermediate and a decrease in mature SP-C peptide levels. The purpose of the present study was to assess the function of the C-terminal propeptide of SP-B by expressing hSP-BΔc in SP-B(−/−) mice and determining which aspects of the SP-B(−/−) phenotype were not corrected by transgene expression. FVB/N transgenic mice expressing a transgene construct encoding the signal peptide, N-terminal propeptide, and mature peptide of human SP-B (hSP-BΔc) under the control of the 3.7-kilobase human SP-C promoter were generated as described previously (12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar). Two of four transgenic mouse lines were used in the present study. Mice from transgenic Lines 6.1 and 1.4 were bred with hemizygous 129J × Swiss Black SP-B mice generated by gene targeting (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E.

Offspring bearing one wild type mouse SP-B allele and the hSP-BΔc transgene were identified as described below, and siblings crossed to generate mice expressing hSP-BΔc in a null background (SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+)). hSP-BΔc transgenic mice were identified by PCR amplification of a 600-base pair fragment, spanning the junction of the human SP-C promoter and human SP-B cDNA, as described previously (12Lin S.

SP-B(+/−) and SP-B(−/−) genotypes were identified by amplification of a 1.3-kilobase fragment, spanning the neomycin resistance gene and intron 4 of the targeted SP-B gene. One μM each of a 5′ primer specific for the neomycin resistance gene (5′ ATTGCCTCTGTGGGTGTGTATGTG) and a 3′ primer specific for the SP-B gene (5′ GGTGGAGAGGCTATTCGGCTATGA) were incubated with 100 ng of genomic DNA in 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 100 μM dNTPs, and 0.5 units of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer) for 2 min at 94°C, followed by a 30-cycle PCR amplification comprised of 94°C denaturation for 30 s, 63°C annealing for 30 s and 2 min of elongation at 72°C. The SP-B(−/−) genotype was identified by the absence of a 260-base pair fragment spanning introns 3 and 4 of the mouse SP-B gene following amplification with 1 μM each of 5′ primer (5′ CTTCCTTGGTCATCTTTGTGAGGAGGTGGA) and 3′ primer (5′ CGGTGTCGCCAAGTGCTTGATGTCTACCTG) using the PCR conditions described above. The SP-B(−/−) genotype was confirmed by Southern blotting of BamHI-restricted genomic DNA with a species-specific mouse SP-B cDNA and neomycin resistance probes as described previously (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar). RNAs encoding mouse and human SP-B were analyzed by S1 nuclease assays using 32P-end-labeled, species-specific probes and 2 μg of total RNA as described previously (14Yei S.P. Bachurski C.J. Weaver T.E. Wert S.E. Trapnell B.C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 329-336Google Scholar). Total SP-B protein was analyzed by ELISA (15Pryhuber G.S. Hull W.M. Fink I. McMahan M.J. Whitsett J.A. Pediatr. Res. 1991; 30: 597-605Google Scholar) and Western blotting (11Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Bba-Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Google Scholar, 12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar), using equal amounts of protein from lung homogenates of 6-7-week-old mice of each genotype. Mature SP-B, Mr∼18,000, and SP-C, Mr∼4,000, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sulfhydryl reducing agents and detected by blotting with antiserum 28031 (11Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Bba-Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Google Scholar), which detects only SP-B, or antiserum 559 (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar), which detects both SP-B and SP-C; SP-C proprotein was detected by antiserum 68514 (16Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Google Scholar) which recognizes antigenic determinants in the 20-amino acid N-terminal propeptide of SP-C. SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice and FVB/N mice (wild type) at 7-8 weeks of age were used for measurements of saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) pool size and choline incorporation in vivo Wild type and SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice were given 8 μl/g body weight intraperitoneal injections of 0.2 μCi/μl [3H]choline chloride (DuPont NEN). Groups of 5-7 wild type and SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice were killed, and an alveolar lavage was recovered from each animal at five preselected times from 3 to 48 h after isotope injection based on our previous experiences with precursor labeling in mice (17Ikegami M. Ueda T. Hull W. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Dranoff G. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L650-L658Google Scholar). Mice were given intraperitoneal pentobarbital to achieve deep anesthesia, and the distal aorta was cut to exsanguinate each animal. The chest of the animal was opened; a 20-gauge blunt needle was tied into the proximal trachea; 0.9% NaCl was instilled into the airways until the lungs were inflated, and the fluid was withdrawn by syringe. The lavage procedure was repeated four times, and samples from each lung were pooled for analysis. Lung tissue after alveolar lavage was weighed and homogenized in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Alveolar lavage and aliquots of the lung homogenates were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) and Sat PC was isolated (18Mason R.J. Nellenbogen J. Clements J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 281-284Google Scholar). The Sat PC was divided for measurement of phosphorous (19Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar) and radioactivity. The total radioactivity recovered in Sat PC for the alveolar lavage, lung tissue, and total lung (alveolar and tissue) of each animal was calculated. Percent secretion of labeled Sat PC was calculated as the radioactivity in alveolar Sat PC divided by the total radioactivity in the alveolar lavage plus lung tissue × 100. Pool sizes of Sat PC in alveolar lavage, lung tissue, and total lung were calculated as μmol per kg body weight. The DNA measurements for lung tissue were according to Hill and Whatley (20Hill B.T. Watley S. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 20-23Google Scholar). For measurements of phospholipid composition, chloroform/methanol extracts of pooled alveolar lavages from 2 SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice and 2 wild type mice each were used for two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (21Kulovich M.V. Hallman M. Gluck L. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1979; 135: 57-63Google Scholar). The spots were visualized with iodine vapor, scraped, and assayed for phosphorous content (19Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar). Static lung compliance was measured in 12 SP-B(+/+)/hSP-BΔc(+/+), 8 SP-B(+/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+), and 10 SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice at 6-7 weeks of age. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) and placed in a chamber containing 100% O2. In this manner, the lungs were completely deflated at the time of death (22Stengel P. Frazer D. Weber K. J. Appl. Physiol. 1980; 48: 370-375Google Scholar). A catheter (20-gauge angiocatheter) was inserted into the trachea and connected to a silicon pressure sensor (X-ducer™, Motorola, Phoenix, AZ). The chest wall and diaphragm were opened carefully to avoid injuring the lungs. The lungs were inflated with air in small increments (0.1 ml every 5-8 s) to a maximal pressure of 40 cm H2O. Lungs were deflated in stepwise fashion. Airway opening pressure and lung volume were recorded at each inflation and deflation increment. All measurements were completed within 15 min after death. Pressure-volume curves were generated for each animal. Lung compliance was determined by calculating the slopes and intercepts of the straight portion of the deflation curve where pressure ranged from −10 to +10 cm H2O (23Lai Y.-L. Diamond L. Respir. Physiol. 1986; 66: 147-155Google Scholar). Specific lung compliance was calculated as lung compliance divided by the lung weight. Murine sense and antisense riboprobes used were synthesized as described previously (24Damore-Bruno M.A. Wikenheiser K.A. Carter J.E. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L40-L47Google Scholar); human riboprobes were synthesized from full-length SP-B cDNA (25Pilot-matias T.J. Kister S.E. Fox J.L. Kropp K. Glasser S.W. Whitsett J.A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 75-86Google Scholar) subcloned from pkc4 as an EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of pGEM3Z (f+). In situ hybridization was performed under stringent conditions as reported by Damore-Bruno et al. (24Damore-Bruno M.A. Wikenheiser K.A. Carter J.E. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L40-L47Google Scholar) with the addition of an extensive post-hybridization washing schedule (26Whitsett J.A. Dey C.R. Stripp B.R. Wikenheiser K.A. Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Engelhardt J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 13-20Google Scholar) to minimize possible cross-reactivity between the murine and human probes. Transgenic and control lungs from 6-week old mice were fixed by tracheal infusion (27Buckingham K.W. Wyder W.E. Toxicol. Pathol. 1981; 9: 17-20Google Scholar) with 1.5% paraformaldehyde, 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Following overnight immersion in the same fixative, lungs were minced into 1-mm cubes and processed for electron microscopy as described by Fehrenbach et al. (28Fehrenbach H. Richter J. Schnabel P.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1991; 162: 91-104Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation, blocks were rinsed for 1 h in 4-6 changes of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) (SCB), post-fixed 2-3 h in 1% OsO4 in SCB, rinsed several times in SCB and several times in distilled H2O, and incubated overnight in 4% aqueous uranyl acetate. After several rinses in distilled H2O, blocks were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols and transferred to Epon 812 (Shell Chemical Co.) via propylene oxide. Ultrathin sections (60-90 nm) were prepared, counterstained with lead citrate, and evaluated and photographed using a JEOL-100-CXII transmission electron microscope. For the lung function studies, differences among animals were evaluated by comparing lung compliances, specific lung compliances, intercepts, and inflation lung volumes at 30 cm of H2O by two-way analysis of variance; significant differences between mean values was determined by Bonferroni/Dunn test. Differences between groups of animals in surfactant metabolic studies and ELISA analysis were tested by two-tailed Student's t test. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Generation of transgenic mouse lines expressing truncated human SP-B (hSP-BΔc, in which the sequence encoding the 102-residue C-terminal propeptide was deleted) in type II epithelial cells has been previously described (12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar). Since these mice expressed both endogenous SP-B and the human SP-BΔc transgene, there was a 3-4-fold increase of mature SP-B peptide in lung homogenates of animals that were homozygous for the transgene. Surfactant composition and phospholipid pool sizes, static compliance, and type II ultrastructure were all normal in adult SP-BΔc transgenic mice, indicating that increased levels of SP-B did not perturb surfactant homeostasis or lung function. hSP-BΔc transgenic mice (line 6.1) were bred with SP-B(+/−) mice and offspring that were homozygous for hSP-BΔc and heterozygous for the mouse SP-B allele (SP-B(+/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+)) were identified by PCR. These mice were subsequently interbred to achieve expression of hSP-BΔc in the null background (SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+)) (Fig. 1). Of 105 offspring screened, 21 were identified as both mSP-B(−/−) and hSP-BΔc(+/+), consistent with Mendelian inheritance of a recessive allele and postnatal survival of all animals carrying the hSP-BΔc transgene. In the absence of the transgene no SP-B(−/−) offspring were detected confirming the perinatal lethality associated with ablation of the SP-B locus (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar) and the ability of hSP-BΔc to rescue these animals. “Rescued” SP-B(−/−) mice were indistinguishable from wild type littermates with respect to body weight, lung weight, reproductive capacity, and longevity, indicating that the C-terminal propeptide of SP-B is not essential for survival. A separate transgenic line (line 1.4) in which the hSP-BΔc transgene was expressed at approximately 1% of wild type SP-B was also bred into the SP-B knockout background. Of 60 offspring from 6 litters no rescued SP-B(−/−) survivors were detected by PCR analyses. To confirm transgene transmission in this line, 2 litters were delivered on day 19 of gestation and analyzed for genotype by PCR. Of 15 offspring, 5 were both transgene-positive and homozygous for the disrupted SP-B allele. In contrast to wild type littermates, these animals rapidly succumbed to respiratory failure, as described previously for SP-B knockout mice (13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar), indicating that the level of hSP-BΔc transgene expression in the 1.4 line was not sufficient to rescue SP-B(−/−) offspring. S1 nuclease analyses of lung tissues from SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice detected only human SP-B RNA confirming the complete absence of mouse SP-B in these animals (Fig. 2). These results were corroborated by in situ hybridization studies (Fig. 3) in which only human SP-B RNA was detected in SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice. Expression of hSP-BΔc RNA was restricted to alveolar type II epithelial cells in contrast to wild type littermates in which endogenous SP-B RNA was expressed in both type II cells and nonciliated bronchiolar cells (Clara cells). The expression of hSP-B mRNA in type II cells was consistently observed in 12 SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) animals of different ages from six separate litters. Quantitation of SP-B protein by ELISA indicated that the level of mature peptide in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was elevated approximately 2-fold in SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice relative to wild type littermates (Fig. 4A). Western blot analyses of lung homogenates from SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) demonstrated that all of the hSP-BΔc precursor was fully processed to the mature 8-kDa peptide (Fig. 4B). In contrast to normal processing of hSP-BΔc, the SP-C proprotein was aberrantly processed resulting in the accumulation of an 11-kDa intermediate as previously reported in SP-B(−/−) mice and human infants (5Nogee L.M. DeMello D.E. Dehner L.P. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 406-410Google Scholar, 13Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). However, unlike SP-B(−/−) mice, levels of the mature SP-C peptide, Mr = 5000, did not appear to be decreased.Fig. 3In situ analyses of lung tissues from a wild type littermate (A and C) and an SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mouse (B and D). Lungs were harvested from 6-week old mice and in situ hybridization performed using 32S-labeled probes specific for either mouse SP-B (A and B) or human SP-B (C and D) as described.

A, SP-B mature peptide was quantitated by ELISA in 6-week old offspring of hSP-BΔc transgenic mice (line 6.1) crossed into the SP-B(−/−) background. A total of 56 mice were analyzed including 9 SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+), 4 wild type, 12 SP-B(+/+)/hSP-BΔc(+/+), 10 SP-B(+/−)/hSP-BΔc(−/−), and 21 SP-B(+/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice. SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) (“rescued” SP-B(−/−) mice) mice contained over 2 times as much total SP-B as the wild type littermates, p = 0.019. B, Western blot analysis of total lung homogenates from 6-week old offspring of hSP-BΔc transgenic mice (line 6.1) crossed into the SP-B(−/−) background: lane 1, SP-B(+/+)/hSP-BΔc(+/+); lane 2, SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+); lanes 3 and 4, SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) (“rescued” SP-B(−/−) mice); lane 5, SP-B(+/−)/hSP-BΔc(−/−); lane 6, wild type mice. Five μg of protein were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing electrophoretic conditions, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibody 28031. SP-B mature peptide monomers, dimers, and trimers are detected at Mr approximately 8,000, 18,000, and 24,000, respectively. Protein standards are shown in kilodaltons to the left of the panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Analysis of SP-C protein expression.

B, the Western blot in A was submerged in a stripping buffer (100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7)) at 50°C for 30 min with agitation, washed twice in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min, blocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, and reprobed with antibody 68514 which detects the N-terminal propeptide of SP-C. Incomplete stripping resulted in the detection of mature SP-C peptide, Mr approximately 5,000, in addition to the processing intermediate, Mr approximately 11,000 (lanes 4 and 5), detected by antiserum 68514. Lane 1 (A) was omitted because of the high signal intensity at Mr = 11,000 resulting from overloading of protein from the 1.4 transgenic line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous ultrastructural analyses of lung tissue from hSP-BΔc(+/+) transgenic mice (line 6.1) indicated that type II cell structure was not affected by expression of hSP-BΔc or increased levels of SP-B mature peptide (12Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of hSP-BΔc in SP-B(−/−) mice resulted in the formation of greatly enlarged lamellar bodies (Fig. 6C) containing normal concentric lamellar membranes in approximately 20% of type II cells. Closely apposed lamellar bodies were observed, and in many instances, lamellar bodies appeared to be coalescing, suggesting that the increased size of these inclusions was related in part to increased fusion (Fig. 6D). Enlarged and/or fusing lamellar bodies were detected in all type II cells of SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice but never observed in wild type littermates or hSP-BΔc transgenic mice. Typical tubular myelin profiles were readily detected in SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice indicating that SP-BΔc was sufficient to restore this ultrastructural feature of extracellular surfactant in SP-B(−/−) mice (not shown). Other ultrastructural abnormalities were not detected in the lungs of SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice, and ultrastructural features of nonciliated bronchiolar cells were indistinguishable from Clara cells in wild type mice. Intracellular and extracellular pool sizes of Sat PC were estimated in 32 SP-B(−/−)/SP-BΔc(+/+) mice and 36 wild type mice from precursor incorporation studies (Fig. 7). The alveolar Sat PC pool size, estimated from alveolar lavage samples, was similar in the two groups. The lung tissue pool of Sat PC was increased 30% in SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice compared with wild type mice, and the amount of Sat PC in total lung was increased 23% (calculated as the sum of the alveolar and tissue Sat PC). The percent of the total lung Sat PC recovered by alveolar lavage was 20.9 ± 0.4% in SP-B(−/−)/hSP-BΔc(+/+) mice and 27.7 ± 0.5% in wild type mice (p < 0.0001) consistent with increased size and number of lamellar bodies noted in the ultrastructural studies. There were no differences between the two groups of mice in body weight (S"

These structures are thought to be one of the unique features of the N-glycans of neural tissues. To examine the intracellullar role of GnT-III expression and its product in neural cells, its gene was overexpressed in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells which normally express a low level of GnT-III. In the GnT-III gene-transfected cells, lectin blot analysis showed that some glycoproteins showed increased levels of bisecting GlcNAc structures. Following treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) the control cells showed neurite outgrowth for differentiation whereas the transfectants showed no morphological response or change in the rate of cell growth. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trk/NGF receptor was detected at 5-15 min after NGF treatment in control cells, but not detected in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells despite the intact binding of NGF to the cells. Moreover the dimerization of Trk with NGF treatment was not induced in the GnT-III transfectant as compared with the dimerization seen in control cells. These results indicate that overexpression of GnT-III gene in PC12 cells affects some functions of glycoprotein receptors such as Trk by alteration of N-glycan structures, and results in changes in the intracellular signaling pathway of tyrosine phosphorylation modified by NGF. β-1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III: EC 2.4.1.144) is a pivotal glycosyltransferase which participates in branch formation by catalysis of the synthesis of a bisecting GlcNAc structure in N-glycans.

The marked changes in the sugar chain structures of cell surface membrane occurring during ontogenesis and oncogenesis suggest that they play pivotal roles in cell differentiation and proliferation (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Google Scholar). In the case of glycoproteins, N- and O-glycans are expressed in the majority of cell surface and secreted proteins (2Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Annu. Rev.

In such tissues, it is known that the level of polysialyl N-glycans decreases in the neural cell adhesion molecule as these cells mature. This indicates that the sugar chains of the neural cell adhesion molecule regulate the cell-cell interaction in neural tissues (5Friedlander D.R. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. J.

Although the polysialyl sugar chain structure is one characteristic of most neural tissues, some unique differences for the N-glycans of mouse brain have been reported (9Shimizu H. Ochiai K. Ikenaka K. Mikoshiba K. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 334-338Google Scholar). Among them, a bisecting GlcNAc structure, which is biosynthesized by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:β-D-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III: EC 2.4.1.144), has been found (Fig. 1). GnT-III is one of the pivotal glycosyltransferases which participates in the branching of N-glycans (10Taniguchi N. Ihara Y. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 733-738Google Scholar), and produces an unique sugar chain structure, a bisecting GlcNAc (11Narasimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Google Scholar). GnT-III has been purified from rat kidney and the rat (12Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Google Scholar), human (13Ihara Y.

Such high levels for the expression of GnT-III mRNA seem to be compatible with the existence of unique N-glycan structures in brain including bisecting GlcNAc. Several experimental approaches have been used to elucidate the role of GnT-III in cultured cells (15Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28311-28315Google Scholar, 16Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Ohnishi A. Ijuhin N. Nishiura T. Kanakura Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 412-418Google Scholar). In mouse melanoma B16 cells, GnT-III gene induction resulted in changes in their N-glycan structures and suppressed the metastatic potential of the original cells (17Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Google Scholar). This implies that GnT-III also has important functions in neural tissues since melanoma cells are also of neural origin. In the present study, we have investigated the biological roles of GnT-III expression and its bisecting GlcNAc product in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by introduction of the GnT-III gene. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo). PC12 and the GnT-III gene-transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and 0.1 mg/ml of kanamycin under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. NGF (TaKaRa, Japan) was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml to induce PC12 differentiation. Rat GnT-III cDNA clone C4 (12Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Google Scholar) was deleted at its 5′ non-coding region and the cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence was inserted into the pMEP4 (Invitrogen) EcoRI site to obtain the final construct, pMEPrIII. The pMEP4 is a mammalian expression vector with the metallothionein IIa gene enhancer/promoter (18Richards R.I. Heguy A. Karin M. Cell. 1984; 37: 263-272Google Scholar) also includes the hygromycin-resistant gene. PC12 cells used for transfection of cDNA were plated in a 10-cm plastic culture dish coated with collagen to a density of 1 × 106/ml cells. After 24 h the medium was removed and the cells washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and changed to serum-free DMEM. The pMEPrIII vector (20 μg) was mixed with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 μl of this solution was added to PC12 cells. After 5 h incubation the medium was changed to the original as described above. Stable transfectants were screened with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. Cell pellets were homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitors, and the supernatant after removal of the nucleus fraction by centrifugating for 20 min at 900 × g was used for the assays. GnT-III, GnT-V, and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase activities were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography methods described previously (19Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Google Scholar, 20Nishiura T. Fujii S. Kanayama Y. Nishikawa A. Tomiyama Y. Iida M. Karasuno T. Nakao H. Yonezawa T. Taniguchi N. Tarui S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5345-5350Google Scholar) using the fluorescence-labeled sugar chain (GlcNAcβ-1,2-Manα-1,6-[GlcNAcβ-1,2-Manα-1,3-] Manβ-1,4-GlcNAcβ-1,4-GlcNAc-pyridylamino) as the substrate. Samples of wild type and gene transfectant cell extracts containing 5 μg of protein were electrophoresed on 8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (21Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 784-794Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated with biotin-conjugated lectins (2 μg/ml biotinylated E-PHA or 2 μg/ml biotinylated L-PHA; Honen Corp. Tokyo) using the buffer systems as described (21Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 784-794Google Scholar). Lectin reactive proteins were detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and the blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GnT-III gene-transfected PC12 cells and their controls were cultured with or without 50 ng/ml NGF and then disrupted in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM APMSF, 5 mM aprotinin, 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM iodoacetamide). The cell-free lysates were adjusted to the same protein concentration and immunoprecipitated with the C-14 Trk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The precipitate was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted samples were then characterized by immunoblot or lectin blot analyses as described above. For the detection of phosphorylated tyrosine residues, a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol after blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS. The blots were detected by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) and developed with the ECL kit. Phosphorylation of Trk with or without NGF was estimated by immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled Trk as described previously (22Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Guroff G. Fujiki N. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1540-1547Google Scholar). In brief, cells were preincubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml) was then added and incubated with the cells for 1 h. After 5 min of NGF (50 ng/ml) treatment, cells were lysed and Trk was immunoprecipitated as described above. The precipitates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography using a Fuji Film imaging plate for the BAS2000 Bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Japan). Growth of GnT-III gene transfectants and control PC12 cells was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (23Qian F. Vaux D.L. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 335-347Google Scholar). Plates of 96 wells, each containing 2 × 104 cells in 200 μl, were cultured with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 12 h and [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added to each well. After 6 h of incubation at 37°C the cells were harvested and [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was measured with the Betaplates system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml and cultured for 12 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (PBS(−) with 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2) and incubated with 500 μl of the binding buffer containing various concentrations (0.37-10 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled NGF at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS(−) and lysed with 1 M NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. To estimate the specific binding of NGF to the cells, NGF binding assay using 125I-labeled NGF was also performed in the presence of various amounts of cold NGF (0.02-500 ng). Cells (2 × 106) were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in the binding buffer as described under the method for NGF binding. NGF was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and the cells were incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The chemical cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) was added to a final concentration 0.5 mg/ml. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and quenched by washing with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cross-linked cells were lysed and subjected to the immunoblot analysis of Trk as described above. To investigate the functional role of GnT-III gene transfection and its bisecting GlcNAc sugar chain product, during neural cell differentiation and development, a GnT-III gene expression vector, MEPrIII, was employed. This inserted rat GnT-III cDNA downstream of the metallothionein IIa promoter, which was then transfected into PC12 cells using a LipofectAMINE complex. The hygromycin resistant transfectants were screened as described under “Materials and Methods.” The specific activity of GnT-III for each clone was assayed and then three high activity transfectants (PC12-III-1, −2, and −3) were randomly taken and used in succeeding experiments. As shown in Table I, GnT-III activity was elevated about 4-6 times over the wild type or mock transfectant (PC12-hyg). GnT-V and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase activities assayed as the control glycosyltransferases showed no significant changes.Table IGlycosyltransferase activities of control and GnT-III gene transfected PC12 cellsGnT-IIIGnT-Vβ-1,4-GTpmol/h/mg proteinPC122201201530PC12-hyg1901401390PC12-III-112701101350PC12-III-29701141420PC12-III-38101201300 Open table in a new tab PC12 cell differentiates and forms neurites under NGF treatments (24Greene L.A.

Academic Press, New York1980: 373-414Google Scholar). To test the role of overexpressed GnT-III and its bisecting GlcNAc sugar chain product on NGF induced differentiation, parental, mock transfectants, and GnT-III gene transfected PC12 cells were cultured with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days and cell morphologies were compared. Fig. 2 shows the morphology of cells cultured with NGF. After 5 days of treatment, cell proliferation was reduced and neurite formation was observed in the case of PC12 and the PC12-hyg, a mock transfectant. However, the GnT-III gene transfectants showed no neurite formation, and cell proliferation was not affected (PC12-III-1 and −2 representing the transfectants were shown). To test the effect of GnT-III expression on proliferation of PC12 cells, their growth rate was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, part a, the cell growth was suppressed in the case of control cells under NGF treatment, compared with the cells without NGF treatment. But no suppression of cell growth was observed in the case of GnT-III gene-transfected cells with NGF treatment (Fig. 3A, part b). DNA synthesis was also evaluated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. As shown in Fig. 3B, the thymidine incorporation was decreased in the case of control cells under NGF treatment compared with the cells without NGF. But the decrease was not observed in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells with NGF treatment. To investigate the change of sugar component of glycoproteins from cell lysates between control and GnT-III gene-transfected cells, lectin blot analyses were performed using E- and L-PHA. E-PHA preferentially binds to sugar chains containing a bisecting GlcNAc structure which is the product of GnT-III (26Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14753-14755Google Scholar). In contrast L-PHA binds to structures of complex type N-glycans containing 3 or 4 branches including GlcNAcβ-1,6, which is the product of GnT-V (27Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Google Scholar). In the case of control cells, after 5 days of treatment with NGF, E-PHA reactivity showed no significant change but L-PHA reactivity was slightly increased in the glycoproteins of 80-95 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 1 of L-PHA). In the case of GnT-III gene-transfected cells, E-PHA reactivity to glycoproteins of about 98 kDa showed a marked increase compared with control cells without NGF treatment (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3 of E-PHA, arrow). However, after 5 days of treatment with NGF, the L-PHA reactivity to glycoproteins showed no significant change in contrast to the case for control cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3 of L-PHA). These data showed that some glycoproteins were modified by overexpression of GnT-III activity and E-PHA reactive glycoproteins increased. These E-PHA reactive glycoproteins produced by overexpression of GnT-III activity may suppress the appearance of L-PHA reactive glycoproteins noted in the differentiated PC12 cells after 5 days treatment with NGF. During this period, no significant change was found in the enzyme activity levels of glycosyltransferases GnT-III, −V, and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase as the result of treatment with NGF (data not shown). To determine the effect of NGF signaling in GnT-III gene-transfected cells, the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk was investigated. In Fig. 5A, control and GnT-III gene-transfected PC12 cells that had been cultured with NGF were harvested at the indicated time (0, 5, 15, and 30 min) after treatment and lysed. From each cell lysate sample, Trk was immunoprecipitated with anti-Trk antibody and subjected to blotting analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and anti-Trk antibody. In Fig. 5A, tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk was detected after 5-15 min of NGF treatment in control cells. However, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in the case of Trk from GnT-III gene-transfected cells. In Fig. 5B, phosphorylation of Trk with NGF treatment was also estimated using [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells. Despite an apparent signal of 32P-labeled Trk in control cells, no signal was detected in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells under NGF treatment. Similar results were obtained in other GnT-III gene transfectants (data not shown). These results suggest that the function of Trk may be abolished by changes in its sugar chain structure and then lead to disruption of tyrosine phosphorylation. Such an effect is consistent with failure to respond to NGF as found in the GnT-III gene-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 2). Trk was immunoprecipitated and subjected to lectin blot analyses. In Fig. 6, although the expression level of Trk protein showed no significant difference between control and the GnT-III gene-transfected cells, the results showed that reactivity to E-PHA increased in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells (lane 2 of E-PHA) compared with controls (lane 1 of E-PHA). A faint broad band reactive to L-PHA was detected in the control cells (lane 1 of L-PHA) but decreased in the transfected cells (lane 2 of L-PHA). Concanavalin A, which prefers to bind high mannose-type glycans, showed no reactivity to both of the immunoprecipitated Trks from control and GnT-III gene-transfected cells (data not shown). This indicates that Trk is also one of the glycoproteins affected by GnT-III overexpression. Using 125I-labeled NGF, NGF binding to control and GnT-III gene-transfected cells was investigated as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, there is no significant difference in the binding between control and the gene-transfected cells. To clarify the precise mechanism of disruption of Trk function in the GnT-III gene transfectants under NGF treatment, Trk dimerization by NGF was investigated. The cell surface proteins were cross-linked with 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) under NGF treatment as described under “Materials and Methods.” After cross-linking, cell lysates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Trk antibody. In Fig. 8, control cells showed a typical homodimer form of Trk (about 300 kDa) after 5 min treatment of NGF. But the dimerization of Trk was not observed in the gene-transfected cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that the change of sugar chain structure of Trk by GnT-III causes the functional change in Trk, and disrupts the dimerization of Trk leading to non-autophosphorylation in the gene transfectants under NGF treatment, despite the intact binding of NGF to the cells. Certain N-glycan structures of glycoproteins appear to play an important role in neural cell development (3Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 728-732Google Scholar, 4Metzler M. Gertz A. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Schrader J.W. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2056-2065Google Scholar). GnT-III is one of the pivotal enzymes which regulates N-glycan branch structure, and the enzyme activity is high in such mammalian tissues as brain and kidney (14Bhaumik M. Seldin M.F. Stanley P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 295-300Google Scholar, 28Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated some of the biological functions of GnT-III expression and its bisecting GlcNAc product in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. These cells have very low GnT-III activities despite their neural origin. A GnT-III expression vector, whose expression was controlled by the metallothionein IIa promoter, was transfected into PC12 cells using a lipid complex, and the positive clones were screened by hygromycin resistance. In the case of GnT-III gene transfectants, the sugar chain structure of N-glycans was modified and especially some specific 98-kDa proteins showed increases in their level of bisecting GlcNAc as resulted by their reactivity with E-PHA. At present, it is not clear why some specific glycoproteins are susceptible to GnT-III overexpression. Conformation of N-glycosylation sites in each glycoprotein may affect the susceptibility to GnT-III action, and determine the sugar chain structure of each glycoprotein in the cells. In the case of GnT-III gene-transfected mouse melanoma B16 cells, we also experienced that specific 80- and 95-kDa proteins were enhanced in E-PHA reactivity (17Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Google Scholar). But in both of PC12 and B16 transfectants, these specific target glycoproteins could not be identified, and further investigations will be required. The PC12 cells were found to be a most useful and popular model for the study of the actions of NGF and cell differentiation (24Greene L.A. Tischer A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar, 29Guroff G. Bottenstein J. Sato G. Cell Culture in the Neurosciences. Plenum, New York1984: 245-271Google Scholar). We have investigated the biological effect of GnT-III gene transfection into PC12 cells and found that they were not responsive to NGF as indicated by the rate of cell growth and morphological changes. These results indicated that such regulation and differentiation of PC12 cells were markedly modified by modulation of the sugar chain structure of several glycoproteins regulating their cellular differentiation. In the mechanism of NGF action, it appears to relate to the phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (30Halegoua S. Patrick J. Cell. 1980; 22: 571-581Google Scholar, 31Nakanishi N. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7791-7799Google Scholar, 32Landreth G.E. Rieser G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 677-683Google Scholar). The NGF signaling pathway is known to be initiated by the direct binding of NGF to the high affinity NGF receptor/Trk proto-oncogene. This receptor is a protein tyrosine kinase and its activity and autophosphorylation are activated in response to NGF (33Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Google Scholar, 34Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Pang L. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 217-233Google Scholar). In attempts to clarify the molecular mechanism of the non-responsiveness to NGF of GnT-III gene-transfected PC12 cells, the role of Trk was investigated. The Trk receptor has 13 potential N-glycosylation sites in its molecule (35Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Google Scholar), and any of these potential sugar chain attachments might be modified. To test the function of Trk, after treatment of the cells with NGF, Trk was immunoprecipitated and then the tyrosine phosphorylation level was estimated by immunoblot analysis using a phosphotyrosine antibody. Surprisingly, in the case of GnT-III gene transfectant, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of Trk was not increased compared with the increase seen in the control PC12 cells after adding NGF (Fig. 5). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk is known to be accompanied with dimerization of Trk under NGF treatment (36Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Google Scholar). In the case of GnT-III gene transfectant, this dimerization did not occur even under NGF treatment as compared with the control, despite the intact binding of NGF to the cells. These data suggest that the change of sugar chain structure of Trk by overexpressed GnT-III activity affects its conformation of protein and causes disturbance of the dimerization, and disrupts its signal transduction under NGF treatment. Laconte et al. (37Leconte I. Auzan C. Debant A. Rossi B. Clauser E. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 17415-17423Google Scholar) have previously shown that the N-glycans of the insulin β subunit receptor were essential for transmembrane signaling in Chinese hamster ovary cells by studies in which this receptor had been modified by site-directed mutagenesis of its N-glycosylation sites. Our present study also supports the importance of N-glycans in the cellular signaling systems, and provides further mechanical evidence of N-glycan function in the cellular signaling. It has been recently reported that the GM1 ganglioside can bind to Trk and activate its autophosphorylation (38Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Google Scholar) and prevent apoptosis of PC12 cells (39Ferrari G. Anderson B.L. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Google Scholar). Mutoh et al. (38Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Google Scholar) also reported that the binding of GM1 to Trk was inhibited by blocking of N-glycosylation using tunicamycin, and this suggests the importance of N-glycosylation on Trk in its biological function. The relationship of sugar structures of glycolipid GM1 and glycoprotein in the mechanism of the NGF signaling pathway is not clear, but appears to relate to the existence of a novel regulation of Trk activation. In the case of neuroblastoma GOTO cells, the GnT-III activity level is high in the subconfluent state, but drastically decreases in the confluent state of the cells. This suggests that the regulation of GnT-III activity relates to the regulational system of cell proliferation (21Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 784-794Google Scholar). Similar phenomena were also observed in the case of sialyltransferase activity during cell growth in HepG2 cells (40Hahn T.J. Goochee C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23982-23987Google Scholar). If cell proliferation is partially controlled by modulation of intracellular growth signaling due to autonomous regulation of sugar chain biosynthesis, cell growth associated changes of glycosyltransferase levels could relate to a feed-back like regulatory function. Although the present study has been concerned in part with the NGF-Trk signaling pathway in PC12 cells, investigations of other pathways offer attractive areas of investigation. Very recently Canossa et al. (41Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Google Scholar) have reported that the low affinity NGF receptor (p75NGFR) could accelerate Trk-mediated signaling, and activate some p75NGFR-associated protein kinases. To assess the glycosylation change of p75NGFR in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells, p75NGFR was immunoprecipitated from control and GnT-III gene-transfected cells using a rabbit anti-mouse p75NGFR polyclonal antibody (Chemicon Int. Inc.) which can also react to rat p75NGFR, and subjected to the lectin blot analysis using E- and L-PHA as described in the case of Trk. Even in the GnT-III gene-transfected cells, no increase of E-PHA reactivity was observed (data not shown), and suggested that p75NGFR was not affected by GnT-III overexpression. p75NGFR has one N-glycan in its extracellular domain and the removal of the N-glycosylation site does not affect the NGF binding to the non-glycosylated p75NGFR (42Baldwin A.N. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4594-4602Google Scholar). This implies that N-glycosylation in p75NGFR may be not important for its function. Taken together, in the NGF-associated signaling of PC12 cells, we conclude that GnT-III overexpression mainly affects Trk itself but not another known pathway of p75NGFR. However, to clarify the precise functional correlation between Trk and N-glycosylation, further investigations of Trk function with its modified N-glycosylation should be required using various cell models expressing Trk. Our studies demonstrate that a specific N-glycan structural change affects some receptor glycoprotein functions, and causes modulation of a cell biological function such as cell differentiation. Until now it has been believed that a sugar chain mainly functions outside of the cell but we have found that the modulation of sugar chain structures can lead to the modulation of various biological functions by affecting intracellular events such as signal transduction pathways.

The CD data indicate that, in acidic water, at concentration below 0.8 mM, the peptide exists in a predominantly coil structure while at higher concentration it can form helical aggregates; addition of small amounts of trifluoroethanol induces a secondary structure, mostly due to the presence of helical elements. Using NMR-derived constraints, an ensemble of conformers for the peptide has been determined by restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Analysis of the converged three-dimensional structures indicates that a significant population of them adopts an amphipathic α-helical conformation that, depending upon experimental conditions, presents a variable extension in the stretch Leu6-Tyr20. An equilibrium with nonhelical structured conformers is also observed. We suggest that the capability of the peptide to modulate its secondary structure as a function of the medium dielectric constant, as well as its ability to form helical aggregates by means of intermolecular hydrophobic interactions, can play a significant role for G-protein activation.

It is composed of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of about 55 kDa, exhibiting absorption and fluorescence spectra typical for a flavoprotein and similar to the SQR from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limnetica. From N-terminal and tryptic peptide sequences of the pure protein a genomic DNA clone was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Its sequence contains an open reading frame of 1275 base pairs (EMBL nucleotide sequence data base, accession no. X97478X97478) encoding the SQR of R. capsulatus. The deduced polypeptide consists of 425 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 47 kDa and a net charge of +9. The high similarity (72%)/identity (48%) between the N termini of the cyanobacterial and the bacterial enzyme was confirmed and extended. Both enzymes exhibit the FAD/NAD(P) binding betaalphabeta-fold (Wierenga, R. K., Terpstra, P., and Hol, W. G. S. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 187, 101-107). The complete sequence of the SQR from R. capsulatus shows further similarity to flavoproteins, in particular glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. The cloned sqr was expressed in Escherichia coli in a functional form."

We investigated the role of cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes in these regulatory mechanisms. Generation of ROM in cultured rat mesangial cells was inhibited by selective inhibitors of PDE4, rolipram and denbufylline, whereas PDE3 inhibitors, cilostamide and lixazinone, had no effect. Conversely, cilostamide or lixazinone suppressed mitogenic synthesis of DNA in mesangial cells, but 1 μM rolipram or 1 μM denbufylline showed no inhibitory effect. The efficacy of PDE isozyme inhibitors (IC50) to suppress [3H]thymidine incorporation or ROM generation paralleled IC50 values for inhibition of cAMP PDE. Incubation of mesangial cells with either rolipram alone or with cilostamide alone increased significantly in situ activity of PKA in mesangial cells, assessed by (−cAMP/+cAMP) PKA activity ratio, and the stimulatory effects were additive. Results indicate that in mesangial cells a cAMP pool that is metabolized by PDE4 activates PKA and thereby inhibits ROM generation; another cAMP pool that is metabolized by PDE3 activates another PKA (isozyme or pool) which suppresses proliferation of mesangial cells. We propose that in mesangial cells, a cAMP-PKA pathway that regulates mitogenesis is determined by activity of PDE3, whereas another cAMP-PKA pathway is directed by activity of PDE4 and controls ROM generation.

Using the patch-clamp method in conjunction with phosphatase inhibitors, we investigated whether the run-down phase was the result of dephosphorylation by an endogenous protein phosphatase. In cell-attached patches, cantharidic acid (500 nM), okadaic acid (100 nM), and calyculin A (100 nM), nondiscriminant inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) at these concentrations, caused a significantly greater and sustained response of BKCa to Bt2cGMP. Within 2 min, the response of BKCa to the combination of cantharidic acid and Bt2cGMP was greater than the response to these agents added separately. Incubation of mesangial cells with okadaic acid for 20 min at a concentration (5 nM) specific for PP2A increased the basal open probability of BKCa and completely inhibited rundown after activation by Bt2cGMP. Incubation with calyculin A (10 nM), a more potent inhibitor of PP1, did not affect BKCa activity. In inside-out patches, Bt2cGMP plus MgATP caused a sustained activation of BKCa that was inhibited by exogenous PP2A but not PP1.

In the present study, the interaction of Ang with heparin has been further characterized. The basic cluster Arg-31/Arg-32/Arg-33 has been identified as an important component of the heparin binding site. Mutations of these residues, and of Arg-70 as well, decrease both the affinity of Ang for heparin-Sepharose and the capacity of Ang to support cell adhesion.

The rat CYP7A promoter/reporter activity was strongly stimulated by cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the nuclear hormone receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in a dose-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis in the region of nt −74 to −55 altered this stimulation.

Here we demonstrate that 25 μM MPP+ decreases the content of mitochondrial DNA to about one-third in HeLa S3 cells. On the contrary, 0.1 μM rotenone, which inhibits complex I to the same extent as 25 μM MPP+ in the cells, increases the content of mitochondrial DNA about 2-fold. Hence, the effect of MPP+ on mitochondrial DNA is not mediated by the inhibition of complex I. To examine the replication state of mitochondrial DNA, we measured the amount of nascent strands of mitochondrial DNA. The amount is decreased by MPP+ but increased by rotenone, suggesting that the replication of mitochondrial DNA is inhibited by MPP+. Because the proper amount of mitochondrial DNA is essential to maintain components of the respiratory chain, the decrease of mitochondrial DNA may play a role in the progression of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease-like symptoms caused by the mitochondrial respiratory failure. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), an oxidative metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), is considered to be directly responsible for MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease-like symptoms by inhibiting NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

https://openalex.org/W2146334532,"The role of the protein structural change monitored by absorption band shifts following flash photolysis of CO from myoglobin is discussed in terms of structure-function relationships. Evidence is presented that the Soret band shift does not depend primarily on the covalent linkage of the heme iron to the protein by using the mutation H93G(L) in which the proximal histidine 93 is replaced by glycine and an exogenous ligand L, which coordinates the heme iron but is not covalently bound to the globin. While CO rebinding kinetics depend strongly on the nature of the exogenous ligand L in H93G(L), the magnitude and time evolution of the Soret band shift in a viscous buffer on the nanosecond time scale are hardly perturbed in all cases studied. Comparison of the Soret band and charge transfer Band III shifts demonstrates that both have a similar time dependence on the nanosecond to microsecond time scale following flash photolysis in viscous solvents. We conclude that the nonexponential kinetics of protein relaxation probed by transient absorption band position shifts involves primarily distal coordinates prior to ligand escape. This result agrees with earlier measurements of Soret band shifts in distal pocket mutants of myoglobin (1). We suggest that the band shifts are primarily a response to changes in the electrostatic field around the heme (a transient Stark shift) associated with changes in protein structure that occur following ligand photodissociation."

Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 345-354Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not a mere side effect seen in recombinant systems.The seemingly controversial effect of α2-AR activation on stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity has been attributed to relatively high expression levels of the receptors (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar), cell-type-specific expression of different types of adenylyl cyclases (14Federman A.D. Conklin B.R.

Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Google Scholar). A direct interaction of α2-ARs with Gs protein has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar), while in other cell types, the mechanism for stimulation seems less clear (9Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Näsman J. Savola J-M. Åkerman K.E.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 75-83Google Scholar, 15Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Google Scholar, 19Jones S.B. Halenda S.P. Bylund D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 239-245Google Scholar). In many cases, the stimulatory response has shown subtype selectivity, the stimulation being more pronounced with the α2B subtype compared with the α2A and α2C subtypes (9Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Näsman J. Savola J-M. Åkerman K.E.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 75-83Google Scholar, 13Pepperl D.J. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 802-809Google Scholar, 15Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Google Scholar). This suggests that the G protein coupling domains differ between the subtypes. Different cytoplasmic domains have been implicated in G protein activation and selection both in adrenergic receptors (20Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Google Scholar, 21Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Google Scholar) and other heptahelical receptors (22Wong S.K-F.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the apparent subtype-specific coupling of the mouse α2-AR subtypes, α2A and α2B, when expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells at comparable receptor levels, and to delineate the receptor domain leading to potentiation of cAMP production.DISCUSSIONDuring the last few years, it has become evident that G protein-coupled receptors can couple to multiple G proteins to elicit different cellular responses (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar, 28Dell'Acqua M.L. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5676-5685Google Scholar, 29Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 997-1003Google Scholar, 30Negishi M. Irie A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16122-16127Google Scholar). The α2-ARs have been shown to couple to both negative and positive regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (5Fraser C.M. Arakawa S. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11754-11761Google Scholar, 7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar, 9Jansson C.C. Karp M.

If coupling to both pathways occurs simultaneously but with different potencies, one could expect to obtain a biphasic dose-response curve. With the α2-ARs, this is often the case; an inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production is seen with low concentrations of agonist and a stimulation or potentiation of cAMP production with higher concentrations (5Fraser C.M. Arakawa S. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11754-11761Google Scholar, 7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar, 13Pepperl D.J. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 802-809Google Scholar, 15Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Google Scholar). Earlier studies have indicated that the stimulatory effect of α2-ARs is cell-type-specific (15Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Google Scholar) and/or dependent on the expression level of the receptors (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar). This response also seems to be subtype-specific, the α2B subtype having a more pronounced stimulatory effect than the α2A and α2C subtypes when expressed in the same cells (8Jansson C.C. Marjamäki A. Luomala K. Savola J-M. Scheinin M. Åkerman K.E.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 165-174Google Scholar, 9Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Näsman J. Savola J-M. Åkerman K.E.O. Eur. J.

In the present study, we expressed the mouse α2A- and α2B-AR subtypes in Sf9 cells at comparable expression levels and obtained a marked difference in the coupling specificity between the subtypes. The α2B subtype showed a biphasic dose-response curve with a potentiation of the forskolin stimulation at high concentration of NE, whereas the α2A subtype displayed a monophasic inhibitory dose-response curve. With prolonged infection times, which parallel an increase in receptor density, the maximal inhibition with α2A was increased. This is in contrast to the finding by Eason et al (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar) that an increase in receptor density promotes the stimulatory pathway with the human α2A subtype (α2-C10). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but might involve interspecies variation of the receptor subtypes or differences in the types of G proteins expressed by the two different cell lines used. A reduction in the maximal stimulation with longer infection times for the α2B subtype was also seen, which indicates a more efficient coupling to the inhibitory component at higher expression levels. The imidazoline-like agonist UK14,304 was very weak in eliciting a biphasic response with the α2B subtype. The ability of UK14,304 to promote coupling to a stimulatory pathway with the α2B subtype has been shown to be very weak in Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Phamacol. 1994; 45: 696-702Google Scholar).PTX treatment, which is known to reveal a stimulatory pathway to cAMP production with the α2-ARs (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Google Scholar, 19Jones S.B. Halenda S.P. Bylund D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 239-245Google Scholar, 27Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Phamacol. 1994; 45: 696-702Google Scholar), increased the stimulation over 2-fold with the α2B subtype. This supports the hypothesis that coupling to both pathways occur simultaneously, and thereby, an elimination of either pathway would result in an enhancement of the other. PTX treatment of cells expressing the α2A subtype did not reveal any significant coupling to a stimulatory pathway although the inhibition was abolished. This confirms that the ability of the receptors to potentiate cAMP production is, apart from being related to expression levels, also subtype-specific.Treatment of the cells with CTX, which would abolish the stimulation if it was Gs-mediated, drastically reduced the inhibition with both subtypes but did not seem to affect the stimulatory component with the α2B subtype. These data are difficult to interpret, however, since CTX stimulated the adenylyl cyclase activity several-fold over the forskolin-stimulated activity, and this activity may be difficult to inhibit (9Jansson C.C. Karp M. Oker-Blom C. Näsman J. Savola J-M. Åkerman K.E.O. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 75-83Google Scholar, 32Dittman A.H. Weber J.P. Hinds T.R. Choi E-J. Migeon J.C. Nathanson N.M. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 943-951Google Scholar).α2-AR-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity has been suggested to occur through a rise in intracellular calcium concentration in PC12 cells (15Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24045-24052Google Scholar). Since we observed a small but significant elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in Sf9 cells expressing the α2B subtype when assayed with fura-2 fluorescence (data not shown), we measured the change in cAMP production in the prescence of EGTA. The potentiating response did not differ significantly from the control experiment while EGTA largely prevented the Ca2+ elevation in the fura-2 assay. This suggests that Ca2+ elevation is not the stimulating factor in the α2B-mediated potentiation of cAMP production in these cells although Ca2+ may enhance the stimulatory response.The third intracellular loop of G protein-coupled receptors has been implicated in G protein selectivity and activation (for review, see Ref. 33Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 101-119Google Scholar). When we expressed chimeric α2A-/α2B-ARs with interchange of the i3-loops, the responses with NE were very similar to the parent receptor subtypes. A reduction of the potentiating response of α2B was seen with MCR2, and a reduction of the inhibition of α2A could be seen with MCR1. This may be related to a more efficient coupling to Gi proteins through the i3-loops of the receptors. Another possibility is that the change of the i3-loop might alter the general conformation of the coupling device leading to slightly altered responses.In an earlier study, where part of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the α2A subtype was introduced into the β2-AR, a small reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was seen, suggesting an involvement of the carboxyl-terminal tail in G protein coupling (21Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Google Scholar). In this study, the exchange of the carboxyl-terminal tail in α2A subtype for α2B sequence (MCR3) did not alter the coupling mode for the α2A subtype (Fig. 6), indicating that this domain, if involved in coupling to G proteins in the α2-ARs, probably interacts with a Gi protein. The chimeric receptor MCR4 displayed a typical biphasic dose-response curve. This was also expected since this chimera contains α2B sequences in all the proposed G protein-coupling domains. We also constructed a chimeric α2A receptor with α2B sequence from the amino terminus to the distal end of the i2-loop, but this construct was not expressed at such a density that a functional characterization could be accomplished.When the i2-loop from α2B was introduced into the α2A subtype, the chimeric receptor displayed a biphasic dose-response curve with NE similar to the α2B subtype when assayed 48 h p.i. At an earlier time point (38 h p.i.), the chimeric receptor stimulated cAMP production even more potently than did the native α2B subtype at the same time postinfection. There are two possible explanations for this. First, the chimeric construct was expressed at higher receptor levels than the α2B construct, about 3.8 pmol/mg of protein for MCR5 compared with about 1.5 pmol/mg of protein for the α2B subtype. A higher expression could increase coupling to the stimulatory component and thereby mask a coupling to the inhibitory component. Second, a Gs-coupling domain in the third intracellular loop of the human α2A subtype has been identified based on studies with chimeric α2/5-HT1A receptors (34Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24753-24760Google Scholar). Exchange of the i2-loop from the α2B subtype might result in a receptor that couples more tightly to a stimulating G protein.The i2-loop has been implemented in G protein selectivity in a study using muscarinic m1:β-adrenergic receptor chimeras (22Wong S.K-F. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Google Scholar). The role of the i2-loop in G protein activation has also been studied using synthetic peptides derived from α2-ARs and muscarinic receptors (35Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Google Scholar, 36McClue S.J. Baron B.M. Harris B.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 267: 185-193Google Scholar). In the study by Okamoto and Nishimoto (35Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Google Scholar), the peptide derived from the i2-loop of the human α2A subtype (α2-C10) potently stimulated GTPγS binding to Gs proteins. Although this finding is in contrast to our results that the α2A receptor is strictly inhibiting, other regions of the receptor are probably also involved in governing the selectivity.The i2-loop sequences of the α2A and α2B-ARs differ at six positions when predicted from the cDNA sequences. There are three non-conserved amino acid substitutions between the two subtypes that will change the polarity of the i2-loop, Ser-134, Gln-137, and Leu-143, in the α2A subtype. Single point-mutated receptors with each of these non-conserved residues substituted with corresponding α2B residues showed no clear biphasic responses with NE. In contrast, a double mutant with S134A and L143S responded in a similar way to the α2B subtype. The interpretation of this is that at least these two residues are needed to maintain the integrity of the coupling domain. Interestingly, in the β2-adrenergic receptor, the equivalent residues (Ser-134 and Leu-143) are the same as in the α2B subtype.In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the coupling of α2-ARs to cAMP production is subtype-specific and that the second intracellular loop of the α2B subtype determines the different coupling specificity leading to stimulation of cAMP production. Site-directed mutagenesis of non-conserved amino acid residues indicates that the whole structure of the second intracellular loop is important for efficient coupling. INTRODUCTIONThe α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) 1The abbreviations used are: α2-ARα2-adrenergic receptorG proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinNEnorepinephrinep.i.postinfectionPTXpertussis toxinCTXcholera toxinIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMCRmouse chimeric receptori2-loopsecond intracellular loop. are members of a large family of heptahelical receptors mediating the extracellular stimuli to the interior of the cell through G proteins. Three different subtypes of α2-ARs, α2A, α2B, and α2C, can be distinguished based on the affinity for selective ligands (1Bylund D.B. Ray-Prenger C. Murphy T.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 245: 600-607Google Scholar), and this subdivision has been confirmed with the molecular cloning of three separate genes (2Kobilka B.K. Matsui H. Kobilka T.S. Yang-Feng T.L. Francke U.

A direct interaction of α2-ARs with Gs protein has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

To characterize the molecular structure of GFRP, we have purified it from rat liver using an efficient step of affinity chromatography and isolated cDNA clones, based on partial amino acid sequences of peptides derived from purified GFRP. Comparison between the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified GFRP showed that the mature form of GFRP consists of 83 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 9,542. The isolated GFRP cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with six consecutive histidine residues at its N terminus. The fusion protein was affinity-purified and digested with thrombin to remove the histidine tag. The resulting recombinant GFRP showed kinetic properties similar to those of GFRP purified from rat liver. Cross-linking experiments using dimethyl suberimidate indicated that GFRP was a pentamer of 52 kDa. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements confirmed the pentameric structure of GFRP by giving an average Mr of 49,734, which is 5 times the calculated molecular weight of the recombinant GFRP polypeptide. Based on the pentameric structure of GFRP, we have proposed a model for the quaternary structure of GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I complexes. GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) mediates feedback inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity by tetrahydrobiopterin and also mediates the stimulatory effect of phenylalanine on the enzyme activity. To characterize the molecular structure of GFRP, we have purified it from rat liver using an efficient step of affinity chromatography and isolated cDNA clones, based on partial amino acid sequences of peptides derived from purified GFRP.

Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar, 2Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Google Scholar). The intracellular level of BH4 is subsaturating for these enzyme reactions and thus is thought to be an important regulator of the activities of these enzymes. BH4 is synthesized from GTP by a pathway composed of four enzyme reactions (1Nichol C.H. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar). Most important for regulation of BH4 biosynthesis is GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. GTP cyclohydrolase I is present in many organisms, ranging from bacteria to animal. In bacteria, this enzyme functions as the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of folic acid and not of BH4 (1Nichol C.H. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar). Rat GTP cyclohydrolase I is composed of multiple identical subunits and shows positive cooperativity against GTP (3Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Google Scholar, 4Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Google Scholar).

We have recently reported the identification of a new regulatory protein (GFRP) which mediates the feedback inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I by the end product of this pathway, BH4 (5Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). GFRP and BH4 inhibit the enzyme activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I by decreasing its maximum velocity while having little effect on the affinity of GTP, indicating noncompetitive inhibition. GFRP exerts its inhibitory effect on GTP cyclohydrolase I by forming a complex with GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of BH4 and GTP. Formation of the complex between the two proteins is reversible, depending on the presence of BH4 and GTP. Furthermore, the inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I by GFRP and BH4 is specifically reversed by L-phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is the substrate of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which requires BH4 as a cofactor. Since the stimulatory effect of phenylalanine on GTP cyclohydrolase I activity results in an increase in the rate of BH4 biosynthesis and, in turn, BH4 is used for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, we suggest that this phenomenon be regarded as feed-forward regulation. Although phenylalanine reverses the GFRP-mediated inhibitory effect of BH4 on GTP cyclohydrolase I, the protein complex remains intact in the presence of GTP, BH4, and phenylalanine. Furthermore, phenylalanine alone induces complex formation between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I, and under these conditions, GTP cyclohydrolase I, which shows positive cooperativity against GTP (3Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Google Scholar), changes its kinetic behavior from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. The discovery of GFRP and its function related to phenylalanine revealed the molecular mechanism of a mysterious clinical observation that, in patients with phenylketonuria, the plasma levels of biopterin are increased as are those of phenylalanine (6McInnes R.R. Kaufman S. Warsh J.J. Van Loon G.R. Milstien S. Kapatos G. Soldin S. Walsh P. MacGregor D. Hanley W.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 458-469Google Scholar, 7Kaufman S. Berlow S. Summer G.K. Milstien S.

Thus, the high levels of phenylalanine, which accumulate due to a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, continuously stimulate the rate of BH4 biosynthesis by the stimulatory effect on GTP cyclohydrolase I activity mediated via GFRP. If this mechanism also operates in cells producing catecholamines or nitric oxide, phenylalanine should affect the biosynthesis of these biologically active molecules by regulating the biosynthesis of the rate-limiting cofactor BH4. Thus, GFRP also may be important in these cells. As a first step toward elucidating the molecular mechanism of GFRP action, we have established procedures for the purification, cDNA cloning, and bacterial expression of GFRP. These procedures and the characterization of the subunit structures of GFRP are presented here. In particular, the information on the quaternary structure of GFRP provides important insights into the mechanism of GFRP-mediated GTP cyclohydrolase I regulation. Another method for purifying and cloning GFRP was recently reported by Milstien et al. (10Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Google Scholar). These authors proposed naming the protein GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein (GFRP), a name that is similar to feedback regulator protein for GTP cyclohydrolase I, which we originally designated the protein (5Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). This suggested terminology is adopted here. GTP was obtained from Yamasa (Chiba, Japan). BH4 was a generous gift from the Suntory Institute for Medicinal Research and Development (Gunma, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP was from Amersham Corp. Dimethyl suberimidate was from Pierce. GTP cyclohydrolase I activity was assayed as described (3Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 at 37°C), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM GTP, the enzyme, GFRP, and BH4 and/or phenylalanine. The recombinant rat GTP cyclohydrolase I obtained from the plasmid construct described below was used for the assay and had the same enzymatic properties as GTP cyclohydrolase I purified from rat liver. 2Details of the purification and characterization of the recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase I will be published elsewhere (K. Hatakeyama, and T. Yoneyama, manuscript in preparation). The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 15 min. Then the reaction product, dihydroneopterin triphosphate, was converted to neopterin triphosphate by oxidation with I2 and KI and then dephosphorylated to neopterin by alkaline phosphatase. Finally, neopterin was quantitated by HPLC and fluorescence detection (3Hatakeyama K. Harada T. Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Google Scholar). The concentration of protein was determined using a Bio-Rad dye-binding protein assay kit with bovine γ-globulin as a standard (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein (MBP) vector system (12Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea III, A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.-d. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Google Scholar) was used for the bacterial expression of rat GTP cyclohydrolase I. The NcoI recognition sequence is located around the initiation codon of rat GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA (4Hatakeyama K. Inoue Y. Harada T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 765-769Google Scholar). The plasmid harboring the cDNA (pRGC) was digested with NcoI and then further digested with mung bean nuclease to create a blunt end. Then the plasmid was further digested with HindIII, and the resulting NcoI (blunted)-HindIII fragment was cloned between the SmaI and HindIII sites of a pMALc vector (New England Biolabs Inc.) to generate pMAL-RGC. The pMAL-RGC plasmid contained the entire coding region of GTP cyclohydrolase I except for the initiator methionine, located just after the sequence coding Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg (factor Xa cleavage site), which was attached to the C terminus of MBP. Escherichia coli strain JM109 containing pMAL-RGC was cultured overnight at 37°C. The 5-ml culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of rich medium (New England Biolabs Inc.), which was incubated until A600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 0.6 mM, and the E. coli culture was incubated for an additional 3 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70°C. Half of the bacterial pellet was thawed on ice and sonicated in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 30 mM NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.72 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant solution was recovered, and the precipitate was sonicated again in 2 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged. The supernatants were combined, and the lysate was divided into four parts (each 3 ml) and stored at −70°C. All procedures were done at 4°C unless otherwise stated. Frozen rat livers (120 g) obtained from male Wistar rats were homogenized in 480 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 1 M), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.35 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml E-64 (N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]agmatine; Boehringer Mannheim) by an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged successively at 8,000 rpm for 20 min and then at 42,000 rpm for 1 h to obtain the supernatant solution. The solution was applied to a 250-ml column of DEAE-Toyopearl (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA at a flow rate of 400 ml/h. The column was washed with 400 ml of the homogenization buffer and then eluted with the buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl. The 120-ml eluate was divided into two parts and stored at −70°C until use. The frozen DEAE-Toyopearl eluate was thawed on ice, and the following solution was successively added to the eluate while stirring: 1.2 ml of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.6 ml of 25% Tween 20, 3 ml of the E. coli lysate containing the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein, 65 μl of 1 M DTT, 130 μl of GTP, and 13 μl of 0.1 M BH4. The 67-ml solution was mixed with 14.2 ml of the amylose column equilibration buffer (described below) containing 2 M NaCl. Then the solution was applied to a 15-ml column of amylose (New England Biolabs Inc.) equilibrated with an equilibration buffer of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 500 mM NaCl, 0.22% Tween 20, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM GTP, and 20 μM BH4 (buffer A). The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A and then with 50 ml of buffer A without Tween 20 and eluted with buffer A containing 10 mM maltose and no Tween 20. The eluate was concentrated to 1.7 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centriflow CF-25). The following column operations were done at room temperature. The concentrated solution was applied to a Superose 6 column (1.6 × 47 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with TKE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA) containing 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM GTP, and 20 μM BH4 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing the complex between GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I were combined and concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration. The concentrated solution was filtered through a Sephadex G-25 HR10/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with TKE buffer containing 1 mM DTT and 0.01% Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The 1.5-ml eluate was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to the Superose 6 column equilibrated with the same buffer as that used for Sephadex G-25. The second smaller peak, which eluted after a larger peak of the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein, was collected (see Fig. 1A). The fractions were combined and concentrated to 0.4 ml by ultrafiltration. To verify the homogeneity of the purified preparation of GFRP, 0.1 ml of the final sample was analyzed by DEAE-nonporous resin (Tosoh) HPLC. The column, run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, was washed with 4 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA and then eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of KCl in the equilibration buffer. The single protein peak that eluted at a KCl concentration of 0.17 M was collected (see Fig. 1B). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using the PhastSystem (Pharmacia). After electrophoresis, protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A sample of purified GFRP (3 μg) was directly subjected to amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Model 470A automated gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC apparatus (Model 120A). The purified GFRP (7 μg) also was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (4 pmol; Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) in a solution (150 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 2 M guanidine HCl, and 1 mM DTT at 30°C for 21 h. The digest was injected onto an ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm; Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and separated with a 100-ml gradient of acetonitrile from 5 to 60% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 220 nm, and the peak fractions were collected and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. From the N-terminal and peptide amino acid sequences of GFRP, we designed two sets of mixtures of oligonucleotide primers that cover all possible codons for each amino acid. One set (primers 1 and 3) was used for the first PCR, and the other set (primers 2 and 4) was used for a second, nested PCR (see Fig. 2). From 10 μg of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA as a template, first strand cDNA was synthesized from primer 3 (2.5 μM) by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units). Out of a total of 20 μl, 1 μl of the resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified in a 100-μl reaction using primers 1 (3 μM) and 3 (1 μM). The PCR conditions were 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 2 min of annealing at 48°C, and 1 min of extension at 72°C for 30 cycles. The amplified products were separated on 3% Nusieve agarose GTG (FMC Corp.), and DNA products between 100 and 200 bp in size were isolated because the expected length of cDNA fell in this range. Using the first PCR product as a template, we performed the second PCR with primers 2 (1 μM) and 4 (1 μM) under the same PCR conditions as described above. The amplified ∼130-bp band was isolated and then subcloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Both strands of the inserts were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer. From the sequence of the GFRP cDNA isolated above, two primers (primers 5-1 and 5-2) were designed for performing 5′-RACE (13Frohman M.A. Duch M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). We used the 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primer 5-1 was used for cDNA synthesis, and primer 5-2 was used for PCR amplification with an anchor primer (CLONTECH). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then cloned into a pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene) between the EcoRI and BamHI sites. From the sequence of the GFRP cDNA isolated using mixed primers, two other primers (primers 3-1 and 3-2) were designed for performing 3′-RACE (13Frohman M.A. Duch M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). We used the 3′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.). First cDNA strand was synthesized with an adapter primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Then the first PCR was carried out with primer 3-1 and a universal adapter primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR products were separated on a gel, and products between 0.2 and 1.0 kilobase pair were isolated. Using the isolated PCR products as a template, the second PCR was carried out with primer 3-2 and the universal adapter primer, and the major products were isolated and cloned into a pCRII vector. Two PCR primers were designed to construct a pET expression vector (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar) for GFRP. The E-1 primer was a 36-mer (5′-GGGAATTCCCTTACCTGCTCATCAGCACTC-3′), which contained an NdeI site (underlined) covering the ATG translation start codon of GFRP. The E-2 primer was a 39-mer (5′-GGGAATTCAGGTCATTCCTTGTGCAGACACCAC-3′), which contained a SalI site (underlined) 3 bp downstream of the TGA translation stop codon. The PCR products obtained with the E-1 and E-2 primers were separated on a gel, and the major 230-bp band was isolated. After digestion with NdeI and SalI, the fragment was cloned into plasmid pET-15b (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites. The resulting construct encoded a stretch of six histidine residues (His6 tag) followed by the complete coding region of GFRP. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the His6-GFRP construct (pET-His6-GFRP) was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h, harvested, and frozen. The cells obtained from a 225-ml culture were sonicated in 6 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.3 M NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 0.25% Tween 20, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.72 μg/ml pepstatin, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc.) equilibrated with lysis buffer and washed with lysis buffer and then with an elution solution of 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 5.9), 0.3 M NaCl, and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol containing 20 mM imidazole. The His6-GFRP fusion protein was then eluted from the column with the elution solution containing 0.5 M imidazole. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centriflow CF-25) and filtered through a Sephadex G-25 HR10/10 column equilibrated with 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). To remove the N-terminal histidine residues of the purified His6-GFRP fusion protein, the protein was digested with thrombin, which cleaves at its recognition sequence (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) located between the His6 tag and GFRP. Thrombin cleaves peptides at the carboxylic side of the arginine residue. Ten mg of the protein was digested with 6.6 units of thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim) in 2.77 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2.5 mM CaCl2 at room temperature for 4 days. After the addition of 30 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated to 1.3 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centriflow CF-25). Aliquots (200 μl) of the concentrated solution were separated on a Superdex 75 HR column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.2 M KCl, and 1 mM EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Cross-linking reactions were performed in 100 μl of 50 mM Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.2) containing 0.2 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT or 0.2 M triethanolamine HCl buffer (pH 8 or 9) containing 0.1 mM DTT at a GFRP subunit concentration of 2 or 20 μM. The reaction mixture was prepared on ice. To the mixture was added freshly prepared dimethyl suberimidate to concentrations varying from 0.2 to 25 mM. The resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min or 1.5 h, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 M lysine. Protein was then precipitated using a deoxycholate/Cl3CCOOH procedure (15Benesadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Google Scholar). The precipitates were washed with ethyl ether to remove Cl3CCOOH and dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer. Cross-linked protein was resolved by electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS as described by Weber and Osborn (16Weber K. Osborn M. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Academic Press, New York1975: 179-223Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, protein was stained with silver (17Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were carried out using a Beckman Instruments Optima™ XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. The data were fit using the Origins™ software supplied with the instrument (18McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman-Spinco, Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar). For the fitting, we calculated the molar extinction coefficient and partial specific volume from the composition of recombinant GFRP using the residue values of Perkins (19Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Google Scholar); these were 11,237 M−1 cm−1 and 0.739 cm3/g, respectively. The sedimentation equilibrium experiment utilized three double sector cells and was carried out at three protein concentrations (8, 16, and 24 μM initially), a rotor speed of 16,000 rpm, and 20°C. In each cell, 100 μl of protein solution and 110 μl of buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH, 0.1 M KCl, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.6)) were loaded. The data were collected after 24 h. Corrections for the density of the solvent were based on a value of 1.006 g/ml, calculated from values provided in Ref. 20Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Google Scholar. We affinity-purified GFRP from rat liver by utilizing the fact that it forms a complex with GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of GTP and BH4 and dissociates from the complex in the absence of GTP and BH4 (5Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar). Because GFRP also inhibited the activity of a recombinant form of GTP cyclohydrolase I fused to MBP in the presence of BH4, we inferred that GFRP also formed a complex with the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” partially purified rat liver extracts were mixed with E. coli lysate containing the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein, and then the mixture was supplemented with GTP and BH4. When the mixture was applied to an amylose column, all the enzyme activity and the inhibitory activity were bound to the amylose. Thus, GFRP appeared to bind to the GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein, which in turn was bound to amylose through its MBP portion. Since the amylose fraction also contained endogenous E. coli MBP, the fraction was filtered through Superose gel equilibrated with a buffer containing GTP and BH4 to separate the complex from E. coli MBP. The isolated complex of GFRP and the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein was then filtered through Superose gel equilibrated with a buffer containing neither GTP nor BH4 to separate GFRP from the MBP-GTP cyclohydrolase I fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, a small protein peak was eluted from the column at an elution volume (80 ml) corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa. The peak contained a BH4-dependent inhibitory activity against GTP cyclohydrolase I. When the preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single band was observed (data not shown). To further verify the homogeneity of the preparation, it was analyzed on a DEAE-nonporous resin HPLC column (Fig. 1B). A single peak was eluted from the DEAE column. The flow-through fraction showed absorbance at 280 nm, but did not contain any protein. The fraction from the single peak contained a BH4-dependent inhibitory activity against GTP cyclohydrolase I as shown by enzyme assay and also contained a protein that migrated on SDS gel at the same position as that observed using the Superose fractions. The overall purification of GFRP is summarized in Table I. Thus, an ∼35,000-fold purification in the specific activity of GFRP from rat liver extract was achieved with a yield of 30%.Table I.Purification of GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein from rat liverStepProteinTotal activityaThe activity of GFRP is expressed as the amount of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity that was inhibited.Activity yieldSpecific activityPurificationmgnmol/h%nmol/h/mg-fold1.

Open table in a new tab The subunit molecular mass of GFRP was estimated to be 9.4 kDa by SDS gel analysis, while the apparent native molecular mass of GFRP from gel filtration data was 35 kDa. In addition, a single amino acid (proline) was identified as the N-terminal residue for the purified preparation of GFRP as described below. Therefore, we conclude that GFRP is a protein consisting of multiple identical subunits. The purified preparation of GFRP had the same effect on the kinetic properties of GTP cyclohydrolase I as we reported using partially purified GFRP (5Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3. The activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I was inhibited in the presence of GFRP in a BH4 dose-dependent manner, and the median effective concentration of BH4 was 2 μM (Fig. 3A). The inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I by GFRP at a BH4 concentration of 7 μM was dose-dependently reversed by phenylalanine (Fig. 3B). In the presence of phenylalanine and in the absence of BH4, the substrate velocity curve for GTP cyclohydrolase I activity changed from a sigmoidal form to a hyperbolic form in the presence of GFRP (Fig. 3C). The Hill coefficient decreased from 2.4 to 1.2 in 1 mM phenylalanine. To determine the primary structure of and to establish a bacterial expression system for GFRP, we cloned a cDNA encoding GFRP. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined from a purified preparation of GFRP to be Pro-Tyr-Leu-Leu-Ile-Xaa-Xaa-Gln-Ile-Xaa-Met (Xaa represents unidentified residues). Then purified GFRP was digested by lysyl endopeptidase, and four fractions were isolated and sequenced. Fraction L3 gave no amino acid sequence.

By near UV CD spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the arrangement and mobility of aromatic amino acids in proteins, we have monitored continuously with a time resolution of 5 s the kinetics of structural alterations of the ectodomain of HA isolated from different influenza virus strains (H1 (A/PR 8/34), H2 (A/Japan), and H3 (X31)). To establish a functional correlation to structural alterations of the HA ectodomain reflected by the CD, we have measured the kinetics of the virus-erythrocyte fusion and of the inactivation of fusion by low pH preincubation of viruses. At acidic pH we found a multiphasic behavior of the CD signal recorded at 283 nm. Upon lowering the pH we detected first an increase of the CD amplitude, which is associated with the formation of a fusion-competent state of HA. The initial increase was followed by a continuous decline of CD amplitude, which can be ascribed to a transformation into a fusion-inactivated conformation that is in its early phase reversible as found for A/Japan. The half-time of the different phases of the CD signal depended on the virus strain, the temperature, and the acidic pH. The results support recent hypotheses that the fusion-competent conformation is an intermediate of the fusion-inactivated structure of HA.

The pure Ser-22/Ile-25 (SI form) crambin crystal structure confirms correlations deduced for the natural, mixed sequence form of crambin crystals. Physical separation of the mixed form into pure SI form and Pro-22/Leu-25 (PL form) crambin and the PL form crystal structure determination (Yamano, A., and Teeter, M. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13956-13965) support the proposed (Teeter, M. M., Roe, S. M., and Heo, N. H. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 230, 292-311) correlation model. Electron density of mixed form crambin crystals shows four possible pairs of side chain conformations for heterogeneous residue 22 and nearby Tyr-29 (22 = 4, two conformations for each of two side chains). One combination can be eliminated because of short van der Waals' contacts. However, only two alternates have been postulated to exist in mixed form crambin: Pro-22/Tyr-29A and Ser-22/Tyr-29B. In crystals of the PL form, Pro-22 and Tyr-29A are found to be in direct van der Waals' contact (Yamano, A., and Teeter, M. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13956-13965). Comparison of the SI form structure with the mixed form electron density confirms that the fourth combination of side chains does not occur and that side chain correlations are mediated by water networks."
https://openalex.org/W2069217876,"The purine-cytosine permease (PCP) is an active transporter located in the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae This protein mediates purine (adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine) and cytosine accumulation in the cell by using an electrochemical potential difference in proton as the energy source. Various mutant strains, with altered Kt(app) (apparent Michaelis constant of transport) of uptake for one or several bases, have already been selected. Their cloning and sequencing revealed that three of them presented substitutions in the same region of the putative sequence of the PCP: this region might correspond to the hydrophilic segment 371-377 (I-A-N-N-I-P-N). Two mutants displayed single mutations, resulting in only one amino acid residue change (N377I and N374I, respectively), and the other displayed three amino acid substitutions (I371V, I375V, and N377G). Therefore, to analyze the contribution of individual amino acid changes to the phenotype of the complex mutant, single (N377G) and double (I371V,I375V) mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The influence of single mutations in this region was studied by measuring, for adenine, hypoxanthine, and cytosine, the uptake constants on cells and equilibrium binding parameters on plasma membrane-enriched fractions. Uptake and binding constant determinations showed that all the variations observed for the Kt(app) of uptake were correlated with variations of the binding Kd(app) for the corresponding solutes. Thus, our results emphasize the role of the two asparagine residues, located at positions 374 and 377, respectively, in the binding of the bases. In addition, the sole substitution of the 377 asparagine residue by glycine is responsible for the phenotype of the triple mutant. The effect of pH on the apparent hypoxanthine binding dissociation constant showed that the effects of N377G and N377I changes were, at least partially, due to a shift of the pKa of an ionizable amino acid residue of the unliganded permease. These two amino acid residue changes induced a shift of the pKa of this group in the unliganded, deprotonated permease about two units toward acidic pH. This result suggests that the 371-377 segment might play a key role in the proper three-dimensional structure of the active purine-cytosine permease."

Herein we analyze the heparin-binding domain of CTX using 10 CTXs from Taiwan and African cobra venom. We also performed computer modeling to obtain more information of the binding at molecular level. The results provide a molecular model for interaction of CTX-heparin complex where the cationic belt of the conserved residues on the concave surface of three finger β-sheet polypeptides initiates ionic interaction with heparin-like molecules followed by specific binding of Lys residues near the tip of loop 2 of CTX. The dissociation constants of CTXs differ by as much as 4 orders of magnitude, ranging from ∼140 μM for toxin γ to ∼20 nM for CTX M3, depending on the presence of Lys residues near the tip of loop 2. High affinity heparin binding becomes possible due to the presence of Arg-28, Lys-33, or the so-called consensus heparin binding sequence of XKKXXXKRX near the tip of the loop.

Many physiological functions, including wound healing, cell attachment and spreading, recruitment of inflammatory cells (chemokines), and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (cytokines) are ascribed to them (for reviews, see Refs. 3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellen L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar and 4Linhardt R.L. Chem. & Ind. 1991; : 45-50Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitous and abound at cell surfaces, wherefrom they control the entry or availability of approaching entities (3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellen L.

In view of the growing importance of functional role of heparin binding protein being identified, significant effort has been devoted, but with contradictory results, to elucidate the so-called heparin binding consensus sequence (11Spillman D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Google Scholar). An attempt to identify a heparin binding motif by linearly aligning a broad collection of alleged heparin binding sequences has been made and a consensus, XBBXBX and XBBBXXBX derived (12Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some of the proteins most affected by heparin do not contain this sequence in their heparin binding site (Ref. 13Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, recent analysis of heparin binding sites of human antithrombin III (14Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Google Scholar) points to the requirement of Lys residues outside the previously proposed pentasaccharide binding region. This implies that complicated structural features other than simple cluster of basic residues must operate, and a well defined binding motif remains to be elucidated. The recently solved heparin-basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) co-crystal structure (15Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Google Scholar) will promote our understanding further. Cobra venom CTXs are a family of highly homologous, small (∼60-62 amino acids), basic, water-soluble, but membrane- active, polypeptides with well defined three-finger loop β-sheet structures (16Sun Y.-J. Wu W. Chiang C.-M. Hsin Y.-A. Hsiao C.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2403-2413Google Scholar, 17Bilwes A. Rees B. Moras D. Ménez R. Ménez A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9177-9186Google Scholar, 20Rees B. Bilwes A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 385-406Google Scholar). Also known as cytotoxins, they target a variety of cell types, in particular cardiac myocytes (21Dufton M.J. Hider R.C. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergammon Press Inc., Elmsford, NY1991: 259-302Google Scholar, 22Fletcher J.E. Jiang M.-H. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 669-695Google Scholar). Although their binding to phospholipids is demonstrated (23Chien K.-Y. Huang W.-N. Jean J.-H. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Google Scholar, 24Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.-M. Hseu Y.-C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Google Scholar), lipids alone cannot account for their high specificity. We have recently suggested that sulfated oligosaccharide may be a target of CTX action and that this binding potentiates its penetration into phospholipid membrane (10Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C-M. Chi L-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this interaction and the amino acid residues involved remain to be determined. We undertook a study of interaction of 10 CTXs isolated from venom of Naja atra, 2According to recently revised nomenclature for the asiatic cobra, N. naja, species (25Wüster W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 399-406Google Scholar). Naja mossambica and Naja nigricollis with heparin for the following reasons. Cardiotoxins are highly homologous and their three-dimensional structures are superimposable (for review, see Ref. 20Rees B. Bilwes A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 385-406Google Scholar). Differing in some cases by as little as one residue, these naturally occurring variants present themselves as a series of readily available basic proteins that might allow establishment of trends underlying the interaction of basic β-sheet proteins with anionic carbohydrates of the cell surface. This approach, though less specific than site-directed mutagenesis, can be directly applicable in understanding the toxicity of cobra venom. For instance, the results of the present study shows that all the toxins, and some PLA2 from the same venom, bind to heparin, albeit with varying avidity. Furthermore, we analyzed heparin-induced conformational change of CTXs by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic and computer molecular dynamic (MD) modeling methods to address the questions of binding motif and stoichiometry of CTX-heparin complex. The proposed model reveals a new type of β-sheet heparin-binding motif with structural feature to explain the high-affinity of three-finger toxins with receptors. Crude venom from Naja naja atra, Naja mossambica mossambica and Naja nigricollis nigricollis (according to previous nomenclature) was purchased from Sigma. Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosal) of average Mr 15,000 (HMW heparin) and homolytically depolymerized heparin of average Mr 3,000 (LMW heparin) used in this study were also purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Egg sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Inc. CTXs from N. atra and N. mossambica venom were purified by SP-Sephadex C-25 ion exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC and assayed for hemolytic and fusion activities as described (23Chien K.-Y. Huang W.-N. Jean J.-H. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Google Scholar, 24Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.-M. Hseu Y.-C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Google Scholar). Toxin γ (Tγ) was purified from venom of N. nigricollis according to Fryklund and Eaker (26Fryklund L. Eaker D. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2865-2871Google Scholar). Purity of CTXs, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical reverse phase HPLC, was found to be higher than 99%. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method. Heparin-induced structural change in CTXs was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded on AVIV 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ); details of calibration of the spectrometer are reported (19Chiang C.-M. Chang S.-L. Lin H.-J. Wu W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9177-9186Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, due to technical difficulty in monitoring ellipticity at 195 nm using high ionic strength buffer. Typically, 20 μM CTX was titrated against HMW or LMW heparin, and at each point, the solution was incubated for 3 min at room temperature before scanning. Titrations in the reverse order were performed similarly by titrating 20 μM of LMW heparin against CTX. Spectra, average of four repeats, were obtained by scanning from 260 to 190 nm. A 1-mm cell, bandwidth of 1 nm, and time constant of 1 s were used to collect data, reported as ellipticity in millidegrees. Temperature was maintained at 25°C. Heparin-induced structural perturbation was analyzed according to change in ellipticity around 192-195 nm. Intrinsic fluorescence intensity of Tyr or Trp of CTXs was monitored to determine dissociation constant of the toxins with HMW heparin as reported (10Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C-M. Chi L-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Google Scholar). Briefly, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 285 nm and 318 nm for Tyr and at 291 nm and 345 nm for Trp, respectively, by using SLM 4800 fluorescence spectrometer. The dissociation constant, Kd, was determined by non-linear least squares fitting of data by assuming that n independent, but equivalent, binding sites are present in heparin using the following equation,Kd=H0−[HC]C0−n[HC]/[HC](Eq. 1) where [Co], [Ho] and [HC] are concentrations of CTX, heparin, and CTX-heparin complex respectively. By using the fluorescence intensity, F, as an indication of the fraction of binding, Equation 1 can be reformulated as the following three equations which can be used to simulate the experimental fluorescence intensity of CTXs as a function of heparin concentration.Fx=F0+Fs−F0X(Eq. 2) X=nH0+C0+Kd−Y/2C0(Eq. 3) Y=nHo+Co+Kd2−4nCoHa1/2(Eq. 4) where Fx is fluorescence intensity and Fo, Fs are intensities when CTX is free and at saturation respectively. Complete (100%) binding was assumed to occur when the fluorescence intensity reached a plateau. Change in turbidity of samples was monitored using Beckmann DU-70 spectrophotometer. Typically, CTXs in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were titrated against LMW heparin and the A320 was monitored at each point. In some cases, a reverse titration with constant LMW heparin (20 μM) against increasing CTX concentrations was also studied to reveal the binding mode of CTXs with LMW heparin. The procedure and result are similar to our previous experiment with HMW heparin, but the extent of aggregation as monitored by optical density is in general higher than that detected for HMW heparin. To determine the relative affinities of CTXs, crude venom (3.0-3.8 mg) from N. atra, N. mossambica, and N. nigricollis was loaded onto Heparin-Sepharose column (HiTrap, 1 ml, Pharmacia), fitted to Bio-Rad FPLC system. The column was washed extensively with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and bound fractions were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The eluted fractions were analyzed for protein concentration by measuring A230 using Beckmann DU-70 spectrophotometer. The assignment of respective toxin peaks was done by comparing the HPLC retention times of the fractions with that of purified toxins. CTX activity of each fraction was assayed by adding 100 μl aliquots of the fraction to a solution containing 20 mM sphingomyelin vesicles in a total volume of 1 ml 10 mM Tris buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and monitoring the fusion/aggregation activity of the vesicles at A450 as described (23Chien K.-Y. Huang W.-N. Jean J.-H. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Google Scholar). PLA2 activity of eluates was assayed, by adding 100 μl aliquots of each fraction to 4 ml of assay buffer containing 2 mM dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, 20 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Triton X-100 ml, pH 8.0. The amount of NaOH required to titrate fatty acid released from dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles, to maintain pH at 8.0, was monitored using Autotitrator (Radiometer, Copenhagen). The co-ordinates of x-ray structures of CTX A5 were taken from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and used as the initial structures for molecular modeling. Structure of heparin was obtained from the recently determined structure of hep-bFGF complex (15Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Google Scholar). Model building, docking and energy minimization were performed on IBM RS6000 375 and Silicon Graphics Indigo II workstation using QUANTA/CHARMM Version 4.0 software. Polar hydrogen atoms were added to the x-ray structures by standard procedure in QUANTA. The initial structures of toxin and heparin were relaxed by energy-minimization to remove initial nonbonded contacts. Docking of the molecules was performed by using the Modeling Module of QUANTA/CHARMM. Heparin was docked on the concave side of the CTX A5 molecules as indicated by the aggregation property of CTXs (see results). Comparison of the binding strengths of CTXs determined at various ionic strengths suggests that two basic residues, Arg/Lys-28 and Lys-33, are involved in binding. Further optimization of electrostatic interaction allows CTX to be docked in an orientation perpendicular to the three antiparallel β-sheet strand. The docked complex structures were energy-minimized and then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD simulation was performed with distance-dependent dielectric constant. A time step of 1 fs was used. The nonbonded cutoff value was set at 15 Å, and the nonbonded pair list was updated every 20 time steps. Typical simulation time for each complex was ∼40 ps. The final structures generated by MD simulations were energy-minimized and used for analysis. We also carried out preliminary reference MD simulations with explicit all-atom solvent molecules to ensure that our simulation was consistent with that performed in solution. CTXs exhibit a sharp positive band near 195 nm and weak negative minimum near 215 nm, characteristic of β-sheet, in their CD spectrum. We have shown that titration of CTX A3 with heparin, monitored by change in ellipticity at 195 nm, and ∼215 nm, yields a two-phase curve, initial decrease in ellipticity ∼195 nm followed by recovery of the same ellipticity at higher GAG concentrations (10Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C-M. Chi L-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Google Scholar). We have proposed that there exist two non-equivalent binding states and that the second binding state may be a manifestation of the aggregation of CTX molecules that accompanies saturated binding. To understand the details of binding, we performed similar titration of 10 CTXs. All CTXs studied were found to bind to heparin; similar two-phase profile was obtained. Fig. 1, A-C, show, respectively, the representative spectra (top panels) and the plot of ellipticity versus heparin concentration (bottom panels) of CTXs A5, M4, and M1 (see Ref. 24Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.-M. Hseu Y.-C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Google Scholar for details of classification). It can be seen that up to ∼2 μM heparin, ellipticity ∼195 nm decreases steadily as a function of heparin, reaches minimum, and increases again for higher heparin concentrations. Ellipticity ∼215 nm exhibited similar change but with opposite sign (data not shown). Interestingly, in the presence of excess heparin, ellipticity of CTX A5 rises slightly higher than that for free form, whereas ellipticity of CTX M1 remains considerably lower than for free protein and is intermediate for CTX M4. Also, the effective concentration (amount of heparin required to produce maximum perturbation) varies from 2 to 2.8 μM for different toxins. The results of titration of 10 CTXs studied against HMW heparin are summarized in Fig. 2, A and B, and Table I.Fig. 2HMW and LMW heparin-induced structural change in 10 CTX homologues as studied by change in ellipticity ∼195 nm plotted as a function of concentration of the heparin. CTXs were classified into two groups according to the effective concentration of HMW heparin required to produce maximum structural perturbation in CTX-heparin complex. A, effective concentration of heparin for the indicated toxins was around 2 μM. B, effective concentration of heparin for the indicated toxins was 2.4-3 μM. CTXs can be classified into two groups according to the extent of LMW heparin-induced conformational change as follows: small change in CD ellipticity, less than 3 millidegrees, of the indicated toxins occurred (C) and large change in CD ellipticity, larger than 6 millidegrees, of the indicated toxins was observed (D). Ellipticity of free toxin was taken to be 0; hence, the change is negative. Greater values imply larger change. The concentration of CTXs was kept constant at 20 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table I.Comparison of CD ellipticity, effective concentration, and amino acid sequence around loop 2 of CTXs studied with LMW and HMW heparin in 20 mM Na2HPO4 bufferCTXAmino acid sequenceΘEllipticityaEllipticity of free CTXs is denoted by θ; total change in ellipticity at maximum perturbation, by Δθ2; change in ellipticity with excess heparin is denoted by Δθ1 and represents the contribution to change, of the first binding site; Δθ2−Δθ1 represents contribution of second binding to change.

CTX M1 and Tg exhibit higher Δθ1 values and undergo maximum change upon first binding, whereas CTXs M2, M4, A3, A5, exhibit higher Δθ2−Δθ1 values and undergo maximum change upon second binding. CTXs A2, A4, A1, and M3 are characterized by low Δθ2 values.b Effective concentration, concentration of heparin required to induce maximum perturbation. Open table in a new tab For the sake of convenience of description we define ellipticity of free toxin as η, that at maximum perturbation as η2, and that in the presence of excess heparin as η1 (Table I). In the change profile at ∼195 nm, then, the point corresponding to maximum perturbation is Δη2. The difference between η1 and η, referred to here as Δη1, denotes contribution to the magnitude of change of the first binding state, because this stronger binding state should predominate for excess heparin. The difference, Δη2−Δη1, represents contribution of second binding state, assuming that the two sites are mutually independent. As can be seen from Table I, CTX M1 and Tγ undergo maximum conformational change upon first binding (high Δη1) while CTXs M2, M4, A3, and A5 undergo change upon second binding (high Δη2 - Δη1). Effective concentration of heparin required to produce maximum change in CTXs (Δη2) also varies for different CTXs. That for CTX M4, A3, A2, A1, and M3 falls in the range of 1.8-2.0 μM, and that for CTXs M1, Tγ, M2, A5, and A4 varies from 2.4 to 3.0 μM. We have suggested that significant conformational change occurs due mainly to the aggregation of CTX-heparin complex around saturation; this indicates that the latter group prefers to remain in the aggregated state even when more heparin is added. It is interesting to point out that the presence of basic residue appears to correlate with the suggested aggregation state of CTX-heparin complex. With the exception of CTX A4, the only CTX containing Arg at the N-terminal, all CTXs containing either Arg-6 or Lys-6 dissociate at lower effective heparin concentration of 1.8-2.0 μM (Tables 1 and 2). Additional evidence to support this interpretation can be obtained from turbidity data presented later. HMW Heparin contains ∼10 pentasaccharides and thus many CTX molecules may bind to heparin at maximum perturbation. This forced indulgence or molecular crowding may introduce constraints in the protein. To delineate the contribution of molecular crowding, we performed binding study using depolymerized heparin (average Mr 3000, LMW heparin) which would be free of crowding. The composition of this heparin is heterogeneous (27Arakawa T. Wen J. Philo J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 267-273Google Scholar); it contains saccharides of varying lengths while some sequences present in HMW heparin may be altogether absent in this lower homologue. This property of LMW heparin, however, allows identification of several trends that remain hidden with the higher homologue. Shown in Fig. 3A are representative CD spectra of CTX A3 alone and in presence of LMW heparin. The profile of change in ellipticity versus concentration of LMW heparin is plotted in Fig. 3B Like for HMW heparin, ellipticity ∼195 nm decreased to minimum at 20 μM heparin and resumed that of free protein at 80 μM heparin. Similar titration with trisulfated heparin disaccharide and hyaluronan, the GAG lacking sulfate, revealed that no change occurred in CTX A3 (Fig. 3B; see also Ref. 10Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C-M. Chi L-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Google Scholar). This indicates that a sulfated stretch longer than disaccharide is required for binding. The reversibility of binding and regaining of ellipticity of CTX A3 at higher concentrations of LMW heparin are similar to that for HMW heparin. The effective concentration of LMW derivative, 20 μM, however, is ∼10-fold higher than for HMW heparin. But the difference in their molecular weights is ∼5-fold. The higher effective concentration for LMW heparin can be explained by the absence in this sulfated oligosaccharide of some sequences required for binding. We therefore performed similar titration in the reverse order to gain insight into binding. LMW heparin (20 μM, constant, effective concentration) was titrated against CTX A3. Fig. 3C shows profile of ellipticity of CTX A3 in absence (open symbols) and presence (closed symbols) of the heparin versus concentration of CTX A3. It can be seen that upon addition of CTX A3 to heparin, the ellipticity rises steadily, and the rise is comparable to that for free protein (compare with control), which indicates that this binding causes no perturbation. Since heparin is present in excess here, this binding can be considered to be strong. After addition of 12 μM of CTX A3; however, further addition of toxin does not cause an increase in ellipticity, which instead remains constant until 20 μM. This indicates that maximum perturbation occurs around here since the added CTXs do not contribute to CD signal as expected. Optical density measurement suggests that the turbidity increases abruptly from 0.02 to 1.0 from 12 to 20 μM protein (data not shown). Beyond 20 μM, the ellipticity again rises sharply and the rise is comparable to that of free CTX A3 (compare with control), but the turbidity remains at around 1.0. This indicates that binding is saturated after 20 μM and that most conformational change occurs due to aggregation of CTX-heparin complex. In conclusion, CTX A3 binds similarly to LMW and HMW heparin. The effective binding sites available in LMW heparin are, however, less than those of HMW heparin even after normalizing with their respective molecular weights. We then performed titration of 10 CTXs with LMW heparin and monitored change in ellipticity. The results are summarized in Fig. 2, C and D to allow comparison with similar experiments done with HMW heparin (Fig. 2, A and B). For convenience of our discussion, the results obtained for HMW heparin are classified according to the difference in their effective charge, whereas those obtained for LMW heparin are classified according to the differences in their degree of conformational change. It can be seen that some CTXs undergo small structural perturbation (Fig. 2C), while others undergo large change in ellipticity (Fig. 2D) upon binding to LMW heparin. A similar result can also be observed for HMW heparin, but the interpretation is complicated because of the combined effect of molecular crowding and aggregation on the detected conformational change. The magnitude of change, i.e. the values of Δη2, are listed in Table I. All S-type CTXs (CTX containing Ser-29) exhibit smaller conformational change, and CTX M2 and all P-type CTXs (CTX containing Pro-31) exhibit larger conformational change (higher Δη2−Δη1 or Δη1). Comparison of their amino acid sequences indicates that Arg-28 and/or Lys-33 may enhance heparin-induced conformational change of the CTXs. Comparison of Δη2 values of CTXs with LMW and HMW heparin reveals that LMW heparin, on the same CTX, exerts smaller effect. This implies that molecular crowding arising out of the superstructure of the higher homologue contributes to structural perturbation of CTXs. Alternatively, the smaller effect of LMW heparin may be a manifestation of the absence in this polysaccharide of numerous sequences present in the HMW homologue. In summary, both molecular crowding and specific side chain interaction in the CTX-heparin complex play a role in heparin-induced CTX conformational changes. Interestingly, binding of CTXs with LMW heparin was accompanied by change in turbidity of the solution. As shown in Fig. 4, the profile of turbidity change can be classified into two groups: one with slow decline"
https://openalex.org/W1973313721,"Thyroid hormone receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors that can potentially interact with thyroid hormone response elements as homodimers or heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor. It has generally been felt, however, that the heterodimer is responsible for induction of gene expression. We have demonstrated previously that the optimal thyroid hormone receptor binding sequence is not the consensus hexamer half-site AGGTCA but is an octamer, AGGTCA. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that thyroid hormone response elements composed of optimal half-sites (TAAGGTCA) will bind thyroid hormone receptors readily and activate gene expression independently of the retinoid X receptor. In contrast, response elements composed of suboptimal half-sites (e.g. GCAGGTCA) will require the retinoid X receptor to facilitate thyroid hormone receptor-mediated gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we have reconstituted thyroid hormone receptor-mediated gene expression in yeast. Our studies confirm the hypothesis that the retinoid X receptor is required for gene expression from response elements composed of suboptimal half-sites, whereas thyroid hormone receptors are sufficient to activate gene expression maximally from response elements containing optimal half-sites. Furthermore, coexpression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 is required for ligand-dependent gene activation from single response elements. Surprisingly, however, coexpression of the retinoid X receptor decreases the steroid receptor coactivator-1-dependent thyroid hormone induction. Overall these data demonstrate that the architecture of the thyroid hormone response element dictates the nuclear receptor requirements for gene activation.

https://openalex.org/W2067359918,"A number of crystallographic studies of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein have established that the fatty acid-binding site is within an internalized water-filled cavity. The same studies have also suggested the existence of a region physically distinct from the fatty acid-binding site which connects the cavity of the protein with the external solvent, hereafter referred to as the portal. In an effort to examine the portal region, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the mutations V32D/F57H into the murine ALBP cDNA. Mutant protein has been isolated, crystallized, and its stability and binding properties studied by biochemical methods. As assessed by guanidine-HCl denaturation, the mutant form exhibited a slight overall destabilization relative to the wild-type protein under both acid and alkaline conditions. Accessibility to the cavity in both the mutant and wild-type proteins was observed by stopped-flow analysis of the modification of a cavity residue, Cys117, by the sulfhydryl reactive agent 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at pH 8.5. Cys117 of V32D/F57H ALBP was modified 7-fold faster than the wild-type protein. The ligand binding properties of both the V32D/F57H mutant and wild-type proteins were analyzed using a fluorescent probe at pH 6.0 and 8.0. The apparent dissociation constants for 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid were approximately 9-10-fold greater than the wild-type protein, independent of pH. In addition, there is a 6-fold increase in the Kd for oleic acid for the portal mutant relative to the wild-type at pH 8.0. To study the effect of pH on the double mutant, it was crystallized and analyzed in two distinct space groups at pH 4.5 and 6.4. While in general the differences in the overall main chain conformations are negligible, changes were observed in the crystallographic structures near the site of the mutations. At both pH values, the mutant side chains are positioned somewhat differently than in wild-type protein. To ensure that the mutations had not altered ionic conditions near the binding site, the crystallographic coordinates were used to monitor the electrostatic potentials from the head group site to the positions near the portal region. The differences in the electrostatic potentials were small in all regions, and did not explain the differences in ligand affinity.

We present these results within the context of fatty acid binding and suggest lipid association is more complex than that described within a single equilibrium event. Lipids are essential molecules that serve a variety of roles in biological systems including formation of the primary structural components of membranes, serving as a source and store of metabolic energy, and as messengers for signal transduction. The intracellular trafficking of these poorly soluble molecules has been hypothesized to be mediated by a family of proteins known as the intracellular lipid-binding proteins (1Banaszak L.J. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan X. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized in part by their conserved gene structure, similarity of amino acid sequences, and the ability to bind lipophilic molecules such as fatty acids and retinoids (2Veerkamp J.H. Maatman R.G.H.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 17-52Google Scholar, 3Lalonde J.M. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1240-1247Google Scholar). The adipose specific member of the gene family is known as the adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP or aP2) 1The abbreviations used are: ALBPadipocyte lipid-binding proteiniLBPsintracellular lipid-binding proteins1,8-ANS1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acidDTNBdithionitrobenzoic acidPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)MES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidHDShexadecanesulfonic acidIFABP 2intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2. (4Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14544-14551Google Scholar). This 14.6-kDa protein is found in great abundance in the adipocyte cytosol and has been shown to bind long chain fatty acids and fatty acid analogs with an affinity of 0.1-1.5 μM (4Matarese V.

The crystal structure of ALBP, like all members of the iLBP family, is relatively easy to visualize (1Banaszak L.J. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan X. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar) and a stereodiagram of the main chain is given in Fig. 1. The single polypeptide chain is folded such that the 10 antiparallel β-strands hydrogen bond to each other in a barrel-like fashion. Starting from the N-terminal, the strands have been referred to in numerous other publications as βA through βJ. The single exception to the inter-strand H-bonding appears between strands βD and βE. The distance between these two strands is too large to form normal β-sheet hydrogen bonds but the gap is filled with side chains maintaining the integrity of the β-barrel. The ends of the β-barrel are closed off by a helix-turn-helix segment at one end, and the last few residues of the N-terminal and side chains at the other. The helix-turn-helix is located between strands βA and βB. ALBP and other family members have an unusual structural property. The binding site for fatty acids and hydrophobic ligands is an internalized cavity. This cavity is partially hidden from the external milieu in some iLBPs and is nearly totally hidden for ALBP. The internalized cavity is much larger than the ligand and is filled with ordered and presumably disordered water molecules. For most iLBP proteins, including ALBP, the ligand:protein stoichiometry is 1:1. The crystal structures of the apo and holo forms of ALBP are essentially the same, which suggests that a conformational change must accompany both the association and dissociation processes (9Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Google Scholar). Members of the iLBP family have dissociation constants for their ligands in the micromolar to nanomolar range. The thermodynamics of the association reaction have been determined by titration calorimetry for ALBP binding to oleic and arachidonic acid (10LaLonde J.M. Levenson M.A. Roe J.J. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25339-25347Google Scholar), and by van't Hoff data for ALBP and a number of other fatty acid-binding proteins (7Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Google Scholar). These studies reveal that the relatively high affinity of an iLBP for a hydrophobic ligand is influenced by enthalpic factors. This is in agreement with the crystal structures of the apo and holo forms of the protein which suggest that some of the binding energy is derived from the coulombic interactions between the ionized carboxylate of the fatty acid and a binding triad formed by the side chains of two arginines and a tyrosine which are present within the cavity. Structural studies of ALBP in the presence and absence of various fatty acid ligands have also lead to the identification of a distinct region of the protein surface known as the portal, as first described by Xu et al. (9Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Google Scholar). The portal is a region physically distinct from the fatty acid binding cavity and is formed by helix αII and turns between βC-βD and βE-βF. One of the characteristics of the portal region is the relatively mobile side chain of Phe57. The position of the side chain of Phe57 is significantly different in the apo- and holoprotein. The side chain is near the hydrocarbon tail of the fatty acid and points toward the exterior of the molecule in the holoprotein. In the apoprotein, the aromatic ring swings back and appears to block access to the cavity. These observations suggest the region around Phe57 could be indicative of a favored connection between the internal binding site and the environment. To address the functional role of Phe57 and the portal region, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the mutations V32D/F57H into the murine ALBP cDNA. The mutant was designed to form a histidine-aspartic acid salt bridge across a region of the ALBP molecule thought to be the preferential pathway for ligand entry into the binding cavity. Furthermore, the region of ALBP mutated is distant from the internalized arginines and therefore would not be expected to interfere with the coulombic binding reaction. Our goal was to test the portal hypothesis by attempting to confer pH dependence to the binding characteristics. In this report, biochemical characterization of the mutant protein including stability, ligand binding, and kinetic properties is described. To understand the conformational implications of the mutations, the crystal structure of the mutant form of ALBP is compared at two different pH values. Last, in an attempt to further understand how the mutation could affect binding, the electrostatic potential at atomic sites occupied by ligand atoms in the mutant structures were calculated from the crystallographic coordinates, and the resultant values compared with native forms of ALBP. Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed using a sequencing kit manufactured by Life Technologies, Inc. and carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler Model 480 from Perkin-Elmer. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Microchemical Facility, University of Minnesota. 1,8-ANS was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. and fatty acids were purchased from Nu Check Prep Inc. Nalidixic acid and all other chemicals used were reagent grade and obtained from Sigma. The V32D/F57H mutant was created in a sequential manner. PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis was used to construct the single V32D mutation in the murine ALBP cDNA. The plasmid pGSTALBP (5Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Xu Z. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Google Scholar) was used as a template for two polymerase chain reactions using either the V32D oligo (5′-ACAAGGAAAGACGCAGCCATG-3′) and an oligo complimentary to the 3′ end of the cDNA (5′-TTGATGGATCCTTCCATCCAGGC-3′) or an internal ALBP oligo (5′-GGTGTTTTTATGAGTACTCTC-3′) and an oligo complimentary to the 5′ end of the cDNA (5′-AGGACGGATCCTCCTCGAAGGTT-3′). Two products were obtained, a 350-bp V32D product which corresponds to nucleotides 131-476 of the cDNA and a 208-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 12-227. The PCR products were mixed, denatured at 95°C for 10 min, and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature over a 60-min period. The heteroduplexed DNA was then used as the template for a second round of PCR utilizing the 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides (above) that bracket the ALBP cDNA and which contain BamHI restriction sites to facilitate cloning. The 450-bp PCR product was subcloned into BamHI digested, dephosphorylated, vector 3Zf(−). Ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109 and recombinant plasmids were selected on the basis of blue/white color selection. Plasmids were recovered and V32D mutants were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The V32D/F57H double mutant was created by single-stranded mutagenesis (11Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated and screened via restriction digest with the enzyme DraI. Successfully mutagenized plasmids were then verified via DNA sequencing. By analogous procedures, the individual F57H mutation was generated using single-stranded DNA prepared from wild-type cDNA. To obtain large quantities of recombinant mutant proteins, the individual cDNAs were subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pJMB100A. PCR was used to engineer novel XbaI restriction sites into cDNA flanking regions to facilitate subcloning. A 27-bp 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-GGTTTACACCATGGGTGATGCCTTTGT-3′) and a 25-bp 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCCTCTAGATCCTTCCATCCAGG-3′) (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc.) were used to produce a 447-bp PCR product that could be directly subcloned. The PCR product was subcloned into XbaI-digested pJMB100A. Recombinant plasmids were identified via diagnostic restriction enzyme analysis with HindIII, and sequenced to verify the integrity of the nucleotide sequence. During the molecular manipulation of the various cDNAs, it became apparent that the use of the NcoI site at the 5′ terminus of the cDNA would facilitate the subcloning procedures. The incorporation of the 5′ NcoI site resulted in the conservation of the initiating methionine residue but a subsequent mutation of cysteine 2 to a glycine residue. Previous work in our laboratory (12Xu Z Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14367-14370Google Scholar) had shown that E. coli expressed wild-type ALBP contains a post-translational modification of Cys2 such that the sulfhydryl group becomes modified and is unreactive to group-specific reagents. As shown by crystallization studies, Cys2 is found on βA, quite far from the ligand binding site or the portal. Consequently, we anticipated that the C2G mutation would have no effect on ALBP properties. To ensure that the C2G mutation had no adverse effects upon the folding of ALBP, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured and compared with that of wild-type ALBP. The excitation and emission maxima of all forms were essentially identical to wild-type ALBP (results not shown) and concluded that the C2G mutation would have negligible effects upon ALBP structure and function. All protein described within this report contains the C2G mutation. The V32D/F57H ALBP cDNA was transformed into E. coli JM 101 and protein expression induced by the addition of nalidixic acid as described previously (12Xu Z Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14367-14370Google Scholar). Proteins were purified as described previously (9Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Google Scholar) except that cation exchange chromatography was used as the terminal step, replacing immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Concentrated protein solution was dialyzed into 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and fractionated utilizing a Mono S HR 10/10 cation exchange column. Recombinant ALBP forms were eluted with a NaCl gradient to 500 mM salt and fractions containing the protein were identified via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. During purification of all forms, the pH of the extract was reduced to 5.0 for 8-12 h. Under these conditions, any potentially bound endogenous ligand is released from the binding site. All preparations of ALBP were found to be apoprotein as revealed by Cys117 titration. For ALBP, fatty acid binding blocks Cys117 modification and conversely, Cys117 modification blocks fatty acid binding (13Buelt M.K. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7408-7413Google Scholar), lowering the pH to 5.0 releases bound fatty acids and allows the titration of the sulfhydryl group. Equilibrium unfolding as a function of increasing concentration of guanidine HCl was carried out as described previously (13Buelt M.K. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7408-7413Google Scholar). Briefly, V32D/F57H ALBP or wild-type ALBP were dialyzed into either 50 mM MES, pH 5.5, or 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then diluted to 0.5 μM in the appropriate buffer at 25°C. The emission spectrum of each protein was recorded in the presence of increasing guanidine HCl with a Perkin-Elmer 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength set to 285 nm. The emission wavelength maximum was plotted versus the concentration of denaturant for each point in the unfolding profile. The Gibbs free energy was then calculated for each point in the unfolding range and replotted versus guanidine HCl concentration. Line fitting by linear regression was used to determine the concentration of denaturant at the midpoint of the transition. Modification of Cys117 was carried out as described previously (13Buelt M.K. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7408-7413Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was added to a final concentration of 10 μM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl and reacted with 80 μM DTNB at room temperature. Sulfhydryl titration was monitored spectrophotometrically and the amount of thionitrobenzoate released was calculated from the absorbance at 412 nm (ϵ = 13,600 cm−1M−1). Protection assays were performed by mixing protein with 50 μM ligand (oleic acid or 1,8-ANS) for 3 min before the addition of DTNB. Stopped-flow analysis was carried out with an Applied Photophysics apparatus and data analyzed with the X suite of kinetic analysis programs. Data were fit to a single exponential equation which used a steady state value to mark the completion of the reaction. Ligand binding to V32D/F57H ALBP and wild-type ALBP was assessed using the fluorescent probe 1,8-ANS (14Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Google Scholar). The probe was dissolved in absolute ethanol and its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ372 = 8000 cm−1M−1). Final ethanol concentrations were kept below 1% (v/v). Proteins were dialyzed into 50 mM NaPO4 at either pH 6.0 or 8.0 and added in 1 μM aliquots to 0.5 μM 1,8-ANS. The samples were mixed for 1 min and their fluorescence was measured in a thermostatted (25°C) Perkin-Elmer 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer. All manipulations took place under dimmed lights. Relative fluorescence was plotted versus increasing protein concentration and Scatchard analysis was performed to determine binding parameters. Oleic acid was used as a competitor for 1,8-ANS binding to either V32D/F57H ALBP or wild-type ALBP. Subsaturating concentrations of V32D/F57H ALBP (2.3 μM) or wild-type ALBP (0.6 μM) in 50 mM NaPO4, pH 8.0, were mixed with 0.5 μM 1,8-ANS at 25°C and the fluorescence signal was measured. Increasing concentrations of oleic acid (from a 10 mM stock in absolute ethanol) were added and the subsequent loss of fluorescence was observed. Relative fluorescence was then plotted versus increasing concentration of oleic acid and a polynomial equation was used to determine the amount of oleate at the midpoint of the competition (50% loss of initial fluorescence) and the apparent Ki (14Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Google Scholar). The protein was equilibrated in 12.5 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization screens were set up using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method. A pH/phosphate scan was first tried similar to native ALBP crystallization conditions (9Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Google Scholar). These conditions yielded crystals at 2.4 M phosphate, pH 6.4. Due to the lower quality of these crystals as estimated by the maximum observable resolution, different conditions were screened using the sparse matrix (15Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Google Scholar) and factorial scan method (16Carter Jr., C.W. Carter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12219-12223Google Scholar). A different crystal form which diffracted to a higher resolution was found at 2.4 M (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM NaKPO4, and 100 mM acetate, pH 4.5. X-ray diffraction data was collected on a Siemens multiwire area detector, with CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 generator implemented with a graphite crystal monochromator. Data was collected with a crystal to detector distance of 12 cm, and a crystal rotation of 0.25° between frames. Data collection statistics are reported in Table I. Neither crystal form was isomorphous with previously reported crystal forms of native ALBP. The pH 4.5 form has the space group P43212, with one molecule per asymmetric unit, and cell dimensions of a = b = 56.4 Å, c = 80.5 Å. The pH 6.4 form belongs to the space group C2221, also with one molecule per asymmetric unit, and cell dimensions of a = 79.5 Å, b = 97.3 Å, c = 50.7 Å.Table IX-ray diffraction results at two pH values from the mutant ALBP-V32D/F57HpH 4.5 formpH 6.4 formNo. of crystals11Rsym (I) %10.5113.13Resolution range (Å)30-1.930-2.8No. of observations10334054873No. of unique reflections103245800Space groupP43212C2221Unit cell a × b × c56.5 × 56.5 × 80.8 Å79.5 × 97.3 × 50.7 ÅRfactor/Rfree (%)19.2/24.6%19.3/26.8%Waters430Root mean square bond length (Å)0.0070.010Root mean square bond angle (°)1.541.56Root mean square dihedral (°)25.526.7Root mean square improper twist (°)1.061.21Overall G-factor0.20.2Bad contacts11 Open table in a new tab Phases were obtained using molecular replacement implemented in X-plor (17Brünger A.T. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 46-57Google Scholar), with native ALBP used as the search model. The refinement was carried out in X-plor, initially using rigid body and positional refinement, and ending with subsequent rounds of b-factor/positional refinement using a bulk-solvent correction. The mutated residues were modeled as alanines through the initial stages of refinement, and were fit to both 2Fo−Fcdensity contoured at 1σ, and Fo−Fcdensity contoured at 3σ. Data was added to the refinements in increments of 0.5 Å or less, starting with data from 8.0 Å to 3.5 Å. Waters were added to the model when the resolution of the data reached 2.5 Å in the case of the pH 4.5 form, or during final refinement of the pH 6.4 form. Waters had to meet the following criteria: 1) presence in 2Fo−Fcmaps contoured at 3σ; 2) spherical shape; and 3) within 2.5 to 3.5 Å of a proper hydrogen bond donor/acceptor. The Rfactor/Rfree was monitored at all times to ensure proper fitting of the model (18Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Google Scholar). Final refinement statistics are presented in Table I. The coordinates at both pH values of the V32D/F57H are deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 1AB0 and 1ACD. All electrostatic calculations were carried out in Delphi, part of the Biosym suite of programs for the study of protein structure. The parameters used in the calculations are listed in Table II. Electrostatic potentials were calculated using the crystal structures of native ALBP, the pH 4.5, and the pH 6.4 mutant forms. Potentials were also calculated using models based on the pH 4.5 form with His57 in the three most common rotamer positions to determine the influence of His57 position on the electrostatic potential. The models for this calculation were built using O (19Jones T.A. You J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). To assess the effect of the mutations on ligand binding, it was decided to measure the electrostatic potential near the arginine-tyrosine-binding site and at ligand atom positions throughout the cavity using crystallographic coordinates previously determined for a ligand. The structure of native ALBP bound to hexadecane sulfonic acid (HDS; 1lid in the Protein Data Bank) was used to provide the reference ligand position (20Lalonde J.M. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4885-4895Google Scholar). All structures were superimposed in O, then the coordinates of HDS were used to reference points in the three-dimensional electrostatic potential at each atom position of HDS. Similar calculations were also carried out on hypothetical models of the mutant forms R126L/Y128F and T125Q. The former has a negative effect on binding affinity while the latter increases ligand affinity (21Sha R. Kane C. Xu Z. Banaszak L. Bernlohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Google Scholar).Table IIParameters used to evaluate the electrostatic potentials in the binding cavity of wild-type and mutant ALBPGrid spacing (Å)1.0 ÅGrid extent beyond model (Å)15.0 ÅDielectric constantInterior2.0Exterior80.0Poisson-Boltzman equation iterationsLinear P-BAutoNonlinear P-B500Protein atoms partial charge setAmberProtein atoms size setDelphi default Open table in a new tab The V32D/F57H mutant was designed to test the hypothesis that fatty acids preferentially enter and exit the ALBP cavity via the portal region. Since the mutations involved surface residues, the change from hydrophobic to hydrophilic side chains was not expected to notably affect protein stability but would affect accessibility to the cavity. The residues which were mutagenized can be visualized in Fig. 1. Note that they are located on a helix, α-II (V32D), and a turn between β-strands C and D (F57H). The best model called for the creation of the mutations V32D/F57H which based upon distances and geometry, would create a salt bridge between Asp32 and His57 at a pH above the pKa of Asp32 and below that of His57. To purify V32D/F57H ALBP, a combination of pH fractionation, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography was utilized. Protein purity was estimated to be greater than 95% based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and typical yields of protein were 10-20 mg/liter of ferment. The protein was soluble at a wide range of pH values and ionic strengths and stable when stored at −20°C. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of V32D/F57H ALBP was assessed and compared with wild-type ALBP as a measure of its folding. The fluorescence excitation and emission maxima for V32D/F57H ALBP were 285 and 332 nm, respectively, at both pH 5.5 and 8.0. These values are virtually identical with those obtained for wild-type ALBP, which indicated that the tryptophan residues found in V32D/F57H ALBP are most likely located in the same environment as the tryptophan residues within ALBP. Integrity of the tertiary structures was confirmed by crystallography as described below. The stability of V32D/F57H ALBP at pH 5.5 and 8.0 was examined by observing the equilibrium unfolding of the protein in response to increasing concentrations of denaturant. The transition profiles for denaturation of both V32D/F57H ALBP and wild-type ALBP at pH 5.5 had essentially the same sigmoidal shape. The denaturation was reversible; dilution of denatured protein with the appropriate buffer resulted in a return to emission maximum of 334 nm for each protein (results not shown). The concentration of guanidine HCl at the midpoint of the folded/unfolded transition at pH 5.5 was 1.6 ± 0.02 M for native ALBP and 1.1 ± 0.04 M for the V32D/F57H mutant. Similar results were obtained at pH 8.0. Midpoints for native ALBP were 1.5 ± 0.05 and 1.2 ± 0.08 M for the double mutant. At each pH, V32D/F57H ALBP was denatured at a lower concentration of guanidine HCl than wild-type ALBP, indicating that the mutant form is somewhat destabilized relative to wild-type ALBP.

https://openalex.org/W2085130172,"Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are transcription factors that traditionally have been thought to bind DNA as protein dimers. Recently, however, it has been recognized that RXRs can also bind to DNA as protein tetramers. Receptor tetramers form cooperatively on response elements containing suitably reiterated half-sites, and play an important role in determining the specificity of DNA recognition by different nuclear receptors. We report here that RXR tetramers exhibit significant functional plasticity, and form on response elements possessing diverse half-site orientations and spacings. This ability of RXRs to form tetramers and related oligomers appears to contribute to the synergistic transcriptional activation observed when multiple, spatially separated response elements are introduced into a single promoter. Oligomerization may therefore be a common paradigm for DNA recognition and combinatorial regulation by several different classes of transcription factors."

Cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCKcholecystokininYap3yeast aspartyl protease 3MFα1the prepropeptide of the yeast α-mating pheromonePCRpolymerase chain reactionRIAradioimmunoassay. is a vertebrate neurohormonal peptide which controls a wide variety of functions, predominantly in the digestive tract and the brain (for review see; Crawley and Corwin (1994)). During precursor maturation pro-CCK is subjected to a number of post-translational modifications, including C-terminal α-amidation, tyrosyl sulfation, and endoproteolytic processing (Rehfeld et al, 198836Rehfeld J.F. Bardram L. Cantor P. Hilsted L. Schwartz T.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 25-31Google Scholar). Bioactive CCKs possess the same amidated C terminus which results from endoproteolytic cleavage C-terminally of the dibasic Arg105-Arg106 residues followed by removal of these basic amino acids by carboxypeptidase digestion, exposing Gly104 to peptidyl-monooxygenase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast, endoproteolytic processing of pro-CCK is far more heterogeneous at the N terminus with examples of CCK-58, −39, −33, −22, −8, and −5 having been identified in various tissues or plasma samples (Fig. 1A) (Rehfeld and Hansen, 198635Rehfeld J.F.

Goebell H. Reeve Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1517-1521Google Scholar). Many of these forms of CCK are produced via cleavage of pro-CCK C-terminally of single arginine residues (Rehfeld and Hansen, 198635Rehfeld J.F. Hansen H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5832-5840Google Scholar; Eberlein et al., 199211Eberlein G.A. Eysselein V.E. Davis M.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. Grandt D. Niebel W. Williams R. Moessner J. Zeeh J. Meyer H.E. Goebell H. Reeve Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1517-1521Google Scholar). However, CCK-22, the predominant hormonal form of CCK, is produced by endoproteolytic processing at Lys81. Consequently this lysine processing event is of crucial significance for understanding the biology of CCK (Liddle et al., 198424Liddle R.A. Goldfine I.D. Williams J.A.

Many foreign proteins have been expressed in yeast (Hadfield et al, 199316Hadfield C. Raina K.K. Shashi-Menon K. Mount R.C. Mycol. Res. 1993; 8: 897-944Google Scholar). Often these proteins are directed through the yeast secretory pathway, either by the endogenous N-terminal signal sequence of the protein or via production of a hybrid protein which includes the leader region of a secreted yeast preproprotein. Passage through the secretory pathway exposes proteins to a number of post-translational capabilities, including disulfide bridge formation, glycosylation and proteolytic processing (Hadfield et al, 199316Hadfield C. Raina K.K. Shashi-Menon K. Mount R.C. Mycol. Res. 1993; 8: 897-944Google Scholar). The best characterized yeast endopeptidase is the Kex2 serine protease, which was identified for its ability to cleave precursors of the α-mating pheromone and killer toxin at dibasic sites (Julius et al, 198421Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Google Scholar). Overexpression studies in kex2 mutants resulted in the isolation of the yeast aspartyl protease (Yap3), which is able to rescue the mating deficiency of kex2 deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Egel-Mitani et al, 199012Egel-Mitani M. Flygenring H.P. Hansen M.T. Yeast. 1990; 6: 127-137Google Scholar). More recently a third endopeptidase, Mkc7, with considerable homology to Yap3 has been detected (Komano and Fuller, 199522Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10753-10756Google Scholar). This protease, which was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the cold sensitive growth phenotype of kex2 mutants, has the ability to cleave an internally quenched flurogenic substrate C-terminally of a Lys-Arg site (Komano and Fuller, 199522Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10753-10756Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the extent of post-translational processing of human pro-CCK expressed and secreted from S. cerevisiae Evidence was found for an, as yet, uncharacterized endopeptidase in yeast which is able to cleave CCK at a single lysine residue to produce CCK-22, a predominant form of circulating CCK in mammals.

Open table in a new tab A full-length cDNA clone encoding human prepro-CCK was generously supplied by Karin Pedersen. The S. cerevisiae α-mating pheromone 1 gene (MFα1) was kindly provided by Ira Herskowitz (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 198223Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Google Scholar). Two pro-CCK expression plasmids were constructed in the URA3-2μ plasmid pJ399, in which gene transcription is driven by the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (Bitter and Egan, 19842Bitter G.A. Egan K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 263-274Google Scholar) and terminated by the yeast TPI1 termination signal (Alber and Kawasaki, 19821Alber T. Kawasaki G. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 419-434Google Scholar). Plasmid pJ399 was constructed from pYES2.0 (Invitrogen). The coding region of human prepro-CCK was amplified by PCR using the Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The forward primer (5′-ACGTGAATTCTAAACTAAAAATGAACAGCGGCGTGTGCCTGTGCGTG-3′) resulted in an EcoRI site 10 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, while the reverse primer (5′-ACGTTCTAGACTAGGAGGGGTACTCATACTCCTCGGC-3′) introduced an XbaI site immediately downstream of the TAG stop codon. The PCR product was purified after agarose gel electrophoresis using the Sephaglas Band Prep procedure (Pharmacia), cleaved with EcoRI and XbaI (Boehringer Mannheim), and cloned into pJ399. To ensure high secretion levels of CCK, we constructed a second expression plasmid where the sequence encoding the prepropeptide of the MFα1 yeast α-factor (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 198223Kurjan J. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1982; 30: 933-943Google Scholar) was fused to the coding region of pro-CCK (amino acids 31-115) (Fig. 1B). This expression plasmid was constructed by a two-step process. First, the yeast MFα1 gene was amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5′-ACGTGAATTCTAAACTAAAAATGAGATTTCCTTCAATTTTTACTGCAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACGTTCTAGATTAGTACATTGGTTGGCCGGGTTTTACA-3′) and cloned into pJ399 as described above. The resulting plasmid was cleaved with HindIII and XbaI to remove the coding region of the four tandem α-factor repeats, but leaving the sequence encoding the MFα1 prepropeptide. The region encoding pro-CCK was amplified using PCR (forward primer, 5′-ACGTTCTAGACTAGGAGG GGTACTCATACTCCTCGGC-3′; reverse primer was the same as used for amplification of the coding region of prepro-CCK) resulting in a product with a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ XbaI site that could be ligated into the pJ399 plasmid containing the coding region of prepro-MFα1 The resulting plasmid encodes a hybrid protein that consists of the first 89 amino acids of prepro-MFα1 and the last 85 amino acids of prepro-CCK starting at Ser31 (Fig. 1B). It was expected that pro-CCK would be liberated in the yeast secretory pathway by Kex2 cleavage C-terminally of the Lys-Arg site in the α-factor prepropeptide, followed by two dipeptidyl aminopeptidase digestion steps to remove the Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala sequence (Fig. 1B) (Hadfield et al., 199316Hadfield C. Raina K.K. Shashi-Menon K. Mount R.C. Mycol. Res. 1993; 8: 897-944Google Scholar). To ensure the coding nucleotides had not been altered during the PCR steps, plasmid inserts were exposed to double stranded DNA sequencing with the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing procedure (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis was used to detect and partially characterize pro-CCK products secreted from yeast transformants. Four monospecific antisera raised in rabbits which binds various processing intermediates of CCK were utilized; Ab 2609, Ab 3208, Ab 7270, and Ab 89009 (Table II). Measurements were performed as described previously (Rehfeld, 1978a32Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4016-4021Google Scholar; Hilsted and Rehfeld, 198618Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. Anal.

Trypsin cleaves C-terminally of the Arg105-Arg106 site, and carboxypeptidase B removes these residues leaving glycine-extended CCK. This procedure involves incubating the sample with an equal volume of 2 mg/ml trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.1 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 10 min, after which the samples were cooled to room temperature. Carboxypeptidase B (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and terminated by a second boiling step. Processing products of pro-CCK larger than CCK-22 were detected by RIA analysis with Ab 89009 after samples were exposed to trypsin as described above. Yeast transformants grown to late exponential phase were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to collect the cells and 100-500 μl of the culture supernatant was loaded directly onto a Sephadex G-50 superfine (Pharmacia) column (1 × 100 cm) at 4°C. The sample was eluted in VBA buffer (20 mM barbital buffer, 0.6 mM thiomersal, and 0.11% bovine serum albumin) at a flow rate of 2.4 ml/h, with 800-μl fractions being collected every 20 min. The column was calibrated with trace amounts of [125I]albumin and 22NaCl to indicate the void and total volumes, respectively. Anion exchange chromatography was conducted on a 5 × 50-mm Mono-Q HR/R anion exchange column (Pharmacia) which had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8). The column was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 20% acetic acid over 70 min, with 1-ml fractions being collected every minute. Sulfated CCK-8-Gly and non-sulfated CCK-8-Gly (Cambridge Research Biochemicals) were used for calibration. Samples were dried under vacuum and resuspended in VBA buffer before RIA analysis. A five-step procedure was utilized to purify CCK secreted from transformants of S. cerevisiae Step 1: the wild type yeast YNG318 transformed with the plasmid encoding the hybrid prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK construct was grown in 200 ml of selective media to late exponential phase and cells removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 3 with trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The cleared supernatant was loaded onto five Sep-Pak plus C18 columns (Waters) connected in series, which had been pre-equilibrated with 10 ml of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile followed by 10 ml of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Material was passed through the columns at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was eluted sequentially with 10-ml solutions of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100% acetonitrile. The fractions collected were diluted in distilled water and analyzed by RIA using Ab 3208. The same procedure was utilized with the mkc7 yap3 (HKY24) and kex2 yap3 (ME938) double mutants expressing the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK construct. However, the starting quantity was 2 liters of culture medium and CCK-immunoreactive fractions were detected using RIA analysis with Ab 89009 and/or Ab 3208 after the samples had been treated with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B. Step 2: immunoreactive fractions from Sep-Pak purification were concentrated under vacuum to a final volume of 1 ml, adjusted to pH 8 with NaOH and loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 superfine column as described previously. Step 3: the next stage of purification involved anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column and was performed as outlined above. Step 4: the fractions containing CCK immunoreactivity were further processed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C8 column (2.1 × 150 mm) (Vydac) at 50°C, eluted at 0.2 ml/min with a gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (0.5%/min). Fractions were collected every 0.5 min. Step 5: selected immunoreactive fractions from Step 4 were subjected to a further reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography step on a Vydac C18 column using the same solvents but employing a gradient of 0.2%/min. Peak fractions were collected manually (monitored at 214 nm). Molecular masses of purified peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry performed in a Biflex instrument (Bruker-Franzen) using α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as a matrix. Both positive and negative ions were analyzed in the linear mode using external calibration to give an accuracy of 0.1%. Individual peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis using an automatic protein sequencer (Procise 494A, Applied Biosystems) equipped with an on-line high performance liquid chromatography system for detection of the amino acid phenylthiohydantoins. Transformants of the YNG318 strain expressing the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK fusion peptide were grown overnight at 30°C in selective media. The next morning the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of synthetic complete media lacking uracil and methionine, and supplemented with 500 μCi of L-[35S]methionine (Amersham). After the cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 30°C they were washed twice in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) before being resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. An approximate equal volume of pre-chilled acid washed glass beads (Sigma) was added and the sample vortexed 10 times for 30 s with cooling on ice between each vortexing. SDS was then added to a final volume of 1% and the cell lysate boiled for 3 min. An equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 380 mM NaCl, 12 mM EDTA (pH 8), 5% Triton X-100) was included and a cleared supernatant prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4°C for 2 h following the addition of 5 μl of Ab 7270 which binds to glycine extended CCK (Table II). Immune complexes were bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) during a second 2-h incubation at 4°C with gentle agitation. The sample was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 s and the pellet washed 8 times in 1 × sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded directly onto a Sephadex G-50 superfine column. Radiolabeled CCK was detected in the column fractions by a combination of liquid scintillation counting and RIA analysis utilizing Ab 3208. Transformants of the YNG318 strain expressing prepro-CCK and the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK fusion protein were grown to late exponential phase and the culture media was subjected to RIA analysis for the presence of glycine-extended, C-terminally extended, and α-amidated CCK. In each case two independent transformants were analyzed. No major differences in CCK immunoreactivity were detected with transformants harboring the same plasmid constructs (Table III).Table IIIExpression levels of CCK secreted from transformants of the yeast strain YNG318CCK precursor polypeptideImmunoreactivity (nanomoles/liter) measured with antibodyAb 2609 (CCK-NH2)Ab 3208 (CCK-Gly)Ab 3208 (with T/C) (CCK-Gly + CCK-Cterm)Prepro-CCK 100.47 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.02Prepro-CCK 200.43 ± 0.010.79 ± 0.04Prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK 1057.1 ± 2.3180.4 ± 8.1Prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK 2049.4 ± 4.8143.4 ± 5.9 Open table in a new tab Secretion of glycine-extended CCK was determined by immunoreactivity to Ab 3208 (Table III). Both constructs resulted in the secretion of glycine-extended CCK from yeast transformants. However, approximately hundredfold higher levels of secretion were seen when CCK was expressed as a fusion to the α-factor prepropeptide compared with the native prepro-CCK. Treatment of the samples with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B increased the quantity of glycine-extended immunoreactivity at least 2-fold indicating that considerable quantities of secreted CCK was C-terminally extended (Table III). In contrast to glycine and C-terminally extended CCK, no α-amidated CCK was found in media supernatants of yeast expressing pro-CCK, as indicated by the absence of immunoreactivity to Ab 2609 in media in which yeast expressing the prepro-CCK or the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK constructs had been cultured (Table III). To further characterize the extent of endoproteolytic processing of CCK produced in S. cerevisiae, secreted material of strain YNG318 expressing the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK fusion protein were subjected to gel chromatography. Analysis of the fractions collected for glycine-extended CCK uncovered two major peaks of CCK immunoreactivity, one at an elution constant (KD) of 0.75, the other 1.15 (Fig. 2A). These KD values are similar to the known elution constants of CCK-22-Gly and CCK-8-Gly, respectively, determined by the same procedures (Cantor and Rehfeld, 19875Cantor P. Rehfeld J.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 168: 153-158Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of the CCK-immunoreactive products they were purified to homogeneity and subjected to mass spectrometry and protein sequence analysis. As predicted, the latter immunoreactive peak was identified as CCK-8-Gly and the earlier as CCK-22-Gly (Fig. 3, A and B). It should be noted that the peptides isolated during this study were oxidized to varying degrees (Fig. 3). All human CCK peptides contain methionine and tryptophan residues. It is a common observation that methionine residues are prone to oxidation in the presence of oxygen. In addition, we often find that tryptophan containing peptides undergo oxidation in the mass spectrometer. 2A. H. Johnsen, unpublished observations. Both processes appear to be more pronounced in short peptides and at low peptide concentrations.Fig. 3Mass spectra of some of the purified CCK molecules secreted from yeast transformants. A, CCK-8-Gly (calculated molecular mass 1121) secreted from YNG318 expressing the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK construct, the four last peaks stem from increasing oxidations of the parent molecule, as often seen with peptides containing methionine and tryptophan residues. B, CCK-22-Gly, including two oxidized residues (calculated molecular mass: 2800) secreted from YNG318 expressing the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK construct.

This resulted in the detection of two additional CCK-immunoreactive peaks not present in untreated fractions, one at a KD of 0.6 and the other at a KD of 1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, it would appear the new peaks represented C-terminally extended CCK-22 and CCK-8, respectively. Fractions collected from Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography were also analyzed with Ab 89009 which binds the N terminus of CCK-22. Two immunoreactive peaks were observed, one corresponding to CCK-22-Gly and the other at KD 0.6 (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting this elution constant represents C-terminally extended CCK-22. A similar experiment was performed using an antibody which binds the N terminus of non-sulfated CCK-8 (Ab 94179). 3J. F. Rehfeld, unpublished data. The results showed two immunoreactive peaks at KD values of 1 and 1.15, the latter being CCK-8-Gly, and the former being C-terminally extended CCK-8 (data not shown). Expression of the pro-CCK fusion in strain MT960 (Table I), which is the wild type for the PEP4 protease, but defective in the BAR1 encoded “barrier” protease, an exported pepsin-like protease which cleaves α-factor (Mackay et al., 198826Mackay V.L. Welch S.K. Insley M.Y. Manney T.R. Holly J. Saari G.C. Parker M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 55-59Google Scholar), resulted in the formation of CCK-22-Gly and CCK-8-Gly in a manner similar to that of strain YNG318 (data not shown). Thus, neither protease A nor the barrier protease seems to be responsible for the observed proteolytic cleavages of pro-CCK. The prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK plasmid was transformed into S. cerevisiae strains deficient in the function of known yeast secretory pathway endopeptidases in an attempt to determine which enzyme(s) were responsible for the endoproteolytic processing of pro-CCK. Analysis of the extracellular products from transformants of the mkc7 yeast mutant HKY21 by gel chromatography and RIA analysis with Ab 3208 showed that both CCK-22-Gly and CCK-8-Gly were produced (Fig. 4A). Pro-CCK processing was then analyzed in yeast deficient in both the Mkc7 and Yap3 aspartyl proteases (HKY24). However, the three proteolytic cleavage events occurring in wild type yeast persisted in the mkc7 yap3 double mutant (Fig. 4B). Treatment of the column fractions with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B uncovered two additional immunoreactive peaks (Fig. 4B) corresponding to C-terminally extended versions of CCK-22 and CCK-8. Processing at Lys81 to produce C-terminally extended CCK-22 was confirmed in the HKY24 strain by the purification of the CCK-immunoreactive material eluting at a KD of 0.6 followed by protein sequencing and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3C). When the prepro-MFα1-pro-CCK construct was expressed in a kex2 mutant, ME598, the pattern of pro-CCK endoproteolytic processing was altered (Fig. 4C). No glycine extended products were detected, and a single major CCK-immunoreactive peak was found eluting at a KD of 0.6 after the Sephadex G-50 column fractions had been exposed to trypsin and carboxypeptidase B treatment (Fig. 4C). A similar situation was observed when the fusion protein was expressed in the kex2 yap3 double mutant ME938 (Fig. 4D). Immunoreactive material in the medium of this double mutant was purified, exposed to protein sequencing and mass spectrometry (Fig. 3D), and its identity shown to be C-terminally extended CCK-22. However, several other CCK species were recovered during the large scale preparation of pro-CCK processing products secreted by the ME938 transformant, each constituting a minor fraction (less than 5%) of total secreted CCK. Most were N- or C-terminally truncated fragments, indicating that a low level of degradation by amino- and carboxypeptidases had occurred (data not shown). Although, a small amount of C-terminally extended CCK-39, N-terminally truncated by one residue, was also identified (data not shown). CCK processing patterns were also examined in the triple protease mutant strain HKY25 (Table I). Analysis of secreted pro-CCK products revealed a large degree of variation between experiments in molecular forms of CCK produced, however, cleavage at Lys81 persisted"

From our results, it appears that the energetic contribution of aromatic face-to-face stacking interactions may be significant if polycyclic molecules, such as guanine, are involved. The energetics of virtually all binding properties in proteins is the culmination of a complex set of intermolecular interactions. The individual contributions and the mutual interdependence of these interactions are currently being probed through protein engineering by many research groups. The most powerful experimental approach is to analyze the effects of single mutations on binding, turnover, or conformational stability and to compare these with the properties of proteins where multiple mutations are combined in one molecule (1Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Google Scholar, 2Gerlt J.A. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1079-1105Google Scholar, 3Knowles J.R. Science. 1987; 236: 1252-1257Google Scholar, 4Wells J.A.

Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Google Scholar). In each case, the free energy barriers to substrate turnover introduced by mutations of catalytic residues are not additive in the corresponding double (or multiple) mutants. Residues involved in the process of breaking and forming covalent bonds appear to contribute to turnover in a mutually dependent way. Far less information is available on the additivity of molecular interactions involved in substrate binding. In this study, we investigate the mutual dependence of interactions at the guanine-binding site of ribonuclease T1 by protein engineering. Ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1; EC 3.1.27.3) of the slime mold Aspergillus oryzae (10Sato K. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1957; 44: 753-767Google Scholar) is the best known representative of a large family of homologous microbial ribonucleases with members in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic worlds (11Hartley R.W.

RNase T1 has a pronounced specificity for the base guanine; kinetic studies on the trans-esterification of dinucleoside phosphates revealed that the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for GpN 1The abbreviations used are: NpN3′,5′-linked dinucleoside phosphate compounds (N represents any of the four common nucleosides)2′-GMP2′-guanylic acid; Wat, water. substrates is ∼106-fold greater than for corresponding ApN substrates and at least 108-fold greater than for CpN and UpN substrates (13Walz F.G. Osterman H.L. Libertin C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 95-102Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of RNase T1 complexed with the competitive inhibitor 2′-GMP (14Heinemann U. Saenger W. Nature. 1982; 299: 27-31Google Scholar, 15Arni R. Heinemann U. Tokuoka R. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15358-15368Google Scholar) provides a structural basis for understanding the enzyme's specificity. In the complex, the hydrogen-bonding potential of the guanine base is completely saturated by complementary donor/acceptor sites on the enzyme involving the backbone atoms of Asn-43, Asn-44, and Asn-98 and the side chain carboxyl group of Glu-46 (Fig. 1). The N(1)-H-Glu-46 O-ϵ1, N(2)-H-Glu-46 O-ϵ2, and the N(2)-H-Asn-98 O hydrogen bonds have apparent contributions of 2.7, 1.1, and 1.2 kcal/mol to the specificity of RNase T1 for guanosine, respectively (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar). Moreover, the guanine base is stacked between the phenolic side chains of tyrosines 42 and 45 (14Heinemann U.

In this study, Tyr-42, Tyr-45, and Glu-46 (the only residues that interact with the guanine base through their side chains) have been replaced by alanine. The effects of the single mutations are discussed below. To measure the functional cooperativity between these residues, single and multiple mutations have been analyzed by double mutant cycles. The structural implications of the Y42A mutation have been investigated by x-ray diffraction analysis. Oligonucleotides were bought from Eurogentec. The 3′,5′-dinucleoside phosphate substrate GpU was from Sigma. Common reagents were purchased at the highest purity available. The overproduction of wild-type RNase T1 and the E46A mutant as secretory proteins in Escherichia coli has previously been described (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar, 21Steyaert J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9064-9072Google Scholar). The Y42A and Y45A mutants, the corresponding double mutant, as well as the Y42A/E46A double mutant were constructed via a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis technique (22Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659Google Scholar). Mutations were identified by DNA sequence determination (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar); the entire sequence of each mutant gene was determined to check that no additional unwanted mutations had arisen during the polymerase chain reaction steps. The wild-type and mutant enzymes used in this study are of the isoform containing a lysine at position 25; they were purified to homogeneity as described (24Mayr L.M. Schmid F.X. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 52-58Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 35°C in 50 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM EDTA at pH 6.0 (ionic strength = 0.1 M). The protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm, where A0.1% = 1.54 (25Shirley B.A. Laurents D.V. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 20: 181-188Google Scholar). For the mutants lacking one or two tyrosine side chains, this value was recalculated according to Pace et al. (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar). The obtained A0.1% values were 1.42 for mutants with one truncated tyrosine and 1.30 for the mutant with two tyrosine side chains removed. The kinetic parameters for the trans-esterification of GpU were determined from initial velocities by measuring the absorbance increase at 280 nm (27Zabinski M. Walz F.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 558-564Google Scholar). GpU concentrations varied between 10 μM and 1 mM. Reactions were started by adding enzyme to final concentrations ranging from 3 × 10−10 to 5 × 10−6M depending on the enzyme used, except for the Y42A/E46A mutant, for which a concentration of 397 μM had to be used. For this mutant, the second-order rate constant (kcat/Km) for the trans-esterification of GpU was derived from a progress curve run overnight at a substrate concentration of 408 μM (much lower than the Km). Indeed, the Km for the single E46A mutant exceeds 5 mM (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar). In experiments requiring high substrate concentrations, 0.5-, 0.2-, or 0.1-cm path length cuvettes were used to diminish the background absorbance. Experimental data were analyzed with the program GraFit (28Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar). Single crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in sitting drops at 20 mg/ml protein in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 0.125% (w/v) 2′-GMP and 1.25% (w/v) CaCl2 using 50% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a precipitant.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1523-1530Google Scholar) are very similar, we used the coordinates of this structure (Protein Data Bank code pdb1bir.ent) as our initial model for molecular replacement. After removing all non-protein atoms and the side chain of Tyr-42, rigid body refinement was carried out using X-PLOR (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), resulting in an R-factor of 0.316. The structure has been refined to a final R-factor of 0.216 and an Rfree factor of 0.257 by successive sessions of stereochemically restrained least-square refinements using X-PLOR and manual model revisions using the program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics Inc. graphics station. The phenylalanine at position 100 and 2′-GMP were fitted manually into the corresponding difference densities after the first couple of refinement cycles. 82 water molecules were inserted in spherical difference densities where suitable hydrogen-bonding partners were available. The interaction of an individual side chain with the substrate may be analyzed by comparing the kinetics for the wild-type enzyme with those for a mutant in which the side chain has been truncated (2Gerlt J.A. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1079-1105Google Scholar, 3Knowles J.R. Science. 1987; 236: 1252-1257Google Scholar). The obtained apparent binding energy is always a measure of the specificity of binding or catalysis (33Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1577-1580Google Scholar). If the mutation does not induce structural changes and allows the access of bulk water to the cavity in the enzyme-substrate complex, the apparent binding energy may be a crude measure of the incremental binding energy of the interaction, i.e. the net free energy contribution of the interaction to transfer the substrate from bulk water to the enzyme complex. Free energy changes calculated from the specificity constants (ΔG = −RT ln((kcat/Km)/(kcat/Km)group→0)) equal the apparent contribution to substrate specificity of the group under investigation. In this study, Tyr-42, Tyr-45, and Glu-46 have been replaced by alanines. The effects of these mutations on the steady-state kinetic parameters are discussed below. This paper also addresses the mutual interplay of amino acid residues involved in substrate binding. For this purpose, we constructed the Y42A/Y45A and Y42A/E46A double mutants and measured their kinetics. The free energy barriers to substrate specificity introduced by the single and multiple mutations have been analyzed by double mutant cycles (1Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Google Scholar, 4Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Google Scholar, 34Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Google Scholar). The degree to which one mutation affects the contribution of a second mutation (quantified by the coupling term ΔΔG) measures the mutual component of the interaction energy between both residues and the substrate, provided that none of the mutations gives rise to a disrupted spatial arrangement of other amino acid residues (1Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Google Scholar). Simple additivity (ΔΔG = 0) is observed when the two residues contribute to binding/turnover in a functionally independent way (4Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Google Scholar). To discuss the apparent effects of mutations on the steady-state kinetics in terms of binding energy and specificity (33Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1577-1580Google Scholar), it is a requisite to analyze the structural implications of these mutations (see above). In the ideal case, a mutation causes the removal of a simple interaction with no perturbation of the structure. Below, we argue that the mutations we introduced in RNase T1 are non-disruptive deletions (according to the classification of Fersht et al. (35Fersht A.R. Leatherbarrow R.J. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6030-6038Google Scholar)). Therefore, the apparent energetic contributions calculated from the effects of these mutations are genuine estimates of changes in incremental interaction energies. The phenolic side chain of Tyr-42 forms the basis of the guanine-binding site (Fig. 1). The aromatic ring lies on top of a hydrophobic core involving the side chains of Phe-50, Val-79, Ile-90, and Phe-100. Because of its buried location in the enzyme-substrate complex and the dramatic effect of the Y42A mutation on the kinetics (see below), we were concerned that this mutation induces major changes in the overall structure of the protein. For this reason, we examined the structural implications of the Y42A mutation by x-ray crystallography. The complex of Y42A RNase T1 with the specific inhibitor 2′-GMP has been refined to an R-factor of 0.216 using x-ray diffraction data to 2.3 Å (Table I). The Y42A mutation does not disrupt the overall structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (overall root mean square deviation = 0.349 Å). The local structural effects caused by the Y42A mutation are summarized in Fig. 2. The apparent structural perturbations at lysine 25 and glutamate 28, two solvent-exposed residues, are due to alternative side chain conformations. Table II compares the intermolecular hydrogen bonds for wild-type and Y42A RNase T1 in complex with 2′-GMP. A water molecule (Wat-134) occupies part of the free space available after removal of the tyrosine side chain (Fig. 3). The water molecule takes up the same position as the Tyr-42 O-η does in the wild-type enzyme and forms a new hydrogen bond of 2.92 Å (Table II) with O-6 of the base (Fig. 4). The sugar pucker in the Y42A RNase T1·2′-GMP complex is C-2′ endo (Table III), as in the case of the wild-type complex (15Arni R. Heinemann U. Tokuoka R. Saenger W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 757-764Google Scholar) studies on RNase T1 indicate that the Tyr-45 side chain is flexible and solvent-exposed. Removal of this side chain is therefore not likely to disturb the enzyme's three-dimensional structure. Glu-46, another solvent-exposed residue in the free enzyme, swings into hydrogen bond the guanine base (see the Introduction) upon substrate binding (19Martinez-Oyanedel J. Choe H.-W. Heinemann U. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 335-352Google Scholar). The invagination resulting from the removal of the Glu-46 side chain is probably sufficiently large to allow access of bulk water (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar). All structural data corroborate the view that the Y42A, Y45A, and E46A mutations correspond to non-disruptive deletions. Table IV lists the steady-state kinetic parameters for the trans-esterification of GpU obtained for the wild-type enzyme and for the Y42A, Y45A, and E46A mutants. The Y45A mutation has minor effects on the steady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme, indicating that this residue does not contribute significantly to the incremental binding energy of the substrate. Consistent with this notion, the Y45F and Y45W mutations have been found to induce marginal effects on the trans-esterification kinetics of pGpC (37Ikehara M. Ohtsuka E. Tokunaga T. Nishikawa S.

Open table in a new tab In contrast to the Y45A mutation, the Y42A and E46A deletions were found to affect the steady-state kinetic parameters of the enzyme significantly. The trans-esterification rates of Y42A and E46A are linearly proportional to the substrate concentration over the entire concentration range that is experimentally accessible. From these linear relationships, we calculated the second-order rate constant for the trans-esterification reaction (kcat/Km). We defined a minimum value of Km equal to 1 mM (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar). From our data, it appears that substrate binding, rather than turnover, is impaired upon deletion of the Tyr-42 or Glu-46 side chain. The six-membered aromatic rings of Tyr-42 and the guanine base are involved in a parallel face-to-face stacking interaction (dihedral angle = 12°; centroid separation = 5.0 Å). The Y42A mutation has a devastating effect (ΔG = −5.4 kcal/mol) on the enzyme's incremental binding energy toward guanosine. This effect is much larger than normally observed for intramolecular aromatic-aromatic interactions between side chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, mostly of the perpendicular edge-to-face type (40Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Google Scholar, 41Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1988; 39: 125-189Google Scholar, 42Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Google Scholar). Indeed, simple aromatic rings prefer to associate via enthalpically favorable edge-to-face interactions of ∼1.5 kcal/mol. This is in contrast to parallel stacking, which contributes almost zero when the rings are monocyclic. The large contribution of Tyr-42 to substrate binding suggests that face-to-face stacking can be significant when polycyclic molecules such as guanine are involved. The contribution of Glu-46 to substrate binding and guanine specificity (see the Introduction) has been discussed in detail previously (16Steyaert J. Opsomer C. Wyns L. Stanssens P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 494-499Google Scholar, 43Hirono S. Kollman P.A. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 233-243Google Scholar). Studies on model compounds indicate that hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions may mutually reinforce each other (44Ishida T. Tarui M. In Y. Ogiyama M. Doi M. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 214-216Google Scholar). The large effects of the E46A and Y42A mutants could theoretically be explained by such a type of cooperativity. Hydrogen bonds with the periphery of the base (Glu-46) might enhance a stacking interaction with this base (Tyr-42) and vice versa. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a double mutant cycle analysis involving Tyr-42 and Glu-46 (Fig. 5). The effect of the Y42A mutation was measured in the presence and absence of the Glu-46 side chain. The coupling energy ΔΔG, measured by comparing the free energy differences corresponding to parallel transitions of this cycle, is 0.394 kcal/mol. This is a small value (<10%) compared with the effects of the individual mutations, indicating that the contributions of Tyr-42 and Glu-46 to guanine binding are mutually independent. Crystallographic data suggest that specific recognition of guanosine by RNase T1 involves sandwich-like parallel stacking of the guanosine base between the phenolic side chains of Tyr-42 and Tyr-45 (14Heinemann U. Saenger W. Nature. 1982; 299: 27-31Google Scholar, 15Arni R. Heinemann U. Tokuoka R. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15358-15368Google Scholar, 17Hakoshima T. Toda S. Sugio S. Tomita K.-I.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 127-133Google Scholar). Our data indicate that this view is no longer valid. The Tyr-45 phenolic side chain does not contribute to substrate binding or to substrate turnover. By constructing the Y42A/Y45A double mutant, we also investigated whether the stacking interaction between the guanine base and Tyr-42 depends on the presence of the Tyr-45 phenolic ring. The kcat/Km ratio for the double mutant is very similar to that for Y42A RNase T1 (Table IV), indicating that the strength of the Tyr-42-guanine base interaction does not depend on Tyr-45. Taken together, all data show that the Tyr-45 side chain, often referred to as the lid of the guanine-binding site (15Arni R. Heinemann U. Tokuoka R. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15358-15368Google Scholar, 38Nishikawa S. Morioka H. Kimura T. Ueda Y. Tanaka T. Uesugi S. Hakoshima T. Tomita K.-I. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. Eur. J.

Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 793-799Google Scholar), does not contribute to the incremental binding energy for guanosine. From our double mutant cycles, it appears that the Tyr-42/Tyr-45 and Tyr-42/Glu-46 pairs contribute to substrate binding in a mutually independent way. This is consistent with a large data base for free energy changes that result when single mutants are combined (4Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Google Scholar). Indeed, if two residues do not interact with each other by direct or indirect contact, the sum of the free energy changes derived from the single mutations is nearly always equal to the free energy change measured in the multiple mutant. One major exception where such simple additivity does not apply exists for catalytic residues which, instead, act in a highly cooperative way (5Carter P. Wells J.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 564-568Google Scholar, 7Weber D.J. Serpersu E.H. Shortle D. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8632-8642Google Scholar, 8Weber D.J. Meeker A.K. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6103-6114Google Scholar, 9Steyaert J. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 770-781Google Scholar). Structural conservation of particular enzyme residues among homologous family members is indicative of their structural or functional importance (45Poteete A.R. Rennell D. Bouvier S.E. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 38-40Google Scholar). Among the guanine-specific members of the homologous family of microbial ribonucleases, Tyr-42, Tyr-45, and Glu-46 are conserved (11Hartley R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 15: 355-358Google Scholar, 12Hill C. Dodson G. Heinemann U. Saenger W. Mitsui Y. Nakamura K. Borisov S. Tischenko G. Polyakov K. Pavlovsky S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 364-369Google Scholar). Both tyrosines are consistently observed at equivalent positions in all eukaryotic members. In the prokaryotic ribonucleases, a phenylalanine occupies position 42 (RNase T1 numbering), and an arginine is found at position 45. Glu-46 is found throughout the family. The conservation of an aromatic ring (Tyr, Phe) at position 42 (RNase T1 numbering) is compatible with the observation that the guanine base interacts with the phenyl part of the side chain. The tyrosine hydroxyl group makes no direct intermolecular contacts with the guanine base. The strict conservation of Glu-46 is easily explained in terms of two specific hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium part of the guanine base. It has been established that the Glu-46 carboxylate takes part in an invariant structural motif that renders guanine specificity (46Sevcik J. Sanishvilli R.G. Pavlovsky A.G. Polyakov K.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 158-162Google Scholar). The fact that Tyr-45 is conserved but does not contribute to substrate binding or to catalysis indicates that it fulfills another function. We can only speculate on its role. The Tyr-45 side chain may be involved in the folding and stability of RNase T1. It may prevent other nucleotides from binding the catalytic site. Comparison of the expression of the authentic RNase T1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and A. oryzae (47Fujii T. Yamaoka H. Gomi K. Kitamoto K. Kumagai C. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1869-1874Google Scholar) suggests the existence of an intracellular inhibitor for the enzyme. If A. oryzae has a specific inhibitor for its ribonuclease, Tyr-45 may be essential in RNase inhibitor recognition. Arg-59 (barnase numbering), the equivalent of Tyr-45 in barnase, interacts with five barstar residues and contributes ∼5 kcal/mol to the intermolecular interaction energy of the barnase-barstar complex (48Guillet V. Lapthorn A. Hartley R.W. Mauguen Y. Structure. 1993; 1: 165-176Google Scholar, 49Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Google Scholar).

However, when a given amount of the SdhC-SdhD fraction is mixed with varying amounts of succinate dehydrogenase or vice versa succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity increases as the amount of succinate dehydrogenase or the SdhC-SdhD fraction added increases. Maximum reconstitution is obtained when the weight ratio of succinate dehydrogenase to the SdhC-SdhD fraction reaches 5.26. This ratio is slightly higher than the calculated value of 3.37, obtained by assuming 1 mol of succinate dehydrogenase reacts with 1 mol of SdhC and SdhD. The isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction contains 35 nmol cytochrome b556/mg protein. Unlike mitochondrial cytochrome b560, the cytochrome b556 is reducible by succinate in the isolated and complex forms. Furthermore, cytochrome b556 in the isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction has absorption properties, carbon monoxide reactivity, and EPR characteristics similar to those of cytochrome b556 in intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase, indicating that its heme environments are not affected by the presence of succinate dehydrogenase. However, the redox potential of cytochrome b556 in the SdhC-SdhD fraction (22 mV) increases slightly when complexed with succinate dehydrogenase (34 mV). No hybrid succinate-ubiquinone reductase is formed from mitochondrial QPs (the membrane-anchoring protein fraction of bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase) and E. coli succinate dehydrogenase or vice versa. However, the cytochrome b556 in E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is reducible by succinate in the presence of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, and the rate of cytochrome b556 reduction correlates with the reconstitutive activity of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. A modified procedure is developed for isolation of highly purified succinate-ubiquinone reductase from Escherichia coli NM256 containing a cloned sdh operon in a multicopy plasmid. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase is solubilized from the membrane by polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and purified by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The isolated reductase is resolved into a reconstitutively active, two-subunit succinate dehydrogenase and a two-subunit membrane anchoring protein fraction (the SdhC-SdhD fraction) by alkaline (pH 10.2) treatment of the reductase in the presence of 1 M urea, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography under anaerobic conditions.

The Escherichia coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase catalyzes the succinate-dependent reduction of ubiquinone (Q) 1The abbreviations used are: QubiquinoneDCPIPdichlorophenol-indophenolE9C12polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl etherTTFAthenoyltrifluoroacetoneQ22,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. during aerobic respiration (1Spencer M.E. Guest J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 947-953Google Scholar). The purified complex contains four protein subunits with apparent molecular weights of 64,000, 28,000, 19,500, and 17,500, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar) and has five redox prosthetic groups: one covalent bound FAD, three iron-sulfur clusters (4Fe-4S, 2Fe-2S, and 3Fe-4S), and one protoheme IX, b556. The larger two subunits are succinate dehydrogenase. The 64-kDa subunit (Fp) houses FAD and the 28-kDa subunit (Ip) houses three iron-sulfur clusters. The two smaller subunits are membrane-anchoring proteins that house cytochrome b556. The ligand for cytochrome b556 is a bis-histidine (3Peterson J. Bibat C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 155-156Google Scholar). Both membrane-anchoring subunits are thought to be required for cytochrome b556 heme ligation (4Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Vibat C.R.T. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 521-527Google Scholar), are essential for attachment of soluble succinate dehydrogenase to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, and are required for the reduction of ubiquinone. The membrane-anchoring protein fraction is named QPs (Q-binding protein in succinate-ubiquinone reductase) in the mitochondrial system (5Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3579-3585Google Scholar). ubiquinone dichlorophenol-indophenol polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether thenoyltrifluoroacetone 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In E. coli, the genes for the Fp and Ip subunits and for the membrane anchoring proteins are located in one operon (sdh), which is transcribed in the following sequence: sdhC, sdhD, sdhA (Fp), sdhB (Ip) (6Wood D. Darlison M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Google Scholar, 7Darlison M.G. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 507-517Google Scholar). This operon has been cloned and sequenced (6Wood D. Darlison M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Google Scholar, 7Darlison M.G. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 507-517Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the Fp and Ip subunits of succinate dehydrogenase are highly conserved when compared with enzymes from different species. For example, the Ip subunits from beef heart mitochondria and from E. coli are approximately 50% identical (6Wood D. Darlison M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Google Scholar). On the other hand, amino acid sequences of the membrane anchoring subunits differ significantly among species (8Hagerhall C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Google Scholar). Of the available amino acid sequences of membrane anchoring subunits, QPs1 from beef heart mitochondria has higher sequence similarity to SdhC of E. coli than to SdhC of other bacteria (9Yu L. Wei Y.-Y. Usui S. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Google Scholar). However, QPs3 from beef heart mitochondria has no sequence similarity to E. coli SdhD (10Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A FASEB J. 1996; 10: 2837Google Scholar). Although E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase is structurally and functionally similar to the mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome b556 in the E. coli enzyme is fully reducible by succinate (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar), whereas that in mitochondria is not (11Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Google Scholar), indicating that the role of cytochrome b may differ in these two enzyme systems. In E. coli, cytochrome b556 may be involved in electron transfer, whereas in mitochondria cytochrome b560 plays a structural role. The latter was established by the restoration of the absorption properties, redox potential, and EPR characteristics of cytochrome b560 during formation of a thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)-sensitive succinate-ubiquinone reductase from isolated QPs and succinate dehydrogenase (11Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Google Scholar). Although intensive study of mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase has generated a wealth of information (8Hagerhall C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Google Scholar, 12Hederstedt L. Ohnishi T. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1992: 163-198Google Scholar, 13Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. III. CRC Press, London1992: 229-297Google Scholar), the electron transfer mechanisms in this region of the chain are not understood. Bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase has been resolved into reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase and QPs. High resolution SDS-PAGE of QPs reveals three protein bands, QPs1, QPs2, and QPs3, respectively (14Lee G.Y. He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Google Scholar). Although the cDNAs encoding QPs1 and QPs3 have been cloned and sequenced (10Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A FASEB J. 1996; 10: 2837Google Scholar, 14Lee G.Y. He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Google Scholar), the use of a genetic approach to elucidate the structure-function of QPs, especially to identify the amino acid residues involved in ubiquinone-binding and succinate dehydrogenase docking, must await the availability of active recombinant QPs subunits. The facts that the E. coli sdh operon has been cloned and sequenced and the enzyme from this source has been purified make this an attractive model system for structure-function studies of mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase. However, the difference in succinate reducibility of cytochrome b in these two reductases, together with the fact that E. coli SdhD bears no sequence similarity with QPs3 of beef mitochondria, raises the possibility that interactions between succinate dehydrogenase and membrane anchoring subunits in these two systems are different. Recently we developed a method to resolve E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase into reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase and membrane-anchoring protein fraction (the SdhC-SdhD fraction). This, together with the availability of reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase and QPs from beef heart mitochondria, enables us to compare the mode of interaction between succinate dehydrogenase and membrane anchoring subunits in these two systems. Herein we report the preparation of reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction from E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase. The physical properties and reconstitutive activity of purified succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction from E. coli were measured and compared with their mitochondrial counterparts. Formation of hybrid succinate-ubiquinone reductase was tested with mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction and vice versa. TTFA, dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP), polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (E9C12), fumaric acid, and succinic acid were obtained from Sigma. DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Oxalic acid was from Aldrich. Other chemicals were the highest purity commercially available. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q2) was synthesized in our laboratory as previously reported (15Yu C.A. Yu L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 23: 259-273Google Scholar). Calcium phosphate was prepared according to Jenner (16(June 5, 1973) U. S. Patent 3,737,516Google Scholar) and mixed at a 3:1 ratio with cellulose powder prior to use in column chromatography. Bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase (17Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Google Scholar), succinate dehydrogenase (18Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Google Scholar), and QPs (11Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Google Scholar) were prepared by the reported methods. E. coli K12 strain NM256/pGS133 (6Wood D. Darlison M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Google Scholar), which has plasmid containing a 4.5-kilobase pair BamHI fragment (sdhCDAB) inserted into a low copy number vector pLC339, was a gift from Dr. R. B. Gennis of the University of Illinois. Growth of E. coli NM256/pGS133 was carried out according to Koland et al. (19Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 445-453Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, when A660 reached 1.5-1.7, by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and frozen at −80°C. Membrane was prepared from frozen cell pastes essentially according to the method of Kita et al. (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar) and frozen at −80°C until use. 28 ml of frozen membrane preparation, 10 mg/ml, in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10% sucrose and 3 mM EDTA were thawed, and freshly prepared E9C12 (25% stock solution in H2O) was added to a final concentration of 4%. The mixture was incubated at 0°C with constant stirring for 1 h, 24 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 41,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant obtained was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (3.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% E9C12 (w/v), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was washed, in sequence, with 100 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% E9C12 (w/v), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ml of the same buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl, and a linear gradient formed from 500 ml of the same buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 500 ml of the same buffer containing 0.25 M NaCl. The fractions containing succinate-ubiquinone reductase were collected and combined, and succinate was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The reductase was concentrated by precipitation with 35% ammonium sulfate saturation. The floating precipitate obtained was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-succinate buffer, pH 7.4, to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml and used for preparation of succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction. 8 ml of the isolated succinate-ubiquinone reductase, 10 mg/ml, in 50 mM Tris-succinate buffer, pH 7.4, was dialyzed against 800 ml of 30 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM sodium succinate, for 4 h with one change of buffer. The dialyzed preparation was adjusted to a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml with 30 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM sodium succinate and flushed with argon for 30 min with stirring. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or in the cold room (4°C) under argon atmospheres. All solutions used were bubbled with argon gas for at least 10 min before use. Urea (8 M) solution was slowly added to the enzyme solution to a final concentration of 1 M. The mixture was then brought to pH 10.2 by adding 1 N NaOH dropwise. After incubation for 10 min the sample was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.6 × 3 cm) equilibrated with 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 10.0, containing 0.5 M urea and 10 mM sodium succinate. Succinate dehydrogenase was adsorbed to the column, while the SdhC-SdhD fraction was recovered in the effluent. The column effluent was immediately adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, and dialyzed against 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The dialyzed E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The purified SdhC-SdhD fraction was recovered as a floating precipitate between 10 and 35% ammonium sulfate saturation and redissolved in 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The column containing adsorbed succinate dehydrogenase was washed with 2 column volumes of 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 10.0, containing 0.5 M urea and 10 mM sodium succinate, followed by 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM sodium succinate until the pH of the eluate was neutral. This succinate dehydrogenase was eluted from the column with 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mM NaCl and 10 mM sodium succinate. The succinate dehydrogenase fractions were combined and treated with ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. The precipitate recovered was dissolved in a small volume of 50 mM sodium-potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 containing 20 mM succinate. This solution was divided into 100-μl portions and stored under argon at −80°C until use. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity was assayed as previously reported (17Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of enzyme complex was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mM sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 μM DCPIP, 20 mM succinate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 25 μM of Q2. Activity was determined by measuring the reduction of DCPIP (the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm). A millimolar extinction coefficient of 21 was used to calculate activity. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. The content of cytochrome b556 was determined from the reduced-minus-oxidized spectrum using the extinction coefficient of 22.8 cm−1 mM−1 for the wavelength pair 558-575 nm (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Kita et al. (20Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Google Scholar) or Schägger et al. (21Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Google Scholar) in which the 10% glycerol in the separating gel is replaced by 8 M urea (14Lee G.Y. He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Google Scholar). Potentiometric titrations of cytochrome b556 in the isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction and in intact and reconstituted succinate-ubiquinone reductases were carried out anaerobically using the ferri-ferro-oxalate system, at pH 7.0 (midpoint redox potential = 0 mV), as described previously (22Kita K. Yamato I. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8910-8915Google Scholar). EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 200D spectrometer at liquid helium temperature. The instrument settings are given in the relevant figure legends. Although a one-step purification procedure has been reported (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar) for isolation of succinate-ubiquinone reductase from an E. coli strain containing the sdh operon on a pGS133 plasmid, the detergent used in this method, Lubrol PX, is no longer commercially available. In order for this simple purification procedure to be useful, a substituting detergent for Lubrol PX must be found. Of 10 detergents tested, E9C12 was found to have the same effectiveness as Lubrol PX in solubilizing succinate-ubiquinone reductase from the membrane. Also, it is suitable for the subsequent DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase isolated with E9C12 has activity and purity comparable with that obtained with Lubrol PX. The isolated reductase catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone with a specific activity of 16 μmol succinate oxidized/min/mg protein (3.1 μmol succinate oxidized/min/nmol cytochrome b556) at 23°C. Activity was assayed by measuring the ability of the reductase to catalyze ubiquinone-mediated electron transfer from succinate to DCPIP. A maximum of 60% of the succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity detected in isolated succinate-ubiquinone reductase or in the membrane preparation is sensitive to TTFA (3 mM). This differs from that observed for the bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase in which about 98% of the activity detected is sensitive to TTFA. When the succinate-ubiquinone reductase obtained with E9C12 was subjected to SDS-PAGE using the system of Schägger et al. (21Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Google Scholar), three major protein bands, with apparent molecular masses of 64, 28, and 14 kDa and a very faint band with an apparent molecular mass of 13 kDa were observed (Fig. 1). This SDS-PAGE pattern is similar to that reported for the reductase prepared using Lubrol (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar). These four protein bands are assumed to be SdhA (64,000), SdhB (28,000), SdhC (14,000), and SdhD (12,000), respectively (2Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Google Scholar). However, judging from Coomassie Blue color intensities of the four protein bands, band IV is in substoichiometry to bands I and II of succinate dehydrogenase, whereas band III is in molar excess to bands I and II. The possibility that band IV is a contaminant protein and band III contains SdhC-SdhD has been ruled out because when the proteins in bands III and IV were eluted from the gel slices and subjected to the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, the sequences correspond to those of SdhC and SdhD, respectively. Thus, the band IV protein shown in SDS-PAGE is indeed SdhD. When the purified reductase is subjected to the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, the percentage of recoveries of N-terminal amino acid residues of these four subunits are similar, indicating that the molar ratio of these four subunits in the purified reductase is 1:1:1:1, and the low color intensity of SdhD results from its low binding affinity with Coomassie blue dye. The isolated E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase contains 0.05 nmol Q/nmol cytochrome b556, indicating that the isolated reductase is deficient in ubiquinone. Ubiquinone deficiency in succinate-ubiquinone reductase preparations is also evident from the activity increase in the Q-stimulated DCPIP reduction by succinate in the presence of excess Q2. With 25 μM Q2 in the assay mixture, E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase shows a more than 15-fold increase in DCPIP reduction (from 0.9 to 16 μmol succinate oxidized/min/mg protein), whereas the mitochondrial enzyme shows only a 2-2.5-fold increase (from 6.4 to 14 μmol succinate oxidized/min/mg protein), indicating a Q deficiency in the E. coli enzyme preparation of about 94% and in mitochondrial enzyme of about 40-50%. Because studying Q-protein interactions using synthetic ubiquinone derivatives requires prior removal of Q from the enzyme complex, the E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase preparation is superior to the mitochondrial enzyme preparation. Succinate-ubiquinone reductase is resolved into succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction by a procedure involving alkaline (pH 10.2) treatment in the presence of 1 M urea, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. All steps are carried out under anaerobic conditions (argon atmosphere), and all reagents are bubbled with argon gas for at least 10 min before use. The alkaline pH, together with urea, splits succinate dehydrogenase from the SdhC-SdhD fraction, and these two fractions are separated on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. The dark green-colored succinate dehydrogenase is tightly absorbed to the column, whereas the reddish-colored SdhC-SdhD fraction is recovered in the effluent. The absorbed succinate dehydrogenase was eluted with 250 mM NaCl. The greenish-colored material remaining on the column could not be eluted even with 1 M salt and was identified as denatured succinate dehydrogenase. The denaturation of succinate dehydrogenase does not occur in the column chromatographic step because when DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B gel is used in a batchwise eluting manner, instead of in a column, denatured succinate dehydrogenase is also observed. Prolonging the column chromatographic step increases the amount of succinate dehydrogenase denatured. In general, for a 1.5-h-long column chromatographic step, the recovery of succinate dehydrogenase is about 60-70%, whereas the recovery of the SdhC-SdhD fraction is nearly 100%. The pH of SdhC-SdhD-containing effluent from the DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column must be neutralized immediately. Urea in the effluent is removed by dialysis. Because dialysis does not remove E9C12, a relatively high concentration of detergent (2%) is present in the SdhC-SdhD preparation. High detergent concentrations destabilize cytochrome b556 and make it very difficult to concentrate samples for use in experiments needing high protein concentrations, such as EPR. Ammonium sulfate fractionation of the dialyzed SdhC-SdhD fraction removes the excess E9C12 from the preparation as a thick white waxy floating precipitate formed between 5 and 20% ammonium sulfate saturation. The pure SdhC-SdhD fraction is recovered as a floating red precipitate formed between 20 and 35% ammonium sulfate saturation and dissolved in a small volume of buffer to give a protein concentration of 10-20 mg/ml. About 60% of the SdhC-SdhD in succinate-ubiquinone reductase is recovered in this final step. The SdhC-SdhD fraction thus obtained is ready for use in EPR experiments and can be stored at −80°C for months without loss of reconstitutive activity. Isolated succinate dehydrogenase shows two protein bands on SDS-PAGE, with apparent molecular masses of 64 and 28 kDa (lane 3 of Fig. 1), corresponding to SdhA and SdhB in succinate-ubiquinone reductase. The isolated membrane-anchoring fraction shows two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 14 and 13 kDa (lane 4 of Fig. 1), corresponding to SdhC and SdhD. The purity of isolated succinate dehydrogenase and membrane-anchoring protein fraction, judging from SDS-PAGE, is more than 90%. Fig. 2 shows the reconstitution of succinate-ubiquinone reductase from succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction. Isolated succinate dehydrogenase or the SdhC-SdhD fraction alone has no succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity. However, when a given amount of succinate dehydrogenase is mixed with varying amounts of the SdhC-SdhD fraction, the succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity increases as the amount of the SdhC-SdhD fraction used is increased (Fig. 2A). Maximal reconstitution is obtained when the weight ratio of succinate dehydrogenase to the SdhC-SdhD fraction reaches 5.26. The maximum reconstituted activity is 3.1 μmol succinate oxidized/min/nmole cytochrome b556 at 23°C. The addition of 3 mM TTFA in the assay mixture inhibits 50% of the reconstituted activity. Because the maximum reconstituted activity obtained and the degree of TTFA sensitivity are the same as those observed for intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase, the resolved succinate dehydrogenase and SdhC-SdhD fraction are reconstitutively active. The weight ratio of 5.26 for maximum activity is also obtained when the reconstitution is performed with a given amount of the SdhC-SdhD fraction and varying amounts of succinate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2B). If intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase contains four subunits, with molecular weights of 64,268, 26,637, 14,167, and 12,792, in equal molar ratio, the weight ratio between succinate dehydrogenase and the SdhC-SdhD fraction should be 3.37. That the experimental value is higher than the calculated value is probably due to slight denaturation of the soluble succinate dehydrogenase used, because it is known to be labile in the soluble form. The isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction contains 35 nmol cytochrome b556/mg protein. The oxidized cytochrome shows broad absorption at the α- and β-regions with Soret absorption at 412 nm (see Fig. 3). When the sample is reduced with dithionite, an α-absorption at 558 nm, a broad β-absorption peak at between 526 and 528 nm, and the Soret absorption at 424 nm are observed (Fig. 3). These absorption characteristics are identical to those observed for cytochrome b556 in intact or reconstituted E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase, indicating that the absorption characteristics of cytochrome b556 are not affected by the presence of succinate dehydrogenase. This is in contrast to the beef heart mitochondrial system in which the spectral characteristics of cytochrome b560 in isolated QPs differ from those of cytochrome b560 in the reductase. The dithionite-reduced cytochrome b560 in isolated mitochondrial QPs has a symmetrical α-absorption peak at 560 nm, whereas in succinate-ubiquinone reductase it exhibits an α-absorption maximum at 560.5 nm with a discernible shoulder at 553 nm. The addition of succinate dehydrogenase to QPs to form succinate-ubiquinone reductase regenerates the 553 nm shoulder peak, indicating that the heme environments of cytochrome b560 are affected by the presence of succinate dehydrogenase. Cytochrome b556 in isolated succinate-ubiquinone reductase is reducible by succinate. Cytochrome b556 in the isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction is also reducible by succinate in the presence of succinate dehydrogenase under anaerobic conditions. The succinate reduced spectrum of cytochrome b556, either in the isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction or in succinate-ubiquinone reductase, is the same as that obtained with dithionite. On the other hand, cytochrome b560 in intact mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase or isolated QPs is not reducible by succinate. Reduced cytochrome b556 and cytochrome b560 in isolated succinate-ubiquinone reductases from E. coli and beef heart mitochondria, respectively, do not react with carbon monoxide. Reduced cytochrome b556 in the isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction does not react with carbon monoxide, whereas cytochrome b560 in isolated mitochondrial QPs in its reduced form is completely reactive with carbon monoxide. The addition of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase to mitochondrial QPs converts carbon monoxide reactive cytochrome b560 in QPs into a carbon monoxide nonreactive form. As expected, after the addition of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase to the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction, cytochrome b556 in the SdhC-SdhD fraction remains totally nonreactive toward carbon monoxide. These results suggest that the environments of the fifth and sixth ligands of mitochondrial cytochrome b560 differ from those of E. coli cytochrome b556, even though the ligands for both cytochromes are bis-histidines (3Peterson J. Bibat C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 155-156Google Scholar, 23Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Google Scholar). The midpoint potential of cytochrome b556 in the isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is estimated to be +22 mV, about 12 mV lower than that of cytochrome b556 in intact (34 mV) succinate-ubiquinone reductases. The addition of succinate dehydrogenase to the SdhC-SdhD fraction increases the midpoint potential of cytochrome b556 to 33 mV with concurrent reconstitution of succinate-ubiquinone reductase. The redox potential of E. coli cytochrome b556 in the isolated SdhC-SdhD fraction is 166 mV higher than that of cytochrome b560 in isolated mitochondrial QPs (−144 mV); and the redox potential of cytochrome b556 in intact E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase is 219 mV higher than that of cytochrome b560 in intact mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase (−185 mV). These values correlate with the fact that mitochondrial cytochrome b560 is not reducible by succinate in either the isolated or complex form, whereas E. coli cytochrome b556 is reducible by succinate in both forms. Like mitochondrial cytochrome b560, the redox potential of E. coli cytochrome b556 is affected by the interaction of SdhC-SdhD with succinate dehydrogenase. Fig. 4 compares EPR characteristics of cytochromes b in isolated membrane-anchoring fraction and intact and reconstituted succinate-ubiquinone reductases from E. coli and mitochondrial systems. Cytochrome b556 in the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction shows an EPR signal at g = 3.65 (Fig. 4A). This signal is identical to that of cytochrome b556 in intact and reconstituted E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductases, indicating that removal of succinate dehydrogenase did not affect the heme environments of cytochrome b556. This is different from that observed for mitochondrial cytochrome b560. Cytochrome b560 in intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase exhibits a EPR signal at g = 3.46, whereas it shows two EPR signals at g = 3.07 and 2.92 in isolated QPs (Fig. 4B). The addition of succinate dehydrogenase to QPs converts the g = 3.07 EPR signal of cytochrome b560 in QPs to g = 3.46, indicating that the heme environment of cytochrome b560 is affected by the interaction of QPs with succinate dehydrogenase. The availability of isolated, reconstitutively active membrane-anchoring fraction and succinate dehydrogenase from the E. coli and bovine mitochondrial systems enables us to study the formation of a hybrid succinate-ubiquinone reductase from the E. coli membrane-anchoring protein fraction and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and vice versa. When a given amount of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase is mixed with increasing amounts of mitochondrial QPs, no succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity is detected (see Fig. 2A, cross symbols). Failure to reconstitute is also observed when the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is mixed with increasing amounts of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (see Fig. 2B, cross symbols). Because no hybrid succinate-ubiquinone reductases are formed, it is of interest to see whether or not this is due to a lack of interaction between succinate dehydrogenase and the membrane-anchoring protein fraction from these two systems. Reduction of cytochrome b556 in the isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction in the presence of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase or a change of EPR characteristics of cytochrome b560 in isolated mitochondrial QPs upon the addition of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase would indicate interaction. The first indication is based on the fact that cytochrome b556 in the isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is reducible by succinate upon the addition of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase. The second indication is based on the observation that one of the EPR signals (g = 3.07) of cytochrome b560 in isolated mitochondrial QPs converts to a g = 3.46 signal upon the addition of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. Table I shows that the cytochrome b556 in E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is reducible by succinate in the presence of reconstitutively active mitochondrial or E. coli succinate dehydrogenase. The rate of reduction correlates with the reconstitutive activity of the added succinate dehydrogenase. When the isolated E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction is mixed with mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenases having decreasing low Km ferricyanide reductase activity, the rate of cytochrome b556 reduction by succinate decreases correspondingly. No cytochrome b556 reduction is observed when a mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase possessing no low Km ferricyanide reductase activity is added to the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction. Because the low Km ferricyanide reductase activity in soluble succinate dehydrogenase correlates with its reconstitutive activity, the rate of cytochrome b556 reduction by succinate in the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction correlates with the reconstitutive activity of succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenases with decreasing low Km ferricyanide reductase activity are obtained by exposing fully reconstitutively active soluble succinate dehydrogenase to air for increasing lengths of time. The rate of cytochrome b556 reduction by succinate is faster with mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase than with the E. coli enzyme at the same protein concentration. This is in line with the fact that isolated succinate dehydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria has a higher low Km ferricyanide activity than does succinate dehydrogenase from E. coli As expected, no reduction of cytochrome b556 by succinate is observed when mitochondrial succinate-ubiquinone reductase or succinate-cytochrome c reductase is added to the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction because the succinate dehydrogenase in these reductase complexes contains no low Km ferricyanide reductase activity (or reconstitutive activity).Table IReduction of cytochrome b556 in the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction by various preparationsPreparation addedReduction of cytochrome b556Reduction rateμmol b556/min/mgE. coli SQR+0.27Mito SQR−E. coli SDH+0.31Mito SDH+0.40(Reconstitutively active)Mito SDH−(Reconstitutively inactive) Open table in a new tab Because cytochrome b556 is not reducible by succinate in the presence of reconstitutively inactive succinate dehydrogenase or intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase from beef heart mitochondria, the electron for the reduction of cytochrome b556 in E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction must come from the low Km ferricyanide reductase site of succinate dehydrogenase. These results indicate that succinate dehydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria can interact with the E. coli SdhC-SdhD fraction and reduce cytochrome b556 at the expense of succinate. However, this reduced cytochrome b556 is unable to reduce Q, and thus no succinate-ubiquinone reductase is formed. The inability of reduced cytochrome b556 to reduce Q may indicate that cytochrome b556 in E. coli succinate-ubiquinone reductase is not the donor of the first electron for Q. Possibly, the electron acceptor for cytochrome b556 is a ubisemiquinone radical and the donor of the first electron for Q is E. coli succinate dehydrogenase. In the hybrid system, the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase is unable to provide the first electron to reduce Q to ubisemiquinone. Alternatively, the reduction of cytochrome b556 is not required for succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity in the E. coli system. Interaction between mitochondrial QPs and E. coli succinate dehydrogenase is suggested by the decrease in the signal height of the g = 3.07 EPR signal of cytochrome b560 in QPs upon the addition of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase (see Fig. 4B). However, this interaction differs from that observed in the mitochondrial reconstituting system in which the g = 3.07 EPR signal of cytochrome b560 in QPs is converted to a g = 3.46 signal. Because the addition of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase to mitochondrial QPs causes a decrease in the g = 3.07 signal height of cytochrome b560 without producing the g = 3.46 signal, no succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity is reconstituted. This suggests that E. coli succinate dehydrogenase interacts with mitochondrial QPs to some degree but not enough to form an active reductase.

The Hemopoietic Colony-stimulating Factors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984Google Scholar). GM-CSF exerts its biological effects through binding to its high affinity, heterodimeric receptor complex composed of a low affinity GM-CSF-specific α subunit (GMR-α) and a common β subunit (βc) shared with the receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-5 (2Lopez A.F. Elliott M.J. Woodcock J. Vadas M.A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 495-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Amino acid residue 21 in the GM-CSF molecule is essential for binding to its GM-CSF receptor αβc complex (3Hercus T.R. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J.M. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 3500-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of glutamic acid for arginine at this position in GM-CSF resulted in a GM-CSF analog (E21R) that bound to the low affinity GMR-α, was devoid of high affinity binding to the GM-CSF receptor αβc complex, and effectively antagonized GM-CSF in binding experiments and functional assays (4Hercus T.R. Bagley C.J. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J.M. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E21R induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in hemopoietic cells expressing the GM-CSF receptor (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Importantly, E21R directly induced apoptosis in the absence of any preexisiting GM-CSF, and this appeared to be an active process since inhibition of protein phosphorylation, transcription, and protein synthesis rescued the cells from E21R-induced apoptosis (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, E21R induced apoptosis even if the survival factors granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or stem cell factor were added to the cells. However, addition of IL-3 blocked E21R-induced apoptosis, indicating that ligand-mediated engagement of βc is central for maintaining cell viability (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

GMR-α is the major binding subunit of the GM-CSF receptor complex and plays a role in biological signaling. Mapping of the cytoplasmic domain of the GMR-α subunit using truncated receptor mutants suggested that the membrane-proximal region (upstream of residue 382) is important for growth of BaF3 cells (6Muto A.

We wanted to study if the same regions were involved in E21R-induced apoptosis. The βc alone does not bind GM-CSF, but confers high affinity binding of GM-CSF when coexpressed with the low affinity GMR-α subunit (10Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5082-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, βc is crucial for signal transduction generated by the GM-CSF receptor (10Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies of βc mutants with cytoplasmic truncations coexpressed with wild-type GMR-α in BaF3 cells revealed two regions critical for signaling. The membrane-proximal region (upstream of residue 517) is involved in phosphorylation, proliferation, and viability (12Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Durstin M. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The distal region (between residues 626 and 763) is essential for activation of signaling proteins including ras and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (14Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and rescue from growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis (15Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although βc is essential for survival, its role in E21R-induced apoptosis is not known. The absence of high affinity binding of E21R (presumably the result of a lack of βc contact) suggested that binding to GMR-α was sufficient and that βc was not required for E21R-induced apoptosis. Ligand binding of the GM-CSF receptor αβc complex leads to phosphorylation of βc, the JAK2 kinase, and MAP kinases (8Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A.

Certain stimuli such as activation of Fas/APO-1 (CD95), osmotic shock, and UV irradiation cause an increase in the activity of the MAP kinase c-Jun-NH2-terminal-kinase (JNK) compared with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and this imbalance has been associated with apoptosis (17Cano E.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar). As GM-CSF can activate the MAP-kinases, it was of interest to see if activation of JNK and ERK is associated with E21R-induced apoptosis. Although various external stimuli can initiate apoptosis through different signaling cascades, some of these converge at the level of one or several interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) and related cysteine proteases (for review, see Ref. 22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been established whether ICE and ICE-like proteases are involved in E21R-induced apoptosis. In this study we sought to determine (i) the requirements of the GMR-α and βc subunits in E21R-induced apoptosis; (ii) the role played by JNK and ERK; (iii) whether E21R activates the Fas/APO-1 (CD95) receptor; and (iv) if ICE-like proteases were essential for E21R-induced apoptosis. We show that the membrane-proximal regions of both GMR-α and βc are required for E21R-induced apoptosis. This process does not involve tyrosine phosphorylation of βc, but treatment with E21R alters the ERK/JNK balance. The apoptosis-inducing surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) is not activated with E21R. Furthermore, we provide evidence for involvement of ICE-like proteases following E21R treatment. Finally, the physiological cell death inhibitor Bcl-2 does not inhibit apoptosis by E21R, indicating that the molecular mechanism of this pathway is distinct from that induced by growth factor deprivation. Permission was approved by ethics committees to collect blood from leukemic patients. Peripheral blood was collected from patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Primary blast cells expressing functional heterodimeric GM-CSF receptors were isolated and cultured as described previously (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These AML cells did not express mRNA for GM-CSF, and they were devoid of endogenous GM-CSF production (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We also studied Jurkat T cells. This human cell line grows autonomously and was maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum without exogenous growth factors. Nonstimulated Jurkat T cells do not produce detectable GM-CSF mRNA or protein. DNA constructs were introduced into Jurkat T cells by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). We cotransfected 2 × 107 cells in 0.3 ml of RPMI medium with 3 μg of GMR-α constructs, 7 μg of βc constructs, and 10 μg of apoptosis inhibitor expression constructs, and at 960 microfarads and 270 V. The generation of the cDNAs and the corresponding vectors for the GMR-α and βc mutants have been described elsewhere (7Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

These receptor cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into the Jurkat T cells before they were sorted and studied after 48 h. Plasmids encoding RSV/Bcl-2, pCXN2/CrmA, or pcDNA3/p35 were introduced into Jurkat T cells, and stable clones were selected for resistance to neomycin (1.5 mg/ml, CrmA and p35) or hygromycin (0.5 mg/ml, Bcl-2). After selection for antibiotic resistance over the next 15 days, we transiently transfected the cells with both GMR-α and βc cDNA as outlined above. The methods for immunoprecipitation of the βc subunit and Western blotting of phosphorylated βc have been detailed recently (25Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J. Goodall G. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AML cells (107/sample) were stimulated with either GM-CSF (10 ng/ml, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) or E21R (1 μg/ml, BresaGen, Adelaide, Australia) for selected time periods before they were lysed, and βc was immunoprecipitated with our anti-βc monoclonal antibody 4F3. Immunoprecipitated βc was then analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. In separate experiments, AML cells were metabolically labeled with 32PO4 (1 μCi/107cells, BresaGen) overnight prior to cytokine stimulation. Gels with immunoprecipitated βc were analyzed with a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In other experiments we specifically examined tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated βc using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (3-365-10, Boehringer Mannheim, Frankfurt, Germany) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham, Little Chalfont, U. K.). To measure the JNK/ERK activity we used a kinase method described previously (26Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 871-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, AML cells (107/sample) were cultured with either GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), E21R (10 μg/ml), or subjected to 30 min of osmotic stress using D-sorbitol (0.6 M, Sigma, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). The cells were lysed, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with either an anti-JNK1 or an anti-ERK1 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, Pharmigen, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitates were next adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose before washing in lysis buffer and in kinase buffer. The immunocomplexes were then resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (BresaGen) and 20 μg of either the fusion protein c-Jun (1–169)-GST (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or myelin basic protein (Sigma). The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30°C before it was terminated with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylation of products was examined after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) using the PhosphoImager. To test whether the Fas/APO-1 (CD95) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors were activated upon adding E21R, we cultured AML cells for 48 h with E21R (1 μg/ml) with or without a soluble Fas receptor (anti-Fas, 20 μg/ml) or a soluble TNF receptor (TNFR, 20 μg/ml) (27Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). As positive controls we measured, after 24 h, either the viability of Jurkat T cells cultured with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3, 100 μg/ml) with or without anti-Fas (20 μg/ml), or the viability of the human laryngeal carcinoma cell line Hep2 (28Barbara J.A.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) cultured with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) with or without anti-TNFR (20 μg/ml). We used the ICE-inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (YVAD-CMK; Bachem, Switzerland) or the alkylating agent iodoacetamide (Sigma) to block protease activity. Dexamethasone (0.1 mM, Sigma) was used to induce apoptosis of Jurkat T cells with or without overexpression of Bcl-2. The degradation of chromosomal DNA into low molecular weight fragments was displayed on 1.2% agarose gels after an overnight incubation with lysis buffer followed by extraction with organic solutions as described elsewhere (29Lotem J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sachs L. Blood. 1991; 78: 953-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We quantitated the number of apoptotic cells by either measuring the reduced binding of propidium iodide to DNA using an EPICS-Profile II Flow Cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) as outlined (30Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) or by determination of trypan blue exclusion. All human, primary, hemopoietic cells express both the GMR-α and βc. To establish the individual requirements of GMR-α and of βc for E21R-induced apoptosis, we expressed either or both receptor subunits in Jurkat T cells since these cells do not have endogenous expression of the GM-CSF receptor. Using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry we isolated the GM-CSF receptor-positive cells and confirmed the expression of the GMR-α or the βc mutants and that the levels of expression were similar. Furthermore, the expression levels remained constant over the next 40 h (data not shown). E21R (10 μg/ml) induced apoptosis only in cells expressing both receptor subunits and in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) with a maximal effect seen after 30 h (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing either receptor subunit alone remained fully viable. We identified key features of apoptosis (22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar) such as condensation of the chromatin and decreases in size of the nuclei and cells upon addition of E21R by examination of electron micrographs (Fig. 2, A and B) and demonstration of fragmented DNA (Fig. 2C). Since Jurkat T cells grow in a GM-CSF-independent manner these experiments further illustrate the active nature of the E21R-induced apoptosis. To study in more detail the cytoplasmic regions of the GMR-α and βc involved in E21R-induced apoptosis, we expressed a series of mutant receptors in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3). In cells expressing wild-type GMR-α and βc mutants having up to 255 amino acids deleted (β763, β626), E21R (10 μg/ml) induced apoptosis in a manner similar to cells expressing the wild-type GM-CSF receptor complex (Fig. 4). Cells with mutant β544 showed intermediate decline in viability, whereas cells carrying the β517 and β455 mutants were resistant to E21R treatment. Addition of wild-type GM-CSF alone had no impact on the viability of these cells (data not shown). Notably, the chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of βc and the full-length cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor β subunit was unable to signal apoptosis in response to E21R (Fig. 4). Thus, the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of βc appears important for E21R-induced apoptosis. With a similar approach using cells expressing wild-type βc and truncated GMR-α mutants (Fig. 3), we determined the cytoplasmic region of the GMR-α subunit required for E21R-induced apoptosis. Fig. 5A shows that a region spanning 16 amino acids downstream of the transmembrane domain was necessary for E21R (10 μg/ml) to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, a GMR-α/IL-2 receptor common γ subunit chimera allowed E21R-induced apoptosis, indicating that the cytoplasmic region of the IL-2 receptor common γ subunit can substitute for GMR-α in this effect (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the need for the membrane-proximal region of the receptor, the GMR-α/CPROX chimera prevented E21R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Addition of wild-type GM-CSF alone had no impact on the viability of the cells (data not shown). We next examined whether phosphorylation of βc accompanied E21R-induced apoptosis. We could not detect any alteration in the level of total phosphorylation of βc immunoprecipitated from AML cells metabolically labeled with 32P and treated with E21R (1 μg/ml; Fig. 6A). GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), on the other hand, markedly enhanced phosphorylation of βc. This observation was confirmed and extended with immunoprecipitated βc and an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. Whereas GM-CSF caused a rapid and clear increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of βc, E21R did not (Fig. 6B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of βc is therefore apparently not essential for E21R-induced apoptosis. Neither did we observe any detectable phosphorylation of the GMR-α subunit upon addition of E21R (data not shown). Moreover, in separate coimmunoprecipitation experiments using anti-βc antibody for immunoprecipitation and anti-JAK2 antibody for Western blotting, we noted that JAK2 was intrinsically associated with βc and that neither GM-CSF nor E21R altered the levels of JAK2 preassociation up to the 30-min time point. Furthermore, GM-CSF, but not E21R, induced phosphorylation of JAK2 (data not shown). To assess whether MAP kinases are associated with E21R-induced apoptosis, we measured the activities of immunoprecipitated ERK1 and JNK1 in a kinase assay. It is evident from Fig. 7 that E21R (1 μg/ml) prominently decreased ERK1 activity without affecting JNK1 activity in AML cells. These data reflect the actual activity of the MAP kinases and not their concentrations since we could not detect any alteration in the total amount of either ERK1 or JNK using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (data not shown). We studied E21R-induced apoptosis of AML cells cultured with soluble Fas and soluble TNF receptors (Fig. 8A). These soluble receptors did not affect the decline in AML cell viability upon addition of E21R (1 μg/ml), whereas anti-Fas inhibited Jurkat T cells from dying following activation of the Fas/APO-1 (CD95) system with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, and anti-TNFR inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis of Hep2 cells (Fig. 8B). ICE-like proteases participate in the induction of cell death in response to several different stimuli (22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar, 31Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Apoptosis mediated by several members of the family of ICE-like proteases has been shown to be inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor iodoacetamide and the ICE-inhibitor YVAD-CMK and the viral proteins CrmA and p35 (for review, see Ref. 22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar). We used these inhibitors to test whether E21R induced apoptosis via ICE-like proteases. Indeed, addition of iodoacetamide or YVAD-CMK dose dependently blocked E21R-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 9A) and in AML cells (data not shown). Treatment with YVAD-CMK or iodoacetamide alone had no impact on cell viability (Fig. 9A). Jurkat T cells overexpressing either CrmA or p35 and the wild-type GM-CSF αβc receptor complex were rescued from E21R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 9B). However, overexpression of the oncogene product Bcl-2, an apoptosis-inhibitor (32Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), failed to block E21R-induced apoptosis, although it prevented dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of these cells (Fig. 9C). We show here that apoptosis induced by the GM-CSF analog E21R requires the coexpression of GMR-α and βc on the cells. Data obtained with the truncated GMR-α mutants revealed that a short membrane-proximal region was crucial for E21R to induce apoptosis. This notion was strengthened further with data obtained from chimeric GMR-α receptor constructs containing either full-length or regions of the cytoplasmic IL-2 receptor γ common subunit. Interestingly, the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of GMR-α contains a proline-rich motif termed box 1 which is conserved among the IL-3Rα and IL-5Rα subunits, and the common IL-2 receptor γ subunit (24Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions within this region in the human GMR-α, and in both the human and murine IL-5Rα, abolished proliferation and protein phosphorylation (7Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cornelis S. Fache I. Van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. Tavernier J. Devos R. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Takaki S. Kanazawa H. Shiiba M. Takatsu K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7404-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating its pivotal role in cell growth regulation. Our data pose the intriguing and novel possibility that this region might also be involved in eliciting a death signal under certain conditions. Using a series of truncated βc mutants, we found that a membrane-proximal region spanning approximately 100 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for E21R-induced apoptosis. This particular region has been shown previously to be important for proliferation of BaF3 cells (8Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but it does not include the more distal region involved in promoting cell survival (15Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, E21R-induced apoptosis specifically required this membrane-proximal region of βc since the chimeric receptor containing full-length cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor β subunit, whose amino acid sequence shares no significant homology with βc, failed to signal apoptosis in response to E21R. Stimulation with GM-CSF results in phosphorylation of both βc and the associated JAK2 kinase (8Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 16Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of the more distal residue 750 of βc is important for maintaining viability of BaF3 cells (12Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Durstin M. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8665-8669Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas GM-CSF induced a rapid increase in both total phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of βc, E21R was without any effect. Consistent with this finding is the observation that E21R, in contrast to GM-CSF, did not activate JAK2. Apparently, βc propagates an E21R-initiated death signal at least without requiring βc tyrosine phosphorylation, which is consistent with our previous observation that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did not prevent E21R-induced apoptosis (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An increase in the activity of the MAP kinase JNK concomitant with a decreased ERK activity has been observed in various cells undergoing apoptosis (17Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar). A novel finding in the present study is that E21R-induced apoptosis leads to an increased ratio of JNK to ERK activity because of a decrease in ERK activation. This altered balance in MAP kinase activity might interfere with the activity of transcription factors governing gene expression involved in the control of the cell death effector machinery. ICE-like proteases play a key role in the execution of apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar). YVAD-CMK and the thiol protease inhibitor iodoacetamide both block apoptosis by inhibiting one or more of the ICE family members (22Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar). We found that both of these inhibitors abrogated E21R-induced apoptosis. These findings were confirmed and extended using the viral proteins CrmA and p35. Overexpression of either inhibitor blocked E21R-induced apoptosis. In contrast, Bcl-2, an oncogene product that inhibits the apoptotic pathway probably upstream of cysteine protease-activation (35Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirer G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), had no effect. Among the apoptosis-inducing events most thoroughly studied are the Fas-related apoptosis and cell death caused by a lack of growth factors (26Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 871-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 36Tian Q. Taupin J.L. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the apoptotic pathway triggered by E21R binding to the GM-CSF receptor αβc complex is probably different from Fas involvement. First, we could not detect surface expression of the Fas ligand on primary AML cells (data not shown). Second, a soluble Fas receptor did not prevent E21R-induced apoptosis. Third, E21R did not affect the expression and activation of the serine/threonine kinase FAST and the nuclear RNA-binding protein TIA1 (data not shown) involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat T cells (36Tian Q. Taupin J.L. Elledge S. Robertson M. Anderson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fourth, the cytoplasmic domains of GMR-α and βc do not possess any significant homology to the death domains identified in the Fas/APO1 and TNF receptors (37Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 38Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischjel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). Although Bcl-2 can prevent apoptosis following growth factor deprivation in various cell types (32Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 39Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar), the data presented here indicate that the mechanism of E21R-induced apoptosis is distinct from growth factor deprivation. This is based on the inability of overexpression of Bcl-2 to rescue Jurkat T cells (Fig. 9B) or primary AML cells (data not shown) treated with E21R despite being able to rescue Jurkat T cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (Fig. 9C). In addition, the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine blocked E21R-induced apoptosis of AML cells (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but it failed to suppress death caused by growth factor deprivation (data not shown). Collectively, our data suggest that the death signal initiated with E21R ultimately leads to activation of one or more ICE-like cysteine proteases, and in a Fas/APO-1 (CD95)/Bcl-2-independent manner. We suggest that a tyrosine-dephosphorylated state of βc might be important for E21R-induced apoptosis. Possibly E21R disrupts a preformed, productive GM-CSF receptor (5Iversen P.O. To L.B. Lopez A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and events downstream of the receptor might alter the balance among the activity of the MAP kinases JNK and ERK leading to gene expression involved in triggering apoptosis, such as activators of ICE-like proteases. Future studies are required to define the exact mechanism by which the GM-CSF receptor elicits the death signal within the cell and the identity of any resulting gene products. We thank Dr. A. Strasser for comments on the manuscript. The cDNA for the truncated GMR-α mutants was from A. Kraft. The cDNA for Bcl-2 was from Dr. D. Vaux, CrmA from Dr. D. Pickup, and p35 from Dr. V. Dixit.
