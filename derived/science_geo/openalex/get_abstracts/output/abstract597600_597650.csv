https://openalex.org/W2767083909,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence is increasing and becoming a major public health concern. Whether a Mediterranean diet can help prevent GDM in unselected pregnant women has yet to be studied. Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of GDM with two different dietary models. All consecutive normoglycemic (<92 mg/dL) pregnant women at 8–12 gestational weeks (GW) were assigned to Intervention Group (IG, n = 500): MedDiet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and pistachios; or Control Group (CG, n = 500): standard diet with limited fat intake. Primary outcome was to assess the effect of the intervention on GDM incidence at 24–28 GW. Gestational weight gain (GWG), pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean section (CS), preterm delivery, perineal trauma, small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA) and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit were also assessed. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Results A total of 874 women completed the study (440/434, CG/IG). According to nutritional questionnaires and biomarker analysis, women in the IG had a good adherence to the intervention. 177/874 women were diagnosed with GDM, 103/440 (23.4%) in CG and 74/434(17.1%) in IG, p = 0.012. The crude relative risk (RR) for GDM was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56–0.95; p = 0.020) IG vs CG and persisted after adjusted multivariable analysis, 0.75(95% CI: 0.57–0.98; p = 0.039). IG had also significantly reduced rates of insulin-treated GDM, prematurity, GWG at 24–28 and 36–38 GW, emergency CS, perineal trauma, and SGA and LGA newborns (all p<0.05). Conclusions An early nutritional intervention with a supplemented MedDiet reduces the incidence of GDM and improves several maternal and neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2765971760,"Dinoflagellate species belonging to the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa produce ciguatoxins (CTXs), potent neurotoxins that concentrate in fish causing ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) in humans. While the structures and toxicities of ciguatoxins isolated from fish in the Pacific and Caribbean are known, there are few data on the variation in toxicity between and among species of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa. Quantifying the differences in species-specific toxicity is especially important to developing an effective cell-based risk assessment strategy for CFP. This study analyzed the ciguatoxicity of 33 strains representing seven Gambierdiscus and one Fukuyoa species using a cell based Neuro-2a cytotoxicity assay. All strains were isolated from either the Caribbean or Gulf of Mexico. The average toxicity of each species was inversely proportional to growth rate, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off between an investment in growth versus the production of defensive compounds. While there is 2- to 27-fold variation in toxicity within species, there was a 1740-fold difference between the least and most toxic species. Consequently, production of CTX or CTX-like compounds is more dependent on the species present than on the random occurrence of high or low toxicity strains. Seven of the eight species tested (G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, Gambierdiscus ribotype 2, G. silvae and F. ruetzleri) exhibited low toxicities, ranging from 0 to 24.5 fg CTX3C equivalents cell-1, relative to G. excentricus, which had a toxicity of 469 fg CTX3C eq. cell-1. Isolates of G. excentricus from other regions have shown similarly high toxicities. If the hypothesis that G. excentricus is the primary source of ciguatoxins in the Atlantic is confirmed, it should be possible to identify areas where CFP risk is greatest by monitoring only G. excentricus abundance using species-specific molecular assays."
https://openalex.org/W2765587381,"The inflammatory and metabolic derangements of obesity in pregnant women generate an adverse intrauterine environment, increase pregnancy complications and adverse fetal outcomes and program the fetus for obesity and metabolic syndrome in later life. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications in placenta including altered DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation may mediate these effects. Term placental villous tissue was collected following cesarean section from lean (prepregnancy BMI<25) or obese (BMI>30) women. Genomic DNA was isolated, methylated and hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitated and hybridized to the NimbleGen 2.1M human DNA methylation array. Intermediate metabolites in placental tissues were measured by HPLC-ESI-MS, ascorbate levels by reverse phase HPLC and gene expression by RT-PCR. Differentially methylated and hydroxymethylated regions occurred across the genome, with a 21% increase in methylated but a 31% decrease in hydroxymethylated regions in obese vs lean groups. Whereas increased methylation and decreased methylation was evident around transcription start sites of multiple genes in the GH/CSH and PSG gene clusters on chromosomes 17 and 19 in other areas there was no relationship. Increased methylation was associated with decreased expression only for some genes in these clusters. Biological pathway analysis revealed the 262 genes which showed reciprocal differential methylation/ hydroxymethylation were enriched for pregnancy, immune response and cell adhesion-linked processes. We found a negative relationship for maternal BMI but a positive relationship for ascorbate with α-ketoglutarate a metabolite that regulates ten eleven translocase (TET) which mediates DNA methylation. We provide evidence for the obese maternal metabolic milieu being linked to an altered DNA methylome that may affect placental gene expression in relation to adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2766621091,"Camera trapping has become an increasingly widespread tool for wildlife ecologists, with large numbers of studies relying on photo capture rates or presence/absence information. It is increasingly clear that camera placement can directly impact this kind of data, yet these biases are poorly understood. We used a paired camera design to investigate the effect of small-scale habitat features on species richness estimates, and capture rate and detection probability of several mammal species in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, USA. Cameras were deployed at either log features or on game trails with a paired camera at a nearby random location. Overall capture rates were significantly higher at trail and log cameras compared to their paired random cameras, and some species showed capture rates as much as 9.7 times greater at feature-based cameras. We recorded more species at both log (17) and trail features (15) than at their paired control cameras (13 and 12 species, respectively), yet richness estimates were indistinguishable after 659 and 385 camera nights of survey effort, respectively. We detected significant increases (ranging from 11–33%) in detection probability for five species resulting from the presence of game trails. For six species detection probability was also influenced by the presence of a log feature. This bias was most pronounced for the three rodents investigated, where in all cases detection probability was substantially higher (24.9–38.2%) at log cameras. Our results indicate that small-scale factors, including the presence of game trails and other features, can have significant impacts on species detection when camera traps are employed. Significant biases may result if the presence and quality of these features are not documented and either incorporated into analytical procedures, or controlled for in study design."
https://openalex.org/W2766888300,"The interplay between hemodynamic-based markers of cortical activity (e.g. fMRI and optical intrinsic signal imaging), which are an indirect and relatively slow report of neural activity, and underlying synaptic electrical and metabolic activity through neurovascular coupling is a topic of ongoing research and debate. As application of resting state functional connectivity measures is extended further into topics such as brain development, aging and disease, the importance of understanding the fundamental physiological basis for functional connectivity will grow. Here we extend functional connectivity analysis from hemodynamic- to calcium-based imaging. Transgenic mice (n = 7) expressing a fluorescent calcium indicator (GCaMP6) driven by the Thy1 promoter in glutamatergic neurons were imaged transcranially in both anesthetized (using ketamine/xylazine) and awake states. Sequential LED illumination (λ = 454, 523, 595, 640nm) enabled concurrent imaging of both GCaMP6 fluorescence emission (corrected for hemoglobin absorption) and hemodynamics. Functional connectivity network maps were constructed for infraslow (0.009–0.08Hz), intermediate (0.08–0.4Hz), and high (0.4–4.0Hz) frequency bands. At infraslow and intermediate frequencies, commonly used in BOLD fMRI and fcOIS studies of functional connectivity and implicated in neurovascular coupling mechanisms, GCaMP6 and HbO2 functional connectivity structures were in high agreement, both qualitatively and also quantitatively through a measure of spatial similarity. The spontaneous dynamics of both contrasts had the highest correlation when the GCaMP6 signal was delayed with a ~0.6–1.5s temporal offset. Within the higher-frequency delta band, sensitive to slow wave sleep oscillations in non-REM sleep and anesthesia, we evaluate the speed with which the connectivity analysis stabilized and found that the functional connectivity maps captured putative network structure within time window lengths as short as 30 seconds. Homotopic GCaMP6 functional connectivity maps at 0.4–4.0Hz in the anesthetized states show a striking correlated and anti-correlated structure along the anterior to posterior axis. This structure is potentially explained in part by observed propagation of delta-band activity from frontal somatomotor regions to visuoparietal areas. During awake imaging, this spatio-temporal quality is altered, and a more complex and detailed functional connectivity structure is observed. The combined calcium/hemoglobin imaging technique described here will enable the dissociation of changes in ionic and hemodynamic functional structure and neurovascular coupling and provide a framework for subsequent studies of neurological disease such as stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2765724284,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and fatal disease. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) alters function and fate of various proteins via deacetylation of lysine residues, and is implicated in TGF-β1-induced EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition). However, the role of HDAC6 in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown.HDAC6 expression in IPF and control lungs was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblots. Lung fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β1 ± HDAC6 inhibitors (Tubacin, Tubastatin, ACY1215, or MC1568), and fibrotic markers such as type I collagen were assessed using qRT-PCR and immunoblots. Mice were treated with bleomycin (oropharyngeal aspiration; single dose) ± Tubastatin (intraperitoneally injection; daily for 21 days), and lung collagen expression was gauged using immunoblots and trichrome staining. In a separate experiment, HDAC6 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice were administered bleomycin, and lungs were evaluated in the same manner.HDAC6 expression was deregulated in IPF lungs. Among the HDAC6 inhibitors tested, only Tubastatin significantly repressed TGF-β1-induced expression of type-1 collagen in lung fibroblasts, and this finding was coupled with decreased Akt phosphorylation and increased Akt-PHLPP (PH domain and Leucine rich repeat Protein Phosphatase) association. Tubastatin repressed TGF-β1-induced S6K phosphorylation, HIF-1α expression, and VEGF expression. Tubastatin also repressed TGF-β1-induced inhibition of LC3B-II (a marker of autophagosome formation). In bleomycin-treated mouse lungs, HDAC6 expression was increased, and Tubastatin repressed type-1 collagen expression. However, in HDAC6 KO mice, bleomycin-induced type-1 collagen expression was not repressed compared to WT mice. Knockdown of HDAC6, as well as HDAC10, another potential Tubastatin target, did not inhibit TGF-β1-induced collagen expression in lung fibroblasts.HDAC6 expression is altered during lung fibrogenesis. Tubastatin represses TGF-β1-induced collagen expression, by diminishing Akt phosphorylation and regulating downstream targets such as HIF-1α-VEGF axis and autophagy. Tubastatin-treated WT mice are protected against bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but HDAC6 KO mice are not. Our data suggest that Tubastatin ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis, by targeting the TGFβ-PI3K-Akt pathway, likely via an HDAC6-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2766660803,"Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a broadly used tool in different fields of plant ecology. Despite the importance of edaphic conditions in determining the niche of terrestrial plant species, edaphic data have rarely been included in ENMs of plant species perhaps because such data are not available for many regions. Recently, edaphic data has been made available at a global scale allowing its potential inclusion and evaluation on ENM performance for plant species. Here, we take advantage of such data and address the following main questions: What is the influence of distinct predictor variables (e.g. climatic vs edaphic) on different ENM algorithms? and what is the relationship between the performance of different predictors and geographic characteristics of species? We used 125 plant species distributed over the Neotropical region to explore the effect on ENMs of using edaphic data available from the SoilGrids database and its combination with climatic data from the CHELSA database. In addition, we related these different predictor variables to geographic characteristics of the target species and different ENM algorithms. The use of different predictors (climatic, edaphic, and both) significantly affected model performance and spatial complexity of the predictions. We showed that the use of global edaphic plus climatic variables generates ENMs with similar or better accuracy compared to those constructed only with climate variables. Moreover, the performance of models considering these different predictors, separately or jointly, was related to geographic properties of species records, such as number and distribution range. The large geographic extent, the variability of environments and the different species' geographical characteristics considered here allowed us to demonstrate that global edaphic data adds useful information for plant ENMs. This is particularly valuable for studies of species that are distributed in regions where more detailed information on soil properties is poor or does not even exist."
https://openalex.org/W2767050747,"During influenza A virus (IAV) infection, cytokine storms play a vital and critical role in clinical outcomes. We have previously reported that microRNA (miR)-302c regulates IAV-induced IFN expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)–inducing kinase. In the current study, we found that miR-302a, another member of the miR-302 cluster, controls the IAV-induced cytokine storm. According to results from cell-based and knockout mouse models, IAV induces a cytokine storm via interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF-5). We also found that IAV infection up-regulates IRF-5 expression and that IRF-5 in turn promotes IAV replication. Furthermore, we observed that IRF-5 is a direct target of miR-302a, which down-regulated IRF-5 expression by binding its 3′-UTR. Moreover, IAV increased IRF-5 expression by down-regulating miR-302a expression. Interestingly, miR-302a inhibited IAV replication. In IAV-infected patients, miR-302a expression was down-regulated, whereas IRF-5 expression was up-regulated. Taken together, our work uncovers and defines a signaling pathway implicated in an IAV-induced cytokine storm.

https://openalex.org/W2765996079,"One of the major players in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is disrupted homeostasis of glutamatergic neurotransmission, resulting in elevated extracellular glutamate (Glu) concentrations and excitotoxicity-related cell death. In the brain, Glu concentrations are regulated by Glu transporters, including Glu transporter-1 (GLT-1) and cystine/Glu antiporter (system xc-). Modulation of these transporters by administration of ceftriaxone (CEF, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 150 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 days before focal cerebral ischemia may induce brain tolerance to ischemia by significantly limiting stroke-related damage and normalizing Glu concentrations. In the present study, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 90-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We compared the effects of CEF and NAC pretreatment on Glu concentrations in extracellular fluid and cellular-specific expression of GLT-1 and xCT with the effects of two reference preconditioning methods, namely, ischemic preconditioning and chemical preconditioning in rats. Both CEF and NAC significantly reduced Glu levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus during focal cerebral ischemia, and this decrease was comparable with the Glu level achieved with the reference preconditioning strategies. The results of immunofluorescence staining of GLT-1 and xCT on astrocytes, neurons and microglia accounted for the observed changes in extracellular Glu levels to a certain extent. Briefly, after MCAO, the expression of GLT-1 on astrocytes decreased, but pretreatment with CEF seemed to prevent this downregulation. In addition, every intervention used in this study seemed to reduce xCT expression on astrocytes and neurons. The results of this study indicate that modulation of Glu transporter expression may restore Glu homeostasis. Moreover, our results suggest that CEF and NAC may induce brain tolerance to ischemia by influencing GLT-1 and system xc- expression levels. These transporters are presumably good targets for the development of novel therapies for brain ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2766995515,"In photosynthetic water oxidation, two water molecules are converted into one oxygen molecule and four protons at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II (PSII) via the S-state cycle. Efficient proton exit from the catalytic site to the lumen is essential for this process. However, the exit pathways of individual protons through the PSII proteins remain to be identified. In this study, we examined the involvement of a hydrogen-bond network near the redox-active tyrosine YZ in proton transfer during the S-state cycle. We focused on spectroscopic analyses of a site-directed variant of D1-Asn-298, a residue involved in a hydrogen-bond network near YZ. We found that the D1-N298A mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exhibits an O2 evolution activity of ∼10% of the wild-type. D1-N298A and the wild-type D1 had very similar features of thermoluminescence glow curves and of an FTIR difference spectrum upon YZ oxidation, suggesting that the hydrogen-bonded structure of YZ and electron transfer from the Mn4CaO5 cluster to YZ were little affected by substitution. In the D1-N298A mutant, however, the flash-number dependence of delayed luminescence showed a monotonic increase without oscillation, and FTIR difference spectra of the S-state cycle indicated partial and significant inhibition of the S2 → S3 and S3 → S0 transitions, respectively. These results suggest that the D1-N298A substitution inhibits the proton transfer processes in the S2 → S3 and S3 → S0 transitions. This in turn indicates that the hydrogen-bond network near YZ can be functional as a proton transfer pathway during photosynthetic water oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2765299678,"Iron (Fe) deficiency is one of many conditions that can seriously damage crops. Low levels of photosynthesis can lead to the degradation of chlorophyll content and impaired respiration in affected plants, which together cause poor growth and reduce quality. Although ethylene plays an important role in responses to Fe deficiency, a limited number of studies have been carried out on ethylene response factor (ERFs) as components of plant regulation mechanisms. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of AtERF4 in plant responses to Fe deficiency. Results collected when Arabidopsis thaliana was grown under Fe deficient conditions as well as in the presence of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) revealed that leaf chlorosis did not occur over short timescales and that chloroplast structural integrity was retained. At the same time, expression of the chlorophyll degradation-related genes AtPAO and AtCLH1 was inhibited and net H+ root flux was amplified. Our results show that chlorophyll content was enhanced in the mutant erf4, while expression of the chlorophyll degradation gene AtCLH1 was reduced. Ferric reductase activity in roots was also significantly higher in the mutant than in wild type plants, while erf4 caused high levels of expression of the genes AtIRT1 and AtHA2 under Fe deficient conditions. We also utilized yeast one-hybrid technology in this study to determine that AtERF4 binds directly to the AtCLH1 and AtITR1 promoter. Observations show that transient over-expression of AtERF4 resulted in rapid chlorophyll degradation in the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum and the up-regulation of gene AtCLH1 expression. In summary, AtERF4 plays an important role as a negative regulator of Fe deficiency responses, we hypothesize that AtERF4 may exert a balancing effect on plants subject to nutrition stress."

XJ-445 and Desmodesmus bijugatus XJ-231 were investigated in this study. The results showed that throughout the growth phases, the lipid content of microalgae increased. The surface properties like particle size, the degree of hydrophobicity, and the total concentration of functional groups increased while net surface zeta potential decreased. The results suggested that the growth stage had significant influence not only on the lipid content but also on the surface characteristics. Moreover, the lipid content was significantly positively related to the concentration of hydroxyl functional groups in spite of algal strains or growth phases. These results provided a basis for further studies on the refinery process using oleaginous microalgae for biofuel production."
https://openalex.org/W2767186288,"Objective The United States is amidst an opioid epidemic, including synthetic opioids that may result in rapid death, leaving minimal opportunity for bystander rescue. We pilot tested a behavioral intervention to reduce the occurrence of opioid overdose among opioid dependent persons at high-risk for subsequent overdose. Materials and methods We conducted a single-blinded randomized-controlled trial of a repeated dose motivational interviewing intervention (REBOOT) to reduce overdose versus treatment as usual, defined as information and referrals, over 16 months at the San Francisco Department of Public Health from 2014–2016. Participants were 18–65 years of age, had opioid use disorder by Structured Clinical Interview, active opioid use, opioid overdose within 5 years, and prior receipt of naloxone kits. The intervention was administered at months 0, 4, 8, and 12, preceded by the assessment which was also administered at month 16. Dual primary outcomes were any overdose event and number of events, collected by computer-assisted personal interview, as well as any fatal overdose events per vital records. Results A total of 78 persons were screened and 63 enrolled. Mean age was 43 years, 67% were born male, 65% White, 17% African-American, and 14% Latino. Ninety-two percent of visits and 93% of counseling sessions were completed. At baseline, 33.3% of participants had experienced an overdose in the past four months, with a similar mean number of overdoses in both arms (p = 0.95); 29% overdosed during follow-up. By intention-to-treat, participants assigned to REBOOT were less likely to experience any overdose (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.62 [95%CI 0.41–0.92, p = 0.019) and experienced fewer overdose events (IRR 0.46, 95%CI 0.24–0.90, p = 0.023), findings that were robust to sensitivity analyses. There were no differences between arms in days of opioid use, substance use treatment, or naloxone carriage. Conclusions REBOOT reduced the occurrence of any opioid overdose and the number of overdoses. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT02093559"
https://openalex.org/W2765304780,"Activation of the RAS/ERK and its downstream signaling components is essential for growth factor–induced cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (Ptpn11), is a positive mediator required for most, if not all, receptor tyrosine kinase–evoked RAS/ERK activation, but differentially regulates the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade in various cellular contexts. The precise mechanisms underlying the differential effects of SHP2 deficiency on the PI3K pathway remain unclear. We found that mice with myelomonocytic cell-specific [Tg(LysM-Cre);Ptpn11fl/fl mice] Ptpn11 deficiency exhibit mild osteopetrosis. SHP2-deficient bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) showed decreased proliferation in response to M-CSF and decreased osteoclast generation. M-CSF–evoked ERK1/2 activation was decreased, whereas AKT activation was enhanced in SHP2-deficient BMMs. ERK1/2, via its downstream target RSK2, mediates this negative feedback by negatively regulating phosphorylation of M-CSF receptor at Tyr721 and, consequently, its binding to p85 subunit of PI3K and PI3K activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of RSK or ERK phenotypically mimics the signaling defects observed in SHP2-deficient BMMs. Furthermore, this increase in PI3K/AKT activation enables BMM survival in the setting of SHP2 deficiency.—Wang, L., Iorio, C., Yan, K., Yang, H., Takeshita, S., Kang, S., Neel, B.G., Yang, W.

https://openalex.org/W2765656082,"Objectives To investigate the obstetric and psychological characteristics of women who opt to use epidural analgesia (EDA) during labour and the impact of participating in labour preparation courses on women’s decisions to use EDA. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Population 2596 women with singleton pregnancies and intended vaginal delivery. Methods Data were collected using two self-completed questionnaires at pregnancy weeks 17 and 32. Fear of childbirth was assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ). Symptoms of anxiety were measured by the Hopkins Symptom Check List (SCL-25) and depression by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Obstetric and socio-demographic information was retrieved from birth records at the maternity ward. Main outcome measure Preference for EDA was indicated by the questionnaire item “I would prefer an epidural regardless” on a 4-point scale (1 = highly agree, 4 = highly disagree) at pregnancy week 32. Results Twenty-one percent of the women (540/2596) answered that they would choose EDA as the only alternative method of analgesia during labour. Counselling for fear of childbirth [OR 3.23 (95%CI 2.12; 4.92)] and W-DEQ sum score ≥ 85 [OR 2.95 (95%CI 2.06; 4.23)] were significantly (p<0.001) associated with choice of EDA. Participation in labour preparation courses was significantly (p = 0.008) associated with a reduction of intended use of EDA during labour [OR 0.67 (95%CI 0.49; 0.90)]. Conclusion Fear of childbirth is significantly associated with women’s choice of EDA during labour. On the other hand, women that participate in labour preparation courses would rather consider other methods of analgesia during labour."
https://openalex.org/W2766057597,"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) impacts millions of individuals worldwide and more than 100,000 people in the United States. Leg ulcers are the most common cutaneous manifestation of SCD. The health status of individuals living with chronic leg ulcers is not only influenced by clinical manifestations such as pain duration and intensity, but also by psychosocial factors. Garnering insights into the psychosocial impact can provide a more holistic view of their influence on quality of life. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants living with active SCD-associated leg ulcers or with a history of ulcers. Subjects were recruited from an ongoing study (INSIGHTS, Clin Trial.Gov NCT02156102) and consented to this qualitative phase of the study. Five areas were explored: leg ulcer pain, physical function, social-isolation, social relationships and religious support. Data was collected from 20 individuals during these interviews and a thematic analysis was performed and reported. Results Twenty participants with a mean age of 42.4 (SD ± 11.1years) were included in the study. Major themes identified included:1) pain (acute and chronic); 2) compromised physical function as demonstrated by decreased ability to walk, run, and play sports; 3) social isolation from activities either by others or self-induced as a means of avoiding certain emotions, such as embarrassment; 4) social relationships (family support and social network); 5) support and comfort through their religion or spirituality. Conclusions SCD patients with leg ulcers expressed that they experience social isolation, intense and frequent ulcer pain, and difficulty in physical function. SCD-associated leg ulcers have been studied from a clinical approach, but the psychosocial factors investigated in this study informs how quality of life is impacted by the leg ulcers."

DNA/RNA viruses often hijack the cellular factors resident in PML-NBs to promote their proliferation in host cells. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), belonging to Hepadnaviridae family, remains undetected in early infection as it does not induce the innate immune response and is known to be the cause of several hepatic diseases leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The association of PML-NB proteins and HBV is being addressed in a number of recent studies. Here, we report that the PML-NB protein Speckled 110 kDa (Sp110) is SUMO1-modified and undergoes a deSUMOylation-driven release from the PML-NB in the presence of HBV. Intriguingly, Sp110 knockdown significantly reduced viral DNA load in the culture supernatant by activation of the type I interferon-response pathway. Furthermore, we found that Sp110 differentially regulates several direct target genes of hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx), a viral co-factor. Subsequently, we identified Sp110 as a novel interactor of HBx and found this association to be essential for the exit of Sp110 from the PML-NB during HBV infection and HBx recruitment on the promoter of these genes. HBx, in turn, modulates the recruitment of its associated transcription cofactors p300/HDAC1 to these co-regulated genes, thereby altering the host gene expression program in favor of viral persistence. Thus, we report a mechanism by which HBV can evade host immune response by hijacking the PML-NB protein Sp110, and therefore, we propose it to be a novel target for antiviral therapy.

The HBV genome has four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for different proteins as follows: the polymerase; the core antigen (HBcAg); the surface antigen (HBsAg); and the X protein (HBx) (2Gearhart T.L.

Among these, HBx is a multifunctional viral cofactor that has a significant role in viral pathogenesis and carcinogenesis (3Hu L. Chen L. Li L. Sun H. Yang G. Chang Y. Tu Q. Wu M. Wang H.

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies are nuclear sub-structures, which are constituted of ∼80 proteins including PML, Speckled 100-kDa protein (Sp100), transcription factor p53, the histone acetylase and co-activator CBP, the tumor suppressor Rb, the Bloom syndrome helicase BLM, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), etc. As these proteins play a significant role in many crucial cellular pathways, PML-NBs are often targeted by the viral proteins (5Möller A. Schmitz M.L. Viruses as hijackers of PML nuclear bodies.Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. 2003; 51: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar). The Speckled family of transcription factors (Sp100, Sp140, and Sp110) is an important class of PML-body residents, which have several isoforms and are critically involved in gene regulation and anti-viral response (8Bloch D.B.

Sp110b, the truncated isoform (amino acid sequence 1–549, which is up to the SAND domain), is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and represses retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) activity in the nucleus (9Nicewonger J.

A study showed that Sp110b interacts with hepatitis C virus core protein and gets relocalized from the nucleus to the cytosol (mainly near the endoplasmic reticulum membranes). This sequestration of Sp110b from the nucleus by the core activates retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription, thereby causing sensitization to all-trans-retinoic acid-mediated cell death (10Watashi K. Hijikata M. Tagawa A. Doi T. Marusawa H. Shimotohno K.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7498-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another group showed that Sp110b plays an important role in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene expression and virion production by interacting with the EBV nuclear protein SM and promoting gene transcription and enhancing mRNA stability. Depletion in the Sp110b level diminishes the ability of SM to enhance EBV lytic mRNA expression (9Nicewonger J. Suck G. Bloch D. Swaminathan S.

A recent bioinformatics study proposed that RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1) and ATF7IP (activating transcription factor 7 interacting protein), which are reported to be involved in transcriptional regulation and function as a chromatin remodelers in association with viral proteins like hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and Epstein-Barr virus BRLF1/Rta protein, are two potential interactors of Sp110 (17Cai L.

In this study, we show that Sp110 remains in SUMO-1-modified form and undergoes a deSUMOylation-driven exit from the nuclear bodies in the presence of HBV or more specifically the HBV-encoded co-factor HBx. Sp110 was found to deregulate the expression of a large number of host genes, and interestingly, a significant number of them were direct targets of HBx, which were mostly implicated in the transcription, replication, repair, and immune-response pathways. Furthermore, we identified Sp110 as a novel interactor of the viral co-factor HBx, which hijacks the host protein and exploits its chromatin-binding property to get recruited to the co-regulated genes. HBx, in turn, modulates the recruitment of its associated transcription co-factors p300/HDAC1 to those genes, thereby altering the host gene expression program in favor of viral persistence. Altogether, our study shows that the host protein Sp110 is one of the prime factors that is exploited by HBV and is crucial for the pathogenesis as its knockdown led to a dramatic viral elimination and therefore is a potential therapeutic target. Nuclear body protein Sp110 is implicated in transcription regulation and several human diseases. We observed an augmentation of Sp110 expression with ELISA in the serum of chronically infected HBV patient samples when compared with the normal uninfected samples (n = 15) (Fig. 1A). This result was consistent with immunohistochemistry staining of normal, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic hepatitis B-infected (CHB) liver tissues (n = 10) with the anti-Sp110 antibody (Fig. 1B), where the positively stained area in CHB is ∼6-fold higher than normal tissues. To understand the role of Sp110 during HBV infection, we have used the following two models: 1.3-mer HBV plasmid (subgenotype D3) transfection in HepG2 cells where the HBV genome is present extra-chromosomally; and HepG2.2.15, a stable HBV (subgenotype D3)-producing cell line that is used in several premier studies (19Sells M.A. Zelent A.Z.

Inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication by quercetin in human hepatoma cell lines.Virol. Sin. 2015; 30: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The efficacy of the 1.3-mer HBV plasmid transfection was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C) as per standard protocol (22Cai D. Nie H. Yan R. Guo J.-T. Block T.M. Guo H. A Southern blot assay for detection of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA from cell cultures.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1030: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as nested PCR (amplifying the surface antigen region of the HBV genome) with the DNA extracted from the culture supernatant (supplemental Fig. S1). We found that Sp110 mRNA and protein expression increased upon 1.3-mer HBV transfection (Fig. 1, D and E), similar to the data from the patient samples. HepG2.2.15 also showed a significant increase in the expression of Sp110 when compared with its parental cell line HepG2 (Fig. 1, G and H). Thus, Sp110 has an increased expression independent of whether the HBV genome is present extra-chromosomally or in integrated form. In HepG2 cells, Sp110 was found to reside inside the PML-nuclear bodies and co-localized with Sp100 and PML, markers of the nuclear bodies (Fig. 2A). When Sp100 (which is essential for PML-NB formation) is silenced, Sp110 was observed to have lost its usual punctate distribution and was distributed throughout the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, in HepG2.2.15 cells, Sp110 was found to have a distribution similar to supplemental Fig. S2, although the distribution of Sp100 was unaltered (Fig. 2B, panel I). Staining with PML further confirmed the integrity of the nuclear body HepG2.2.15 (Fig. 2B, panel II). Therefore, unlike many other virus infections, HBV infection did not cause PML-NB disruption (as also shown in a recent study (23Niu C. Livingston C.M. Li L. Beran R.K. Daffis S. Ramakrishnan D. Burdette D. Peiser L. Salas E. Ramos H. Yu M. Cheng G. Strubin M. Delaney IV, W.E. Fletcher S.P. The Smc5/6 complex restricts HBV when localized to ND10 without inducing an innate immune response and is counteracted by the HBV X protein shortly after infection.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12: e0169648Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)); however, Sp110 was found to be released from the PML body. Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) plays a critical role in PML-NB formation, and SUMOylation is known to target many proteins to different nuclear sub-compartments. Many PML body proteins, including other Sp100 family proteins Sp100, Sp140, have been reported to get SUMO1-conjugated (8Bloch D.B. Nakajima A. Gulick T. Chiche J.D. Orth D. de La Monte S.M. Bloch K.D. Sp110 localizes to the PML-Sp100 nuclear body and may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional coactivator.Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because, the SUMOylation site of Sp100 and Sp140 lies in their N-terminal region, which has almost 49% homology to that of Sp110 (Fig. 2C) (8Bloch D.B. Nakajima A. Gulick T. Chiche J.D. Orth D. de La Monte S.M. Bloch K.D. Sp110 localizes to the PML-Sp100 nuclear body and may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional coactivator.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6138-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we speculated that Sp110 could get SUMOylated. We performed co-immunoprecipitation, and it was found that Sp110 gets extensively SUMOylated in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2D, panel I), but there is no association between SUMO1 and Sp110 in HepG2.2.15 cells (Fig. 2D, panel II). Similar observations were seen by confocal imaging of Sp110 and SUMO1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Fig. 2E), where there is a noteworthy decrease of SUMO1 levels in the latter. Furthermore, we transfected broad-range SUMO-specific proteases for SUMO1/2/3, SENP1, and SENP2 in HepG2 cells, as the other SENP family proteins have a higher preference for SUMO2/3 (25Kumar A. Zhang K.Y. Advances in the development of SUMO specific protease (SENP) inhibitors.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J. 2015; 13: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the deSUMOylases resulted in diffused distribution of Sp110 along with a reduction in PML body staining of SUMO1, as compared with untransfected cells, which have higher SUMOylation levels (Fig. 2F). However, the integrity of the PML body was not lost because no significant alteration of PML body puncta was observed on SENP1 or SENP2 overexpression (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, it can be concluded that in HepG2 cells, Sp110 is present in PML bodies in a SUMOylated form. HBV leads to deSUMOylation of Sp110 and its consequent exit from the PML body. The increased expression of Sp110 and its differential distribution upon HBV infection indicated that it might be playing some crucial function. To understand whether Sp110 has a direct role to play in the infection, we silenced Sp110 in HepG2.2.15 cells and scored the viral DNA load. Sp100, another PML-NB body, has been used as a control. The efficacy of Sp110 and Sp100 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). We observed that Sp110 silencing led to a dramatic reduction of viral DNA load although no significant change was observed upon Sp100 knockdown (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S4A). A diminution of the viral DNA was also detected by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3C) as well as nested PCR from the culture supernatant (supplemental Fig. S1). The decrease was also evident in viral protein HBsAg levels (supplemental Fig. S4B). Previous studies have shown that HBV inhibits apoptosis to release infectious progeny, and HBV proteins play a major role in it by blocking the caspase-independent apoptosis pathway (26Liu H. Yuan Y. Guo H. Mitchelson K. Zhang K. Xie L. Qin W. Lu Y. Wang J. Guo Y. Zhou Y. He F. Hepatitis B virus encoded X protein suppresses apoptosis by inhibition of the caspase-independent pathway.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Arzberger S. Hösel M. Protzer U. Apoptosis of hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes prevents release of infectious virus.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 11994-12001Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because viral elimination was observed upon Sp110 knockdown, we were interested in looking into its effect on the apoptosis repression. The flow cytometric data upon Sp110 silencing showed a substantial increase in the sub G0 cell population (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S5) indicating cell death. Observations with the APOSTRANDTM kit, which detects the apoptotic DNA levels, in a sample confirmed that Sp110 knockdown indeed makes the cell more apoptosis-prone (Fig. 3E), suggesting an anti-apoptotic role of Sp110 during HBV infection. This corroborates a decrease in cell viability (Fig. 3F) and mRNA expression of proliferation marker genes (Ki-67, MCM2, PCNA, and BCL2) (Fig. 3G). Microarray analysis was done for Sp110 silenced compared with negative control silenced Hep2.2.15 cells to understand its role in HBV infection. The heat map with an absolute fold-change cutoff of 1.5 is shown in Fig. 4A. About 890 genes belonging to different cellular processes were found to be differentially regulated (absolute fold-change ≥ 1.5 and p ≤ 0.05) (supplemental Table S3), which were grouped through the Significant Biology Network (Fig. 4B). By further analyzing the total differentially expressed gene set at a higher stringency (absolute fold-change ≥ 2.0; p ≤ 0.05; minimum required interaction score 0.7, high confidence) by STRING database (28Szklarczyk D. Franceschini A. Wyder S. Forslund K. Heller D. Huerta-Cepas J. Simonovic M. Roth A. Santos A. Tsafou K.P. Kuhn M. Bork P. Jensen L.J. von Mering C. STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D447-D452Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar), we obtained a network hub consisting of IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9), signal transducers, and transactivator 1 (STAT1), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS3, IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT3, interferon-α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27), IFI6, myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), etc., which are classical components of the type I interferon-response pathway (Fig. 4C and supplemental Table S4). The up-regulation of all these genes upon Sp110 silencing was validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4D). On a closer look, these genes were found to be either a component of or the target of transcription factor ISGF3 (a hetero-trimeric complex of STAT1, IRF9, and STAT2, which plays a crucial role in the IFN-I-response pathway). The increased expression of the ISGF3 factors was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4E), which probably explains the up-regulation of its downstream targets. Previous studies reported that trichostatin A (TSA) inhibits the type I interferon pathway by blocking the formation of the ISGF3 factor thus affecting the activation of the downstream interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) (29Génin P. Morin P. Civas A. Impairment of interferon-induced IRF-7 gene expression due to inhibition of ISGF3 formation by trichostatin A.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7113-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Chang H.-M. Paulson M. Holko M. Rice C.M. Williams B.R. Marié I. Levy D.E.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We found that concomitant TSA treatment along with Sp110 knockdown in HepG2.2.15 cells did not show the viral abolition by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4F) and Southern blotting (Fig. 4G), thereby confirming that the type I interferon-response pathway activation plays a crucial role in observed viral elimination. Because TSA blocks the ISGF3 formation and the network hub obtained consisted of ISGF3 components and its downstream targets, we were interested in looking into their regulation by Sp110. In this context, we were interested to identify the role of full-length Sp110c isoform, for which the subsequent experiments were performed by overexpressing FLAG-Sp110c. The chromatin association of FLAG-Sp110c was confirmed by chromatin fractionation assay (supplemental Fig. S6). We observed that the mRNA level of the genes showed a significant decrease upon Sp110c overexpression (Fig. 4H), and ChIP assays confirmed that there is a direct recruitment of Sp110c to the promoters of IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2 (Fig. 4I) in HepG2.2.15 cells. Furthermore, luciferase assay with 1.3 kb from the STAT1 promoter region cloned in the pGL3-basic vector showed significant repression on the presence of Sp110 (Fig. 4J). Thus, our results show that host factor Sp110 regulates the type I interferon-response pathway, which has direct implication in viral elimination. HBx is a crucial factor that is responsible for viral pathogenesis (31Kew M.C. Hepatitis B virus x protein in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 26: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is known to utilize the host cellular machinery for reprogramming the host gene expression network, leading to tumorigenicity (32Cromlish J.A. Hepatitis B virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma: possible roles for HBx.Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 270-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Comparison of Sp110 silenced microarray data (supplemental Table S3) with the integrated ChIP-chip, and microarray data of HBx (33Sung W.K. Lu Y. Lee C.W. Zhang D. Ronaghi M. Lee C.G. Deregulated direct targets of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein, HBx, identified through chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression microarray profiling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21941-21954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) revealed that a significant number of genes, which are direct targets of HBx, were differentially regulated by Sp110 (supplemental Table S5). Most of these genes were found belonging to the following pathways: immune response, signaling, metabolism, transcription, replication, and DNA repair (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S6). The network of the mentioned pathways has been shown in Fig. 5B. Apart from these, many microRNA targets were obtained from the comparative analysis (data not shown). Few candidate genes of the selected pathways were subsequently validated (Fig. 5C). Because Sp110 silencing differentially regulated a substantial number of target genes of HBx but did not significantly alter the expression of the latter (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S7A), we hypothesized that it is probably the HBx recruitment to these genes that is being affected by Sp110. We indeed found a noteworthy decrease in HBx recruitment in candidate genes MYCN, TAF5, PERP, and BCL2L12 upon Sp110 silencing (Fig. 5E), whereas ACTB, used as a negative control, did not show any change in the recruitment on Sp110 knockdown. Previous reports have shown that HBx associates with transcriptional co-activator (p300)/co-repressor (HDAC1) and alters the epigenetic landscape near its target genes thereby affecting the host gene expression (34Cougot D.

https://openalex.org/W2765632217,"Enveloped viruses transfer their genomes into host cells by fusing their membrane to that of the cell. To visualize single-virus fusion in living cells, researchers take advantage of the proteolytic maturation of HIV, type 1 (HIV-1), which can generate free fluorescent proteins within the viral particle. Co-labeling viruses with a content marker and a fluorescently tagged Vpr (a viral core protein) enables detection of single-virus fusions, but a major limitation of this approach is that not all viral particles incorporate both markers. Here we designed a labeling strategy based on the bifunctional mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr construct, in which 2xCL denotes a tandem cleavage site for the viral protease. This bifunctional marker was efficiently cleaved during virus maturation, producing free mCherry and the core-associated YFP-Vpr. A nearly perfect colocalization of these two markers in virions and their fixed 1:1 ratio enabled automated detection of single-particle fusion in both fixed and live cells based on loss of the mCherry signal. Furthermore, a drop in FRET efficiency between YFP and mCherry because of cleavage of the bifunctional marker, which manifested as a marked shift in the normalized YFP/mCherry fluorescence ratio, reliably predicted viral protease activity in single virions. This feature could discriminate between the particles containing free mCherry, and therefore likely representing mature viruses, and immature particles whose fusion cannot be detected. In summary, our new labeling strategy offers several advantages compared with previous approaches, including increased reliability and throughput of detection of viral fusion. We anticipate that our method will have significant utility for studying viral fusion and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2766342075,"Male sex hormones—androgens—regulate male physique development. Without androgen signaling, genetic males appear female. During puberty, increasing androgens harness the hair follicle's unique regenerative ability to replace many tiny vellus hairs with larger, darker terminal hairs (e.g., beard). Follicle response is epigenetically varied: some remain unaffected (e.g., eyelashes) or are inhibited, causing balding. How sex steroid hormones alter such developmental processes is unclear, despite high incidences of hormone-driven cancer, hirsutism, and alopecia. Unfortunately, existing development models are not androgen sensitive. Here, we use hair follicles to establish an androgen-responsive human organ culture model. We show that women's intermediate facial follicles respond to men's higher androgen levels by synthesizing more hair over several days, unlike donor-matched, androgen-insensitive, terminal follicles. We demonstrate that androgen receptors—androgen-activated gene transcription regulators—are required and are present in vivo within these follicles. This is the first human organ that involves multiple cell types that responds appropriately to hormones in prolonged culture, in a way which mirrors its natural behavior. Thus, intermediate hair follicles offer a hormone-switchable human model with exceptional, unique availability of genetically identical, but epigenetically hormone-insensitive, terminal follicles. This should enable advances in understanding sex steroid hormone signaling, gene regulation, and developmental and regenerative systems and facilitate better therapies for hormone-dependent disorders.—Miranda, B.

https://openalex.org/W2762297863,"DNA barcoding is a fast and reliable tool to assess and monitor biodiversity and, via community phylogenetics, to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes that may be responsible for the community structure of forests. In this study, DNA barcodes for the two widely used plastid coding regions rbcL and matK are used to contribute to identification of morphologically undetermined individuals, as well as to investigate phylogenetic structure of tree communities in 70 subplots (10 × 10m) of a 25-ha forest-dynamics plot in Brunei (Borneo, Southeast Asia). The combined matrix (rbcL + matK) comprised 555 haplotypes (from ≥154 genera, 68 families and 25 orders sensu APG, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016), making a substantial contribution to tree barcode sequences from Southeast Asia. Barcode sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using maximum likelihood, both with and without constraining the topology of taxonomic orders to match that proposed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. A third phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the program Phylomatic to investigate the influence of phylogenetic resolution on results. Detection of non-random patterns of community assembly was determined by net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI). In most cases, community assembly was either random or phylogenetically clustered, which likely indicates the importance to community structure of habitat filtering based on phylogenetically correlated traits in determining community structure. Different phylogenetic trees gave similar overall results, but the Phylomatic tree produced greater variation across plots for NRI and NTI values, presumably due to noise introduced by using an unresolved phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that using a DNA barcode tree has benefits over the traditionally used Phylomatic approach by increasing precision and accuracy and allowing the incorporation of taxonomically unidentified individuals into analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2765688714,"Odour-baited technologies are increasingly considered for effective monitoring of mosquito populations and for the evaluation of vector control interventions. The BG-Malaria trap (BGM), which is an upside-down variant of the widely used BG-Sentinel trap (BGS), has been demonstrated to be effective to sample the Brazilian malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi. We evaluated the BGM as an improved method for sampling the African malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis. Experiments were conducted inside a large semi-field cage to compare trapping efficiencies of BGM and BGS traps, both baited with the synthetic attractant, Ifakara blend, supplemented with CO2. We then compared BGMs baited with either of four synthetic mosquito lures, Ifakara blend, Mbita blend, BG-lure or CO2, and an unbaited BGM. Lastly, we compared BGMs baited with the Ifakara blend dispensed via either nylon strips, BG cartridges (attractant-infused microcapsules encased in cylindrical plastic cartridge) or BG sachets (attractant-infused microcapsules encased in plastic sachets). All tests were conducted between 6P.M. and 7A.M., with 200-600 laboratory-reared An. arabiensis released nightly in the test chamber. The median number of An. arabiensis caught by the BGM per night was 83, IQR:(73.5-97.75), demonstrating clear superiority over BGS (median catch = 32.5 (25.25-37.5)). Compared to unbaited controls, BGMs baited with Mbita blend caught most mosquitoes (45 (29.5-70.25)), followed by BGMs baited with CO2 (42.5 (27.5-64)), Ifakara blend (31 (9.25-41.25)) and BG lure (16 (4-22)). BGM caught 51 (29.5-72.25) mosquitoes/night, when the attractants were dispensed using BG-Cartridges, compared to BG-Sachet (29.5 (24.75-40.5)), and nylon strips (27 (19.25-38.25)), in all cases being significantly superior to unbaited controls (p < 000.1). The findings demonstrate potential of the BGM as a sampling tool for African malaria vectors over the standard BGS trap. Its efficacy can be optimized by selecting appropriate odour baits and odour-dispensing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2765485309,"The zooarchaeological research presented here investigates Neolithic and Chalcolithic (ca. 6500-5000 cal. BC) animal exploitation strategies at Uğurlu Höyük on the Turkish island of Gökçeada in the northeastern Aegean Sea. Toward this end, we first discuss the results of our analysis of the zooarchaeological assemblages from Uğurlu Höyük and then consider the data within a wider regional explanatory framework using a diachronic approach, comparing them with those from western and northwestern Anatolian sites. The first settlers of Gökçeada were farmers who introduced domestic sheep, goats, cattle and pigs to the island as early as 6500 years BC. Our results align well with recently published zooarchaeological data on the westward spread of domestic animals across Turkey and the Neolithization of southeast Europe. Using an island site as a case study, we independently confirm that the dispersal of early farming was a polynucleated and multidirectional phenomenon that did not sweep across the land, replace everything on its way, and deliver the same ""Neolithic package"" everywhere. Instead, this complex process generated a diversity of human-animal interactions. Thus, studying the dispersal of early farmers from southwest Asia into southeast Europe via Anatolia requires a rigorous methodological approach to develop a fine-resolution picture of the variability seen in human adaptations and dispersals within complex and rapidly changing environmental and cultural settings. For this, the whole spectrum of human-animal interactions must be fully documented for each sub-region of southwest Asia and the circum-Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2766288854,"Brain ischemia causes oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in neurons, triggering a cascade of events leading to synaptic accumulation of glutamate. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors causes excitotoxicity and delayed cell death in vulnerable neurons. Following global cerebral ischemia, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are more vulnerable to injury than their cortical counterparts, but the mechanisms that underlie this difference are unclear. Signaling via Rho-family small GTPases, their upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) is differentially dysregulated in response to OGD/ischemia in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Increased Rac1 activity caused by OGD/ischemia contributes to neuronal death in hippocampal neurons via diverse effects on NADPH oxidase activity and dendritic spine morphology. The Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 mediates an OGD-induced increase in Rac1 activity in hippocampal neurons; however, the identity of an antagonistic GAP remains elusive. Here we show that the Rac1 GAP breakpoint cluster region (BCR) associates with NMDA receptors (NMDARs) along with Tiam1 and that this protein complex is more abundant in hippocampal compared with cortical neurons. Although total BCR is similar in the two neuronal types, BCR is more active in hippocampal compared with cortical neurons. OGD causes an NMDAR- and Ca2+-permeable AMPAR-dependent deactivation of BCR in hippocampal but not cortical neurons. BCR knockdown occludes OGD-induced Rac1 activation in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, disrupting the Tiam1-NMDAR interaction with a fragment of Tiam1 blocks OGD-induced Tiam1 activation but has no effect on the deactivation of BCR. This work identifies BCR as a critical player in Rac1 regulation during OGD in hippocampal neurons."

However, the obtained behavioral parameters lack published reference values.To determine mean values for different motor behavioral parameters describing the strategy adopted by healthy people in performing repeated sequences of finger opposition movements, examining associations with gender and age.Normative values for finger motor performance parameters were obtained on a sample of 255 healthy volunteers executing sequences of finger-to-thumb opposition movements, stratified by gender and over a wide range of ages. Touch duration, inter-tapping interval, movement rate, correct sequences (%), movements in advance compared with a metronome (%) and inter-hand interval were assessed.Increasing age resulted in decreased movement speed, advance movements with respect to a cue, correctness of sequences, and bimanual coordination. No significant performance differences were found between male and female subjects except for the duration of the finger touch, the interval between two successive touches and their ratio.We report age- and gender-specific normal mean values and ranges for different parameters objectively describing the performance of finger opposition movement sequences, which may serve as useful references for clinicians to identify possible deficits in subjects affected by diseases altering fine hand motor skills."

https://openalex.org/W2766997579,"Thiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain. In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity. These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes. Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses. Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) under physiological oxygen levels. However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1α in neurological injury is currently unknown. Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1α expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes. We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1α target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD. We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1α target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD. These results demonstrate that induction of HIF-1α mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2767054391,"Consistent across time and cultures, men and male adolescents older than 14 years of age appear underrepresented in mood disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek psychological help. The much higher rate of suicide amongst males suggests that depression in men might be underreported. One of the core human motives is to seek acceptance by others and avoid rejection. Rejection Sensitivity (RS) has been conceptualized as the cognitive-affective processing disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely respond to cues of rejection in the behavior of others. RS has been previously linked with the onset and course of depression, but-as yet-has not been investigated longitudinally in a clinical population. We investigated the predictive role of RS to symptom deterioration 6 months after end-of- treatment in 72 male inpatients with depressive spectrum disorder. The BDI was administered at intake, end-of-treatment and 6 month follow-up. RS scores were obtained at intake. Rejection Sensitivity had additional predictive power on BDI scores at 6 months follow-up controlling for BDI scores at end-of-treatment (ΔR2 = .095). The results are discussed in terms of the importance of targeting RS during treatment, and highlight the fact that therapeutic follow-up care is paramount. Future research should investigate possible mediators of the RS-relapse-to-depression association, such as self-blame, rumination, neuroticism, pessimism, emotion dysregulation, and low self-esteem."
https://openalex.org/W2765508483,"X-ray microbeam radiotherapy can potentially widen the therapeutic window due to a geometrical redistribution of the dose. However, high requirements on photon flux, beam collimation, and system stability restrict its application mainly to large-scale, cost-intensive synchrotron facilities. With a unique laser-based Compact Light Source using inverse Compton scattering, we investigated the translation of this promising radiotherapy technique to a machine of future clinical relevance. We performed in vitro colony-forming assays and chromosome aberration tests in normal tissue cells after microbeam irradiation compared to homogeneous irradiation at the same mean dose using 25 keV X-rays. The microplanar pattern was achieved with a tungsten slit array of 50 μm slit size and a spacing of 350 μm. Applying microbeams significantly increased cell survival for a mean dose above 2 Gy, which indicates fewer normal tissue complications. The observation of significantly less chromosome aberrations suggests a lower risk of second cancer development. Our findings provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of microbeam radiotherapy and prove its applicability at a compact synchrotron, which contributes to its future clinical translation."

Genetic interaction databases, including Reactome and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, offer pathway and experiment data analysis using data curated from these publications and data repositories. We have created a method to generate and analyze consensus networks, inferring potential gene interactions, using large numbers of Bayesian networks generated by data mining publications in the PubMed database. Through the concept of network resolution, these consensus networks can be tailored to represent possible genetic interactions. We designed a set of experiments to confirm that our method is stable across variation in both sample and topological input sizes. Using gene product interactions from the KEGG pathway database and data mining PubMed publication abstracts, we verify that regardless of the network resolution or the inferred consensus network, our method is capable of inferring meaningful gene interactions through consensus Bayesian network generation with multiple, randomized topological orderings. Our method can not only confirm the existence of currently accepted interactions, but has the potential to hypothesize new ones as well. We show our method confirms the existence of known gene interactions such as JAK-STAT-PI3K-AKT-mTOR, infers novel gene interactions such as RAS- Bcl-2 and RAS-AKT, and found significant pathway-pathway interactions between the JAK-STAT signaling and Cardiac Muscle Contraction KEGG pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2766187115,"For clinicians, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nightmare pathogen that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections. Therapy of P. aeruginosa infections is complicated due to its natural high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. Active efflux and decreased uptake of drugs due to cell wall/membrane permeability appear to be important issues in the acquired antibiotic tolerance mechanisms. Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis enzymes have been shown to be essential for pathogenicity of Gram-negative bacteria. However, the role of these targets in virulence has not been identified in P. aeruginosa. Here, we report knockout (k.o) mutants of six cell wall biosynthesis targets (murA, PA4450; murD, PA4414; murF, PA4416; ppiB, PA1793; rmlA, PA5163; waaA, PA4988) in P. aeruginosa PAO1, and characterized these in order to find out whether these genes and their products contribute to pathogenicity and virulence of P. aeruginosa. Except waaA k.o, deletion of cell wall biosynthesis targets significantly reduced growth rate in minimal medium compared to the parent strain. The k.o mutants showed exciting changes in cell morphology and colonial architectures. Remarkably, ΔmurF cells became grossly enlarged. Moreover, the mutants were also attenuated in vivo in a mouse infection model except ΔmurF and ΔwaaA and proved to be more sensitive to macrophage-mediated killing than the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the deletion of the murA gene resulted in loss of virulence activity in mice, and the virulence was restored in a plant model by unknown mechanism. This study demonstrates that cell wall targets contribute significantly to intracellular survival, in vivo growth, and pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, these findings establish a link between cell wall targets and virulence of P. aeruginosa and thus may lead to development of novel drugs for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection."

It is unclear whether or how these structurally diverse proteins or pathways mediate any of the medical benefits of manassantin in vivo. Moreover, it has recently been reported that manassantin causes developmental arrest in zebrafish by inhibiting the mitochondrial complex I, but it is unknown whether manassantin inhibits mitochondrial respiration in intact mammalian cells and live animals. Here, we present direct evidence that manassantin potently and specifically inhibits the mitochondrial complex I and bioenergetic activity in mammalian systems. Manassantin had no effect on complex II– or complex IV–mediated respiration. Of note, it decreased NADH–ubiquinone reductase activity but not the activity of NADH–ferricyanide reductase. Treatment with manassantin reduced cellular ATP levels and concomitantly stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase in vitro and in vivo. As an adaptive response to manassantin-induced bioenergetic deficiency, mammalian cells up-regulated aerobic glycolysis, a process mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) independently of HIF-1α.

Although biochemical analysis with isolated bovine mitochondria suggested that manassantin inhibited complex I (21Lai K. Selinger D.W. Solomon J.M. Wu H. Schmitt E. Serluca F.C. Curtis D. Benson J.D.

Biol. 2013; 8: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this sole publication falls short of proving that manassantin indeed inhibits complex I in mammalian cells and in live animals. Furthermore, the biological consequences of this new activity of manassantin in mammalian cells or tissues remain uncharacterized. Because dysfunction of the mitochondrial complex I is implicated in multiple medical conditions (22Fassone E. Rahman S. Complex I deficiency: clinical features, biochemistry and molecular genetics.J. Med. Genet. 2012; 49: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), discovery of novel and non-toxic inhibitors of complex I to manipulate its activity remains to be of significant interest to scientists in the field (23Degli Esposti M. Inhibitors of NADH-ubiquinone reductase: an overview.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 24Murai M. Miyoshi H. Current topics on inhibitors of respiratory complex I.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1857: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that manassantin potently and specifically inhibited the mitochondrial complex I–mediated respiration with no effect on complex II or complex IV activity in mammalian cells. Treatment with nanomolar concentrations of manassantin B (MNS-B) (and similarly with manassantin A (MNS-A)) caused dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in cultured cells. Consistent with being a potent and specific inhibitor of complex I, MNS-B decreased cellular ATP and stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-dependent up-regulation of glycolysis. These profound effects suggest that manassantin is a prominent modulator of oxygen, energy, and glucose metabolism in mammals. We examined whether manassantin acts as an effective inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration in intact mammalian cells. Because MNS-B and MNS-A are structurally similar and MNS-B was 3 times more abundant than MNS-A in Saururus chinensis extracts, we focused on MNS-B for this and the following experiments. HepG2, a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, and H9C2, a normal rat cardiomyocyte line, were incubated with increasing concentrations of MNS-B (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nm). Both cell lines are known to display active mitochondrial respiration and have been commonly used for studies of mitochondrial ETC complex functions (25Ball A.L. Kamalian L. Alfirevic A. Lyon J.J.

As shown in Fig. 1, MNS-B dose-dependently inhibited OCR (pmol/min/well) in these cells as determined using the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. In HepG2, marked inhibitions of basal mitochondrial respiration (basal OCR), ATP-linked OCR, maximal respiratory capacity, and reserve capacity were observed at 12.5 nm MNS-B. These were completely blocked by 100 nm MNS-B. If basal OCR was considered, the ID50 value (the MNS-B dose required to achieve 50% reduction in basal OCR) in HepG2 cells was slightly higher than 12.5 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). MNS-B also attenuated OCR in a dose-dependent manner in H9C2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). However, it was less potent in H9C2 cells. The ID50 value for MNS-B to inhibit basal OCR was between 25 and 50 nm in H9C2 cells. Complete inhibition of basal OCR, ATP-linked OCR, maximal respiratory capacity, and reserve capacity required more than 100 nm MNS-B in H9C2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether MNS-A is also a bioactive inhibitor of OCR, we compared the activities of MNS-A and MNS-B (25 nm) in multiple cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1, the two forms of manassantin elicited similar effects on basal OCR and other related parameters in these cells. We also compared MNS-B with two well known and potent complex I inhibitors, rotenone and piericidin A. In HepG2 cells, the inhibitory effects of MNS-B on OCR were slightly stronger than or similar to those of rotenone and piericidin A as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. To explore the mechanism for manassantin-mediated inhibition of OCR, mitochondria were freshly isolated from mouse livers and resuspended in respiration buffer containing substrates for complex I (glutamate/malate), complex II (succinate + rotenone), or complex IV (N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)/ascorbate + rotenone) (29Strub G.M.

As shown in Table 1, MNS-B at both 5 and 25 nm significantly inhibited complex I–mediated respiration as indicated by dose-dependent decreases in state 3 respiration without effect on state 4 rate, indicating that manassantin directly interacts with the mitochondrial complex I to exert its effect without involvement of cell surface or cytosolic mediators.Table 1Effects of MNS-B on mitochondrial respiration and complex I enzyme activitiesParametersMNS-B0 nm5 nm25 nmComplex I (glutamate and malate) State 3131 ± 797 ± 4**62 ± 27* State 418 ± 319 ± 316 ± 4Complex II (succinate) State 3324 ± 33307 ± 21324 ± 36 State 469 ± 675 ± 978 ± 5Complex IV (TMPD and ascorbate) State 3 maximum (azide-sensitive)743 ± 62781 ± 7727 ± 54Complex I enzyme activity NADH–ubiquinone reductase112 ± 789 ± 9*58 ± 17** NADH–ferricyanide reductase1992 ± 802125 ± 1611997 ± 188 Open table in a new tab When the complex II substrate succinate was used, MNS-B did not inhibit either state 3 or state 4 rate. Additionally, MNS-B did not interfere with the TMPD/ascorbate (complex IV)–mediated respiration (Table 1). The specific inhibitory effect of MNS-B on complex I–dependent respiration was further confirmed in digitonin-permeabilized H9C2 cells incubated with complex I or complex II substrates. The cellular oxygen consumption was strongly inhibited by 25 nm MNS-B when complex I substrate but not complex II substrate was used (data not shown). Furthermore, spectrophotometric analysis of complex I enzyme activity revealed that MNS-B inhibited NADH–ubiquinone reductase activity but not NADH–ferricyanide reductase activity (30Sazanov L.A. A giant molecular proton pump: structure and mechanism of respiratory complex I.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Table 1), suggesting that the putative MNS-B target is distal to the flavin protein domain function of complex I. Because ETC complex I constitutes a rate-limiting step of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in mitochondria (30Sazanov L.A. A giant molecular proton pump: structure and mechanism of respiratory complex I.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a functional consequence of manassantin treatment in parallel with suppression of oxygen consumption would be inhibition of ATP production. Indeed, treatment of various cell lines including glycolytic tumor cell lines SKOV3 and MDA-MB-468 with MNS-B caused dramatic reduction in steady-state levels of cellular ATP (Fig. 3A). In contrast to ATP, AMP levels were significantly augmented by MNS-B treatment (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these changes in AMP and ATP levels, MNS-B induced activation of AMPKα as reflected by enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172 in all cell lines we examined (Fig. 4). These results confirmed that manassantin negatively regulates oxygen consumption and energy production in these cells.Figure 4Manassantin causes activation of AMPK. The cell lines were cultured with the indicated concentrations of MNS-B for 12 h (A) or with 25 nm MNS-B for the indicated periods of time (hours) (B) before lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis of MAPKα phosphorylation (p-AMPK) at Thr-172 and HIF-1α. Reprobing with β-actin was included as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data suggest that exposure of mammalian cells to manassantin results in bioenergetic deficiency. This new biological effect probably represents a primary cellular function of manassantin. The next question is how cells react to manassantin-induced down-regulation of bioenergetic activity. We thus examined whether MNS-B treatment triggers glucose utilization through glycolysis as an adaptive response to ATP loss. Although limited in ATP generation through direct substrate phosphorylation, glycolysis provides a significant pool of ATP (glycolytic ATP) in highly proliferating cells or in response to energetic stress (31Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis: meeting the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 441-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Activation of glycolysis could partially offset the ATP loss from MNS-B inhibition of complex I. During glycolysis, one molecule of water is released when 2-phosphoglycerate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate. By labeling cells with [5-3H]glucose, we were able to quantitate the glycolytic rate by measuring generation of [3H]water (32Ma Y. Yu C. Mohamed E.M. Shao H. Wang L. Sundaresan G. Zweit J. Idowu M.

As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, MNS-B treatment strongly enhanced glycolysis in H9C2, HepG2, SKOV3, and MDA-MB-468 cells. Consistent with the increased glycolysis, culture supernatants of these cells treated with MNS-B contained dramatically higher levels of lactate (Fig. 5B). The role of manassantin in activation of the glycolytic pathway has not been described. Several groups have previously reported that manassantin inhibits expression of HIF-1α (11Hodges T.W. Hossain C.F. Kim Y.P. Zhou Y.D. Nagle D.G.

Because HIF-1α is a master regulator of a myriad of glycolytic enzymes (32Ma Y. Yu C. Mohamed E.M. Shao H. Wang L. Sundaresan G. Zweit J. Idowu M. Fang X.

Chem. 2009; 9: 1084-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), one may anticipate that manassantin will down-regulate glycolysis as a result of its inhibition of HIF-1α. To clarify the roles of manassantin in regulation of HIF-1α and in glycolysis, we revisited the effect of MNS-B on HIF-1α. At the same range of concentrations that turned on glycolysis, MNS-B decreased basal HIF-1α expression in most cell lines we examined with an exception of SKOV3 (Fig. 4, A and B). Apparently, MNS-B stimulated glycolysis while diminishing HIF-1α in most cells, suggesting that an HIF-1α–independent mechanism is involved in the glycolytic activation in MNS-B–treated cells. We then examined the effect of the specific AMPK inhibitor Compound C (35Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T.

Materials and methods In this cross-sectional study of 105 stroke survivors, the Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcome (SIPSO) was used to measure the level of community integration. Lower-limb strength measures included isometric paretic ankle strength and isokinetic paretic knee peak torque. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were used to evaluate balance performance and walking endurance, respectively. Results SEM revealed that the distance walked on the 6MWT had the strongest direct association with the SIPSO score (β = 0.41, p <0.001). An increase of one standard deviation in the 6MWT distance resulted in an increase of 0.41 standard deviations in the SIPSO score. Moreover, dorsiflexion strength (β = 0.18, p = 0.044) and the BBS score (β = 0.21, p = 0.021) had direct associations with the SIPSO score. Conclusions The results of the proposed model suggest that rehabilitation training of community-dwelling stroke survivors could focus on walking endurance, balance performance and dorsiflexor muscle strengthening if the aim is to augment the level of community integration."

The method can also be used for the automatic detection of schizophrenia; it exhibits higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art methods with no false positives. The detection is based on an analysis from a minute long pattern-recognition computer task. Moreover, this connectivity analysis leads naturally to an optimal choice of electrodes and hence to highly statistically significant results that are based on data from only 3-5 electrodes. The method is general and can be used for the diagnosis of other psychiatric conditions, provided an appropriate computer task is devised."
https://openalex.org/W2765689724,"Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides are produced rapidly at sites of injury, stimulating epithelial migration, a process involving rapid changes in cell shape and volume, requiring rapid flow of water into and out of the cell. We examined the effect of TFFs on fluidity of cells by measuring their sensitivity to osmotic challenges and cell migration, and determined whether those results were mediated through altering the levels of aquaporins (AQPs), a family of transmembrane water channels involved in cellular water homeostasis. Gastric (AGS) and colonic (Caco-2) cell lines had intrinsic TFF levels determined and the predominant TFF peptide knocked down (RNA interference). Knockdown caused lessened responsiveness to changes in external osmotic challenge (by 51 and 69% in AGS and Caco-2 cells, respectively) and reduced cell migration and transepithelial permeability but did not influence proliferation. Exogenous TFF increased several AQPs, particularly AQP3, and those were reciprocally reduced in knockdown cells. TFF-induced, but not fetal calf serum–induced, cell migration was inhibited by the presence of AQP3 blocker (CuSO4). We summarize that TFF peptides promptly produced at sites of injury increase AQP levels, most notably AQP3, thereby enhancing the cells’ ability to rapidly change their shape as part of the restitutive process. TFF peptides also require functioning AQP3 channels to induce cell migration.—Marchbank, T., Playford, R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2921418609,"Aims Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an established method to stabilize acute circulatory failure. Parameters and data on when to ideally wean circulatory support are limited. Bilirubin is a marker of end-organ damage. Therefore, the purpose of this large study was to evaluate the impact of dynamic changes of elevated bilirubin levels on survival in patients on ECLS. Methods and results We reviewed 502 consecutive cases of ECLS from 2007 to 2015. Bilirubin levels were recorded before implantation and until six days after explantation. Dynamic bilirubin changes, and hemodynamic and laboratory outcome parameters were compared in survivors and nonsurvivors. Reason for ECLS implantation was cardiac arrest with ongoing resuscitation in 230 (45.8%), low cardiac output in 174 (34.7%) and inability to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass in 98 (19.5%) patients. 307 (61.2%) patients were weaned off ECLS, however, 206 (41.0%) survived. Mean duration of ECLS was 3 (2–6) days, and survivors received significantly longer ECLS (5 vs 3 days, p < 0.001). Survivors had significantly lower baseline bilirubin levels (p = 0.003). Bilirubin started to rise from day 2 in all patients. In survivors, bilirubin levels had trended down on the day of ECLS explantation and stayed at an acceptable level. However, in weaned patients who did not survive and patients who died on ECLS bilirubin levels continued to rise during the recorded period. Conclusion ECLS support improves survival in patients with acute circulatory failure. Down trending bilirubin levels on veno-arterial ECLS indicate improved chances of successful weaning and survival in hemodynamically stable patients."
https://openalex.org/W2766888387,"Background Muscle atrophy has been explained by an anabolic resistance following food intake and an increase of dietary protein intake is recommended. To be optimal, a dietary protein has to be effective not only to initiate but also to prolong a muscle anabolic response in a catabolic state. To our knowledge, whether or not a dairy or a dairy/plant protein blend fulfills these criterions is unknown in a muscle wasting situation. Objective Our aim was, in a control and a catabolic state, to measure continuously muscle anabolism in term of intensity and duration in response to a meal containing casein (CAS), whey (WHEY) or a whey/ plant protein blend (BLEND) and to evaluate the best protein source to elicit the best post prandial anabolism according to the physio-pathological state. Methods Adult male Yucatan mini pigs were infused with U-13C-Phenylalanine and fed either CAS, WHEY or BLEND. A catabolic state was induced by a glucocorticoid treatment for 8 days (DEX). Muscle protein synthesis, proteolysis and balance were measured with the hind limb arterio-venous differences technique. Repeated time variance analysis were used to assess significant differences. Results In a catabolic situation, whey proteins were able to initiate muscle anabolism which remained transient in contrast to the stimulated muscle protein accretion with WHEY, CAS or BLEND in healthy conditions. Despite the same leucine intake compared to WHEY, BLEND did not restore a positive protein balance in DEX animals. Conclusions Even with WHEY, the duration of the anabolic response was not optimal and has to be improved in a catabolic state. The use of BLEND remained of lower efficiency even at same leucine intake than whey."
https://openalex.org/W2765228580,"Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved, multifunctional protein that has been implicated in a range of cell physiologic processes, especially cell growth and development. A TCTP-like gene has been identified in the Toxoplasma genome [Toxoplasma gondii TCTP (TgTCTP)], although its function remains unknown. The sequence analysis of TgTCTP indicated that it is a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes. We found that the expression level of TgTCTP in the virulent RH strain was significantly higher than that in the avirulent PLK strain. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that TgTCTP was expressed in the parasite cytoplasm. The localization of TgTCTP was unchanged during the replication of the parasite. We expressed a functional recombinant TgTCTP (rTgTCTP) protein in Escherichia coli and found that the recombinant protein could form a multimer. We then evaluated the function of TgTCTP using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 knockout (KO) system. Phenotypic analysis of the KO strain (ΔTgTCTP) revealed that TgTCTP is required for the robust growth of the parasites. TgTCTP deficiency also led to early egress of the parasites and subsequent impairment in their invasion and attachment abilities. We subsequently found that the multimer form of TgTCTP might not be necessary for the growth and replication of the parasite. Then the expression profiling of genes in the ΔTgTCTP and complement strains were analyzed. The results revealed that 988 genes were regulated in ΔTgTCTP compared with the complement strain. Overall, although not essential, TgTCTP is required for the fast growth of Tg and maintenance of its intracellular development.—Zheng J., Chen, Y., Li, Z., Cao, S., Zhang Z., Jia, H.

The resonant signals from C-H stretching in forward CARS usually show high background intensity in tissues, which makes CARS imaging of microvessels difficult. In this study, epi-detection of back-scattered SF-CARS signals showed a negligible background, but the overall intensity of resonant CARS signals was too low to observe the network of brain microvessels. Therefore, Evans blue (EB) dye was used as contrasting agent to enhance the back-scattered SF-CARS signals. Breakdown of brain microvessels by inducing hemorrhage in a mouse was clearly visualized using backward SF-CARS signals, following intravenous injection of EB. The improved visualization of brain microvessels with EB enhanced the sensitivity of SF-CARS, detecting not only the blood vessels themselves but their integrity as well in the brain vasculature."

After the commissioning, a secondary neutron ambient dose from proton scanning nozzle (Gantry 1) was simulated and measured. This simulation was performed to evaluate beam properties such as percent depth dose curve, Bragg peak, and distal fall-off, so that they could be verified with measured data. Using the validated beam nozzle, the secondary neutron ambient dose was simulated and then compared with the measured ambient dose from Gantry 1. We calculated secondary neutron dose at several different points. We demonstrated the validity modeling a proton scanning nozzle system to evaluate various parameters using FLUKA. The measured secondary neutron ambient dose showed a similar tendency with the simulation result. This work will increase the knowledge necessary for the development of radiation safety technology in medical particle accelerators."
https://openalex.org/W2766581647,"Prior studies showed that scientists’ professional networks contribute to research productivity, but little work has examined what factors predict the formation of professional networks. This study sought to 1) examine what factors predict the formation of international ties between faculty and graduate students and 2) identify how these international ties would affect publication productivity in three East Asian countries. Face-to-face surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of faculty and doctoral students in life sciences at 10 research institutions in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Our final sample consisted of 290 respondents (84 faculty and 206 doctoral students) and 1,435 network members. We used egocentric social network analysis to examine the structure of international ties and how they relate to research productivity. Our findings suggest that overseas graduate training can be a key factor in graduate students’ development of international ties in these countries. Those with a higher proportion of international ties in their professional networks were likely to have published more papers and written more manuscripts. For faculty, international ties did not affect the number of manuscripts written or of papers published, but did correlate with an increase in publishing in top journals. The networks we examined were identified by asking study participants with whom they discuss their research. Because the relationships may not appear in explicit co-authorship networks, these networks were not officially recorded elsewhere. This study sheds light on the relationships of these invisible support networks to researcher productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2766782180,"RNA binding protein polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (Ptbp2) as a key alternative splicing regulator for male germ cell development is well established. However, its expression levels and role in cryptorchidism testes tissues has not been explored. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of heat stress impacts the correct proliferation and differentiation of germ cells is unclear. To investigate whether changes in Ptbp2 expression are correlated with heat stress-induced germ cell injury in testicular tissue, we used a murine model of intraperitoneal cryptorchidism with surgical operation. Here we present compelling evidence that germ cells are severely damaged in mice with unilateral cryptorchidism, with non-obstructive azoospermia. And the Ptbp2 and Pgk2 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in parallel, leading us to conclude that the negative correlation between Ptbp2 levels and germ cell injury in unilateral cryptorchidism murine model. We hypothesize that Ptbp2 is susceptible to heat stress and its disruption has resulted in stability decline of germ cell transcripts Pgk2 mRNA, which consequently lead to germ cell injury in cryptorchidism testes. Thus, we confirm that Ptbp2 is an essential factor in heat stress-induced sperm cell injury and non-obstructive azoospermia."
https://openalex.org/W2765617596,"Methylation of cytosine at the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring is the most prevalent and significant epigenetic modifications in mammalian DNA. The CpG methylation level shows a bimodal distribution but the bimodality can be overestimated due to the heterogeneity of per-base depth. Here, we developed an algorithm to eliminate the effect of per-base depth inhomogeneity on the bimodality and obtained a random CpG methylation distribution. By quantifying the deviation of the observed methylation distribution and the random one using the information formula, we find that in tetranucleotides 5’-N5CGN3-3’ (N5, N3 = A, C, G or T), GCGN3 and CCGN3 show less apparent deviation than ACGN3 and TCGN3, indicating that GCGN3 and CCGN3 are less variant in their level of methylation. The methylation variation of N5CGN3 are conserved among different cells, tissues and species, implying common features in the mechanisms of methylation and demethylation, presumably mediated by DNMTs and TETs in mammalians, respectively. Sequence dependence of DNA methylation variation also relates to gene regulatory and promotes the reexamination of the role of DNA sequence in fundamental biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2767024193,"Background Climate change affects human health. The respective consequences are predicted to increase in the future. Patients with chronic lung disease are particularly vulnerable to the involved environmental alterations. However, their subjective perception and reactions to these alterations remain unknown. Methods In this pilot study, we surveyed 172 adult patients who underwent pulmonary rehabilitation and 832 adult tourists without lung disease in the alpine region about their perception of being affected by climate change and their potential reaction to specific consequences. The patients’ survey also contained the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) to rate the severity of symptoms. Results Most of the patients stated asthma (73.8%), COPD (9.3%) or both (11.0%) as underlying disease while 5.8% suffered from other chronic lung diseases. Patients and tourists feel equally affected by current climate change in general, while allergic subjects in both groups feel significantly more affected (p = 0.04). The severity of symptoms assessed by CAT correlates with the degree of feeling affected (p<0.01). The main disturbing consequences for patients are decreased air quality, increasing numbers of ticks and mosquitos and a rising risk for allergy and extreme weather events such as thunderstroms, while tourists are less disturbed by these factors. Increasing number of heat-days is of little concern to both groups. Conclusion Overall patients are more sensitive to health-related consequences of climate change. Yet, the hazard of heat-days seems underestimated and awareness should be raised."
https://openalex.org/W2765877302,"The mechanism of action of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) is mainly attributed to the inhibition of the deacetylase catalytic activity for their histone substrates. In this study, we analyzed the abundance of class I HDACs in the cytosolic, nuclear soluble and chromatin bound cellular fractions in breast cancer cells after HDACi treatment. We found that potent N-hydroxy propenamide-based HDACi induced a concentration dependent decrease in the HDAC1 associated with chromatin and a lasting concomitant increase in cytoplasmic HDAC1 while maintaining total protein expression. No such change occurred with HDAC2 or 8, however, an increase in cytoplasmic non-phosphorylated HDAC3 was also observed. The subcellular re-equilibration of HDAC1 was subsequent to the accumulation of acetylated histones and might be cell cycle dependent. This study suggests that the biological activity of a subset of N-hydroxy propenamide-based HDACi may stem from direct competition with histone substrates of HDACs as well as from spatial separation from their substrates in the nucleus and/or change in post-translational modification status of HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W2766107682,"Musculoskeletal allografts are now commonly used. To decrease the potential risks of transmission of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, or viruses to the transplant recipients, certain issues regarding the management of patients who receive contaminated allografts need to be addressed. We aimed to clarify the incidence and extent of disease transmission from allografts by analyzing the allografting procedures performed in the bone bank of our hospital over the past 20 years. We retrospectively reviewed the data from our allograft registry center on 3979 allografts that were implanted in 3193 recipients throughout a period of two decades, from July 1991 to June 2011. The source of the allografts, results of all screening tests, dates of harvesting and implantation, and recipients of all allografts were checked. With the help of the Center for Infection Control of our hospital, a strict prospective, hospital-wide, on-site surveillance was conducted, and every patient with healthcare-associated infection was identified. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the infection rate between recipients with sterile allografts and those with contaminated allografts. The overall discard and infection rates were, respectively, 23% and 1.3% in the first decade (1991–2001); and 18.4% and 1.25% in the second decade (2001–2011). The infection rate of contaminated allograft recipients was significantly higher than that of sterile allograft recipients (10% vs. 1.15%, P < 0.01) in the second decade. Both infection and discard rates of our bone bank are comparable with those of international bone banks. Strict allograft processing and adequate prophylactic use of antibiotics are critical to prevent infection and disease transmission in such cases."
https://openalex.org/W2766370184,"We use a 575,000-subject, 28-day experiment to investigate monetary policy in a virtual setting. The experiment tests the effect of virtual currency endowments on player retention and virtual currency demand. An increase in endowments of a virtual currency should lower the demand for the currency in the short run. However, in the long run, we would expect money demand to rise in response to inflation in the virtual world. We test for this behavior in a virtual field experiment in the football management game Top11. 575,000 players were selected at random and allocated to different ""shards"" or versions of the world. The shards differed only in terms of the initial money endowment offered to new players. Money demand was observed for 28 days as players used real money to purchase additional virtual currency. The results indicate that player money purchases were significantly higher in the shards where higher endowments were given. This suggests that a positive change in the money supply in a virtual context leads to inflation and increased money demand, and does so much more quickly than in real-world economies. Differences between virtual and real currency behavior will become more interesting as virtual currency becomes a bigger part of the real economy."
https://openalex.org/W2766235177,"Cyclic nigerosyl nigerose (CNN) is a cyclic tetrasaccharide that exhibits properties distinct from other conventional cyclodextrins. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of B16 melanoma with CNN results in a dose-dependent decrease in melanin synthesis, even under conditions that stimulate melanin synthesis, without significant cytotoxity. The effects of CNN were prolonged for more than 27 days, and were gradually reversed following removal of CNN. Undigested CNN was found to accumulate within B16 cells at relatively high levels. Further, CNN showed a weak but significant direct inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase, suggesting one possible mechanism of hypopigmentation. While a slight reduction in tyrosinase expression was observed, tyrosinase expression was maintained at significant levels, processed into a mature form, and transported to late-stage melanosomes. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that CNN treatment induced drastic morphological changes of Pmel17-positive and LAMP-1-positive organelles within B16 cells, suggesting that CNN is a potent organelle modulator. Colocalization of both tyrosinase-positive and LAMP-1-positive regions in CNN-treated cells indicated possible degradation of tyrosinase in LAMP-1-positive organelles; however, that possibility was ruled out by subsequent inhibition experiments. Taken together, this study opens a new paradigm of functional oligosaccharides, and offers CNN as a novel hypopigmenting molecule and organelle modulator."
https://openalex.org/W2767044132,"Background and purpose Deficits in the ability to multitask contribute to gait abnormalities and falls in many at-risk populations. However, it is unclear whether older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) also demonstrate impairments in multitasking. The purpose of this study was to compare multitasking performance in cognitively intact older adults with and without DM and explore its relationship to measures of gait and functional ability. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 40 individuals aged 60 and older with type 2 DM and a matched group of 40 cognitively intact older adults without DM. Multitasking was examined via the ambulatory Walking and Remembering Test (WART) and seated Pursuit Rotor Test (PRT). Self-selected normal and fast walking speed and stride length variability were quantitatively measured, and self-reported functional ability was assessed via the Late Life Function and Disability Index (LLFDI). Results Participants with DM walked slower and took more steps off path when multitasking during the WART. No between-group differences in multitasking performance were observed on the PRT. Multitasking performance demonstrated little correlation with gait and functional ability in either group. Discussion and conclusions Older adults with DM appear to perform poorly on an ambulatory measure of multitasking. However, we analyzed a relatively small, homogenous sample of older adults with and without type 2 DM and factors such as peripheral neuropathy and the use of multiple comparisons complicate interpretation of the data. Future research should explore the interactions between multitasking and safety, fall risk, and function in this vulnerable population. Clinicians should recognize that an array of factors may contribute to gait and physical dysfunction in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and be prepared to assess and intervene appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W2767184204,"Postoperative epidural analgesia often needs rate readjustment using top-ups. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is said to reduce the requirement of epidural top-ups when compared to continuous epidural analgesia (CEA). We compared CEA and PCEA in major thoracic and abdominal surgery, in a cohort study. The primary endpoint was the required number of epidural top-ups. Secondary endpoints were pain scores, side effects and workload differences. We analysed 199 patients with CEA and 187 with PCEA. Both groups had similar pain scores. The total number of top-ups was 75 in 57 patients (CEA) versus 20 top-ups in 18 patients (PCEA). (p = 0.0001) Sedation tended to occur more frequently in patients with CEA versus PCEA, 5.5% vs 1.6% (p = 0.05). Implementation of PCEA led to a decreased number of top-ups, fewer side-effects and decreased use of the postoperative care unit."
