https://openalex.org/W2809038464,"Barriers remain in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) cascade of care (CoC), limiting the overall impact of direct acting antivirals. This study examines movement between the stages of the HCV CoC and identifies reasons why patients and specific patient populations fail to advance through care in a real world population. We performed a single-center, ambispective cohort study of patients receiving care in an outpatient infectious diseases clinic between October 2015 and September 2016. Patients were followed from treatment referral through sustained virologic response. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors related to completion of each step of the CoC. Of 187 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 120 (64%) completed an evaluation for HCV treatment, 119 (64%) were prescribed treatment, 114 (61%) were approved for treatment, 113 (60%) initiated treatment, 107 (57%) completed treatment, and 100 (53%) achieved a sustained virologic response. In univariate and multivariate analyses, patients with Medicaid insurance were less likely to complete an evaluation and were less likely to be approved for treatment. Treatment completion and SVR rates are much improved from historical CoC reports. However, linkage to care following referral continues to be a formidable challenge for the HCV CoC in the DAA era. Ongoing efforts should focus on linkage to care to capitalize on DAA treatment advances and improving access for patients with Medicaid insurance."
https://openalex.org/W2809531323,"The nursing shortage and its impact on patient care are well-documented global issues. Patients living with cancer as a chronic illness have many psychosocial problems and often lack adequate support as a result of ineffective nurse-patient communication. A review of the literature on factors influencing the delivery of psychosocial care to cancer patients indicates that the delivery of psychosocial care in routine cancer nursing within a biomedical healthcare system has not been widely explored.To explore patients' perceptions of their experiences with nurse-patient communication in an oncological clinical environment.A focused ethnographic study was undertaken in two oncology wards of a hospital in Hong Kong. Data were collected through observations of the ward environment, the activities and instances of nurse-patient communication, semi-structured interviews with patients, and a review of nursing documents.Two main themes were identified: 1. Nurses' workload and the environment and 2. Nurse-patient partnership and role expectations. Within these two themes were related subthemes on: Sympathy for the busy nurses; Prioritizing calls to the nurses; Partnership through relationship; Nurses' role in psychosocial care; and Reduction of psychosocial concerns through physical care.Many cancer patients do not expect to receive psychosocial care in the form of emotional talks or counseling from busy nurses, but appreciate the attention paid by nurses to their physiological and physical needs. Nurse-patient partnerships in cancer care may reduce the potential workload of nurses. The psychosocial needs of cancer patients could be optimized by providing good physical care through effective communication within a time-constrained oncology setting."
https://openalex.org/W2808880030,"Background The present study aimed to investigate the impact of pre-sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib. Methods We enrolled 214 patients (71 ± 10 years old; 166 men and 48 women; 90% Child–Pugh grade A and 10% Child–Pugh grade B) treated with sorafenib in our hospital from July 2009 to August 2016. The muscle volume was measured from CT images just before sorafenib administration using software (SliceOmatic). Skeletal muscle mass index was calculated, and the presence of pre-sarcopenia was judged according to the standard (42 cm2/m2 for men and 38 cm2/m2 for women) proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Results Pre-sarcopenia was found in 123 patients (57%). The overall survival (OS) in patients with pre-sarcopenia tended to be worse than in patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 252 vs. 284 days, respectively; p = 0.16). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed a baseline serum albumin level of ≤3.5 g/dl [hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; p = 0.0006], a baseline alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) level of ≥100 ng/ml (HR 2.1; p = 0.002), presence of lesions in bilateral hepatic lobes (HR 1.7; p = 0.03), and presence of major portal vein invasion (HR 1.8; p = 0.01) to be independent prognostic factors. In the 68 patients who had three or more negative prognostic factors, the presence of pre-sarcopenia did not correlate with prognosis. Of the 146 patients who had two or less prognostic factors, OS was significantly worse in 84 patients (58%) with pre-sarcopenia than in 62 patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 417 vs. 562 days, respectively; p = 0.047), and Cox hazard analysis revealed pre-sarcopenia to be an important prognostic factor (HR 1.6; p = 0.047). Conclusion In sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC, pre-sarcopenia is a significant prognostic factor in patients with two or less negative prognostic factors, and could be the target of intervention to improve prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2809649990,"Randomized trials in adults have shown reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality on hemodiafiltration (HDF) compared to high-flux hemodialysis (HD), but the mechanisms leading to improved outcomes are not clear. We studied biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, anti-oxidant capacity and endothelial dysfunction in 22 children (13 female, age 8–15 years). All children received HD for at least 3 months, and were then switched to HDF, keeping all dialysis related parameters and dialysis time constant. All the biomarkers of inflammation (s2-microglobulin, IL-6, IL-10, high sensitive C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine, advanced glycation end-products [AGEs], oxidized low density lipoprotein [ox-LDL] and anti-oxidant capacity) and endothelial dysfunction (asymmetric dimethyl arginine [ADMA], symmetric dimethyl arginine [SDMA]), were comparable between incident and prevalent patients on HD, suggesting that even a short dialysis vintage of 3 months on HD increases inflammation and endothelial stress. After 3 months of HDF therapy there was a significant reduction in s2-microglobulin (p<0.001), hCRP, ADMA, SDMA, AGEs, ox-LDL (p<0.01 for all) and an increase in total antioxidant capacity (p<0.001) compared to HD. All children were maintained on the same dialyser, dialysis water quality, dialysis time and blood flow speeds suggesting that improved clearances on HDF led to an improved biomarker profile. Even in children with residual renal function there was a significant reduction in s2 microglobulin, hsCRP, SDMA, ox-LDL and AGEs on HDF compared to HD. Children with a lower blood flow had higher inflammatory status (higher IL-6/IL-10 ratio; p = 0.04, r = -0.43). Children who achieved a higher convective volume (≥median 12.8L/m2) had lower ox-LDL (p = 0.02). In conclusion, we have shown that a significant improvement in inflammation, antioxidant capacity and endothelial risk profile is achieved even within a short time (3 months) on HDF compared to HD treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2808754910,"Global environmental changes are rapidly affecting species’ distributions and habitat suitability worldwide, requiring a continuous update of biodiversity status to support effective decisions on conservation policy and management. In this regard, satellite-derived Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) offer a more integrative and quicker evaluation of ecosystem responses to environmental drivers and changes than climate and structural or compositional landscape attributes. Thus, EFAs may hold advantages as predictors in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and for implementing multi-scale species monitoring programs. Here we describe a modelling framework to assess the predictive ability of EFAs as Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) against traditional datasets (climate, land-cover) at several scales. We test the framework with a multi-scale assessment of habitat suitability for two plant species of conservation concern, both protected under the EU Habitats Directive, differing in terms of life history, range and distribution pattern (Iris boissieri and Taxus baccata). We fitted four sets of SDMs for the two test species, calibrated with: interpolated climate variables; landscape variables; EFAs; and a combination of climate and landscape variables. EFA-based models performed very well at the several scales (AUCmedian from 0.881±0.072 to 0.983±0.125), and similarly to traditional climate-based models, individually or in combination with land-cover predictors (AUCmedian from 0.882±0.059 to 0.995±0.083). Moreover, EFA-based models identified additional suitable areas and provided valuable information on functional features of habitat suitability for both test species (narrowly vs. widely distributed), for both coarse and fine scales. Our results suggest a relatively small scale-dependence of the predictive ability of satellite-derived EFAs, supporting their use as meaningful EBVs in SDMs from regional and broader scales to more local and finer scales. Since the evaluation of species’ conservation status and habitat quality should as far as possible be performed based on scalable indicators linking to meaningful processes, our framework may guide conservation managers in decision-making related to biodiversity monitoring and reporting schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2808824593,"Movement patterns resembling Lévy walks, often attributed to the execution of an advantageous probabilistic searching strategy, are found in a wide variety of organisms, from cells to human hunter-gatherers. It has been suggested that such movement patterns may be fundamental to how humans interact and experience the world and that they may have arisen early in our genus with the evolution of a hunting and gathering lifestyle. Here we show that Lévy walks are evident in the Me'Phaa of Mexico, in Brazilian Cariri farmers and in Amazonian farmers when gathering firewood, wild fruit and nuts. Around 50% of the search patterns resemble Lévy walks and these are characterized by Lévy exponents close to 1.7. The other search patterns more closely resemble bi-phasic walks. We suggest potential generative mechanisms for the occurrence of these ubiquitous Lévy walks which can be used to guide future studies on human mobility. We show that frequent excursions and meanderings from pre-existing trails can account for our observations."
https://openalex.org/W2809295723,"Background About half of births in rural Tanzania are assisted by skilled providers. Point-of-care mobile phone applications hold promise in boosting job support for community health workers aiming to ensure safe motherhood through increased facility delivery awareness, access and uptake. We conducted a controlled comparison to evaluate a smartphone-based application designed to assist community health workers with data collection, education delivery, gestational danger sign identification, and referrals. Methods Community health workers in 32 randomly selected villages were cluster-randomized to training on either smartphone (intervention) or paper-based (control) protocols for use during household visits with pregnant women. The primary outcome measure was postnatal report of delivery location by 572 women randomly selected to participate in a survey conducted by home visit. A mixed-effects model was used to account for clustering of subjects and other measured factors influencing facility delivery. Findings The smartphone intervention was associated with significantly higher facility delivery: 74% of mothers in intervention areas delivered at or in transit to a health facility, versus 63% in control areas. The odds of facility delivery among women counseled by smartphone-assisted health workers were double the odds among women living in control villages (OR, 1.96; CI, 1.21–3.19; adjusted analyses). Women in intervention areas were more likely to receive two or more visits from a community health worker during pregnancy than women in the control group (72% vs. 60%; chi-square = 6.9; p < 0.01). Previous facility delivery, uptake of antenatal care, and distance to the nearest facility were also strong independent predictors of facility delivery. Interpretation Community health worker use of smartphones increased facility delivery, likely through increased frequency of prenatal home visits. Smartphone-based job aids may enhance community health worker support and effectiveness as one component of intervention packages targeting safe motherhood. Trial registration NCT03161184."
https://openalex.org/W2809404150,"Background Despite a more proactive approach to reducing new HIV infections in infants through lifelong treatment (Option B+ policy) for infected pregnant women, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) has not been fully effective in Papua, Indonesia. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the second greatest risk factor for HIV infection in the community, and an elimination target of <1% MTCT has not yet been achieved. The purpose of this study was to improve understanding of the implementation of Option B+ for PMTCT in Papua through investigation of facilitators and barriers to women’s uptake and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the program. This information is vital for improving program outcomes and success of program scale up in similar settings in Papua. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 women and 20 PMTCT health workers at two main referral hospitals for PMTCT in Papua. Development of interview guides was informed by the socio-ecological framework. Qualitative data were managed with NVivo11 software and themes were analysed using template analysis. Factors influencing women’s uptake and adherence in Option B+ for PMTCT were identified through final analysis of key themes. Results Factors that motivated PMTCT uptake and adherence were good quality post-test HIV counselling, belief in the efficacy of antiretroviral (ARV) attained through personal or peer experiences, and a partner who did not prevent women from seeking PMTCT care. Key barriers for PMTCT participation included doubts about ARV efficacy, particularly for asymptomatic women, unsupportive partners who actively prevented women from seeking treatment, and women’s concerns about community stigma and discrimination. Conclusions Results suggest that PMTCT program success is determined by facilitators and barriers from across the spectrum of the socio-ecological model. While roll out of Option B+ as current national policy for pregnant women in Papua has improved detection and enrolment of HIV-positive women, health facilities need to address various existing and potential issues to ensure long-term adherence of women beyond the current PMTCT program, including during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W2809565885,"Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans. However, interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Additionally, OXTR SNPs did not moderate the subjective overall effect of MDMA (any drug effect) or feelings of “closeness to others”.

https://openalex.org/W2809126952,"Malat1 is a long noncoding RNA with a wide array of functions, including roles in regulating cancer cell migration and metastasis. However, the nature of its involvement in control of these oncogenic processes is incompletely understood. In the present study, we investigate the role of Malat1 and the effects of Malat1 KO in a breast cancer cell model. Our selection of Malat1 as the subject of inquiry followed initial screening experiments seeking to identify lncRNAs which are altered in the presence or absence of Nischarin, a gene of interest previously discovered by our lab. Nischarin is a well characterized tumor suppressor protein and actively represses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in breast cancer. Our microarray screen for lncRNAs revealed multiple lncRNAs to be significantly elevated in cells ectopically expressing Nischarin compared to control cancer cells, which have only marginal Nisch expression. Using these cells, we assess how the link between Nischarin and Malat1 affects cancer cell function, finding that Malat1 confers an inhibitory effect on cell growth and migration which is lost following Malat1 KO, but in a Nisch-dependent context. Specifically, Malat1 KO in the background of low Nischarin expression had a limited effect on cell functions, while Malat1 KO in cells with high levels of Nischarin led to significant increases in cell proliferation and migration. In summary, this project provides further clarity concerning the function of Malat1, specifically in breast cancer, while also indicating that the Nischarin expression context is an important factor in the determining how Malat1 activity is governed in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2809208240,"To understand information representation in human brain activity, it is important to investigate its fine spatial patterns at high temporal resolution. One possible approach is to use source estimation of magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. Previous studies have mainly quantified accuracy of this technique according to positional deviations and dispersion of estimated sources, but it remains unclear how accurately MEG source estimation restores information content represented by spatial patterns of brain activity. In this study, using simulated MEG signals representing artificial experimental conditions, we performed MEG source estimation and multivariate pattern analysis to examine whether MEG source estimation can restore information content represented by patterns of cortical current in source brain areas. Classification analysis revealed that the corresponding artificial experimental conditions were predicted accurately from patterns of cortical current estimated in the source brain areas. However, accurate predictions were also possible from brain areas whose original sources were not defined. Searchlight decoding further revealed that this unexpected prediction was possible across wide brain areas beyond the original source locations, indicating that information contained in the original sources can spread through MEG source estimation. This phenomenon of ""information spreading"" may easily lead to false-positive interpretations when MEG source estimation and classification analysis are combined to identify brain areas that represent target information. Real MEG data analyses also showed that presented stimuli were able to be predicted in the higher visual cortex at the same latency as in the primary visual cortex, also suggesting that information spreading took place. These results indicate that careful inspection is necessary to avoid false-positive interpretations when MEG source estimation and multivariate pattern analysis are combined."
https://openalex.org/W2809664810,"The measurements of spinal curvatures using the ultrasound (US) imaging method on children with scoliosis have been comparable with radiography. However, factors influencing the reliability and accuracy of US measurement have not been studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of curve features and patients’ demographics on US measurements and to determine which factors influence the reliability and accuracy. Two hundred children with scoliosis were recruited and scanned with US by one experienced operator and three trainees. One experienced rater measured the proxy Cobb angles from US images twice one week apart and compared the results with clinical radiographic records. The correlation and accuracy between the US and radiographic measurements were subdivided by different curve severities, curve types, subjects’ weight status and US acquisition experiences. A total of 326 and 313 curves were recognized from radiographs and US images, respectively. The mean Cobb angles of the 13 missing curves were 17.4±7.4° and 11 at the thoracic region. Among the 16 curves showing large discrepancy (≥6°) between US and radiographic measurements, 7 were main thoracic and 6 were lumbar curves. Twelve had axial vertebral rotation (AVR) greater than 8°. The US scans performed by the experienced operator showed fewer large discrepancy curves, smaller difference and higher correlation than the scans from the trainees (3%, 1.7±1.5°, 0.95 vs 6%, 2.4±1.8°, 0.90). Only 4% missing and 5% large discrepancy curves were demonstrated for US measurements in comparison to radiography. The missing curves were mainly caused by small severity and in the upper spinal region. There was a higher chance of the large discrepancy curves in the main thoracic and lumbar regions with AVR>8°. A skilled operator acquired better US images and led to more accurate measurements especially for those subjects with larger curvatures, AVR and body mass index (BMI)."
https://openalex.org/W2808941707,"Background Spirituality and religious attendance (RA) have been associated with personal attitudes and values, and this may affect lifestyle. The aim of this study was to explore their association with adolescent leisure-time choices in a highly secular environment. Methods A nationally representative sample of adolescents (n = 4,182, 14.4±1.1 years, 48.6% boys) participated in the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children cross-sectional study. We measured RA, spirituality (adjusted shortened version of the Spiritual Well-Being Scale), excessive television, computer games, and internet use, as well as participation in organized leisure-time activities. Results Compared to non-attending and non-spiritual respondents, respectively, both attending respondents and spiritual respondents were less likely to watch television and play computer games excessively, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.6 (95% confidence interval 0.5–0.8) to 0.92 (0.9–0.99). Only attending and only spiritual respondents were more likely to use the internet excessively, but this was not the case for those that were both attending and spiritual. Moreover, religious and spiritual respondents were more likely to be involved in at least one organised activity. ORs were 2.9 (1.9–4.3) for RA and 1.3 (1.2–1.4) for spirituality compared to their counterparts. The same pattern was observed for sporting and non-sporting activities combined (ORs 4.6 (3.0–7.1) and 1.5 (1.4–1.7), respectively) and regularly reading books or playing a musical instrument. Conclusions Adolescent RA and spirituality are associated with a more active way of spending leisure-time. Further research should focus on understanding potential mechanisms that underlie these associations."
https://openalex.org/W2809125516,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a validated therapeutic target for Type 2 diabetes due to its specific role as a negative regulator of insulin signaling pathways. Discovery of active site directed PTP1B inhibitors is very challenging due to highly conserved nature of the active site and multiple charge requirements of the ligands, which makes them non-selective and non-permeable. Identification of the PTP1B allosteric site has opened up new avenues for discovering potent and selective ligands for therapeutic intervention. Interactions made by potent allosteric inhibitor in the presence of PTP1B were studied using Molecular Dynamics (MD). Computationally optimized models were used to build separate pharmacophore models of PTP1B and TCPTP, respectively. Based on the nature of interactions the target residues offered, a receptor based pharmacophore was developed. The pharmacophore considering conformational flexibility of the residues was used for the development of pharmacophore hypothesis to identify potentially active inhibitors by screening large compound databases. Two pharmacophore were successively used in the virtual screening protocol to identify potential selective and permeable inhibitors of PTP1B. Allosteric inhibition mechanism of these molecules was established using molecular docking and MD methods. The geometrical criteria values confirmed their ability to stabilize PTP1B in an open conformation. 23 molecules that were identified as potential inhibitors were screened for PTP1B inhibitory activity. After screening, 10 molecules which have good permeability values were identified as potential inhibitors of PTP1B. This study confirms that selective and permeable inhibitors can be identified by targeting allosteric site of PTP1B."
https://openalex.org/W2809623886,"Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a neglected parasitic disease that manifests in infected individuals under different phenotypes, with a range of factors contributing to its broad clinical spectrum. One factor, Leishmania RNA Virus 1 (LRV1), has been described as an endosymbiont present in different species of Leishmania. LRV1 significantly worsens the lesion, exacerbating the immune response in both experimentally infected animals and infected individuals. Little is known about the composition and genetic diversity of these viruses. Here, we investigated the relationship between the genetic composition of LRV1 detected in strains of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis and the interaction between the endosymbiont and the parasitic species, analyzing an approximately 850 base pair region of the viral genome. We also included one LRV1 sequence detected in L. (V.) shawi, representing the first report of LRV1 in a species other than L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis. The results illustrate the genetic diversity of the LRV1 strains analyzed here, with smaller divergences detected among viral sequences from the same parasite species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the LRV1 sequences are grouped according to the parasite species and possibly according to the population of the parasite in which the virus was detected, corroborating the hypothesis of joint evolution of the viruses with the speciation of Leishmania parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2808232652,"Research devoted to investigating the relationship between elevation and seed size in alpine plants gives contradictory results. Some studies document a positive correlation between seed size and elevation, whereas in others a negative correlation is reported. We propose a novel approach to the problem by looking at the whole strategy of seed production, including seed number, and by focusing on a range of environmental variables. In the Tatra Mountains (southern Poland), we selected 73 sites at which seeds of six widely occurring mountain herbaceous species were collected. Each site was characterized by 13 parameters that included climatic and physicochemical soil variables. For each parameter, residuals from a linear regression against elevation were calculated and the residuals were used in a factor analysis. The obtained factors, together with elevation, were used as independent variables in a multiple regression analysis. Elevation affected seed size in four species: in two species the correlation was positive, and in two others it was negative. In three species seed number was related to elevation, and the correlation was negative in all cases. Our results indicate that elevation-dependence of seed production is specific to the species and reflects different resource allocation strategies. Diverse correlations of plant characteristics with elevation may also result from area-specific patterns, because different mountain ranges may exhibit different correlations between elevation and environmental factors. Only by attaining a reproductive allocation perspective and thorough assessment of environmental factors, a full understanding of elevational variation in seed size is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2809185944,"Mutations in USH2A cause both isolated Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and Usher syndrome (that implies RP and hearing impairment). One of the most frequent variants identified in this gene and among these patients is the p.(Cys759Phe) change. However, the pathogenic role of this allele has been questioned since it was found in homozygosity in two healthy siblings of a Spanish family. To assess the causative role of USH2A p.(Cys759Phe) in autosomal recessive RP (ARRP) and Usher syndrome type II (USH2) and to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations associated with p.(Cys759Phe), we performed a comprehensive genetic and clinical study in patients suffering from any of the two above-mentioned diseases and carrying at least one p.(Cys759Phe) allele.Diagnosis was set according to previously reported protocols. Genetic analyses were performed by using classical molecular and Next-Generation Sequencing approaches. Probands of 57 unrelated families were molecularly studied and 63 patients belonging to these families were phenotypically evaluated.Molecular analysis characterized 100% of the cases, identifying: 11 homozygous patients for USH2A p.(Cys759Phe), 42 compound heterozygous patients (12 of them with another missense USH2A pathogenic variant and 30 with a truncating USH2A variant), and 4 patients carrying the p.(Cys759Phe) allele and a pathogenic variant in another RP gene (PROM1, CNGB1 or RP1). No additional causative variants were identified in symptomatic homozygous patients. Statistical analysis of clinical differences between zygosity states yielded differences (p≤0.05) in age at diagnosis of RP and hypoacusis, and progression of visual field loss. Homozygosity of p.(Cys759Phe) and compound heterozygosity with another USH2A missense variant is associated with ARRP or ARRP plus late onset hypoacusis (OR = 20.62, CI = 95%, p = 0.041).The present study supports the role of USH2A p.(Cys759Phe) in ARRP and USH2 pathogenesis, and demonstrates the clinical differences between different zygosity states. Phenotype-genotype correlations may guide the genetic characterization based upon specific clinical signs and may advise on the clinical management and prognosis based upon a specific genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2809480276,"High lipid content of oocytes and embryos in domestic animals is one of the well-known factors associated with poor cryosurvival. Herein, we wanted to determine whether the use of delipidated estrous sheep serum during in vitro maturation (IVM) of ovine oocytes reduces the cytoplasmic lipid droplets content and improves embryo development and cryotolerance after vitrification. Cumulus oocytes complexes (COCs) were matured in vitro for 24 h in medium supplemented with whole or delipidated estrous sheep serum prior to vitrification. Neutral lipid present in lipid droplets of COCs, cleavage rate, embryo development rate on Day 6 and Day 8, and hatching rate on Day 8, were compared among experimental groups. Endoplasmic reticulum stress genes were evaluated in in vitro matured COCs under different lipid conditions prior to vitrification. The lipid droplets' content (mean fluorescence intensity) of oocytes cultured with IVM media supplemented with delipidated serum was lower than COCs matured with whole serum (7.6 ± 1.7 vs. 22.8 ± 5.0 arbitrary units, respectively; P< 0.05). Despite IVM treatment, oocytes subjected to vitrification showed impaired competence compared with the non-vitrified groups (P<0.05). No significant differences in embryo production were observed in non-vitrified COCs after maturation in delipidated or whole serum (33.4±4.9 vs 31.9 ±4.2). COCs matured in delipidated serum and subjected to vitrification showed increased expression of ATF4, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP10 genes (ER stress markers). Collectively, our results demonstrate that although supplementation of IVM medium with delipidated estrous sheep serum reduces the presence of cytoplasmic lipid droplets in oocytes after maturation, oocyte cryotolerance is not improved. Notably, the expression of genes associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) was increased in COCs, with fewer lipid droplets subjected to vitrification, suggesting that oocyte cryopreservation is associated with ER stress and activation of adaptive responses."
https://openalex.org/W2809044603,"Consequences of habitat fragmentation for species occurrence are amongst the most important issues in landscape and conservation ecology. Empirical and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the total amount of habitat, patch size and connectivity have nonlinear effects on species survival on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, population models need to incorporate multiple scales, which can be extremely valuable to prioritizing conservation efforts in these changing landscapes. We tested how the amount and configuration of habitat affect understory bird species occurrence using fine to broad-scale habitat features. We used playback to sample birds in 13 Atlantic Forest fragments in Southeast Brazil. Microhabitat, local and regional landscape variables were tested against bird occurrence. Our results demonstrate that different bird species respond to different habitat scales. Sclerurus scansor, Xiphorhynchus fuscus, Automolus leucophthalmus, Drymophila ochropyga, Mackenziaena leachii, and Chiroxiphia caudata were most influenced by tree height and diameter (microhabitat characteristics), S. scansor, F. serrana and Pyriglena leucoptera were most influenced by forest cover and red-edge reflectance(local-scale metrics) and S. scansor, X. fuscus, D. ochropyga, P. leucoptera, F. serrana and M. leachii had area, core area and functional connectivity index (landscape features) as stronger predictors of species occurrence. Small forest fragments acted as corridors and increased overall connectivity of the entire community. The most effective means of maintaining long-term population connectivity of understory birds involves retaining both large and small areas, including forests with different micro-habitat characteristics. No management approach based on a single-scale would benefit all species. Implementing multiscale conservation strategies are necessary for maintaining long-term viability of forest birds on tropical landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2809240906,"Tropical lakes and their associated floodplain habitats are dynamic habitat mosaics strongly influenced by seasonal variations in hydrologic conditions. In flood-pulse systems, water level oscillations directly influence the connectivity to floodplain habitats for fish. Here, we aimed to investigate whether seasonal changes in the water level of a flood-pulse system (the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia) differentially affect diet breadth and dietary overlap of three common and commercially important fish species (Anabas testudineus, Boesemania microplepis and Notopterus notopterus) presenting important differences in their life-cycle (e.g. seasonal migration). For this purpose, the three fish species were sampled at four locations spread over the lake and their stomach contents extracted for analyses. Dietary differences were investigated across seasons regarding the diet composition and diet breadth of each species as well as the amount of dietary overlap between species. We found that the proportion of empty stomachs changed similarly across seasons for the three species, thus suggesting that ecological differences between species are not sufficient to outweigh the effect of seasonal variations in resource abundance. In contrast, changes in diet composition were species-specific and can be explained by ecological and behavioral differences between species. Diet breadth differed between species in all seasons, except during the wet season, and tended to be higher during the dry season when dietary overlap was the lowest. These variations likely result from changes in the diversity and amount of resources and may lead to habitat use shifts with potential implications for competitive interactions. In particular, increasing connectivity to floodplain habitats may reduce the competitive pressure during the wet season, while resource scarcity during the dry season may constrain individuals to diversify their diet to avoid competition. Overall, our results suggest a considerable plasticity in the feeding behavior of the three species as demonstrated by seasonal variation in both diet breadth and dietary overlap. Such variations can be explained by a number of factors and processes, including changes in resource availability or competitive interactions between individuals for resources, whose relative influence might vary depending on the magnitude and the timing of the flood-pulse driving the connectivity to floodplain habitats. Gaining knowledge on the seasonal evolution of fish's diet is relevant for fisheries management and conservation and our result could be used to guide aquaculture development in Cambodia."
https://openalex.org/W2809304868,"Background Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are serious mucocutaneous reactions. In Spain, the epidemiology and resulting expenses of these diseases are not well established. Methodology Retrospective descriptive study using the Minimum Basic Data Set (CMBD in Spanish) in patients admitted to hospitals of the National Health System between 2010 and 2015 with a diagnosis of SJS and TEN (combination of ICD-9 codes 695.13, 695.14, and 695.15, along with length of hospital stay). Principal findings A total of 1,468 patients were recorded, 773 were men (52.7%). The mean age (± SD) was 52.25 ± 26.15 years. The mean incidence rate for all diagnoses was 5.19 cases per million person-years (2.96 in SJS, 0.31 in SJS/TEN and 1.90 in TEN). 148 patients died (10.1%), 47 due to SJS (5.6%) and 90 (16.7%) due to TEN. The estimated total medical cost of SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in Spain was €11.576.456,18, and the average medical cost per patient was €7.885,86 ± €11.686,26, higher medical cost in TEN (€10352.46 ± €16319,93) than in SJS (€6340,05 ± €7078,85) (p<0.001). Conclusions Older patients have a more severe clinical picture and higher mortality rates. The overall mortality of both diseases is approximately 10%, and clinical diagnosis and age were the variables with the greatest influence on mortality. This study describes a stable incidence and a similar prevalence to other European countries. Additionally, the data show a high cost due to hospitalizations. Finally, the CMBD could be a good system of epidemiological analysis for the study of infrequent diseases and hospital management of conditions such as SJS and TEN."
https://openalex.org/W2809477798,"Background While the global market for probiotics is soon to reach in excess of US$50 billion, the continent of Africa has been largely ignored, despite these products having the ability to reduce the burden of disease and death. Trial design The present randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken in Rwanda, a country devoid of well-documented probiotics. The primary outcome aim was to examine receptivity and compliance for orally administered probiotic capsules containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 in pregnant women and assess any initial side effects or changes to the vaginal microbiome. Methods Pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 55 were recruited from the Nyamata District Hospital in Rwanda and randomly assigned to receive probiotic or placebo capsules for one month. Clinicians were blinded to the treatments. Results The drop-out rate was 21%, with 13 of 18 women in the placebo group and 17 of 20 in the probiotic group completing the study. Only 13 women returned for birthing and additional sample collection. No side effects of either treatment group were reported. Microbiota and metabolomics data showed similar findings to those reported in the literature, with low bacterial diversity and Lactobacillus dominance associated with a healthy vagina, and birthing associated with high diversity. Despite the small sample size and lack of changes in the microbiota, women in the placebo arm were significantly more likely to give birth pre-term. Conclusion Overall women were receptive to the probiotic concept, but the lack of information on such products and logistical and economical challenges pose problems for wider population engagement.

https://openalex.org/W2809349857,"An impairment in the visual attention span (VAS) has been suggested to hamper reading performance of individuals with dyslexia. It is not clear, however, if the very nature of the deficit is visual or verbal and, importantly, if it affects spelling skills as well. The current study investigated VAS by means of forced choice tasks with letters and symbols in a sample of third and fourth graders with age-adequate reading and spelling skills (n = 43), a typical dyslexia profile with combined reading and spelling deficits (n = 26) and isolated spelling deficits (n = 32). The task was devised to contain low phonological short-term memory load and to overcome the limitations of oral reports. Notably, eye-movements were monitored to control that children fixated the center of the display when stimuli were presented. Results yielded no main effect of group as well as no group-related interactions, thus showing that children with dyslexia and isolated spelling deficits did not manifest a VAS deficit for letters or symbols once certain methodological aspects were controlled for. The present results could not replicate previous evidence for the involvement of VAS in reading and dyslexia."
https://openalex.org/W2809525820,"The personality trait openness to experience has been implicated in health, and in particular cardiovascular wellbeing. In a sample of 62 healthy young female adults, the role of openness in cardiovascular responsivity during a stress exposure was examined. Traditionally, methodologies have averaged a stress exposure into a single reading. This may be limited in that it does not consider patterns of cardiovascular adaptation within a stress exposure. Continuous cardiovascular data were reduced to mean 10 second readings, with phases determined through examinations of shifts in responsivity between each 10 second pairing. Analyses revealed a significant linear interaction for openness across the entire exposure for systolic blood pressure, and cardiac output. A significant between-subjects effect for heart rate also emerged. Contrary to their lower counterparts, those highest in openness exhibited an increasingly myocardial hemodynamic response profile throughout the exposure. Comparisons of responsivity suggests adaptive stress response trajectories for those highest in openness. This study also provides evidence that an attenuation of myocardial responsivity may underpin blunted responsivity. This study provides a potential mechanism in reported openness-health associations."
https://openalex.org/W2809005882,"Mutant KRAS represents one of the most frequently observed oncogenes in NSCLC, yet no therapies are approved for tumors that express activated KRAS variants. While there is strong rationale for the use of MEK inhibitors to treat tumors with activated RAS/MAPK signaling, these have proven ineffective clinically. We therefore implemented a CRISPR screening approach to identify novel agents to sensitize KRAS mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitor treatment. This approach identified multiple components of the canonical RAS/MAPK pathway consistent with previous studies. In addition, we identified MAPK7 as a novel, strong hit and validated this finding using multiple orthogonal approaches including knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We show that MAPK7 inhibition attenuates the re-activation of MAPK signaling occurring following long-term MEK inhibition, thereby illustrating that MAPK7 mediates pathway reactivation in the face of MEK inhibition. Finally, genetic knockdown of MAPK7 combined with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in a mutant KRAS NSCLC xenograft model to mediate improved tumor growth inhibition. These data highlight that MAPK7 represents a promising target for combination treatment with MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2809052798,"The high diversity of Neotropical fishes has been attributed to major South American palaeogeographic events, such as Andean uplift, rise of the Isthmus of Panama and marine transgressions. However, the unavailability of temporal information about evolution and diversification of some fish groups prevents the establishment of robust hypotheses about correlations between species diversification and proposed palaeogeographical events. One example is the Anablepidae, a family of teleost fishes found mostly in coastal habitats of Central and South America, but also in some inner river basins of South America. Historical aspects of the distribution patterns of the Anablepidae were never analysed and no accurate estimation of time of its origin and diversification is presently available. A multi-gene analysis was performed to estimate Anablepidae phylogenetic position, age and biogeography, comprising seven nuclear genes. The suborder Cyprinodontoidei was recovered in three major clades, one comprising all the Old World Cyprinodontoidei and two comprising New World lineages. Anablepidae was recovered as the sister group of the New World Poeciliidae, with the Amazonian genus Fluviphylax as their sister group. The ages found for the origin and diversification of Cyprinodontiformes were congruent with the pattern recorded for other vertebrate groups, with an origin anterior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) transition and diversification during the Paleogene. The age estimated for the split between the Atlantic and Pacific lineages of Anableps was congruent with the rise of Panamanian Isthmus. The results suggest Miocene marine transgressions as determinant to the current distribution of Jenynsia."
https://openalex.org/W2809070812,"The crystal structures of a biologically and therapeutically active recombinant homotrimeric fragment of native human SP-D (hSP-D) complexed with the inner core oligosaccharide of the Salmonella enterica sv Minnesota rough strains R5 and R7 (rough mutant chemotypes Rc and Rd1) have been determined. The structures reveal that hSP-D specifically and preferentially targets the LPS inner core via the innermost conserved Hep-Kdo pair with the flexibility for alternative recognition when this preferred epitope is not available for binding. Hep-Kdo binding is achieved through calcium dependent recognition of the heptose dihydroxyethyl side chain coupled with specific interactions between the Kdo and the binding site flanking residues Arg343 and Asp325 with evidence for an extended binding site for LPS inner cores containing multiple Kdo residues. In one subunit of the R5-bound structure this preferred mode of binding is precluded by the crystal lattice and oligosaccharide is bound through the terminal inner core glucose. The structures presented here thus provide unique multiple insights into the recognition and binding of bacterial LPS by hSP-D. Not only is it demonstrated that hSP-D targets the highly conserved LPS proximal inner core Hep-Kdo motif, but also that hSP-D can recognise either terminal or non-terminal sugars and has the flexibility and versatility to adopt alternative strategies for bacterial recognition, utilising alternative LPS epitopes when the preferred inner core Hep-Kdo disaccharide is not available for binding."

Many studies have been conducted on the distribution of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. genotypes in sheep and cattle. However, in China, information about molecular characterization and genetic analysis of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in goats is limited. In this study, 342 fecal samples from adult goats were collected from 12 farms in Sichuan Province, China. The occurrence of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in adult goats was 14.9% (51/342) and 4.7% (16/342), respectively. All G. duodenalis were identified as assemblage E, with two novel genotypes (assemblages E17 and E18) being detected at the beta-giardin (bg) locus. Based on three loci-beta-giardin (bg), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh)-multilocus sequence typing revealed three novel multilocus genotypes (MLGs) of assemblage E (MLG-E1, E2, E3 (sc)). Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA-based PCR identified two Cryptosporidium species, namely C. xiaoi (11/16) and C. suis (5/16).

We collected quantitative and qualitative data before, during and after conducting a clinical trial, using Case Report Forms, Interviewer Administered Questionnaires, In Depth Interviews and Focus Group Discussions. We analyzed the data using an existing theoretical framework including product attributes, relationship attributes and sexual encounter attributes as well as the contextual environment.Our data showed that initial worries reduced over time with actual ring use and ring insertions and removals were described as easy. Most women did not feel the ring during daily activities, appreciated the lack of perceived negative side effects and the increased lubrication. Relationship attributes and sexual encounter attributes such as sexual comfort played a significant role in ring acceptability of the participants and their partners. The contextual environment including Rwandan cultural norms around sexuality positively influenced the acceptance of the NuvaRing. Overall satisfaction was high.Acceptability of the Nuvaring was high among study participants and represents a promising option that could contribute to lowering the unmet need for family planning in Rwanda."
https://openalex.org/W2808992228,"Rodent pups use vocalizations to communicate with one or both parents in biparental species, such as California mice (Peromyscus californicus). Previous studies have shown California mice developmentally exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) or ethinyl estradiol (EE), demonstrate later compromised parental behaviors. Reductions in F1 parental behaviors might also be due to decreased emissions of F2 pup vocalizations. Thus, vocalizations of F2 male and female California mice pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA, EE, or controls were examined. Postnatal days (PND) 2–4 were considered early postnatal period, PND 7 and 14 were defined as mid-postnatal period, and PND 21 and 28 were classified as late postnatal period. EE pups showed increased latency to emit the first syllable compared to controls. BPA female pups had decreased syllable duration compared to control and EE female pups during the early postnatal period but enhanced responses compared to controls at late postnatal period; whereas, male BPA and EE pups showed greater syllable duration compared to controls during early postnatal period. In mid-postnatal period, F2 BPA and EE pups emitted greater number of phrases than F2 control pups. Results indicate aspects of vocalizations were disrupted in F2 pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA or EE, but their responses were not always identical, suggesting BPA might not activate estrogen receptors to the same extent as EE. Changes in vocalization patterns by F2 pups may be due to multigenerational exposure to BPA or EE and/or reduced parental care received."
https://openalex.org/W2809675832,"Background Investigation of the optimal setting for body image prevention programmes is important to maximize the outcomes of such programmes. Objectives We examined the preferred setting for a school-based wellness programme called “In Favour of Myself"". Methods A total of 259 girls (mean 13.82±0.64 years) were divided into a girls-only intervention group, a mixed-gender intervention and a waiting list control group. The participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention (2 months) and at follow-up (3 months) examining changes in self-esteem, media literacy, body image and risk factors for eating disorders. The intervention group participants also completed a satisfaction questionnaire. Results Both intervention groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in identifying advertising strategies (p<0.01) compared with the controls, with the girls-only arm (p<0.001) showing better results. Compared with the girls-only arm and the control group, the mixed-gender group demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvements in the internalization of pressure for thinness (p<0.004), the body-esteem appearance subscale (p<0.025) and body-esteem body-weight subscale (p<0.012) as well as reductions in their perceived current body silhouettes and in the gap between their current and ideal body image (p<0.003). Body dissatisfaction was increased following the programme, although not in a statistically significant manner, with the worst negative effect observed in the girls-only arm. All other differences among the study arms did not show statistically significant differences. Mediation models revealed that body-esteem was directly mediated by group, with statistically significant mediation only in the mixed group. Current body image was mediated indirectly by group through media literacy (i.e., recognizing advertisement strategies and internalization of pressure for thinness), with statistical significance only in the mixed-gender arm compared with the girls-only arm. Higher programme satisfaction was reported in the mixed-gender group (91%) vs. the girls-only groups (79%). Conclusions These outcomes provide preliminary evidence indicating the superiority of a mixed-gender setting compared with a girls-only setting for delivering prevention programmes to 13- to 14-year-old adolescents to enhance their media literacy, positive self-esteem and body image.

https://openalex.org/W2808829869,"The main objective of this study was to investigate the associations between waist circumference, metabolic risk factors, and executive function in adolescents.The study was cross-sectional and included 558 adolescents (mean age 14.2 years). Anthropometrics and systolic blood pressure (sysBP) were measured and fasting blood samples were analyzed for metabolic risk factors. A metabolic risk factor cluster score (MetS-cluster score) was computed from the sum of standardized sysBP, triglycerides (TG), inverse high-density lipid cholesterol (HDLc) and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment). Cognitive control was measured with a modified flanker task.Regression analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic variables, HDLc exhibited a negative and TG a positive association with flanker reaction time (RT). Waist circumference did not demonstrate a statistically significant total association with the cognitive outcomes. In structural equation modeling, waist circumference displayed an indirect positive association with incongruent RT through a higher MetS-cluster score and through lower HDLc. The only statistically significant direct association between waist circumference and the cognitive outcomes was for incongruent RT in the model including HDLc as mediator.These findings are consonant with the previous literature reporting an adverse association between certain metabolic risk factors and cognitive control. Accordingly, these results suggest specificity between metabolic risk factors and cognitive control outcomes. Further, results of the present study, although cross-sectional, provide new evidence that specific metabolic risk factors may mediate an indirect association between adiposity and cognitive control in adolescents, even though a direct association between these variables was not observed. However, taking the cross-sectional study design into consideration, these results should be interpreted with caution and future longitudinal or experimental studies should verify the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W2809324122,"Oceanographic field programs often use δ15N biogeochemical measurements and in situ rate measurements to investigate nitrogen cycling and planktonic ecosystem structure. However, integrative modeling approaches capable of synthesizing these distinct measurement types are lacking. We develop a novel approach for incorporating δ15N isotopic data into existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random walk methods for solving linear inverse ecosystem models. We test the ability of this approach to recover food web indices (nitrate uptake, nitrogen fixation, zooplankton trophic level, and secondary production) derived from forward models simulating the planktonic ecosystems of the California Current and Amazon River Plume. We show that the MCMC with δ15N approach typically does a better job of recovering ecosystem structure than the standard MCMC or L2 minimum norm (L2MN) approaches, and also outperforms an L2MN with δ15N approach. Furthermore, we find that the MCMC with δ15N approach is robust to the removal of input equations and hence is well suited to typical pelagic ecosystem studies for which the system is usually vastly under-constrained. Our approach is easily extendable for use with δ13C isotopic measurements or variable carbon:nitrogen stoichiometry."

An isolate of K. armiger from Alfacs Bay was grown in the laboratory and exposed to adults, embryos and trochophore larvae of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. Adult mussels rejected to filter K. armiger at cell concentrations >1.5·103 cells ml-1. Exposure of adult mussels (23–33 mm shell length) to a range of K. armiger cell concentrations led to mussel mortality with LC50 values of 9.4·103 and 6.1·103 cells ml-1 after 24 and 48 h exposure to ~3.6·104 K. armiger cells ml-1, respectively. Karlodinium armiger also affected mussel embryos and trochophore larvae and feeding by K. armiger on both embryos and larvae was observed under the microscope. Embryos exposed to low K. armiger cell concentrations suffered no measurable mortality. However, at higher K. armiger cell concentrations the mortality of the embryos increased significantly with cell concentration and reached 97% at 1.8·103 K. armiger cells ml-1 after 29 h of exposure. Natural K. armiger blooms may not only have serious direct effects on benthic communities, but may also affect the recruitment of mussels in affected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2809215492,"Small proteins are a new and expanding area of research. Many characterized small proteins are composed of a single hydrophobic α-helix, and the functional requirements of their limited amino acid sequence are not well understood. One hydrophobic small protein, CydX, has been shown to be a component of the cytochrome bd oxidase complex in Escherichia coli, and is required for enzyme function. To investigate small protein sequence specificity, an alanine scanning mutagenesis on the small protein CydX was conducted using mutant alleles expressed from the E. coli chromosome at the wild-type locus. The resulting mutant strains were assayed for CydX function. No single amino acid was required to maintain wild-type resistance to β-mercaptoethanol. However, substitutions of 10-amino acid blocks indicated that the N-terminus of the protein was required for wild-type CydX activity. A series of double mutants showed that multiple mutations at the N-terminus led to β-mercaptoethanol sensitivity in vivo. Triple mutants showed both in vivo and in vitro phenotypes. Together, these data provide evidence suggesting a high level of functional plasticity in CydX, in which multiple amino acids may work cooperatively to facilitate CydX function."

This paper reports on the identification and preliminary characterization of a novel dominant dwarfing gene, Ddw4, from line S44. This was mapped within the centromeric region of chromosome 3R. The Ddw4 gene is sensitive to exogenous gibberellin. Its introduction into the rye populational cultivar Dańkowskie Amber decreased plant height by c. 54% without any negative effects on spike length and number of kernels per spike. Further genetic studies are needed to determine the perspectives for application of the newly detected dwarfing gene into breeding programs for short-stem rye."

Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was measured in minutes per week using the 7-Day PA Recall Interview and accelerometers at baseline and 12 months. Analyses characterized social network structure, composition, tie strength, homogeneity, and support for PA and determined the relationship between network characteristics and PA outcomes.Networks had an average of four social ties (alters). Networks were high in density and transitivity and low in components, indicating high cohesion. Networks were primarily composed of females, Latinos, Spanish-speakers, and family members. Relationship ties were strong as evidenced by close living proximity, in-person contact, high emotional closeness, and long relationship duration. There was high homogeneity in demographics and PA behaviors. Multivariate analyses revealed that network size, familial ties, contact frequency, and ego-alter dissimilarities in age and running but similarities in walking, were associated with increased MVPA. Networks high in support for PA in the form of complimenting ego on exercise, taking over chores to allow ego to exercise, and co-participating with ego in exercise were also associated with greater MVPA.These findings contribute to better understanding interpersonal processes that may influence behavior change in a group with especially low levels of PA."

The modulation of adenosine A1 receptor is neuroprotective in different models of retinal injury. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of the modulation of A1 receptor in LIRD. The eyes of rats intravitreally injected with N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), an A1 agonist, which were later subjected to continuous illumination (CI) for 24 h, showed retinas with a lower number of apoptotic nuclei and a decrease of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) immunoreactive area than controls. Lower levels of activated Caspase 3 and GFAP were demonstrated by Western Blot (WB) in treated animals. Also a decrease of iNOS, TNFα and GFAP mRNA was demonstrated by RT-PCR. A decrease of Iba 1+/MHC-II+ reactive microglial cells was shown by immunohistochemistry. Electroretinograms (ERG) showed higher amplitudes of a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials after CI compared to controls. Conversely, the eyes of rats intravitreally injected with dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), an A1 antagonist, and subjected to CI for 24 h, showed retinas with a higher number of apoptotic nuclei and an increase of GFAP immunoreactive area compared to controls. Also, higher levels of activated Caspase 3 and GFAP were demonstrated by Western Blot. The mRNA levels of iNOS, nNOS and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) were not modified by DPCPX treatment. An increase of Iba 1+/MHC-II+ reactive microglial cells was shown by immunohistochemistry. ERG showed that the amplitudes of a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials after CI were similar to control values. A single pharmacological intervention prior illumination stress was able to swing retinal fate in opposite directions: CPA was neuroprotective, while DPCPX worsened retinal damage. In summary, A1 receptor agonism is a plausible neuroprotective strategy in LIRD."
https://openalex.org/W2808202948,"Background In patients with adult minimal change disease (MCD), proteinuria relapse is a problem to solve. However, the optimal relapse treatment regimen remains unclear regarding steroid dose. We described the treatment pattern of adult MCD patients and evaluated the appropriate steroid dose for relapse treatment. Methods This retrospective multicenter cohort study included 192 patients with adult biopsy-proven MCD from 14 hospitals in Japan. The prescription pattern of immunosuppressive drugs in relapse was reviewed. To assess the association between steroid dose used for relapse and subsequent outcomes, data of patients with tapered prednisolone (PSL) dosage to <10 mg/day before the first relapse in whom the dose was subsequently increased to ≥10 mg/day were extracted and assigned to the High-PSL or Low-PSL groups, based on the median dose of 20 mg/day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model and propensity score analysis with multiple imputations were conducted to compare their clinical course. Results During a median observation period of 37.6 months, 186/192 (96.9%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 100 (52.1%) relapsed. The median urinary protein level at the first relapse was 3.12 g/gCr or g/day. The proportion of non-steroidal immunosuppressant use increased with relapses; cyclosporine was the most common. No significant differences were found in the second relapse, frequent relapses, or adverse events between High-PSL (n = 34) and Low-PSL (n = 36) groups. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that the hazard ratios adjusted with propensity score for the second relapse were 0.94 (High-PSL vs. Low-PSL; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–2.10; P = 0.88) and 0.82 (PSL dose per 10 mg/day; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.16; P = 0.25). Conclusions Among patients in CR with PSL dose <10 mg/day, higher steroid dose (PSL >20 mg/day) was not associated with favorable outcomes after the first relapse as compared to lower dose (10–20 mg/day)."

This study aims to evaluate the ageing effect on cultured pearl quality phenotypes (including size and quality traits) in the graft-recipient animal model: Pinctada margaritifera. For this, eight uniform grafting experiments were designed using two hatchery-produced pearl oyster families as donors, which were followed through time, between 7 and 30 months in age. For each age category, 20 donors were studied for each culture site giving a total of 2400 grafted oysters. Several phenotypic measurements were made: 1) donor family growth performance from shell size records, 2) pearl size and corresponding quality traits, and 3) expression of some genes related to biomineralization processes on both the mantle graft and on pearl sac tissues. Results showed that: 1) donor age has an impact on pearl size, with grafts coming from the youngest donors yielding the biggest pearls; and 2) grafts from donors between 12 and 18 months in age produced pearls of the highest quality (grade and surface quality), a result supported by an analysis where the level of expression for a panel of genes associated with biomineralization was greatest in donors within the 12 to 18 months age group. These results indicate that donors aged between 12 and 18 months have high potential for biomineralisation and nacre deposition, and likely produce larger and higher quality cultured pearls than older donors."
https://openalex.org/W2809338787,"We present the development and evaluation of a gel liner system for upper limb prosthesis users that enables acquisition of electromyographic (myoelectric) control signals through embedded electrodes and flexible, conductive fabric leads. This liner system is constructed using a manufacturing approach rather than by modifying a commercially available liner. To evaluate the efficacy, eight male individuals with transhumeral amputations used this system, with standard myoelectric prostheses, for home trials lasting an average of 7.3 weeks. Before and after the home trials, electrical resistance of the cumulative 218 embedded electrodes and leads within 10 gel liner systems was measured and found to increase slightly (from an average of 13.4 to 27.5 Ω) after usage. While this increase was statistically significant (p = 0.001), all but one of the final resistance values remained low enough to enable consistent myoelectric control. User impressions were evaluated through a questionnaire comparing the liner prototypes to their own myoelectric prosthesis socket interface. Subjects preferred the liner prototype (p = 0.008) over their own system in the clinical areas of comfort, suspension, function, and, especially, ease of use. These results suggest that this gel liner system is a clinically viable option and that it may offer advantages over current clinical technology for users of upper limb myoelectric prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W2809213232,"Specific molecular signaling networks underlie different cancer types and quantitative analyses on those cancer networks can provide useful information about cancer treatments. Their structural metrics can reveal survivability of cancer patients and be used to identify biomarker genes for early cancer detection. In this study, we devised a novel structural metric called hierarchical closeness (HC) entropy and found that it was negatively correlated with 5-year survival rates. We also made an interesting observation that a network of higher HC entropy was likely to be more robust against mutations. This finding suggested that cancers of high HC entropy tend to be incurable because their signaling networks are robust to perturbations caused by treatment. We also proposed a novel core identification method based on the reachability factor in the HC measure. The cores were permitted to decompose such that the negative relationship between HC entropy and cancer survival rate was consistently conserved in every core level. Interestingly, we observed that many promising biomarker genes for early cancer detection reside in the innermost core of a signaling network. Taken together, the proposed analyses of the hierarchical structure of cancer signaling networks may be useful in developing future novel cancer treatments."

We found that the parameter sensitivity ranking according to the change of the bifurcation-point locations in deterministic models and the change of the barrier heights from a living to death state of the cell in stochastic models are highly correlated. For the model we considered, in combination with previous knowledge that the parameters significantly affecting the system's bifurcation point are strongly associated with frequently mutated oncogenic genes, we conclude that the energy barrier height can be used as indicator of oncogenesis as well as bifurcation point. We provide a possible mechanism that may help elucidate the logic of cancer initiation from the view of stochastic dynamics and energy landscape. And we show the equivalence of energy barrier height and bifurcation-point location in determining the parameter sensitivity spectrum for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2809473663,"In a two-echelon new energy vehicle (NEV) supply chain consisting of a risk-neutral manufacturer and a risk-averse retailer, the coordination and sustainability problem is investigated. The risk-averse retailer, who makes sales effort and undertakes the incurred effort cost, decides the order quantity and sales effort level under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) criterion. We derive the optimal centralized decisions of a vertically integrated supply chain where the retailer is owned by the manufacturer. Taking such a centralized case as the benchmark, we prove that the subsidy-sharing-based wholesale price (SS-WP) contract fails to coordinate the NEV supply chain under the decentralized case where the retailer makes decisions independently. Then we design a subsidy-sharing-based sales rebate/penalty (SS-SRP) contract and derive the contract parameters to achieve coordination. We evaluate the coordination efficiency of this contract and find that a well-designed SS-SRP contract can promote the NEV sales and lead to a Pareto-improving win-win situation for both the NEV manufacturer and retailer compared to the non-coordination case. A series of numerical experiments are carried out to compare the effects of significant parameters under the SS-WP and SS-SRP contract and provide additional observations and implications, including an indication of the necessary conditions to sustainably maintain the NEV supply chain."

However, little is known about the effects of early diuretic response to carperitide. Methods We retrospectively analyzed records of 85 patients hospitalized for ADHF who received carperitide as initial treatment and <40 mg furosemide during the early period. The eligible patients were divided into good diuretic responder (GR) group and poor diuretic responder (PR) group on the basis of median urinary volume. Results The PR group demonstrated older age, lower body mass index (BMI), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, left ventricular ejection fraction, and β-blockers prescribed at baseline than the GR group. The incidence of worsening renal function (WRF) was significantly higher in the PR group than in the GR group. There was no correlation between early intravenous furosemide dose and urinary volume (Spearman correlation, ρ = 0.111, p = 0.312). Multivariate analysis showed that the statistically significant independent factors associated with poor diuretic response to carperitide were BMI (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68–0.94, p = 0.004) and BUN (OR = 1.07, 95%CI 1.01–1.15, p = 0.018). Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated a lower event-free rate in the PR group than in the GR group (log-rank, p = 0.007). Conclusions BMI and BUN levels on admission were significant determinants of early poor diuretic response to carperitide. Early poor diuretic response to carperitide was associated with future poor outcomes."

Of all known papillomavirus types, human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are by far the most intensely studied. Although HPVs work well as gene transfer vectors, their use is limited as most individuals are exposed to this virus either through a HPV vaccination or natural infection. To circumvent these constraints, we produced pseudovirions (PsVs) of ten non-human papillomavirus types and tested their transduction efficiencies in vitro. PsVs based on Macaca fascicularis papillomavirus-11 and Puma concolor papillomavirus-1 were further tested in vivo. Intramuscular transduction by PsVs led to months-long expression of a reporter plasmid, indicating that PsVs have potential as gene delivery vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2809685373,"Developmental research on flexible attentional control in young children has often focused on the role of attention in task-switching in a unimodal context. In real life, children must master the art of switching attention not only between task demands, but also between sensory modalities. Previous study has shown that young children can be efficient at switching between unimodal tasks when the situation allows, incurring no greater task-switching costs than adults. However, young children may still experience a greater demand to shift attention between modalities than older participants. To address this, we tested 4-year-olds, 6-year-olds and adults on a novel cross-modal task-switching paradigm involving multisensory detection tasks. While we found age differences in absolute reaction time and accuracy, young children and adults both exhibited strikingly similar effects in task-switching, modality-shifting, and the interaction between them. Young children did not exhibit a greater attentional bottleneck on either the task level, or on the modality level; thus, the evidence suggests that young children engaged in similar cognitive operations in the current cross-modal tasks to adult participants. It appears that cognitive operations in multisensory task configuration are relatively mature between 4 and 6 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2809373850,"Analytical devices that combine sensitive biological component with a physicochemical detector hold a great potential for various applications, e.g., environmental monitoring, food analysis or medical diagnostics. Continuous efforts to develop inexpensive sensitive biodevices for detecting target substances typically focus on the design of biorecognition elements and their physical implementation, while the methods for processing signals generated by such devices have received far less attention. Here, we present fundamental considerations related to signal processing in biosensor design and investigate how undemanding signal treatment facilitates calibration and operation of enzyme-based biodevices. Our signal treatment approach was thoroughly validated with two model systems: (i) a biodevice for detecting chemical warfare agents and environmental pollutants based on the activity of haloalkane dehalogenase, with the sensitive range for bis(2-chloroethyl) ether of 0.01-0.8 mM and (ii) a biodevice for detecting hazardous pesticides based on the activity of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase with the sensitive range for γ-hexachlorocyclohexane of 0.01-0.3 mM. We demonstrate that the advanced signal processing based on curve fitting enables precise quantification of parameters important for sensitive operation of enzyme-based biodevices, including: (i) automated exclusion of signal regions with substantial noise, (ii) derivation of calibration curves with significantly reduced error, (iii) shortening of the detection time, and (iv) reliable extrapolation of the signal to the initial conditions. The presented simple signal curve fitting supports rational design of optimal system setup by explicit and flexible quantification of its properties and will find a broad use in the development of sensitive and robust biodevices."
