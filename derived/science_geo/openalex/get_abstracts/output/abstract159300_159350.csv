https://openalex.org/W2039992040,"The relative contributions of apoptosis and necrosis in brain injury have been a matter of much debate. Caspase-3 has been identified as a key protease in the execution of apoptosis, whereas calpains have mainly been implicated in excitotoxic neuronal injury. In a model of unilateral hypoxia-ischemia in 7-day-old rats, caspase-3-like activity increased 16-fold 24 h postinsult, coinciding with cleavage of the caspase-3 proenzyme and endogenous caspase-3 substrates. This activation was significantly decreased by pharmacological calpain inhibition, using CX295, a calpain inhibitor that did not inhibit purified caspase-3 in vitro. Activation of caspase-3 by m-calpain, but not μ-calpain, was facilitated in a dose-dependent manner in vitroby incubating cytosolic fractions, containing caspase-3 proform, with calpains. This facilitation required the presence of some active caspase-3 and could be abolished by including the specific calpain inhibitor calpastatin. This indicates that initial cleavage of caspase-3 by m-calpain, producing a 29-kDa fragment, facilitates the subsequent cleavage into active forms. This is the first report to our knowledge suggesting a direct link between the early, excitotoxic, calcium-mediated activation of calpain after cerebral hypoxia-ischemia and the subsequent activation of caspase-3, thus representing a tentative pathway of “pathological apoptosis.” The relative contributions of apoptosis and necrosis in brain injury have been a matter of much debate.

Recent studies suggest that cell death after HI is different from developmentally regulated cell death in most cases and cannot appropriately be described as apoptotic (2MacManus J.P. Fliss H.

Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases with an unusual substrate specificity, requiring an aspartate residue in the P1 position, have been identified as key executors of apoptosis (18Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Calpains, another family of cysteine proteases, are calcium-activated and are proposed to participate in the turnover of cytoskeletal proteins and regulation of kinases, transcription factors, and receptors (19Chan S.L.

Furthermore, the proapoptotic protein Bax was cleaved by calpain during drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells (40Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and calpain may be responsible for cleaving the loop region in Bcl-xL, thereby turning an antiapoptotic molecule into a proapoptotic one (41Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). One study demonstrated synergy between calpains and the proteasome downstream of caspases in constitutive apoptosis of human neutrophils (42Knepper-Nicolai B. Savill J. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30530-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas other studies demonstrated an upstream regulatory role for calpains in the apoptosis of neutrophils (43Squier M.K. Sehnert A.J. Sellins K.S. Malkinson A.M. Takano E. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and thymocytes (44Squier M. Cohen J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Nakagawa and Yuan showed that m-calpain may be responsible for the activation of caspase-12 by the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a link between calcium dysregulation and apoptosis (41Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that the supposedly calpain-dependent degradation of calpastatin in a model of neonatal cerebral HI followed a biphasic pattern (45Blomgren K. Hallin U. Andersson A.L. Puka-Sundvall M. Bahr B.A. McRae A. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Hagberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14046-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), where the second phase closely followed the activation of caspase-3. Reports demonstrating degradation of calpastatin by caspase-3 (32Pörn-Ares M.I. Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.V. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate further the spatial and temporal activation of these two proteases and possible interactions in this model. Unilateral HI was induced in 7-day-old Wistar F rats of both sexes (46Rice J. Vannucci R. Brierley J. Ann. Neurol. 1981; 9: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 47Hagberg H. Gilland E. Diemer N. Andine P. Biol. Neonate. 1994; 66: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The pups were anesthetized with halothane (3.0β for induction and 1.0–1.5β for maintenance) in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (1:1), and the duration of anesthesia was <10 min. The left common carotid artery was cut between double ligatures of prolene sutures (6–0). After the surgical procedure, the wounds were infiltrated with a local anesthetic, and the pups were allowed to recover for 1–2 h. The litters were then placed in a chamber perfused with a humidified gas mixture (7.70 ± 0.01β oxygen in nitrogen) for 70 min. The temperature in the gas chamber was kept at 36 °C. Following hypoxic exposure, the pups were returned to their biological dams until sacrificed. Control animals were operated and ligated but not subjected to hypoxia. All animal experimentation was approved by the Ethical Committee of Göteborg (approval number 225-97). Three litters (n= 28) were treated with the calpain inhibitor CX295 (Z-Leu-aminobutyric acid-CONH(CH2)3-morpholine; Cortex Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) or vehicle. The first dose, 200 μl of 5 mm CX295 in 100 mm NaCl (equivalent to ∼80 μmol/kg or 40 mg/kg body weight), was administered subcutaneously immediately after HI. Subsequently, animals were injected with 100 μl of the CX295 solution (equivalent to ∼40 μmol/kg or 20 mg/kg body weight) every 3 h for 24 h. Control animals were injected with 100 mm NaCl. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly dissected out on a bed of ice, weighed, quickly frozen in isopenthane and dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Cortical tissue rostral to the hippocampus, ∼50 mg, was dissected out from each hemisphere at −10 °C. The tissue was homogenized by sonication in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.3), containing 5 mm EDTA, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Homogenate samples were mixed with an equal volume of concentrated (3×) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer and heated (96 °C) for 5 min. Recombinant, active human caspase-3 (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), 2.0 μl of reconstituted solution (the absolute amount of caspase-3 is not known), was preincubated with 50 μl of protease inhibitor solution (see below) for 10 min and then mixed with 100 μl of 50 μmDEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) substrate (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2β CHAPS, and 3 mmNaN3. Cleavage of DEVD-AMC was measured at 37 °C using a Spectramax Gemini microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. DEVD-AMC cleavage was calculated from theVmax and expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFU)/s/ml. Rabbit lung μ- or m-calpain (48Karlsson J.O. Gustavsson S. Hall C. Nilsson E. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (480 pmol of AMC produced/min/ml from LY-AMC at 37 °C, the same for both isozymes) in 50 μl of buffer was preincubated with 50 μl of inhibitor solution (see below) for 10 min and then mixed with 100 μl of 1 mm LY-AMC in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mmDTT, 3β Me2SO, and 3 mmNaN3. Substrate cleavage was evaluated as described for the caspase-3 assay. Inhibitors were as follows: CX295 from Cortex Pharmaceuticals (Irvine, CA) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD) andt-butoxycarbonyl-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Samples of homogenate (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of extraction buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mmNaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2β CHAPS, on a microtiter plate (Microfluor; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, 100 μl of peptide substrate, 50 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) in extraction buffer without inhibitors or CHAPS, but with 4 mm DTT, was added. Cleavage of DEVD-AMC was measured as described above and expressed as pmol of AMC formed per mg of protein and minute. The caspase-3 antibodies were polyclonal and raised either against the full-length precursor of human caspase-3 (H-277; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or against the p17 fragment (residues 176–277) (number 280, a kind gift from Dr. Donald W. Nicholson, Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research, Quebec, Canada). The latter antibody specifically recognized the active form of caspase-3 in tissue sections (6Zhu C. Wang X. Hagberg H. Blomgren K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the amino-terminal proteolytic 145-kDa breakdown product of rat α-fodrin (FBDPN) was used to detect calpain-induced fodrin cleavage (49Bahr B. Tiriveedhi S. Park G. Lynch G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody against DFF-45/ICAD was polyclonal and was generated by immunizing rabbits with a recombinant DFF-45 fusion protein (50Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Xiaodong Wang, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The antibodies against tubulin (clone TU-01; Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands), PARP (clone C-2–101, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), fodrin (FG 6090, Affiniti Research Products, Mamhead, UK), and MAP 2 (clone HM-2, SIGMA) were monoclonal. All secondary antibodies and avidins (horseradish peroxidase-, biotin-, Texas Red-, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated) were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The specificity of the FBDP antibody for calpain-cleaved fodrin was verified by incubating a fodrin-enriched (P2) fraction with either caspase-3 or m-calpain at 37 °C. The incubations were interrupted at various time points, and the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In the fraction incubated with m-calpain, a single, prominent 145-kDa band appeared, increasing with time. In the fraction incubated with caspase-3, no bands could be detected using the FBDP antibody, although extensive degradation of fodrin was taking place, as verified using the FG 6090 antibody that recognizes the intact fodrin as well as several cleavage products (not shown). The protein concentration of homogenates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer was determined according to Karlsson et al. (51Karlsson J. Ostwald K. Kåbjorn C. Andersson M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Samples corresponding to 20 μg of bovine serum albumin were electrophoresed on NOVEX 8–16β Tris-glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Hybond-P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) membranes. Immunoreactive species were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies; Super Signal Western, PICO, DURA, or FEMTO chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce); and Fuji RX film (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Films were scanned, and immunoreactive bands were quantified using the software IPLab Gel 1.5f (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). Alternatively, membranes were exposed in a LAS 1000 cooled CCD camera, and immunoreactive bands were quantified using the software Image Gauge (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Every sample was analyzed 1–4 times, and when multiple determinations were performed the average value was used as n = 1. Stripping of membranes for reprobing purposes was performed by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2β SDS, at 50 °C for 30 min. All membranes were reprobed with the antibody against α-tubulin. Tubulin was used to normalize between samples (10Namura S. Zhu J. Fink K. Endres M. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3659-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pups were deeply anesthetized and perfusion-fixed with 5β formaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer. The brains were rapidly removed and immersion-fixed at 4 °C for 24 h. After dehydration with graded ethanol concentrations and xylene, the brains were paraffin-embedded and cut into 4-μm coronal sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol concentrations before staining. Immunopositive cells were counted in a MAP 2-negative area of parietal cortex 300 × 660 μm in size and expressed as positive cells/mm2. Sections were pretreated with proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min, at room temperature. Antigen recovery was performed by boiling the sections in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min with 4β goat serum in PBS. Anti-caspase-3 p17 was applied diluted 1:500 in PBS and incubated for 60 min at room temperature, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (6 μg/ml in PBS) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (6 μg/ml) for 60 min. Visualization was performed using Vectastain ABC Elite or fluorescence microscopy. Antigen recovery and blocking were performed as above. The anti-FBDP was applied diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 0.2β Triton X-100 and incubated for 60 min at room temperature, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (11 μg/ml in PBS) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (6 μg/ml) for 60 min. Visualization was performed using Vectastain ABC Elite or fluorescence microscopy. Six pups for each time point were decapitated at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 14 days of recovery after hypoxia-ischemia. Control pups (n = 6) were decapitated on postnatal days 7, 8, 10, and 21. The brains were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from each hemisphere (52Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar), quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and stored at −80 °C. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Superscript RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA (2 μg), random primers (500 ng), and RNase-free water to 24 μl were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The mixture was chilled on ice, and 8 μl of 5× first strand buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 4 μl of 0.1 m DTT, and 2 μl of 10 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 42 °C. RT enzyme (2 μl (400 units)) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 42 °C, followed by 15 min of inactivation at 70 °C. The template cDNA thus obtained was diluted to 100 μl with water and stored at −20 °C. Each subsequent PCR (25 μl) contained 4 μl of template cDNA, a 0.2 mmconcentration each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a 1 μm concentration of each primer, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma), and 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Sigma). Primers were as follows: caspase-3 (GenBankTM accession number U49930) 5′-408TTTGGAACGAACGGACCTGT-3′ (upstream) and 5′-798CACGGGATCTGTTTCTTTGC-3′ (downstream); GAPDH (GenBankTM accession number M17701), 5′-331ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-839CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC-3′ (downstream). All primers were from Kebo Lab (Stockholm, Sweden). PCR cycling for caspase-3 was as follows: step 1, 94 °C for 5 min; step 2, 24 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s; step 3, 72 °C for 5 min. PCR cycling for GAPDH was as follows: step 1, 94 °C for 5 min; step 2, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s; step 3, 72 °C for 5 min. The annealing temperatures and cycle numbers were chosen such that both the caspase-3 and the GAPDH PCR products would be in the linear phase of amplification and of similar intensity (data not shown). The PCR products (412 bp for caspase-3 and 528 bp for GAPDH) were separated on 1.5β agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. The pictures were scanned, and the bands were quantified using the software IPLab Gel 1.5f (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA). The relative amount of caspase-3 mRNA was calculated after normalization to GAPDH, to compensate for errors introduced during the preparation of RNA, the production of cDNA, or the PCR. Forebrain hemispheres of P7 control animals (n = 7) were homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 5 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min to obtain cytosolic (S3) fractions. Aliquots of 100 μl of S3, 3.0 μl of 100 mmdithiothreitol, 9.0 μl of 100 mm CaCl2, 1.0 μl of 0.5 m NaOH (to compensate for the drop in pH occurring when Ca2+ ions replace protons in the EDTA molecules), and 58.0 μl of homogenizing buffer were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Purified μ- or m-calpain, recombinant caspase-3, purified calpastatin (14 units/ml), calpastatin peptide (3 μg/ml; Sigma), CX295 (1 mm), ZVAD (0.7 mm), or BAF (0.88 mm) was included in some incubations, replacing partly the homogenizing buffer. When inhibitors were added, they were preincubated for 10 min with the enzymes at room temperature before being added to the S3 mixture. The reactions were stopped by adding 8.0 μl of 100 mm EDTA. Aliquots of 50 μl were assayed for DEVD cleavage, and portions equivalent to 90 μg of total protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The protein concentrations were determined according to Whitaker and Granum (53Whitaker J.R. Granum P.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), adapted for microplates, using a Spectramax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices). Crude calpastatin (100 units/ml) was purified from rabbit lung via hydrophobic interaction chromatography, as previously described (48Karlsson J.O. Gustavsson S. Hall C. Nilsson E. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and further purified via trichloroacetic acid precipitation and gel filtration (54Belles B. Hescheler J. Trautwein W. Blomgren K. Karlsson J. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 412: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Aliquots (50 μl) of m-calpain were incubated for 15 min at room temperature under conditions where the enzyme was half-maximally activated (0.36 mm Ca2+). Increasing amounts of active caspase-3 (1–60 units per incubation, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of caspase-3 that will release 1.0 pmol of AMC/min/ml in the DEVD-cleaving assay described above) were included to see if caspase-3 could increase the m-calpain activity directly. Calpain activity was measured as described above. Student's unpaired t test or analysis of variance with Scheffe's post hoc test were used. DEVD-cleaving activity was detectable in neonatal brain samples and increased severalfold in the ipsilateral compared with the contralateral hemispheres, in accordance with earlier findings (9Cheng Y. Deshmukh M. DaCosta A. Demaro J.A. Gidday J.M. Shah A. Sun Y. Jacquin M.F. Johnson E.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and this increase displayed a maximum 24 h post-HI (not shown). The average ratio between the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres was significantly decreased after calpain inhibition, from 1618β in the vehicle-treated animals to 606.1β in the CX295-treated animals (p = 0.0004) (TableI).Table IEffects of in vivo calpain inhibition on the activation of caspase-3RatioS.D.npββCaspase-3DEVD cleavageVehicle1618.0564.490.0004CX295606.1289.4832 kDaVehicle72.818.3110.005CX29596.017.41229/(29 + 32) kDaVehicle15.211.1110.031CX2956.885.4612ICAD45 + 32 kDaVehicle77.518.2110.006CX29599.914.510The caspase-3-like activity (DEVD cleavage), cleavage of the caspase-3 proform and degradation of endogenous caspase-3 substrate ICAD were assessed"

The formation of mature OCs is completely dependent on the presence of both RANKL and M-CSF, as demonstrated by the lack of OC development in mice lacking the expression of either factor (5Kong Y.Y.

Moreover, considerable evidence support the hypothesis that E2 down-regulates OC formation by blunting the production of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF (9Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Eng. J.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms that serve to explain the antiosteoclastogenic effects of E2 include the ability of sex steroids to stimulate the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy RANKL receptor (18Hofbauer L.C. Khosla S. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4367-4370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a direct repressive effect on the production of membrane-bound M-CSF (19Sarma U. Edwards M. Motoyoshi K. Flanagan A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Lea C.K. Sarma U. Flanagan A.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the relevance of RANKL as an osteoclastogenic factor, and of the potent antiosteoclastogenic effect of E2, sex steroids have not been reported to regulate the production of RANKL. The lack of such regulation is consistent with the absence of both estrogen-responsive elements and binding sequences for E2-regulated transcription factors on the RANKL promoter (21Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Binding of RANKL to its signaling receptor RANK results in the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase that increases the transactivation activity and the production of AP-1 transcription factors. We have recently reported that E2 down-regulates TNF-induced JNK activation in monocytic cells (22Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and others have shown that OC formation is impaired in mice lacking the AP-1 factors c-Fos and c-Jun (23Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 24David J.P. Wagner E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): S149Google Scholar). These data prompted us to investigate the hypothesis that an additional mechanism by which E2 down-regulates OC formation is by decreasing the responsiveness of maturing OC to RANKL. Here we show that E2 decreases the activation of JNK leading to decreased production of the osteoclastogenic transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun. Thus, E2 down-regulates OC formation not only by modulating the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines but also by affecting the sensitivity of maturing OC to RANKL. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Unless otherwise specified, reagents and media were purchased from Sigma. Bone marrow monocytes (BMM), defined as CD11b+ cells, were purified from the bone marrow of 5-week-old mice by positive immunoselection using MACS CD11b immunomagnetic beads (Milteny Biotec, Auburn, CA). RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the ATCC. All cells were maintained in phenol red-free media and 10% charcoal-stripped serum cultured in α-MEM and treated with either E2 (10−8m) or control vehicle. For some experiments, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with raloxifene (10−7m), 4-hydroxytamoxifene (10−7m), and estrogen (10−8m) plus ICI 182780 (10−6m). In other experiments the MEK1/ERK pathway inhibitor PD 98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added (50 μm) to control and E2-treated RAW 264.7 cells 1 h before stimulation with RANKL for 30 min. OC were generated by culturing BMM with recombinant soluble RANKL (20 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 7 days as described (4Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R.

At the end of each experiment, cells were then fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Expression of calcitonin receptors and the ability to form resorption pits in vitrowere assessed as previously described (26Kitazawa R. Kimble R.B. Vannice J.L. Kung V.T. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining for pp60c-src and cathepsin K was conducted as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). More than 98% of the TRAP+cells with three or more nuclei showed specific binding of labeled calcitonin and expression of pp60c-src and cathepsin K. These cells were capable of forming resorption pitsin vitro. Therefore, TRAP+ cells with three or more nuclei were defined and counted as OC. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with E2 (10−8m), ICI 182780 (10−6m), estrogen + ICI, 4-hydro-tamoxifen (10−7m) or raloxifene (10−7m), or vehicle for 24 h and then stimulated with RANKL (200 ng/ml) for 5–30 min. JNK activity was determined in cell extracts as described (22Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were precleared with 10–15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The resin was then removed by centrifugation and the supernatant incubated with 1 μg of anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 h on ice. The immunocomplexes were then precipitated using protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed, resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with 1 μg of recombinant c-Jun (28Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T.

Phosphorylated c-Jun-GST protein was detected by autoradiography as described previously (30Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For some experiment, JNK activity was determined in cell extracts using a JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, JNK was precipitated by incubating cell extract overnight with c-Jun fusion protein beads. Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The appropriate primary and secondary antibodies were used for detection of phosphorylated c-Jun on the membrane followed by a standard chemiluminescence reaction using LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technology). The levels of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated species of JNK1 and JNK2 (total JNK1/2) and those of the active (phosphorylated) forms of JNK1 and JNK2 (active JNK1/2) were measured using whole cell lysates from control and E2-treated RAW 264.7 cells either unstimulated or stimulated with RANKL for 30 min. Cell lysates (50 μg) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto nitrocellulose. Total and phosphorylated JNK1/2 were detected using antibodies specific for either total JNK1 and JNK2 or phosphorylated JNK1 and JNK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blot studies were conducted using whole cell lysates from control and E2-treated RAW 264.7 cells either unstimulated or stimulated with RANKL for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH.8, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (28Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Proteins were boiled in Laemmli loading dye, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and transblotted onto nitrocellulose. The levels of total and phosphorylated MKK4 were detected using antibodies (New England Biolabs) specific for phosphorylated (active) and total (dephosphorylated plus phosphorylated) MKK4 using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating nuclear extracts prepared from control and E2-treated RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with RANKL (20 ng/ml) for 1 h with a32P-labeled double-stranded probe (5′ AAAGCAGCAGCCTGAGCTCATGATCA 3′) synthesized to represent the AP-1 binding sequence (underlined) as described previously (22Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies directed against members of the Jun and Fos families of nuclear proteins were used to supershift the relevant proteins. The probe was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The annealed probe was incubated with nuclear extract on ice for 30 min prior to separation of the DNA-protein complexes on 4% nondenaturing PAGE, pre-run for 1 h in 0.25× TBE running buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for the appropriate length of time. For band supershifting, 200 ng of the appropriate antibody was added to the reaction mixture on ice for 40 min before adding the oligonucleotide probe. Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies specific for either c-Jun, JunD, JunB, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, or Fra-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (22Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Group mean values were compared by two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Subsequent mean comparison tests were performed by the Fisher protected least significant difference test.

Triplicate experiments revealed that E2 (10−8m) decreases by ∼40% the ability of soluble recombinant RANKL and M-CSF to induce the differentiation of primary murine BMM into mature OC (Fig.1 A), defined as TRAP, calcitonin receptor, pp60c-src, and cathepsin K+ multinucleated cells capable of resorbing bonein vitro. Inhibition of either M-CSF- or RANKL-induced signals could account for the ability of E2 to blunt the differentiation of BMM into OC. Because we wished to examine the role of E2 in modulating RANKL-induced signals, we utilized the property of RAW 264.7 cells, a murine monocytic line, to differentiate into OC when treated with RANKL in the absence of M-CSF (25Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Quadruple experiments (Fig. 1 B) revealed that, similar to its effect on primary BMM, E2 decreases by ∼40% the differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells into OC induced by RANKL. The selective estrogen receptor modulators 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene were as effective as estrogen in suppressing RANKL-induced differentiation of both BMM and Raw 264.7 cells into OC. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of estrogen were reversed by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 (3 1), a finding that suggests sex steroids have a genomic effect on OC precursors. Thus, the inhibitory effect of E2 on RANKL-induced signals is sufficient to block OC formation, and RAW 264.7 cells represent an appropriate model for dissecting the molecular mechanisms involved. A key signaling event induced by the binding of RANKL to RANK is the activation of JNK (25Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). To investigate whether E2 decreases JNK activity, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with either E2 or control vehicle for 24 h, a length of time sufficient to induce genomic effects, and then stimulated with RANKL for 0–30 min. Nuclear extracts were then immunoprecipitated using an antibody that recognizes the two members of the JNK family, JNK1 and JNK2. Equal amounts of proteins were recovered and incubated with recombinant GST-c-Jun (a JNK substrate) and [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated material was resolved by SDS-gel and visualized by autoradiography. These studies revealed (Fig.2 A) that RANKL increases JNK activity 10-fold, peaking at 15 min. At all time points E2 treatment blunted RANKL-induced JNK activity, as compared with cells treated with RANKL plus E2 vehicle. Peak inhibitory activity (5-fold inhibition compared with vehicle-treated controls) was found at 15 min. The inhibitory effect of E2 on peak JNK activity was reversed by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 (Fig. 2 B). Raloxifene and tamoxifen blocked RANKL-induced JNK activity in a manner similar to E2. Western blot analysis of RAW 264.7 cell extracts with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated (active) forms of JNK1 and JNK2 showed that unstimulated cells have low levels of active JNK1 and undetectable levels of active JNK2. RANKL induced the production of active JNK1 but not of JNK2 (Fig. 2 C). However, at all time points phosphorylated JNK1 was ∼50% lower in E2-treated cells than in cells treated with vehicle. E2 also had a small inhibitory effect on the levels of phosphorylated JNK1 in unstimulated cells. In contrast, Western blot analysis by an antibody recognizing both the dephosphorylated and the phosphorylated species of JNK1 and JNK2 (total JNK1/2) revealed the presence of both JNK species in unstimulated cells. However, neither RANKL nor E2 altered the level of total JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 2 D). Together, these findings demonstrate that E2 represses the ability of RANKL to induce the activation of JNK1. MKK4 is a kinase known to activate JNK1 by inducing its phosphorylation (32Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Analysis of the effects of E2 on MKK4 using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated (active) form of this kinase revealed (Fig.3 A) that RANKL increases by ∼3-fold the level of phosphorylated MKK4 and that E2 decreases by ∼50% the activation of MKK4 induced by RANKL. E2 also had a small inhibitory effect on the levels of phosphorylated MKK4 in unstimulated cells. In contrast, Western blot studies conducted using an antibody that recognizes both the dephosphorylated (inactive) and the phosphorylated species of MKK4 revealed that neither RANKL nor E2 modulates the total levels of MKK4 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, although the signaling pathway linking RANKL to MKK4 remains to be determined, the data demonstrate that E2 blunts MKK4 and JNK activation, thus leading to diminished JNK activity. MKK4 is activated by MEKK1, a kinase that also leads to the phosphorylation of ELK-1 through the MEK1/ERK pathway (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 34Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Thus, a regulatory effect of E2 on MEKK1 could lead to blunted ERK activity and decreased ERK-induced production of c-Fos. The hypothesis that E2 blunts nuclear levels of c-Fos via inhibition of the MEK1/ERK pathway was excluded by demonstrating that PD 98059, a compound that blocks MEK1 activation (35Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar, 36Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar), does not abolish the ability of E2 to decrease nuclear levels of c-Fos (Fig.4). Because RANKL-induced JNK activation results in enhanced production of Jun and Fos, we examined the effects of E2 on the nuclear levels of these proteins. Western blot studies conducted using RAW 264.7 nuclear extracts and monoclonal antibodies specific for individual member of the Jun and Fos families revealed that RANKL increased c-Jun levels and induced c-Fos production, peaking at 30 min. (Fig. 5). Moreover, in RANKL-stimulated cells, the levels of both c-Jun and c-Fos were ∼3-fold lower in those treated with E2 than in those treated with control vehicle. Neither RANKL nor E2 affected the levels of JunB, JunD, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 (not shown). Jun and Fos exert their transcriptional effects by binding to the AP-1 consensus sequence(s) in the promoter region of target genes. The binding of these nuclear protein to DNA is proportional to their nuclear concentration and phosphorylation status. To determine the effects of E2 on the ability of Jun and Fos proteins to bind to DNA, nuclear extracts from control and E2-treated RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with a labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the AP-1 consensus sequence. Samples from all cells generated a single DNA-protein complex, which was confirmed as AP-1 by the ability of 50-fold molar excess AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide to displace the complex. RANKL increased by ∼3-fold the binding of AP-1 to its binding motif (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, in samples from RANKL-treated cells, a specific anti-c-Jun antibody led to the almost complete disappearance of the AP-1 band, whereas anti-JunD and anti-JunB antibodies had no effects. The AP-1 complex was also supershifted by anti-c-Fos antibody (Fig.5 B), whereas antibodies against Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2 had no effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that RANKL increases the binding to DNA of c-Jun/c-Fos and JunD/c-Fos heterodimers. These experiments also revealed that E2 completely blocks the ability of RANKL to increase the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos and JunD/c-Fos heterodimers to DNA (Fig. 6, A and B). It is now recognized that E2 prevents bone loss via multiple and complex effects on bone marrow and bone cells, which results in decreased OC formation, increased OC apoptosis, and decreased capacity of mature OCs to resorb bone (9Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Eng. J. Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). E2 modulates OC apoptosis and OC activity both directly (37Kameda T. Mano H. Yuasa T. Mori Y. Miyazawa K.

Conversely, inhibition of OC formation in vivo results, in part, from the ability of E2 to block the production of the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF (9Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L.

Another relevant effect of E2 in vivois its capacity to block the production of soluble M-CSF via an IL-1- and TNF-dependent mechanism (16Kimble R.B. Srivastava S. Ross F.P. Matayoshi A. Pacifici R.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also revealed that E2 directly block the differentiation of OC precursors into mature OC (42Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), although the relevance of this phenomenon in vivo remains to be determined. Although IL-1, IL-6, and TNF induce the formation of OCs in vivo and in complex culture systems containing stromal cells, osteoblasts, and OC precursors, these cytokines (alone or in combination) are not capable of inducing the formation of OCs when added to purified OC precursors. Moreover, osteopetrosis is not a feature of mice lacking the capacity to produce and/or respond to either IL-1, IL-6, or TNF (11Lorenzo J.A. Naprta A. Rao Y. Alander C. Glaccum M. Widmer M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the notions that IL-1, IL-6, and TNF enhance OC formation by increasing the production of M-CSF (43Sherman M.L. Weber B.L. Datta R. Kufe D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Falkenburg J.H. Harrington M.A. de Paus R.A. Walsh W.K. Daub R. Landegent J.E. Broxmeyer H.E.

Invest. 2000; 106: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Binding of RANKL to RANK results in a cascade of intracellular events, including the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the stimulation of the protein kinase JNK (25Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B.

Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, increases transcription of the c-jun and c-fos genes (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 47Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This is because the transcription of c-Jun is regulated by two AP-1 binding sites present in its promoter regions (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 48Foletta V.C. Segal D.H. Cohen D.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These sites are constitutively occupied by Jun/ATF2 heterodimers (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 48Foletta V.C. Segal D.H. Cohen D.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which generate a basal rate of gene autostimulation. However, the magnitude of the autoinduction of the c-jun gene by Jun/ATF2 heterodimers is enhanced by JNK-dependent phosphorylation of two serine residues within the N-terminal activation domain of c-Jun (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). JNK is also responsible for the phosphorylation of ternary complex factors (such as Elk-1) that are constitutively bound to the serum response element in the c-Fos promoter (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). Because JNK-dependent phosphorylation of ternary complex factors stimulates the transcription of the c-fos gene, JNK activation results in increased c-fos gene expression (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). The relevance of the RANK/TRAF6/JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway is demonstrated by the fact that osteopetrosis is a feature of TRAF6 (49Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar)- and c-fos-deficient mice (50Wang Z.Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F.

Moreover, osteoclastogenesis is impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing a c-Jun mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by JNK1 (24David J.P. Wagner E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): S149Google Scholar). In agreement with these data and with recent observations of Shevde et al. (42Shevde N.K. Bendixen A.C. Dienger K.M. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7829-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), we have found that E2 decreases the ability of RANKL to activate MKK4 and JNK1 and the production of osteoclastogenic transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos (23Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 24David J.P. Wagner E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): S149Google Scholar). However, we recognize that our findings do not conclusively demonstrate that MKK4 activation is the mechanism by which RANKL and E2 regulate JNK activity and the resulting production of c-Fos and c-Jun. The mechanism by which E2 regulates the activation of MKK4 also remains to be determined, although it is likely that E2 may regulate the production of upstream signaling molecule(s) involved in the activation of MKK4. Because ligand binding to RANK activates NF-κB and E2 represses IL-6-induced NF-κB activation in stromal cells, it could be argued that NF-κB may mediate, at least in part, the repressive effects of E2 on OC development. The regulatory effects of E2 on RANKL-induced NF-κB activation remain to be investigated. However, in agreement with Hsu et al. (25Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L. Xia X.Z. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar), in preliminary studies we have found that RANKL is a weak activator of NF-κB in BMM and RAW 264.7 cells and that E2 does not decrease the RANKL-induced binding of NF-κB to its specific consensus sequence (not shown). Moreover, in previous studies we also found that E2 does not regulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation (22Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the repressive effects of E2 on NF-κB are cell- and promoter-specific. In summary, our findings demonstrate that E2 represses the ability of RANKL to induce the activation of JNK1, thus leading to lower levels of c-Fos and c-Jun and decreased bindings of these proteins to DNA. Thus, a mechanism by which E2 blocks OC formation is by decreasing the responsiveness of OC precursors to the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL."

Expansion of RNA CUG repeats in the 3′-untranslated repeat of the mutant myotonin protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA in myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with alterations in binding activity of CUGBP1. To investigate whether CUGBP1 is directly affected by expansion of CUG repeats in DM tissues, we examined the intracellular status of CUGBP1 in DM patients as well as in cultured cells over expressing RNA CUG repeats. The analysis of RNA·protein complexes showed that, in control tissues, the majority of CUGBP1 is free of RNA, whereas in DM patients the majority of CUGBP1 is associated with RNA containing CUG repeats. Similarly to DM patients, overexpression of RNA CUG repeats in cultured cells results in the re-allocation of CUGBP1 from a free state to the RNA·protein complexes containing CUG repeats. CUG repeat-dependent translocation of CUGBP1 into RNA·protein complexes is associated with increased levels of CUGBP1 protein and its binding activity. Experiments with cyclohexamide-dependent block of protein synthesis showed that the half-life of CUGBP1 is increased in cells expressing CUG repeats. Alteration of CUGBP1 in DM is accompanied by alteration in translation of a transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which has been previously described to be a target of CUGBP1. Analysis of C/EBPβ isoforms in DM patients with altered levels of CUGBP1 showed that translation of a dominant negative isoform, LIP, is induced by CUGBP1.

Soriano P. Tapscott S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Deletion of DMAHP in mice showed that reduction of DMAHP is associated with the increased rate of cataracts but not myotonia or cardiac abnormalities (10Klesert T.R. Cho D.H. Clark J.I. Maylie J. Adelman J. Snider L. Yuen E.C. Soriano P. Tapscott S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis suggests that DM pathogenesis is due to expression of mutant DMPK mRNA (11Wang J. Pegoraro E. Menegazzo E. Gennarelli M. Hoop R.C. Angelini C. Hoffman E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This hypothesis proposes that mutant DMPK mRNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism (11Wang J. Pegoraro E. Menegazzo E. Gennarelli M. Hoop R.C. Angelini C. Hoffman E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Following this RNA-based hypothesis, we suggested that expanded RNA CUG repeats in DMPK mRNA may serve as binding sites for specific CUG triplet repeat RNA-binding proteins (12Timchenko L.T.

We also proposed that the dramatic increase of (CUG)n repeats in DM patients might affect expression of these RNA-binding proteins (14Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Timchenko L.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp.

The RNA-based hypothesis for DM pathogenesis has been recently proved by Thornton and colleagues (18Mankodi A. Logigian E. Callahan L. McClain C. White R. Henderson D. Krym M. Thornton C.A. Science. 2000; 289: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), showing that overexpression of RNA CUG repeats in transgenic mice induces myopathy and myotonia. A number of RNA-binding proteins with specific binding activity to CUG repeats have been identified (12Timchenko L.T. Timchenko N.A. Caskey C.T. Roberts R. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). These proteins include CUGBP1, ETR-3, and Brunol 1 and recently identified a group of expansion binding proteins that preferentially bind to double-stranded structures containing CUG repeats (20Miller J.W.

All of these proteins are likely to be involved in DM pathogenesis, because their activities are altered in DM patients (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CUGBP1 is localized in both nuclei and cytoplasm. The nuclear function of CUGBP1 seems to be associated with splicing (21Philips A.V Timchenko L.T. Cooper T. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a target of CUGBP1 (21Philips A.V Timchenko L.T. Cooper T. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and that splicing of cTnT is altered in hearts of DM patients. CUGBP1 is homologous to Brunol proteins that play a role in translation (19Good P.J. Chen Q. Warner S.J. Herring D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28563-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggests that CUGBP1 may play a role in translation of RNA. In agreement with this suggestion, a significant portion of CUGBP1 has been found to localize in the cytoplasm (22Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that CUGBP1 is associated with polysomes and is involved in the regulation of translation of C(U/C)G-containing mRNA (22Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This function of CUGBP1 may play an important role in regulation of cell growth and proliferation by controlling activities of transcription factors and cell cycle proteins. A member of the CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein family, C/EBPβ, is encoded by an intronless gene, but a single mRNA of C/EBPβ can produce several isoforms with different transcriptional activities (Ref. 23Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar and see Fig. 5 A). Three major isoforms of C/EBPβ are produced by alternative translation: full-length (FL, 38 kDa), liver activator protein (LAP, 35 kDa) and liver inhibitory protein (LIP, 20 kDa). CUGBP1 has been shown to regulate translation of a dominant negative isoform of C/EBPβ, liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein (LIP) (22Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability of CUGBP1 to regulate translation of C(U/C)G-containing mRNAs suggests that altered expression of CUGBP1 in DM may lead to changes in translation of C(U/C)G-containing mRNAs. In this paper, we present evidence showing that RNA CUG repeats directly affect expression and activity of CUGBP1. Experiments in tissue culture demonstrate that endogenous CUGBP1 is titrated from a free pool by overexpression of transcripts with long CUG repeats. Formation of CUGBP1·CUG RNA complexes is accompanied by increased stability of CUGBP1 protein and subsequent elevation of CUGBP1. Similar to results obtained in tissue culture, analysis of DM patients showed that protein levels of CUGBP1 are increased in DM patients and the majority of CUGBP1 is detectable within RNA·protein complexes containing CUG repeats. Sequestration of CUGBP1 in DM patients is accompanied by altered translation of CUGBP1-dependent mRNAs. Long CTG repeats (170 and 500 repeats) were synthesized as described previously (24Ordway J.M. Detloff P.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), fused with a human β-actin promoter, and cloned into the pSV2 vector. The resulting plasmid included the sequence of the human β-actin gene, consisting of 3 kb of 5′-flanking sequence followed by 78 bp of 5′-UTR and 832 bp of intron I. CTG repeat sequences were cloned between the β-actin promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Cos7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For transfections, plasmid DNA (18 μg/15-cm dish) was mixed with LipofectAMINE or Lipofectin and added to cultured cells. Control transfections were performed with vector DNA (BS). The efficiency of transfection was evaluated by using plasmid DNA containing β-galactosidase. After transfection, cells with empty vector and CTG-containing plasmids were used for protein and RNA extraction. To analyze the level of RNA (CUG)170–500 expression in cultured cells, total RNA was purified from transfected cells with TRI reagent. The integrity of RNA has been verified by gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the level of CUG expression, RNA was transferred onto a Z-probe membrane and hybridized with a 32P-(CAG)8 probe. RNA containing 170 CUG repeats was detected after 12 h of exposure. RNA containing 500 CUG repeats was detected after 36 h of exposure because of lower efficiency of RNA expression from the construct containing 500 CTG repeats. No signals for CUG-containing RNAs were detected in control cells transfected with BS after 36 h of exposure. Cos7 or HT1080 cultured cells were transfected with wild type (empty) vector or with plasmid expressing 170 CUG repeats. Cyclohexamide (CHX, 10 μg/ml) was added, and proteins were isolated 2, 4, and 8 h after CHX addition. CUGBP1 levels were examined by Western assay with monoclonal antibodies to CUGBP1 (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The block of protein synthesis by CHX was verified by analysis of p21 protein half-life in HT1080 cells. In experiments presented in the manuscript, the p21 half-life in both control and CUG-expressing cells was 40–60 min and agreed with our previous estimate (25Timchenko N.A Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of CUGBP1 protein levels indicated that CUGBP1 half-life is ∼3 h in control cells. RNA oligomer CUG8 was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase. Cytoplasmic proteins were incubated with the probe, treated with UV light, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing SDS. Where indicated, unlabeled RNA competitor (100 ng) was added prior to protein addition. To verify the concentration of proteins used in UV cross-linking assay, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue after the UV cross-link analysis. All gels presented in this paper were equally loaded. Proteins from DM tissues (14Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Timchenko L.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously (12Timchenko L.T. Timchenko N.A. Caskey C.T. Roberts R. Hum. Mol.

Protein extracts from normal controls were purchased from CLONTECH Co. 50 or 100 μg of protein was loaded on a 10–12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Bio-Rad). The filter was blocked with 10% dry milk/2% bovine serum albumin prepared in TTBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies to CUGBP1 or to C/EBPβ (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and the filter was incubated for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL method. After detection of the protein of interest, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin. For quantitative analysis, the intensity of the signals was determined on the Alpha Imager 2000 gel documentation and analysis system. Protein levels were calculated as a ratio to control protein. In the case of C/EBPβ, the ratios LAP/FL or LIP/FL were calculated. To study CUGBP1 expression in cultured cells, whole cell protein extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western assay with monoclonal (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) or polyclonal antibodies against CUGBP1 (16Lu X. Timchenko N.A. Timchenko L.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To verify protein loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against β-actin. The intensity of CUGBP1 was determined on the Alpha Imager 2000 documentation and analysis system, and the amount of CUGBP1 was calculated as a ratio to β-actin. Total RNA was extracted from heart tissues and from transfected cells with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center). mRNA was extracted with a poly(A) Quick kit (Stratagene). Normal control poly(A) and total RNA were fromCLONTECH Co. Total RNA (1 μg) and mRNA (100 ng) were used for the RT reaction with M-Mul (Stratagene) and oligo(dT) primers. The RT product (2 μl) was then used for PCR, with two sets of primers: one set for the CUGBP1 gene and another one for the TBP gene (internal control). A PCR assay (50 μl) contained 20 pmol of each primer; 50 mm KCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 0.1% Triton X-100; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 200 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP; 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP; and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). Amplification was performed in a Robocycler (Stratagene) under the following conditions: denaturation was at 94 °C for 90 s, annealing at 54 °C for 90 s, and extension at 72 °C for 150 s. The optimal number of cycles when PCR was linear (with heteroduplex formation) was 19 cycles. The PCR products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Intensities of PCR products were quantified by PhosphorImager scans (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuaNT version 1.1 image analysis program (Molecular Dynamics). The CUGBP1 level was calculated as a ratio of the peak area for TBP. Primer sequences for RT-PCR were as follows: CUGBP1, 5′-CCAGACAACCAGATCTTGATGCT-3′ and 5′-AGGTTTCATCTGTATAGGGTGATG-3′; TBP, 5′-CCAGGAAATAACTCTGGCTCATAAC-3′, and 5′-AGTGAAGAACAGTCCAGACTGGCAG-3. Cytoplasm from Cos7 cells or from tissues of DM patients was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on an SEC-400 column (BioLogic HR, Bio-Rad). Standard protein molecular weight markers were run in parallel. 300-μl fractions were collected and used for further analysis of CUGBP1 protein and its binding activity. The presence of total RNA in HPLC fractions was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by EtBr staining and by slot hybridization of gel filtration fractions with 18 S rRNA-specific probe (29Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The position of CUG repeat-containing mRNA within the fractions was determined by slot hybridization with a CAG8 DNA probe labeled by γ-32P in a kinase reaction. The conditions for slot hybridization are as follows. 100 μl of each fraction was denatured with 50% formamide and blotted onto the membrane. The membrane was preincubated with a hybridization mixture (40% formamide: 4× SSC/5%SDS) for 1 h.32P-Labeled CAG8 probe was added and incubated for overnight under the same conditions. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC at room temperature for 2 h and exposed to x-ray film (BioMax). The binding activity of CUGBP1 was examined using gel-shift and UV cross-linking assays with CUG8 probe as described above. 5 μl of each fraction was used in these assays. Western analysis of the fractions was performed as described above. CUGBP1-stable clones were generated using an inducible LacSwitch mammalian system as described in our earlier study (25Timchenko N.A Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The coding region of CUGBP1 was cloned into pOP-13 vector under a Rous sarcoma virus promoter that is regulated by Lac-Repressor. Human fibroblasts were stably transfected with Lac-Repressor and pOP-13-CUGBP1-antisense plasmids. Clones resistant to hygromycin and to G418 were selected and analyzed for the CUGBP1 expression after addition of IPTG. Several clones showed 2- to 5-fold reduction of CUGBP1 protein by expression of antisense CUGBP1 mRNA. One clone showed 6- to 8-fold reduction of CUGBP1 and was selected for further studies. The paper represents data obtained with this clone. Expression of antisense CUGBP1 was induced by addition of 10 mm IPTG, and proteins were isolated 4, 8, and 24 h after IPTG addition. CUGBP1 protein levels were determined by Western analysis with monoclonal as well as with polyclonal antibodies to CUGBP1 as described (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Lu X. Timchenko N.A. Timchenko L.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ isoforms were analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Ratios of LIP/LAP and LAP/FL isoforms were calculated by densitometry. CUGBP1 has been shown to interact with CUG repeats, and its activity is altered in DM patients (13Timchenko L.T. Miller J. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15Roberts R. Timchenko N.A.

Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). To examine whether CUG repeats can directly affect CUGBP1, we initially investigated the status of CUGBP1 in DM cells containing the mutant DMPK transcripts with a large expansion of CUG repeats (15Roberts R. Timchenko N.A. Miller J.W. Reddy S. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S. Timchenko L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13221-13226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Philips A.V Timchenko L.T. Cooper T. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and in control tissues with a normal size of CUG repeats within DMPK mRNA. Cardiac proteins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed by gel-shift assay with a CUG8 probe. Normal control hearts contain a majority of CUGBP1 located in fractions with molecular mass corresponding to the size of free CUGBP1 (51 kDa). With the sensitivity of our gel-shift assays, little or no CUGBP1 is detectable in high molecular mass fractions that contain RNA (Fig.1 A). Additionally, we performed slot hybridization with a short CAG8 probe (see “Experimental Procedures”) that specifically hybridizes to CUG repeats. Under conditions of our experiments, RNA CUG repeats were not detected in any size exclusion fractions from control hearts. On the contrary, gel-shift analysis of fractions from DM tissue showed a remarkably different profile. We found that the majority of CUGBP1 is observed in high molecular weight fractions of DM extracts. Free CUGBP1 is detectable in low molecular weight fractions only after long exposure (data not shown). Slot hybridization of the DM fractions with the CAG8 probe revealed the presence of CUG repeat-containing RNAs that are colocalized with CUGBP1. The detection of CUG repeat-containing RNAs in DM cells and not in control cells is consistent with CUG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Under conditions of hybridization, short CUG repeats or interrupted CUG repeats are not detectable. Western analysis of size exclusion chromatography fractions confirmed that CUGBP1 is present in high molecular mass complexes in cardiac DM cells (Fig. 1 B). Reprobing the membranes with antibodies to α-actin showed a similar position of α-actin in fractions from DM and normal hearts, indicating that global differences in the fractionation procedure did not take place. It is necessary to note that the sensitivity of Western analysis after gel filtration was significantly reduced, and we were able to detect CUGBP1 only in fractions with higher amounts of the protein, whereas gel-shift detected CUGBP1 in several fractions. The above results show that the majority of CUGBP1 is associated with RNA in DM heart extracts, whereas in control samples, CUGBP1 is not bound to RNA. Furthermore, RNA·CUGBP1 complexes in DM extracts colocalized with CUG-containing RNAs. Under sensitivity of slot hybridization with the short CAG probe (24 nucleotides), normal DMPK transcripts with six CUG repeats were not detectable."
https://openalex.org/W2014957944,"Human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is one of three tissue-specific human APs extensively studied because of its ectopic expression in tumors. The crystal structure, determined at 1.8-Å resolution, reveals that during evolution, only the overall features of the enzyme have been conserved with respect toEscherichia coli. The surface is deeply mutated with 8% residues in common, and in the active site, only residues strictly necessary to perform the catalysis have been preserved. Additional structural elements aid an understanding of the allosteric property that is specific for the mammalian enzyme (Hoylaerts, M. F., Manes, T., and Millán, J. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22781–22787). Allostery is probably favored by the quality of the dimer interface, by a long N-terminal α-helix from one monomer that embraces the other one, and similarly by the exchange of a residue from one monomer in the active site of the other. In the neighborhood of the catalytic serine, the orientation of Glu-429, a residue unique to PLAP, and the presence of a hydrophobic pocket close to the phosphate product, account for the specific uncompetitive inhibition of PLAP by l-amino acids, consistent with the acquisition of substrate specificity. The location of the active site at the bottom of a large valley flanked by an interfacial crown-shaped domain and a domain containing an extra metal ion on the other side suggest that the substrate of PLAP could be a specific phosphorylated protein. Human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is one of three tissue-specific human APs extensively studied because of its ectopic expression in tumors. The crystal structure, determined at 1.8-Å resolution, reveals that during evolution, only the overall features of the enzyme have been conserved with respect toEscherichia coli. The surface is deeply mutated with 8% residues in common, and in the active site, only residues strictly necessary to perform the catalysis have been preserved. Additional structural elements aid an understanding of the allosteric property that is specific for the mammalian enzyme (Hoylaerts, M. F., Manes, T., and Millán, J. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22781–22787). Allostery is probably favored by the quality of the dimer interface, by a long N-terminal α-helix from one monomer that embraces the other one, and similarly by the exchange of a residue from one monomer in the active site of the other.

In man, three out of four AP isozymes are tissue-specific, one is placental (PLAP), the second is from germ cell (GCAP), and the third is intestinal. They are 90–98% homologous, and their genes are clustered on the same chromosome. The fourth (NSAP) is nonspecific and can be found in bone, liver, and kidney. It is about 50% identical with the other three, and its gene is located on another chromosome (1Millán J.L. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 995-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 2Millán J.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1992; 209: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Millán J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Like the other mammalian phosphatases, PLAP is post-translationally modified. This includes twoN-glycosylation sites and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor with which these APs are tethered to the membrane. The release of the enzyme may occur through the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Irrespective of whether they are of mammalian or bacterial origin, APs catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters (4Schwartz J.H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with release of inorganic phosphate and alcohol. PLAP has only low sequence identity with the Escherichia coli enzyme (30%), but residues involved in the active site of the enzyme (Ser-92, Asp-91, Arg-166) and the ligands coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium ion are conserved. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism, which was deduced from the structure of the E. coli AP (5Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), was proposed to be similar in eukaryotic APs. In E. coli, the mechanism involves the activation of the catalytic serine by a zinc atom, the formation of a covalent phosphoseryl intermediate, the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl by a water molecule activated by a second zinc atom, and the release of the phosphate product or its transfer to a phosphate acceptor (6Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). However, as judged from various studies using mammalian APs, PLAP presents novel catalytic characteristics. It is an allosteric enzyme (7Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and it is uncompetitively inhibited by somel-amino acids, namely l-Phe, l-Trp, and l-Leu (8Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe T. Wada N. Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. Yang Chou J. J. Biol.

The tissue specificity of the human enzymes has been correlated to an additional function (3Millán J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In NSAP, this specificity involves binding to collagen (11Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Lloys G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PLAP, evidence has accumulated over the past few years suggesting a role in cell division in both normal and transformed cells (13Chan J.R. Stinson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Telfer J.F. Green C.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15She Q. Mukherjee J.J.

Int. 2000; 63: 168-174Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This role probably occurs through its phosphatase activity against phosphorylated proteins (14Telfer J.F. Green C.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Butikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni G. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that PLAP may be involved in the transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus (18Makiya R. Stigbrand T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Makiya R. Stigbrand T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Stefaner I. Stefanescu A. Hunziker W. Fuchs R. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PLAP is one of the first proteins found to be ectopically expressed by cancer cells, leading to the concept that dysregulation of embryonic genes plays a significant role in the cancer process (21Fishman W.H. Inglis N.R. Stolbach L.L. Krant M.J. Cancer Res. 1968; 36: 935-938Google Scholar). During the last 30 years, many clinical reports have been published concerning PLAP and its use as a tumor marker. However, the results are often controversial, mainly because the assays cannot distinguish between the closely related tumor markers GCAP and PLAP (3Millán J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The problem of cross-reactivity in the assays reveals that there is a need to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of at least one human AP. PLAP is a good representative of all human APs because of the high sequence homology between these enzymes. The knowledge of its three-dimensional structure is crucial to elucidating the distinctive properties of eukaryotic APs, which cannot be predicted with confidence by analyzing the bacterial AP structure. These properties include the uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition, the allosteric property related to catalytic activity, and the elements related to tissue specificity. In addition, the location of the residues specific to PLAP may help in the design of new diagnostic tools to eliminate the cross-reactivity observed in the current ones. We present here the crystal structure of PLAP at 1.8-Å resolution and a number of structural elements that may explain the specific properties of PLAP and of other mammalian APs. PLAP was purified according to the method described by Holmgren et al. (22Holmgren P.A. Stigbrand T. Damber M.G. von Schoultz B. Obstet. Gynecol. 1979; 54: 631-634PubMed Google Scholar). The frozen placenta, SS homozygote phenotype, was slowly thawed and cleaned from blood and membranes and cut into pieces. Phosphate-buffered saline in the same amount as the weight of the pieces was added, and the mixture was homogenized. An equal volume of n-butanol was added, and PLAP was extracted by stirring for 30 min. After centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min, the upper butanol phase was removed, and the aqueous phase was heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C. After a similar centrifugation and filtration, acetone was added (the same volume as the aqueous phase), and the mixture was stored at −40 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 11000 × g for 40 min, the pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, by stirring and by dialyzing extensively against the same solution. The solution was then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex column and washed with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.0. PLAP was eluted with a gradient from Tris-buffered saline to Tris-buffered saline + 0.2 m NaCl; the A280 and the catalytic phosphatase activity were determined. The pooled active fractions were dialyzed against 0.1 m glycine and concentrated by DIAFLO ultrafiltration to 3 ml. This fraction was applied to a preparative isoelectric focusing column (Ampholytes pH 3–10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted 48 h later and assayed for catalytic activity. The active fractions were pooled and gel-filtered on a Sephadex G-200 column in Tris-buffered saline. The protein was concentrated to 10–16 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0, using an Amicon Centricon 30. Crystallization screening and growth of crystals were carried out using sitting drop vapor diffusion plates (23Stura E.A Ducruix A. Giegé R. Seeding Techniques in Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 177-206Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained from 12% polyethylene glycol 4,000, 2 mm zinc acetate (essential), 200 mm imidazole malate, pH 5.5–6.5. Other buffers such as acetate, citrate, and cacodylate gave similar results. Magnesium is not needed in the reservoir solution because 2 mm MgCl2 is present in the storage buffer. Large crystals were first grown in the presence of 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which is a substrate used in colorimetric reactions that is hydrolyzed by PLAP, the solution turning yellow on mixing with the protein solution. The solubility of the PLAP substrate/product complex increases with increasing concentrations ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate, whereas the addition of the product, phosphate, augments precipitation. Solubility variations are also observed from preparation to preparation, possibly reflecting variations in the amount and type of glycosylation. Higher solubility preparations correlate with poor quality crystals or difficulty in crystallization, suggesting that the presence of longer sugar chains hinders crystallization. PLAP (0.17 mm) andp-nitrophenyl phosphate (45 mm) were mixed in the volumetric ratio 4:1 before setting up the drops. The reservoir solution consisted of 14% polyethylene glycol 4,000 to 20% polyethylene glycol 3,350, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 2 mm zinc acetate, pH 6.5. The crystals grew as long needles with well defined pyramidal ends, 0.05 × 0.05 mm in cross-section, often as long as the whole length of the drop. Screening for cryo-protection conditions was carried out for crystals to be analyzed with synchrotron radiation. To make up the cryo-protectant, glycerol was added to the working solution with 0–15% xylitol. A few crystals were added to this solution. If the crystals dissolved, extra precipitant was added until the crystals were stable for a prolonged period of time (at least 20 min). Crystals were manipulated in the cryo-solution using loops. CryoLoops, mounting pins, and crystal caps were purchased from Hampton Research (Laguna Hills, Ca). Heavy atom soaking was carried out using 75–300 μl of soaking solutions in depression plates. A first crystal was shock-cooled at 80 K and used to collect a native data set at 1.9-Å resolution. After a short soaking (20 min) in a solution containing 3 mmp-chlormercuri benzene sulphonate (PCMBS) in cryo-solution, a second crystal was shock-cooled at 80 K. One set of data was collected at 1.7-Å resolution. Both data sets were collected at Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Elecrromagnetique, station D41, on a Mar Research image-plate area detector. Data processing and internal scaling were carried out with HKL (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table I). The space-group determination was performed using the autoindexation procedure as implemented in Denzo, and the enantiomer determination was performed by observation of the reflections extinction in the output file. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group C2221 with a = 88.8 Å, b = 114.5 Å, c = 106.9 Å. There is one monomer per asymmetric unit with a Vm of 2.74, corresponding to 50% solvent in the unit cell.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsData collectionDiffraction limit (Å)1.9 Å1.7 ÅResolution used (Å) (last shell)50.0-2.1 Å (2.22-2.13 Å)22.0-1.82 Å (1.87-1.82 Å)Number of reflections3015841585I/ς(I) (last shell)8.6 (2.8)8.5 (1.6)Completeness (last shell)90.0% (87.6%)79.6% (67.6%)Rsym (last shell)14.4% (59.1%)8.2% (48.8%)Molecular replacementResolution (Å)8.0-3.5 ÅR-factor (%) (2nd solution)50.2% (51.3%)Correlation factor (2nd solution)18.5% (14.5%)RefinementResolution (Å)22.0-1.82 ÅR-factor (%)18.5%R-free (%)24.2%Metal peak height (B-factor after refinement)Zn133 ς32 ς (20.1 Å2)Zn234 ς30 ς (19.2 Å2)Mg319 ς28 ς (14.5 Å2)X418 ς24 ς (15.7 Å2) Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the program AMoRe (25Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and the coordinates of one monomer of the wild type E. coli alkaline phosphatase (ECAP) (entry code 1alk) (5Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and the native data set. The best solution obtained was in the resolution shell of 8.0 to 3.5 Å, with a weak correlation coefficient (18.1) and a poor contrast between the first and second solution (Table I). However, when applying the rotation matrix and translation to the coordinates file, we observed that the dimer was recreated along a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which validated this solution as the correct one. The re-building of the model was limited by the low phasing power of the ECAP model due to the low (30%) sequence identity between the two APs. Standard sequence alignment programs gave misleading results and uninterpretable maps. The method of hydrophobic cluster analysis as coded in the program HCA (26Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) was applied to both ECAP and PLAP sequences. The subsequent hydrophobic patch alignment resulted in a corrected sequence alignment between the two. The starting model contained most of the ECAP main chain without loops or insertions, leaving only the side chains for the conserved residues. The program WARP version 5.0 plus the routine Side Dock, kindly provided by A. Perrakis (27Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), was crucial in the rebuilding of the model as well as the data set collected at 1.7-Å resolution. The final PLAP model could then be re-built rapidly. In the active site, the peak height in the Fo −Fc map calculated from the native date set allowed us to unambiguously model a zinc at M1 and M2 and a magnesium at the M3 position, as in the E. coli structure. The peak height in the Fo − Fc map calculated from the PCMBS data was high at M3, but the geometry was in agreement with a magnesium. In addition, after refinement with a magnesium at M3, the B-factor of this atom was equivalent to those of its ligands, and no residual density was observed in the finalFo − Fc map. The statistics of the final model as given by XPLOR (36Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, USA1992Google Scholar) are summarized in TableI. PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to analyze the structure geometry. The three-dimensional structures of PLAP and ECAP were superimposed with the iterative program ALIGN (29Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited to the PDB at Brookhaven (entry code 1EW2). The overall structure of PLAP is a dimer; each monomer contains 479 residues, 4 metal atoms, 1 phosphate ion, and 603 water molecules. The two monomers are related by a 2-fold crystallographic axis. The surface of PLAP is poorly conserved with that of the E. coli enzyme, with only 8% residues in common, although the core is preserved. PLAP possesses additional secondary structure elements comprising an N-terminal α-helix (residues 9–25), forming an arm that embraces the other monomer; an α-helix and a β-strand in a highly divergent region (residues 208–280) and a different organization of the small β-sheet in domain 365–430. PLAP has two glycosylation sites at Asn-122 and Asn-249 that vary in their degree of glycosylation depending of the placental sample (Fig. 1). Two disulfide bridges are located at different positions from those in the E. colienzyme. One is close to the first glycosylation site and may rigidify the loop that carries the carbohydrate chain. The other is located near to Asp-481, where the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor is attached, and may stabilize the orientation of PLAP relative to the membrane. In the active site, only the residues that are essential to the catalysis are preserved, i.e. the catalytic serine, the three metal ion sites (Zn1, Zn2, and Mg3) and their ligands, whereas most of the surrounding residues are different (Fig.2). The upper part of the active site contains a large number of basic residues, and the lower part contains mainly aliphatic or hydrophobic residues. Among these hydrophobic residues, we observe Tyr-367, which belongs to the second monomer. The consequences of such a pattern of residues are typical for mammalian APs and will be discussed below.Figure 2Active site of PLAP. A Corey-Pauling-Koltun representation of the active site pocket of PLAP is shown. The residues conserved with ECAP are represented inwhite. The substituted residues are colored according to the residue type, Phe, Trp, and Tyr are violet; Asn, Cys, Gln, Met, Ser, and Thr are green; Arg, His, and Lys areblue; Asp and Glu are red; Ala, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, and Val are yellow. Residues from the second monomer are pink. This figure was made with TURBO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Half of the enzyme surface corresponds to three clearly identifiable regions whose sequences largely vary among human APs and are lacking in nonmammalian enzymes (Fig. 3). The first is the long N-terminal α-helix described above. The second, an interfacial “crown domain,” is formed by the insertion of a 60-residue segment (366) from each monomer. It consists of two small interacting β-sheets, each composed of three parallel strands and surrounded by six large and flexible loops containing a short α-helix. Third, a “metal binding domain,” comprised of 76 residues (209) and folded into two β-strands flanked by two α-helices. It includes the glycosylation site at Asn-249, stabilized by a stacking interaction with Trp-248, and an additional metal ion. In the Fo − Fc map, calculated from the native data set, the peak for this metal corresponds to about 10 electrons. Its height and the crystallization conditions suggest the presence of a magnesium, but its coordination by carboxylates from Glu-216, Glu-270, and Asp-285 by Phe-269-CO and a water molecule is also in agreement with a calcium ion (30Mac Phalen C.A. Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 77-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 c). The crown domain and the metal binding domain correspond to novel folds, since a search for other structurally related domains using the program DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) yielded no significant matches. One important property that differentiates mammalian APs from their bacterial counterpart is the allostery observed when the enzyme is fully metalized. Mutagenesis studies reveal that stability and catalytic properties of each monomer are controlled by the conformation of the second AP subunit (7Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The principle of allostery implies that the binding of the substrate in one active site will affect the second binding site. The crystal form studied here requires the presence of the substratep-nitrophenyl phosphate to grow. Therefore, the protein structure described corresponds to a conformation of the enzyme activated by substrate. A second item to consider is the hydrophobic character of the dimer interface of PLAP. Less than 30% of the residues are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions, which confer flexibility on the interface. The surface buried in the dimer interface is slightly larger in PLAP (4150 Å2) than in ECAP (3900 Å2). However, the residues involved in dimerization are mainly different, as is the nature of the interface. In ECAP, 36 out of 82 total residues at the dimer interface are involved in hydrogen bonds, whereas in PLAP only 24 out of 83 residues are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions, and only 9 of these are conserved between the two. It could be speculated that in PLAP many hydrogen bond interactions have been replaced by less specific van der Waals contacts, which are more likely to allow rearrangement of the two monomers. Biochemical studies performed on PLAP showed that residues Asn-84, Tyr-367, and Glu-429 are involved in the allostery (7Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our structure brings additional information concerning the precise role of these residues. First, Asn-84 is located at the dimer interface with its δ oxygen within hydrogen-bonding distance of Asp91-N (3.2 Å) and probably intervenes through this residue in the stabilization of the catalytic Ser-92. On the same loop, Val-85 and Asp-86 interact with Ala-1 and Ile-2 from the other monomer, and Lys-87 interacts with Leu-369 and Tyr-367, also from the other monomer. Therefore, Asn-84 may affect the enzyme activity through its interaction with Asp-91 and may intervene in the allostery process because of its involvement in the dimerization (Fig. 4). Second, Tyr-367 is located at the entrance of the active site of the second monomer. Its hydroxyl is located 6.1 Å from the phosphate and 3.1 Å from His-432, which in turn chelates the zinc atom Zn1. The network consisting of Tyr-367 (monomer1)-His-432 (monomer2)-Zn1 (monomer2)-PO4(monomer2) might affect the step of phosphoseryl hydrolysis by modulating the reactivity of Zn1 (Fig. 4). The presence in the active site of a residue from the second monomer and its probable involvement in the enzyme reactivity is a new structural feature that could not have been postulated from the ECAP structure, as the loop containing residues 366 to 375 in PLAP is an insertion with respect to ECAP. In their study, Hoylaerts et al. (7) report that the mutation E429G affects the affinity of Zn1 for PLAP (7Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Glu-429 is solvent-accessible and located at the entrance of the cleft, which leads to the active site where the Oε1 oxygen interacts with the Nδ nitrogen of His-320 (distance = 3.4Å). In turn, His-320-Nε interacts with Zn1 (distance = 2.4 Å). Therefore, the network consisting of Glu-429-His-320-Zn1-PO4 might also affect the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl moiety through the destabilization of Zn1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, Glu-429 may not be directly involved in the allostery process but probably affects the activity and the metals in the enzyme. Finally, the N-terminal α-helix described above is removed from the rest of its own monomer, but it interacts with the second monomer with a buried surface area of 555 Å2, suggesting an involvement in enzyme dimerization. Residues of the N-terminal extremity interact with Arg-370 from loop 366–375 and with Asn-106 and Arg-117 from the second monomer. Therefore, the interaction of the N-terminal α-helix with the second monomer may help stabilize Tyr-367 and, therefore, affect the enzymatic activity (Fig. 4). A second kinetic property of human APs, not shared by their bacterial ancestors, is that they are stereospecifically inhibited by l-amino acids through an uncompetitive mechanism. This type of rare inhibition implies that the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone. In the case of a two-step mechanism like that of PLAP, the complex can be the initial enzyme-substrate or any of the intermediate complexes. Previous studies on PLAP have shown that the molecular mechanism of this inhibition involves Arg-166 and Glu-429 and suggests the presence of a hydrophobic pocket in the active site. Glu-429 is of particular importance as it is the only active site residue specific to PLAP. The corresponding residue is a serine in intestinal AP, a glycine in GCAP, and a histidine in NSAP (8Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe T. Wada N. Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. Yang Chou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21174-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structure confirms the involvement of Arg-166 and Glu-429 and also allows precise description of the hydrophobic pocket, which probably stabilizes the hydrophobic moiety of the inhibitor. Located at the entrance of the cleft, which leads to the active site, Glu-429 borders a pocket that extends from the catalytic Ser-92 to the phosphate product. Arg-166 is found at the edge of a second pocket around the active site, also bordered by Phe-107, Gln-108, and Tyr-367 from the second monomer (Fig. 2). In Fig. 5, we have modeled the inhibition of PLAP by a l-Phe amino acid. This model shows that the geometry of Glu-429, Arg-166, and the hydrophobic pocket is ideal to fit an l-amino acid such asl-Phe. The hydrophobic moiety of the ligand would be stabilized in the hydrophobic pocket, its carboxyl group by Arg-166 and its amide group by Glu-429. This topology matches both the stereo-specificity and uncompetitive character of the inhibition. The knowledge of the structural organization of these pockets offers a molecular basis for the design of more specific inhibitors, which may be useful in drug therapy when involvement of PLAP in tumor growth is confirmed. Our study of the complexes of PLAP and l-amino acids should further clarify the role of these two pockets and the mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition. Although the target of each human AP remains unknown, the tissue specificity strongly suggests an adaptation for these enzymes toward specific proteins. For example, loop 400–430 of NSAP is directly involved in the binding of collagen (12Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the case of PLAP is more controversial, our structural data allow us to speculate that the enzyme may have a specific target, whereas the bacterial enzyme has none. First of all, in the active site itself, there are two pockets that may accommodate residues from the target protein. Should such a protein bind at this position, Glu-429 would be ideally positioned to stabilize the ester moiety of the substrate in the initial step of the catalytic process. This residue is probably a key determinant for substrate selection. In addition, the hydrophobic pocket extends on one side of the active site into a large surface of about 1700 Å2, which with the exception of Asp-173, comprises only neutral or hydrophobic residues from both monomers. The size and character of this region is similar to that typically observed in protein-protein interactions (32Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar), and it would be an ideal location to stabilize a protein substrate. As we move away from the core of the active site, we notice a large valley with an accessible surface of 4000 Å2, flanked on each side by the crown and metal binding domains (Fig. 3). The bottom of this valley is also lined by the loop containing residues 270–285 from the metal binding domain. This loop interacts with and may be stabilized by the putative calcium ion. It could therefore be responsible for the synergism observed between calcium and PLAP activity by intervening in substrate binding (15She Q. Mukherjee J.J. Huang J. Crilly K.S. Kiss Z. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In summary, the organization of the extended active site would be consistent with PLAP interacting with a large substrate. Such a substrate is likely to be a phosphorylated protein. An important issue in the use of PLAP as a cancer marker is the assessment of the potential to differentiate it from the other human alkaline phosphatases present in serum. All mammalian APs have closely related sequences, conserving all the three specific elements: the four cysteines involved in the disulfide bridges, the glycosylation sites, and the residues that coordinate the fourth metal ion. Hence, it is likely that the same ion and glycosylation sites are present in all APs. The core is thus largely preserved, and the divergence between the four proteins is concentrated in the elements of specificity. PLAP and GCAP are the closest 2, with only 10 substitutions between them (33Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Eight of these positions have sufficient solvent exposure to differentiate between the surfaces of these two enzymes (Fig.6). There are 58 substitutions between PLAP and intestinal AP, corresponding to about 12% of all residues (Fig. 6). Half of these are situated on the specific elements that encompass less than one-third of the protein residues. The greatest diversity exists between PLAP and NSAP, with 209 substitutions (Fig.6). 56% of the 161 residues in the specific elements are substituted in NSAP, consistent with their involvement in the mediation of specificity and modulation of activity. Finally, three epitopic surfaces distinguish PLAP from the other APs. One corresponds to the active site pocket in proximity to Glu-429, the second corresponds to the metal-binding site, and the third corresponds to the region comprising Glu-15 and Ile-67 (Fig. 6). The structure of human PLAP, the first structure of a eukaryotic example of this family of enzymes, gives some hints regarding the evolution of this enzyme. Compared with the bacterial homologues, the catalytic requirement has helped the preservation of the overall core of the enzyme, the main secondary structure, and the residues necessary for the catalysis. However, the development of a placenta in mammals has been accompanied by the emergence of tissue specificity and the coadaptation of the enzyme to a specific protein target. The acquisition of allostery and the uncompetitive inhibition imply that this enzyme can be regulated in vivo. These new properties have led to extensive structural modification both in the active site and at the enzyme surface, in agreement with the hypothesis that the target of PLAP may be a phosphorylated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1969171000,"Cadherins are single pass transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca2+-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion by linking the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. In adherens junctions, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins bind to β-catenin, which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein α-catenin. The physical properties of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and its interactions with β-catenin have been investigated. Proteolytic sensitivity, tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and 1H NMR measurements indicate that murine E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured. Upon binding to β-catenin, the domain becomes resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that it structures upon binding. Cadherin-β-catenin complex stability is modestly dependent on ionic strength, indicating that, contrary to previous proposals, the interaction is not dominated by electrostatics. Comparison of 18 cadherin sequences indicates that their cytoplasmic domains are unlikely to be structured in isolation. This analysis also reveals the presence of PEST sequences, motifs associated with ubiquitin/proteosome degradation, that overlap the previously identified β-catenin-binding site. It is proposed that binding of cadherins to β-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.

It is proposed that binding of cadherins to β-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion. The formation and maintenance of solid tissues depends upon specific and regulated intercellular adhesion (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell.. 1996; 84: 345-357Google Scholar). Cadherins are single pass transmembrane adhesion proteins that link the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells in two kinds of intercellular junctions: the adherens junction and the desmosome. These structures play a critical role in tissue development, including cell segregation, condensation, polarization, and differentiation. Cadherin-mediated linkage of cytoskeletal networks imparts resistance to mechanical stress and enables concerted motions required by morphogenic processes. Defects in cadherin-mediated adhesion are associated with several characteristics of malignant transformation, such as dedifferentiation, high mobility, and invasive growth (2Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol... 1989; 108: 2435-2447Google Scholar, 3Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. Van, R.oy F. Cell.. 1991; 66: 107-119Google Scholar). Adherens junctions are sites of cell-cell contact that link the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells (4Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 1997; 13: 119-146Google Scholar). Cadherin extracellular domains on opposing membranes mediate specific Ca2+- dependent, homotypic interactions. The cytoplasmic domains bind to β-catenin, which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein α-catenin (4Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 1997; 13: 119-146Google Scholar, 5Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J... 1989; 8: 1711-1717Google Scholar). An analogous adhesion system exists in Drosophila, with armadillo and DE-cadherin the orthologues of β-catenin and E-cadherin, respectively (6Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol... 1994; 165: 716-726Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis studies have mapped the regions of E-cadherin and β-catenin required for association. The C-terminal 72 residues of E-cadherin are necessary and sufficient for β-catenin binding (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1990; 87: 4246-4250Google Scholar), and a 30-amino acid stretch within this region has been proposed to be the “core” β-catenin binding sequence (8Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhesion Commun... 1994; 2: 319-327Google Scholar). The primary structure of β-catenin consists of an N-terminal region of 140 amino acids, followed by a 524-residue domain that contains 12 repeats of 42 amino acids known as armadillo (arm) repeats (9Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell.. 1994; 76: 789-791Google Scholar) and a 119-residue C-terminal tail. The arm repeat domain is required for association with cadherins (10Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci... 1994; 107: 3655-3663Google Scholar, 11Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 2061-2069Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the arm repeat domain showed that each arm repeat comprises three helices, with the repeats packing to form a superhelix of helices (12Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell.. 1997; 90: 871-882Google Scholar). The superhelix features a shallow groove with a positively charged surface potential. The core β-catenin-binding region of E-cadherin, which has a calculated pI of 3.3, was proposed to bind within the positively charged groove presented by the β-catenin armadillo domain (12Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell.. 1997; 90: 871-882Google Scholar). Several mechanisms appear to modulate cadherin-based adhesion. Cadherins associate with β-catenin shortly after biosynthesis, while still in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the two proteins move together to the cell surface, where they associate with α-catenin (13Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 125: 1327-1340Google Scholar). Failure of cadherins to associate with β-catenin leads to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and degradation of cadherin (14Chen Y.-T. Stewart D.B. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 144: 687-699Google Scholar). Adherens junction formation is also affected by phosphorylation (15Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 148: 399-403Google Scholar, 16Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5090-5095Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of serines in the the cadherin cytoplasmic tail by casein kinase II and glycogen synthase kinase-3β kinases increases the affinity of cadherin for β-catenin (16Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 5090-5095Google Scholar). Moreover, adherens junctions are enriched in protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, some of which bind the cadherin-catenin complex directly (17Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 1375-1380Google Scholar, 18Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol... 1995; 130: 977-986Google Scholar, 19Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J.

Cell Biol... 1998; 141: 779-789Google Scholar, 26Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 21409-21415Google Scholar). β-Catenin also plays a central role in the Wnt/Wg growth factor signaling pathway that controls cell fate determination during embryogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 27Polakis P. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 1837-1851Google Scholar). In this role β-catenin acts as a transcriptional coactivator when bound to members of the lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (Lef/Tcf) transcription factor family (28Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature.. 1996; 382: 638-642Google Scholar, 29van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Booijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell.. 1997; 88: 789-799Google Scholar). Wnt signaling activates transcription by blocking or slowing the normally rapid turnover of β-catenin, thereby elevating cytosolic levels of β-catenin and promoting formation of an active β-catenin-transcription factor complex (27Polakis P. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 1837-1851Google Scholar). The cytosolic concentration of β-catenin is normally maintained below the signaling threshold by a multi-protein complex that targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This protein complex contains APC, the product of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β, and Axin. The β-catenin binding sequences in LEF-1 and APC are largely electronegative, and recent mutagenesis studies have indicated that they bind within the positively charged groove formed by the armadillo repeat region of β-catenin (30von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Ashbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 800-807Google Scholar). It is known that cadherin, APC, and LEF-1 compete for binding to the arm repeat domain of β-catenin (11Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 2061-2069Google Scholar, 30von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Ashbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 800-807Google Scholar), and it is likely that all three ligands bind to overlapping portions of the positively charged groove. Thus, depending on which ligand is bound, β-catenin can have one of several distinct fates: adhesion complex component, transcriptional coactivator, or substrate for proteasomal degradation. As a first step toward understanding the cadherin-β-catenin interaction, we have used a variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques to characterize the cadherin cytoplasmic tail in the absence and presence of β-catenin. Our analysis shows that the cadherin cytoplasmic tail is unstructured in isolation but appears to become structured upon binding to β-catenin. Comparison of a variety of cadherin sequences reveals the presence of sequence motifs associated with proteosomal degradation. It is proposed that these properties are associated with the regulation of cadherin turnover and cellular adhesiveness. Murine β-catenin and the cytoplasmic domain of murine E-cadherin (Ecyto, Arg580–Asp728)1and Drosophila DE-cadherin (DEcyto, Gln1350–Ile1507) were expressed inEscherichia coli as C-terminal fusions to glutathioneS-transferase (GST). Expression constructs were designed to leave a minimal number of additional residues (Gly-Ser-Pro for β-catenin and Gly-Ser for the cadherins) at the N termini after cleavage of the GST fusion. No additional residues were added to the C termini. The bacterially expressed, recombinant cadherin cytoplasmic domains are designated rEcyto or rDEcyto. β-Catenin cDNA in pBluescript SKII+ (31Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Science.. 1992; 257: 4-1142Google Scholar) was digested withNdeI, and the resulting overhangs were filled with DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment. Further digestion withSalI yielded the desired insert, which was ligated intoSmaI-SalI-digested pGEX-KG (32Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem... 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a Drosophila head λZAP® II cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers 5′-GCGCCCGGATCCCAGAAGAAGCAGAAGAAT-3′ and 5′-GCGCCCGATTTCTTTAGATGCGCCAGCCCTGGTC-3′. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated intoEcoRI-BamHI-digested pGEX-KG. The identity of the polymerase chain reaction product was verified by DNA sequencing and its ability to specifically bind armadillo and β-catenin (data not shown). The GST-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain fusion construct has already been described (33Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 123: 149-164Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown in Super Broth, induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction, and the cell paste was stored at −70 °C. Thawed cell paste was treated with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 4 mg/ml pepstatin-A) and deoxyribonuclease I, and the cells were lysed in a French pressure cell. Fusion proteins were batch affinity purified from lysates with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). GST-β-catenin fusion protein was obtained by eluting the protein with a buffer containing 50 mm reduced glutathione. E- and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains and β-catenin were obtained by cleaving the glutathione-agarose-bound fusion proteins with bovine thrombin (Sigma). Thrombin can cleave β-catenin internally at Arg90 or Arg95. Thus, digestion of the GST-β-catenin fusion yields full-length β-catenin and two other major species. These fragments, which differ only at their N termini, copurify and are collectively named β76. Anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography were used to purify all protein products to near homogeneity. Mixtures of rEcyto or rDEcyto and various β-catenin constructs were incubated for more than 1 h at 4 °C and injected onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 10/30 Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mmDTT. MDCK cells (type II J) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody for the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain was described previously (33Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 123: 149-164Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies for E-cadherin and β-catenin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-E-cadherin and preimmune sera were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose. In each case, a ratio of 10 ml of serum to 75 ml of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose was washed with 0.2 m borate, pH 9.0, and the antibodies were cross-linked to the protein A with dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce). Cell extracts were prepared by washing 2 × 107 plated MDCK cells with ice-cold Tris-saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl) and scraping the cells in 2 ml of DTEB (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 mg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin-A, chymostatin, and antipain). Insoluble material was removed with a 10-min incubation on ice followed by centrifugation at 20,800 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was “precleared” by incubating it with immobilized preimmune serum for 45 min at 4 °C, centrifuging it for an additional 5 min at 20,800 ×g, and taking the new supernatant. Precleared extract supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with Sepharose-immobilized polyclonal E-cadherin antibody. Postincubation Sepharose was washed once with DTEB and twice with NaCl-supplemented DTEB. All washes were for 10 min at 4 °C and 10 different NaCl concentrations were used. Sepharose beads were resuspended in DTEB, centrifuged through a 1 m sucrose pad, washed with additional DTEB, and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. After separation on 6.5% SDS-PAGE gels, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) and detected with murine monoclonal primary antibodies specific for E-cadherin and β-catenin and 0.1 mCi/ml125I-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA). Immunoblots were exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak Co.) and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 PhosphorImager system. To compare the behavior of recombinant β-catenin-E-cadherin complexes with that of endogenous complex, 1:1 stoichiometric mixtures of the recombinant proteins were incubated on ice for 16 h and mock precleared as described above. Immunoprecipitations and washes were carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and processed for immunoblotting and quantitation as described above. Tryptophan fluorescence emission and anisotropy experiments utilized an SLM 8000 C spectrofluorometer, featuring a T-format optical pathway and double and single grating excitation and emission monochromators, respectively. Data were taken at room temperature from continuously stirred samples. A 290 nm (8 nm bandpass) excitation wavelength was used for all experiments. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm using a 4-nm emission bandpass and a 2.0-nm wavelength increment with a 1-s integration period. Tryptophan (12 mm), β76 (1 mm), and E- and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail (12 mm) samples were prepared using low ionic strength buffers (10–100 mmTris-HCl or HEPES, pH 7.0–8.5, 20 mm NaCl) with 1 mm DTT or 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol present for β76 and DE-cadherin. E-cadherin emission spectra were also measured under denaturing conditions (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 6m guanidine HCl). Two-channel anisotropy data were collected using the “single point polarization” option and Schott WG-335 long pass filters instead of emission monochromators. Data were collected under native conditions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) for E-cadherin (12 mm) and DE-cadherin (6, 3, or1.5 mm) cytoplasmic tails, β76 (2 mm), β-catenin (3.5 mm), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 3 mm), and tryptophan (12 or 14 mm). Data were also collected under denaturing conditions (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 6m guanidine HCl, and 1 mm DTT) for E- and DE- (6 mm) cadherin cytoplasmic tails, β76, BSA, and tryptophan. Circular dichroism data were measured using an Aviv 60DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit (Hewlett-Packard 89100A). The spectropolarimeter was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid and a 1-mm path length was used for all experiments. Spectra of E- and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains were measured in 10 mmphosphate, pH 7, at 0 °C. These spectra were measured in two parts, with 25 and 10 μm samples being used for 280–205- and 220–186-nm wavelength ranges, respectively. The two halves of each spectrum were scaled using the known sample concentrations. NMR spectra were acquired using a General Electric GN-Omega instrument operating at 500 MHz and a 680 μm sample of E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 0.35 mm trimethyl silyl propionate, and 50% D2O. Presaturation was used to suppress the H2O peak, and trimethyl silyl propionate was employed as the chemical shift standard. The sample was shimmed briefly before acquisition of one-dimensional1H NMR spectra of 256 scans each (4096 real points; spectral width, 7000 Hz) at 50, 25, and 3 °C. NMR data were processed using Felix, version 2.30, from Biosym Technologies (San Diego, CA). The free induction decay was processed conservatively by Fourier transformation without premultiplication. Following phasing, the base lines were corrected by fitting to a zero order polynomial function. GST-β-catenin fusion protein and glutathione-agarose were mixed for 45 min at room temperature in a binding buffer comprising 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm DTT, and either 100, 200, or 400 mm NaCl. Poly-l-glutamate (P1818 or P4636, with average molecular masses of roughly 1,000 and 11,000 Da, Sigma) was then added, and the mixtures were incubated an additional 45 min. E-cadherin was added, and after another 45-min incubation, the agarose beads were spun down, washed three times with the appropriate binding buffer, and boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In each case, after the addition of E-cadherin, the incubation mixture was 3 μm in GST-β-catenin, 3 μm in E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, and 0, 3, 9, or 27 mm in poly-l-glutamate. Different E-cadherin and poly-l-glutamate stocks were made using the appropriate binding buffers. Approximately 25 μm recombinant E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (rEcyto) alone or mixed in 1:1 stoichiometric amounts with either full-length β-catenin or the armadillo repeat region (β59) (12Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell.. 1997; 90: 871-882Google Scholar) was subjected to limited proteolysis with subtilisin. A control mixture containing 25 μm rEcyto and 30 μm bovine serum albumin was also digested. Mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and digested for 20 min at room temperature with subtilisin concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 1.3 μg/ml. Digestions were carried out in a buffered solution comprising 100 mm CHES, pH 9.2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm DTT. This pH is suboptimal for subtilisin but is required for β59 solubility. In separate experiments, rEcyto-β-catenin complex was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C using concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 27 μg/ml; these reactions were carried out in 50–100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm DTT. rDEcyto-β-catenin complex was also digested with subtilisin as described for rEcyto. Subtilisin digestions were stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 8 mm, and endoproteinase Glu-C digestions were stopped by boiling. Cytoplasmic tail sequences from 18 different vertebrate subtypes of classical/type I and atypical/type II cadherins were analyzed. These sequences are mostly of human origin and represent 6 type I cadherins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, P-cadherin, R-cadherin, M-cadherin, and Xenopus laevis EP-cadherin; GenBankTM accession numbers Z13009, M34064, X63629, L34059,D83542, and U04707, respectively) and 12 type II cadherins (cadherin-5, cadherin-6, cadherin-7, cadherin-8, cadherin-9, cadherin-10, cadherin-11, cadherin-12, cadherin-18, cadherin-19, cadherin-20, andRattus norvegicus PB-cadherin; GenBankTMaccession numbers X79981, D31784, AJ007611, L34060, AB035302, AF039747,L34056, L34057, U59325, AJ007607, AF217289, and D83348, respectively) as described in a recent phylogenetic analysis of the cadherin superfamily (34Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 299: 72-551Google Scholar). The PEST-FIND program (35Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar) was used with a sequence window of 10 as implemented at EMBnet Austria. Aliphatic and instability indices were calculated using the ProtParam tool at the ExPASy proteomics server. An “aspartic acid index,” which compares the normalized change in total aspartic acid content relative to total glutamic acid content, is defined as 1.207 (%Asp/%Glu) where 1.207 is the ratio of the compositional percentage for Glu (numerator) and Asp as found in SWISS-PROT Release 38.0 and %Asp and %Glu represent the compositional percentages found in a given cadherin cytoplasmic tail. Fluorescence, circular dichroism, and proton NMR were used to characterize the folded state of recombinant E-cadherin and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains (rEcyto and rDEcyto respectively). Ecyto contains a single tryptophan that is located near the C terminus of the protein. DEcyto has two tryptophans that are near the N and C termini, the latter in a position distinct from the tryptophan in Ecyto. In a folded protein, the tryptophan indole ring is frequently buried within a hydrophobic core or is otherwise shielded from solvent, resulting in a blue shift of the fluorescence maximum relative to free tryptophan (36Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1989; Google Scholar). The tryptophan emission maximum for β76, a thrombin-generated fragment of β-catenin (see “Experimental Procedures”), is significantly blue-shifted relative to tryptophan alone, whereas the maxima for Ecyto and DEcyto are not (Table I). Thus, the single Ecyto tryptophan and two DEcyto tryptophans appear to be solvent exposed.Table ITryptophan fluorescence dataProtein SampleFluorescence maximum 1-aFluorescence maximum was between 300 and 420 nm.rAloneWith 6 m guanidine HClnmE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain3500.026 ± 0.001 (3)0.031 ± 0.003 (6)DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain3480.025 ± 0.002 (2)0.029 ± 0.001 (2)β-Catenin fragment (β76)3380.095 ± 0.011 (4)0.033 ± 0.003 (4)Full-length β-catenin (β97)ND0.089 ± 0.008 (2)NDTryptophan3540.003 ± 0.001 (4)0.007 ± 0.002 (3)Bovine serum albuminND0.080 ± 0.006 (6)0.036 (1)ND, not determined.Anisotropy (r) is defined as (I par −I per)/(I par + 2I per), where I par is the intensity of emitted light with the same orientation as the vertically polarized incident light, and I per is the intensity of emitted light with an orientation perpendicular to the incident light.

Anisotropy (r) is defined as (I par −I per)/(I par + 2I per), where I par is the intensity of emitted light with the same orientation as the vertically polarized incident light, and I per is the intensity of emitted light with an orientation perpendicular to the incident light. Each measurement represents the mean anisotropy value derived from eight measurements of a given sample. The standard deviation for a given measurement was typically 0.001–0.002. The number of independent measurements for each sample is given in parentheses. Folded and denatured proteins commonly display significantly different fluorescence anisotropy values because of the loss of rotational freedom that occurs when a tryptophan indole ring is buried in a hydrophobic core. β-Catenin and BSA yield anisotropy values of ∼0.085 when folded and ∼0.035 when denatured with 6 mguanidine HCl (Table I). In contrast, recombinant E- and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains have anisotropy values comparable with those observed with denatured proteins, and these values do not change significantly when the cadherins are subjected to denaturants (TableI). The fluoresence anisotropy data suggest that the Ecyto and DEcyto domains are unfolded under native conditions. However, regions of a folded protein that lack structure, such as large loops or unstructured N and C termini, might give similar results. CD spectroscopy was therefore used to probe for the presence regular protein secondary structure. The spectra measured for rEcyto and rDEcyto at 0 °C are essentially identical and feature a single minimum in mean residue ellipticity at ∼202 nm (Fig. 1). This spectrum indicates a lack of secondary structure, which would be expected of an unstructured polypeptide (37Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry.. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Google Scholar, 38Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol... 1980; 138: 149-178Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility that the cytoplasmic tail has a defined conformation without regular secondary structure, one-dimensional1H NMR spectra were measured at 3, 25, and 50 °C (Fig.2). At 50 °C, peaks with the chemical shift values of random coil peptides (39Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids.John Wiley & Sons. 1986; Google Scholar) are observed at 0.95 ppm (δ and γ protons of Ile, Leu, and Val), 2.10 ppm (ε protons of Met), and 6.81 ppm (Tyr ring protons). Resolved peak doublets at 7.47 and 7.58 ppm are consistent with exposed C7 and C4 Trp protons, as one would find in an unfolded protein. A broad, very low shoulder between 8 and 9 ppm suggests that amide protons are unprotected and in rapid exchange with solvent protons and deuterons. These data indicate that rEcyto is unfolded at 50 °C. Spectra recorded at 25 and 3 °C are similar to that of the 50 °C spectrum (Fig. 2). However, amide proton peaks appear at 25 °C and become more prominent at 3 °C, with a single small alkyl peak becoming resolved at 0.70 ppm. The appearance of amide proton peaks may result from secondary structure formation, or from a lower rate of solvent exchange res"

VR1 was C-terminally tagged with either the 27-kDa enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or a 12-amino acid ε-epitope. Upon exposure to resiniferatoxin, VR1eGFP- or VR1ε-expressing cells exhibited pharmacological responses similar to those of cells expressing the untagged VR1. Within seconds of vanilloid exposure, the intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) was elevated in cells expressing VR1. A functional pool of VR1 also was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum that, in the absence of extracellular calcium, also was capable of releasing calcium upon agonist treatment. Confocal imaging disclosed that resiniferatoxin treatment induced vesiculation of the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (∼1 min), nuclear membrane disruption (5–10 min), and cell lysis (1–2 h). Nociceptive primary sensory neurons endogenously express VR1, and resiniferatoxin treatment induced a sudden increase in [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial disruption which was cell-selective, as glia and non-VR1-expressing neurons were unaffected. Early hallmarks of cytotoxicity were followed by specific deletion of VR1-expressing cells. These data demonstrate that vanilloids disrupt vital organelles within the cell body and, if administered to sensory ganglia, may be employed to rapidly and selectively delete nociceptive neurons.

Similarly, resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultrapotent capsaicin analogue, can deplete [3H]RTX-binding sites from the brain stem, the sensory ganglia (dorsal root and trigeminal), and the spinal cord with a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated (3Szallasi A.

Both systemic and epidural administration of RTX to adult rats produce analgesia to subsequent noxious thermal stimulation (5Szabo T. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. 1999; 840: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Depending on concentration, duration of exposure, and route of administration, vanilloid ligands may either desensitize the nociceptive primary afferent nerve ending or completely delete the neuron itself (6Yaksh T.L. Farb D.H. Leeman S.E. Jessell T.M. Science. 1979; 206: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Winter J. Dray A. Wood J.N. Yeats J.C. Bevan S.

Previous studies investigating the processes of desensitization and cell loss mainly examined whole animals or primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia, where nociceptive neuronal cell bodies are located. The cloning of the first isotype of the vanilloid receptor (VR1) provides a means to investigate more fully the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of pain signal transduction and the processes underlying susceptibility of VR1-expressing cells to impairment upon exposure to vanilloid agonists (9Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). The VR1 has been characterized as a Ca2+ ionophore (9Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

The VR1 exhibits homology to Ca2+store-dependent TRP channels. In contrast to TRPs, which regulate intracellular calcium stores, VR1 confers two pivotal sensory functions. VR1 transduces chemical (vanilloids and pH) and physical (heat) stimuli at the molecular level, generating action potentials in nociceptive nerve endings, and ultimately leading to sensations of heat, thermal pain, and inflammatory pain (10Tominaga M.

Immunocytochemistry demonstrates VR1 throughout the peripheral endings, cell body, and presynaptic terminals of small size dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (10Tominaga M. Caterina M.J.

These sites coincide well with regional localization of [3H]RTX binding (3Szallasi A. Nilsson S. Farkas-Szallasi T. Blumberg P.M. Hokfelt T. Lundberg J.M. Brain Res. 1995; 703: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Farkas-Szallasi T. Bennett G.J. Blumberg P.M. Hokfelt T. Lundberg J.M. Szallasi A.

The ability of CAP and RTX to displace [3H]RTX binding in the spinal cord and DRG as well as similarities in [3H]RTX binding studies with recombinantly expressed VR1 suggest that both vanilloids act on the same receptors (14Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous studies with vanilloids have shown that vanilloid administration can lead to cell type-specific membrane damage. Long term exposure to vanilloids causes profound ultrastructural changes in DRG neurons (15Jancso G. Karcsu S. Kiraly E. Szebeni A. Toth L. Bacsy E. Joo F. Parducz A. Brain Res. 1984; 295: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Kiraly E. Jancso G. Hajos M. Brain Res. 1991; 540: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). VR1-specific antibodies have been used in intracellular localization by light and electron microscopy, but the functional relationship of these morphological observations to the observed cell damage has not been explored (10Tominaga M.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of fixed cells often limits detailed visual observation of rapid intracellular processes. In the present paper, we used fluorescence confocal microscopy and real time imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged VR1 (VR1eGFP) to examine simultaneously both the morphological and functional molecular processes underlying the immediate effects of vanilloid exposure on the perikarya of cells and neurons with high temporal and spatial resolution. Biochemical functions in the plasma membrane (membrane potential changes, calcium uptake, and [3H]RTX binding) similar to wild-type VR1 were readily observed with the chimeric VR1eGFP. In addition, another active pool of VR1 was located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also reacted within seconds to vanilloid treatment. Exposure of VR1-expressing cells to vanilloids produced a rapidly evolving cytotoxicity. This commenced with a rise in [Ca2+]i, which quickly surpassed the Ca2+ tolerance or sequestration capacity of the mitochondria. Subsequently, nuclear envelope shrinkage and blebbing occurred, followed by cell death. The effect of elevated [Ca2+]i on vital organelles suggests that targeted administration of vanilloid agents to the cell body can rapidly compromise and then eliminate (within hours) VR1-expressing nociceptive neurons. In fact, immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from primary DRG cultures showed that treatment with any of several vanilloid agonists eliminated cells expressing the VR1. To obtain VR1-specific mRNA, 100 DRGs were rapidly removed from 12 adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Total RNA was isolated with the TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). A fragment, comprising the sequence between the XbaI andAflIII sites of rat VR1, was amplified first by the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) and then cloned into the BlueScript vector (Stratagene). The missing 5′-sequence was added likewise with theSacI and XbaI sites. At the 5′ ends of the N- and C-terminal fragments, the SacI and AflIII sites (underlined) were incorporated with forward primers AGATCTCGAGCTCAAATGGAACAACGGGCTAGCTTAGACTC and CTGTATTCCACATGTCTGGAGCTGTTCAAGTTC, respectively. As reverse primers ACTGAGTCCCGGGCGCTGATGTCTGCAGGCT and CACACAGTCGACTTTCTCCCCTGGGACCATGGAATCCTT were used, in which the XbaI and SalI sites were incorporated, respectively. The SacI-AflIII and the RT-PCR- generated AflIII-SalI fragments were triple-ligated into a SacI and SalI cut pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH). The immediate early promoter of the cytomegalovirus in the pEGFP-N3 vector was employed to produce the full-length VR1 with the eGFP tag. Rat VR1 with the short, 12- amino acid ε-tag (KGFSYFGEDLMP) was constructed in a vector, pεMTH, driven by the metallothionein promoter (17Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, SalI and MluI restriction endonuclease sites were incorporated into the VR1 PCR fragment amplified using the forward AGTAGTGTCGACGAACAACGGGCTAGCTTAGACTCA and reverse TTGTTGACGCGTTTTCTCCCCTGGGACCATGGAATC primers, respectively. After cutting the PCR fragment with these enzymes the size-separated cDNA insert was ligated in pεMTH at the compatibleXhoI and MluI sites (17Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The chimeric constructs were verified by sequencing and transiently transfected in COS7, HEK293, and NIH 3T3 cells employing the protocol provided for the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The basal activity of the pεMTH promoter was used in NIH 3T3 cells to produce VR1ε, yet prevent toxicity from long term, high level expression. For patch clamp studies, VR1eGFP-expressing COS7 and HEK293 cells were voltage-clamped in Krebs buffer containing (in mm) NaCl (124), KCl (4.9), KH2PO4 (1.2), MgSO4 (2.4), CaCl2 (2.5), NaHCO3 (25.6), and glucose (10Tominaga M.

Intact cells were incubated (105/well) in a filtration plate with 200 pm [3H]RTX for 60 min at 37 °C and then processed as described earlier (5Szabo T. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M.

COS7, NIH 3T3, and HEK293 cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips and transfected with 1 μg each of the plasmid constructs, cultured for 24 h post-transfection at 35 °C, then mounted in a 1-ml chamber and examined with a MRC-1024 Bio-Rad confocal microscope. To study the two- and three-dimensional distribution of fluorescent chimeric proteins, each x-yplane was scanned over 1 s and at 0.2-μm increments in the z axis mode. To label different subcellular compartments of live cells fluorescently, the ER marker eGFP-KDEL (CLONTECH) was transiently transfected in COS7 and NIH 3T3 cells. To label mitochondria, MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) dye was incubated for 30 min at a 250 nm concentration; the cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.8 mmMgCl2, buffered with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (HBSSH). For determination of [Ca2+]i, cells were cultured in glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and then transfected with 2 μg of VR1eGFP plasmid. After 24 h in culture, cells were loaded with Fura 2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. Single cells expressing the VR1eGFP construct were identified by eGFP fluorescence and were selected based on visual inspection of fluorescence intensity. In all experiments, cells exhibiting intermediate fluorescence in comparison to other cells in the same dish were picked for analysis. To determine the [Ca2+]i, the excitation ratio of Fura-2 at 340 and 380 nm was recorded photometrically in Krebs' buffer at a 10-Hz sampling rate and integrated over 0.5 s, as described previously (20Hough C.J. Irwin R.P. Gao X.M. Rogawski M.A. Chuang D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was calculated using the ratio based equation (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M.

After incubation for 30 min at 34 °C, the cells were washed three times in HBSSH to remove excess dye and examined under the confocal microscope. To record in “zero” extracellular Ca2+ cells were washed four times (5 min each) in HBSSH containing no CaCl2 and 1 mmEGTA and imaged in the same medium. Groups of cells expressing VR1eGFP or small size neurons were selected under the microscope. To quantitate the fluorescence ratio, perikarya of the cells were marked with the graphic tools of the LaserSharp software in the field of a × 40 objective of the Bio-Rad confocal system. Ratiometric imaging was performed at 10-s intervals with an UV laser, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity emitted at 405 and 485 was calculated. DRG neuron-enriched cultures were prepared from embryonic rats (E16). Briefly, embryos were removed from the uterus and placed in Petri dishes containing Lebowitz medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cords were dissected, and the DRGs were stripped off with the meninges. Cells were digested in 0.125‥ trypsin at 37 °C for 20 min. For plating, dissociated cells were changed into minimal essential medium containing 5‥ horse serum and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). Cells were seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips or on multiwell plates. Surfaces were coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. DRG cultures were maintained in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, 7.5‥ fetal bovine serum, 7.5‥ horse serum, 5 mg/ml uridine supplemented with 2 mg/ml FUDR to inhibit cell division and 50 ng/ml NGF to promote neuronal survival and differentiation. Cultures were selected in this medium for 1 week, at which point well differentiated neurons and nondividing cells dominated the population. Primary DRG cultures in this stage were used in confocal microscopy. Total protein extracts were prepared in denaturing SDS buffer and analyzed for immunoreactivity by Western blotting similar to that described by us previously (17Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). VR1-specific antibody was raised in rabbits employing the N-terminal MEQRASLDSEESESPPQE peptide of rat VR1 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as immunogen. Immune sera were affinity purified against the peptide used for immobilization. The specific antibody fraction eluted from the affinity column was diluted 1000-fold for further characterization in Western blot and immunocytochemistry experiments. This antibody fraction recognizes the native rat VR1, as illustrated in Fig. 11, and the chimeric VR1eGFP and VR1ε (data not shown). Stripping of nitrocellulose blotting filters (Bio-Rad) was carried out in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2‥ SDS and 0.1 β-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 1 h. Stripped blots were reanalyzed for tagged fusion proteins either with the GFP (CLONTECH) or the εPKC-specific antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.), prepared in rabbits. To assess equal loading, filters were re-probed with a rat cytochrome c-specific monoclonal antibody (6H2.B4) as suggested by the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories). Antibodies for Western blotting were used at a 1:1000 dilution. To visualize the interaction with the primary antibodies, enhanced chemiluminescence technology was employed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). VR1ε and VR1eGFP plasmid constructs were expressed in COS7, HEK293, and NIH 3T3 cells by transient transfection. Western blot analysis with polyclonal eGFP and ε-tag-specific antibodies demonstrated that the VR1eGFP and VR1ε chimeric proteins expressed in HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cells were of the appropriate sizes, 120 and 93 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, 1st and3rd lanes). No tag-related immunoreactivity was found in the nontransfected host cells (Fig. 1, 2nd and 4th lanes). Repeated Western analyses with GFP- and ε-tag-specific antibodies showed no proteolytic cleavage of the VR1 chimeric proteins (data not shown). These transiently transfected plasmid constructs expressed proteins that exhibited identical molecular weights after the tag-specific antibodies were removed and the blots re-probed with the N-terminal specific VR1 antibody (data not shown). To study the electrophysiological properties of C-terminally eGFP-tagged VR1, plasmid constructs producing VR1eGFP and eGFP as a control were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Green fluorescent cells of medium fluorescence intensity were voltage-clamped, and the holding potential was adjusted to −60 mV. Capsaicin (10 μm) induced a large inward current (Fig.2 a). Similar currents were also evoked by administration of 125 pm RTX to the cells; however, the currents rapidly desensitized to repeated applications (n = 6) (data not shown). Capsaicin was noted to be less effective at inducing desensitization than RTX; therefore, CAP was used in experiments that required repeated application of vanilloid ligands (e.g. Fig. 2). As expected for a functional recombinant, the VR1eGFP-mediated current was attenuated by coincubation of an antagonist, 10 μm capsazepine (CPZ). The current versus voltage relationship demonstrated that the VR1eGFP-mediated current was not particularly voltage-sensitive. The reversal potential was near 0 mV, suggesting mixed cation selectivity for the channel (data not shown). Cells transfected with eGFP did not demonstrate currents when exposed to either CAP or RTX (Fig. 2 b and data not shown). Likewise, nontransfected HEK293 cells did not demonstrate RTX-evoked currents. Overall, the electrophysiological properties of the eGFP-tagged VR1 were very similar to those described for nontagged VR1 (9Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). In accordance with the electrophysiological data, exposure to RTX induced Ca2+ uptake in VR1eGFP-expressing HEK293 and COS7 cells. This ligand-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig.3 a) further confirms the presence of VR1eGFP at the plasma membrane. RTX induced45Ca2+ uptake with an ED50 = 100 ± 50 pm (n = 3) whereas that for CAP was 0.5 ± 0.15 μm (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for VR1 tagged with the 12-amino acid ε-epitope in place of the eGFP tag. This indicates that a C-terminal tag,per se, does not significantly change Ca2+uptake parameters. In addition, RTX-induced45Ca2+ uptake was completely blocked by 10 μm CPZ in VR1eGFP- (Fig. 3 a) and VR1ε−expressing cells (not shown). The curves in Fig. 3 b demonstrate the quantitative characteristics of [3H]RTX binding to eGFP-tagged and ε-tagged VR1 expressed in COS7 cells. Both tagged recombinants exhibited a high affinity, dose-dependent interaction (Kd ∼ 150 ± 10 pm,n = 6) and cooperativity among the receptors (Hill coefficient = 1.5–2). [3H]RTX binding was almost completely inhibited by coincubation of 10 μm CPZ. No significant [3H]RTX binding was detected in cells transfected with the plasmid expressing only eGFP (Fig.3 b). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was employed to analyze the intracellular distribution of VR1eGFP. Optical sections taken at the plane of cell attachment to the glass surface show VR1eGFP fluorescence in the plasma membrane, where microvilli were labeled (Fig.4 a, VR1 accumulation also is present at the focal points in this plane, not seen with fluorescent markers of ER). Optical sections taken through the middle of the cell nucleus, disclosed VR1eGFP in intracellular structures consistent with the ER (Fig. 4, b versus d). To confirm ER localization, cells were transfected with an eGFP that was C-terminally tagged with the ER retention signal (i.e. the KDEL motif, Fig. 4 b). Visualization of the transiently expressed eGFP-KDEL chimera protein in COS7 cells verified that VR1eGFP indeed stained the same ER compartment within the cytoplasm and around the nucleus (Fig. 4, b versus d). Furthermore, the same ER colocalization result was obtained when VR1eGFP-expressing cells were costained with the ER-tracker vital dye (Molecular Probes) (not shown). Fig. 4 illustrates localization of VR1 in COS7 cells but a similar ER localization was seen in HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that it is not a cell type-specific anomaly. ER localization was observed over a range of transfection efficiencies, and the distribution between the plasma membrane and ER was similar in cells expressing VR1eGFP at different levels (not shown). The proportionality between plasma membrane and ER also was maintained in a cell line stably expressing relatively lower levels of VR1ε from the noninduced MTH promoter. These data, as well as results from immunocytochemical staining of fixed DRG neurons, which show a high density of staining throughout the neuronal cytoplasm (10Tominaga M. Caterina M.J.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), suggest the distribution is not simply due to overexpression. Dual wavelength imaging studies demonstrated that the intracellular compartment containing VR1eGFP (green) was distinct from the filamentous mitochondria (red), which were labeled by the red MitoTracker dye and are generally much thicker than the ER (Fig.4 f). Previously it was noted that addition of ionomycin to cells induces intracellular membrane fragmentation due to permeabilization of the plasma membrane to cations (22Subramanian K. Meyer T. Cell. 1997; 89: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This was verified in baseline control studies using the eGFP-KDEL-expressing plasmid, which showed that ionomycin treatment induced membrane fragmentation of the ER (Fig. 4,b versus c). This fragmentation was identical to what occurred with VR1eGFP-expressing cells upon exposure to 1 nm RTX. In these cells a 20-s exposure induced fragmentation of the ER (Fig. 4, d and e) and, simultaneously, a rounding up of the filamentous mitochondria (Fig. 4,f versus g). Testing of a second vanilloid ligand, CAP (1 μm), also demonstrated membrane fragmentation with similar dynamics as noted with RTX (not shown). With the appropriate sets of fluorescence filters, we observed no mixing between the VR1eGFP vesicles (green) and the mitochondrial membranes (red) (data not shown). In cells expressing only eGFP, the structure of the mitochondria and ER did not change upon exposure to vanilloids, indicating the dependence for these effects on the presence of the VR1 receptor. Thus, within the first few seconds after vanilloid exposure, coincident and structu"

We show that in mammalian cells, C.elegans DAF-16 is a direct target of AKT and that AKT phosphorylation generates 14-3-3 binding sites and regulates the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of DAF-16 as previously shown for its mammalian homologs FKHR and FKHRL1. In vitro, interaction of AKT- phosphorylated DAF-16 with 14-3-3 prevents DAF-16 binding to its target site in the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 gene, the insulin response element. In HepG2 cells, insulin signaling to PI 3-kinase/AKT inhibits the ability of a GAL4 DNA binding domain/DAF-16 fusion protein to activate transcription via the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1-insulin response element, but not the GAL4 DNA binding site, which suggests that insulin inhibits the interaction of DAF-16 with its cognate DNA site. Elimination of the DAF-16/1433 association by mutation of the AKT/14-3-3 sites in DAF-16, prevents 14-3-3 inhibition of DAF-16 DNA binding and insulin inhibition of DAF-16 function. Similarly, inhibition of the DAF-16/14-3-3 association by exposure of cells to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, enhances DAF-16 DNA binding and transcription activity. Surprisingly constitutively nuclear DAF-16 mutants that lack AKT/14-3-3 binding sites also show enhanced DNA binding and transcription activity in response to LY294002, pointing to a 14-3-3-independent mode of regulation. Thus, our results demonstrate at least two mechanisms, one 14-3-3-dependent and the other 14-3-3-independent, whereby PI 3-kinase signaling regulates DAF-16 DNA binding and transcription function.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, genetic evidence indicates that an insulin-like signaling pathway, which includes an insulin/IGF-11-like receptor (DAF-2), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase; AGE-1), and protein kinase B (also known as AKT) controls life cycle, metabolism, and longevity (1Kimura K.D.

Genetics. 1994; 137: 107-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, insulin/IGF-1 signaling via PI 3-kinase and AKT mediates diverse effects on cell metabolism, growth, and survival (9Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Biochemical studies to date suggest that PI 3-kinase is important to the metabolic actions of insulin including its effects on gene transcription. A common DNA sequence, referred to as the insulin response element (IRE), binds members of the Forkhead transcription factor family and mediates the negative effect of insulin on transcription of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (12O'Brien R.M.

In hepatoma cells, insulin- inhibition of IRE-directed gene transcription is mediated via a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway (13Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A.

Accordingly, work in several laboratories aimed at identifying the downstream targets of insulin signaling to the nucleus has focused on the role of mammalian homologues of DAF-16, FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX in mediating the negative effect of insulin/IGF-1 signaling on gene transcription. In the absence of insulin/IGF-1, FKHRL1 (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M.

The prevailing view of the mechanism underlying insulin/IGF-1 inhibition of FKHRL1 and other DAF-16 homologs is that phosphorylation of FKHRL1 by AKT at two sites, Thr-32 and Ser-253 promotes retention of these proteins in the cytoplasm (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). AKT preferentially phosphorylates substrates that carry the RXRXXS, which is contained within certain consensus 14-3-3 binding motifs RSXSp XP, or RXXXSp XP where Sprepresents phosphoserine (22Yaffe M.B.

Hence, AKT phosphorylation of its target proteins may create 14-3-3 binding sites. For example, the AKT site at T32 in FKHRL1 is a 14-3-3 consensus binding sequence; AKT phosphorylation of FKHRL1 at sites Thr-32 and Ser-253 promotes interaction of FKHRL1 with 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic retention of FKHRL1 (14Brunet A.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins has also been shown to play a role in nuclear export and/or cytoplasmic retention of the yeast protein Cdc25 (23Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A.

In addition to promoting changes in cellular localization, binding of 14-3-3 to certain of its target proteins directly affects their activity. For example, 14-3-3 can stimulate the catalytic activity of the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 (26Tzivion G. Luo Z.J. Avruch J.

Accordingly, regulation of nuclear export by growth factor signaling to PI 3-kinase and AKT has been demonstrated for FKHR1 (32Biggs W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl.

We questioned whether the Thr-54 site in DAF-16 would function as a 14-3-3 binding site and, if so, whether PI 3-kinase signaling would regulate the interaction of C. elegans DAF-16 with elements of the mammalian nuclear import/export machinery as is the case for the mammalian homologs of DAF-16. We therefore examined the effect of AKT phosphorylation and 14-3-3 association on several aspects of DAF-16 function, including its ability to localize to the nucleus, bind DNA and activate transcription. We find evidence for PI 3-kinase-dependent inhibition of DAF-16 DNA binding activity via 14-3-3-dependent and 14-3-3-independent mechanisms. Thus, our observations suggest a more complex mode of DAF-16 regulation than previously anticipated. The DAF-16a1HindIII/NheI insert from pGEM-FLAG-DAF-16a1 was ligated into the HindIII/XbaI site of pcDNA3 (+) (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3-Flag DAF-16a1. The DAF-16a1BstYI insert from pGEM-FLAG-DAF-16a1 was ligated into theBamHI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate pGEX-DAF-16a1. Phosphorylation site mutants were prepared using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DAF-16a1 BstYI insert from pGEM-FLAG-DAF-16a1 was ligated into the BamHI site of the GAL4 DNA binding domain plasmid to generate GAL4-DAF-16 derivatives. The rat IGF-BP-1 promoter (nucleotides −921 to +79) cloned in PGL3-LUC was a gift from M. Rechler (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Preparation of pMT2-Myc-14-3-3, pGEX-GST-14-3-3, and the pGEX-GST-14-3-3 dimerization mutant has been described previously (26Tzivion G. Luo Z.J. Avruch J.

Specific DAF-16 antibodies were produced in rabbits using the Forkhead DNA binding domain of DAF-16 cloned into GST as the antigen. The competitor 14-3-3 binding phosphopeptide LPKINRSA(Sp)EPSLHR (PP, corresponding to c-Raf-1 amino acids 613–627) and the unphosphorylated version (P) were synthesized by QCB (Boston, MA). Anti-phosphopeptide specific antibodies against 14-3-3 binding consensus were a gift from M. Comb (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For experiments to phosphorylate DAF-16in vitro, GST-DAF-16 proteins were purified from bacteria and GST-AKT was expressed in 293 cells and subsequently affinity-purified on GSH beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Kinase assays were performed using 2 μg of GST-AKT as the kinase and 2 μg of GST-DAF-16 or DAF-16 mutant as the substrate in a kinase buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP (cold assay) supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP (10–20 μCi/reaction) (hot assay) at 30 °C for 40 min. Myc epitope-tagged 14-3-3 expressed in 293 cells was absorbed to anti-Myc epitope antibodies (clone 9E10) pre-coupled to protein-A beads and incubated with 2 μg of AKT- phosphorylated wild-type and mutant GST-DAF-16 for 90 min at 4 °C. Following extensive washes, the associated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated DAF-16 was detected by autoradiography. Both wild-type and mutant GST-DAF-16 variants were detected by anti-GST immunoblotting. Samples containing 2 μg of GST-DAF-16 or 5–10 μg of nuclear extracts, treated as indicated in the figure legends were incubated with 50,000 cpm of32P-labeled IGFBP-IRE probe (caaaacaaacttattttgaa) or G-C/A-C mutant probe (caaaagaaacttcttttgaa) for 15 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dG/dC) in each sample. For competition assays, 10× cold IRE or mutant IRE was added prior to the addition of 32P-labeled IRE probe. For supershift assays, the reaction was pre-incubated with 1 μg of either specific DAF-16 antibody (for detection of GST fusion proteins) or M2 antibody (against the Flag tag for detection of DAF-16 expressed in mammalian cells) for 15 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of 32P-labeled IRE probe. To demonstrate inhibition of DNA binding by 14-3-3, DAF-16 (2 μg) was phosphorylated with GST-AKT (2 μg) for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by addition of 14-3-3 (2 μg). The reaction was further incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, at which time labeled32P-IRE probe was added. Samples were resolved on 4% Tris-glycine PAGE at 100 V for 3 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transcriptional analysis, HepG2 cells were transfected using the CaPO4 method in 30-mm six-well plates with IGFBP-LUC (15 μg) reporter plasmid and pcDNA3-DAF-16 variants (2 μg) or pcDNA3 control vector (2 μg) per 1.5 ml of precipitate. The RSV-β-galactosidase vector (2 μg) was used to control for transfection efficiency. In the experiments described in Figs. 3 and 5, 2 μg of GAL4 DNA binding domain control vector or GAL4-DAF-16 fusion protein vector variants cotransfected with either the IGFBP-luciferase reporter gene or a luciferase reporter gene driven by five GAL4 DNA binding sites cloned upstream of the TK109 promoter. Cells were shocked for 1 min with 10% Me2SO and the incubation continued in the absence of serum. Insulin was added during the last 16 h of the incubation.Figure 5PI 3-kinase inhibition enhances DAF-16 DNA binding and transcriptional activity via an AKT/14-3-3 site-independent pathway. A, identification of DAF-16 DNA binding activity in 293 cell nuclear extract. Nuclear extract was isolated from 293 cells expressing Flag epitope-tagged DAF-16 (M2-DAF-16) (lanes 3–5) or pcDNA alone (lanes 1 and 2) and assayed for binding to the32P-labeled IGFBP-IRE as in Fig. 2 A. Preimmune serum (PI, lanes 1 and 4) or anti-Flag antibody (M2, lanes 2 and5) was used to supershift DAF-16/DNA complexes. The location of the DAF-16/DNA complex and M2/DAF-16/DNA complex (supershift) is indicated. B, inhibition of endogenous PI 3-kinase activity enhances binding of DAF-16 to IRE DNA. Upper panel, nuclear extracts of 293 cells expressing Flag-epitope-tagged DAF-16 (M2-DAF-16) (lanes 2and 3) or vehicle (lane 1) grown in serum (lanes 1 and 2) or serum-deprived in the presence of LY294002 (10 μm,lane 3) were prepared as in Fig. 4 Band assayed for binding to the IGFBP-IRE as described in Fig.2 A and “Experimental Procedures.” Lower panel, expression of DAF-16 in the nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions of the extracts shown was determined by anti-Flag immunoblotting. C, inhibition of endogenous PI 3-kinase with LY294002 enhances binding of DAF-16 AKT site mutants to IRE DNA. Upper panel, nuclear extract was isolated from 293 cells transfected with pcDNA alone (lanes 1–3), Flag-epitope-tagged DAF-16 (lanes 4–6), DAF-16 2A (lanes 7 and 8), or DAF-16 4A (lanes 9 and 10). Cells were grown in serum (lanes 1, 4, 7, and9) or serum-deprived in the presence of LY294002 (10 μm, lanes 2, 5,8, and 10) or wortmannin (10 nm,lanes 3 and 6). Binding to IGFBP·IRE was assayed as in Fig. 2 A. Lower panel, expression of DAF-16 in the nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions was determined by anti-Flag immunoblotting. D, serum growth factors regulate DAF-16 transcription activation. Insulin-responsive HepG2 hepatoma cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the native IGFBP promoter (15 μg) and pcDNA3-DAF-16 (2 μg/ml) (bars D–F) or a control pcDNA3 vector (2 μg/ml) (bars A-C) together with RSV- β-galactosidase to correct for transfection efficiency. 4 h after transfection, cells were changed to serum-containing media (bars B and E) or serum deprivation media (starved) (bars A, C,D, and F) in the absence (bars A and D) or presence (bars C and F) of LY294002 (10 μm). Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase (Promega kit) and β-galactosidase (Tropix kit) expression according to the manufacturers instructions. The mean ratios ± S.E. of luciferase/β-galactosidase triplicates are presented. E, inhibition of endogenous PI 3-kinase activity enhances transcription activity of DAF-16 WT and AKT site mutants DAF-16 3A and DAF-16 4A on the IGFBP·IRE. HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with an expression vector encoding the wild-type GAL4·DAF-16 (bars A and B), or mutant GAL4·DAF-16 derivatives 3A (bars C and D) or 4A (bars E and F) (2 μg), the IGFBP-luciferase reporter gene (15 μg), and the RSV-β galactosidase reporter gene (2 μg). Control cells growing exponentially in serum were stimulated with vehicle (bars A, C, and E) or serum-starved cells were stimulated with LY294002 (bars B, D, and F). The effect of LY294002 is shown as the percentage of control value. F, inhibition of endogenous PI 3-kinase activity does not affect transcriptional activity of DAF-16 WT or mutants on the GAL4 site. HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with GAL4·DAF-16 derivatives (2 μg/ml) and the GAL4-LUC (15 μg) reporter gene. Control cells growing exponentially in serum (bars A, C, andE) were compared with serum-starved cells stimulated with LY294002 (bars B, D, andF). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase gene expression and is presented as the percentage of the serum value for each plasmid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For the DAF-16/14-3-3 association experiments, 293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10-cm plates with 2 μg each of GST-14-3-3 or GST-AKT and 4 μg of pcDNA3-DAF-16 variants. For the DAF-16 localization and DNA binding experiments, 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of the pcDNA3-DAF-16 variants or pcDNA3 alone. Consistent with the genetic data that positions DAF-16 downstream of the PI 3-kinase-regulated serine/threonine kinase AKT inC. elegans, there are four consensus AKT phosphorylation sites in DAF-16 (Fig. 1 A). As has been established for the mammalian DAF-16 orthologs FKHR (16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

Phosphospecific antibodies generated against 14-3-3-binding consensus sequences can specifically recognize DAF-16 phosphorylated by AKT but not unphosphorylated DAF-16 (Fig.1 B, compare lane 2 to lane 1). This antibody recognizes phosphorylation of DAF-16 at threonine 54 (Fig. 1 B, middle, lane 2 versus lane 3). Phosphorylation of recombinant prokaryotic GST-DAF-16 by AKT induces its binding to recombinant mammalian 14-3-3ζ in vitro(Fig. 1 C). This association is inhibited by a competitor phosphopeptide corresponding to a 14-3-3 binding site on c-Raf-1 but not by the unphosphorylated form of the peptide (comparelane 2 with lanes 3 and4). The association with 14-3-3 is also inhibited by mutation of the AKT-phosphorylation sites on DAF-16 (comparelane 2 with lanes 5,7, and 8). In particular, the AKT-phosphorylation site at threonine 54, a site matching closest to the 14-3-3 binding consensus, represents a site whose phosphorylation is indispensable for 14-3-3 binding in vitro (compare lane 2 with lane 5). Homologues of DAF-16 bind and activate transcription through the IRE in the IGFBP gene (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar, 16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Accordingly we also find that DAF-16 binds specifically to the IRE (Fig.2 A). A DAF-16 derivative L201P, with a leucine to proline substitution in the forkhead DNA binding domain, does not bind to the 32P-labeled IRE, nor does an amino-terminal fragment (1–69) of DAF-16 that lacks the forkhead DNA binding domain (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 to lanes 6 and 7). A specific antibody raised against DAF-16 supershifts the DAF-16/DNA complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). We examined whether AKT phosphorylation and/or subsequent association of DAF-16 with 14-3-3 could alter the ability of DAF-16 to bind its target IRE site. Phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT did not by itself affect DAF-16-DNA binding (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 3); however, the addition of 14-3-3 to AKT-phosphorylated DAF-16 resulted in an almost complete inhibition of DAF-16 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 3 and 4). The addition of 14-3-3 had no effect on DAF-16 DNA binding when AKT was omitted (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 2 and 4), or when ATP was omitted (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 7 and 3) from the kinase reaction. Moreover, the competitor 14-3-3 binding phosphopeptide selectively blocked the ability of 14-3-3 to inhibit DAF-16 DNA binding while the unphosphorylated version had no effect (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 5 and 6) demonstrating the requirement of the 14-3-3-phosphopeptide binding domain for the inhibition. Thus, the ability of 14-3-3 to inhibit DAF-16 DNA binding required the association of 14-3-3 with phospho-DAF-16. The DNA binding activity of DAF-16 mutants impaired in their ability to bind 14-3-3, DAF-16 54A (T54A), and DAF-16 4A (T54A, S240A, T242A, S314A) was unaffected by AKT/14-3-3 (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 4 and5 and lanes 7 and 8). Conversely, the DNA binding activity of the DAF-16 2A (240/242A) mutant that retains the ability to bind 14-3-3 was inhibited (Fig.2 D, lanes 13 and 14). Although the DAF-16 (S314A) mutant retains the ability to bind 14-3-3 following AKT phosphorylation (data not shown), 14-3-3 does not inhibit its ability to bind DNA (Fig. 2 D, lanes 10 and 11). The inability of the dimerization-deficient 14-3-3 mutant to inhibit DAF-16 DNA binding (Fig. 2 C, compare lane 3 withlane 6), together with the ability of wild- type 14-3-3 to inhibit mutant DAF-16 2A (S240A/T242A), but not mutant DAF-16 (T54A) or (S314A) DNA binding, suggests that dimeric 14-3-3 interacts with DAF-16 at sites Thr-54 and Ser-314. This interaction may, in turn, mask the forkhead DNA binding domain of DAF-16. We have shown that AKT phosphorylation of DAF-16 WT allows association of 14-3-3 and that this association inhibits binding of DAF-16 to DNA. In HepG2 cells, insulin inhibits transcription activation by DAF-16 and this effect requires the AKT/14-3-3 sites in DAF-16 (21Nasrin N. Ogg S. Cahill C., W., B. Nui S. Dore J. Calvo D. Shi Y. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). If insulin inhibition of DAF-16 activity results from an interaction of DAF-16 with 14-3-3 that inhibits DNA binding, we would not expect to see insulin inhibition of DAF-16 activity if the protein were tethered to the promoter by way of a heterologous DNA binding domain. Therefore, we compared the effect of insulin on the activity of a fusion protein encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain and DAF-16 using the IRE DNA site in IGFBP-1 or GAL4 DNA (Fig.3). In HepG2 cells, DAF-16 expressed in a pcDNA vector activates transcription of the IGFBP promoter by 4-fold (Fig. 3 A, compare bars A and D) and this effect is inhibited by insulin (bar E) or by overexpression of constitutively active AKT (bar F). The AKT site mutant DAF-16 4A is resistant to the effect of insulin and AKT on IGFBP gene transcription (compare bar G to bars H and I, respectively). Thus, in HepG2 cells, the inhibitory effect of insulin and AKT on DAF-16 is dependent on its AKT/14-3-3 sites (16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase phytochelatin high pressure liquid chromatography 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid In recent years, contamination of soils and waters by toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants represents a major environmental and human health problem. The possibility of the removal of these toxic heavy metals by phytoremediation technology has increased interest in the knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation to high levels of heavy metals. Several heavy metals such as cadmium and copper are tolerated to certain low levels through the synthesis of small peptides named phytochelatins, which form a tight complex with the metal ion to inactivate and store it in the vacuole (1Zenk M.H. Gene. 1996; 179: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Phytochelatins are enzymatically synthesized from glutathione as a response of the plant to toxic levels of the heavy metals that produce a transient decrease of GSH content (2Noctor G. Arisi A.-C. Jouanin L. Kunert K.J. Rennenberg H. Foyer C.H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 623-647Google Scholar). Glutathione is synthesized by a two-step ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase. These reactions seem to be highly regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels, as well as by feedback control of the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase by GSH. InArabidopsis, a coordinated response of the glutathione biosynthesis genes to heavy metals has been reported (3Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). One of the factors that also regulates GSH biosynthesis is cysteine availability, because exogenous addition of cysteine has been shown to increase the GSH content (4Farago S. Brunold C. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 433-437Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, little work has been carried out on the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis under heavy metal stress or environmental conditions. The last step of cysteine biosynthesis is catalyzed by theO-acetylserine(thiol)lyase enzyme (OASTL)1 that incorporates sulfide into the O-acetyl-l-serine molecule. This molecule is produced by an acetylation reaction ofl-serine catalyzed by the serine acetyltransferase enzyme. Both serine acetyltransferase and OASTL activities have been demonstrated to be localized in the three cellular compartments involved in protein synthesis, cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondrion (5Lunn J.E. Droux M. Martin J. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of each OASTL and serine acetyltransferase isoform to a particular metabolic pathway is unknown (6Barroso C. Romero L.C. Vega J.M. Gotor C. Curr. Top. Phytochem. 1997; 1: 19-29Google Scholar, 7Leustek T. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 411-419Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, the Atcys-3A gene coding for the cytosolic OASTL isoform from Arabidopsis has been shown to be regulated by salt stress and the hormone abscisic acid (8Barroso C. Romero L.C. Cejudo F.J. Vega J.M. Gotor C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the Cd induction of the cytosolic OASTL fromArabidopsis thaliana and the involvement of this enzyme in cadmium tolerance, by overexpression of the corresponding cDNA in transformed plants. Wild-typeA. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown on moist vermiculite supplemented with Hoagland medium at 20 °C in the light and 18 °C in the dark, under a 16-h white light/8-h dark photoperiod. Cadmium chloride treatments were performed by addition to the Hoagland medium of CdCl2 to 50 μm final concentration, unless otherwise indicated. For the tolerance test, seeds were surface-sterilized and germinated on solid MS medium with and without CdCl2 at indicated concentrations, after cold treatment for 1 day to improve germination. The plants were grown in a growth chamber under the same conditions described above. For circadian experiments plants were grown on soil under a 16-h white light/8-h dark photoperiod for 3 weeks, before harvesting every 4 h for 36 h. After this treatment, plants were shifted to constant light and harvested every 4 h during 1 day. Seeds were germinated on solid MS medium for 5 days on vertical Petri dishes and transferred onto medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2. Plants were weighed after 6 days of further growth. Total seedling fresh weight was determined after gently drawing the root out of the agar medium. Cysteine and glutathione were extracted and subsequently quantified by reverse-phase HPLC after derivatization with monobromobimane (Molecular Probes) following the methods described by Rauser et al. (9Rauser W.E. Schupp R. Rennenberg H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Plant tissues were homogenized in cold extraction buffer (4 ml/g fresh weight) containing 0.1 N HCl and 1 mm EDTA using a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min in the cold. Thiols were reduced at 4 °C for 15 min by mixing 400 μl of extracted samples with 600 μl of 200 mm CHES (pH 9.2) and 100 μl of 250 mm NaBH4. A 330-μl aliquot was derivatized in the dark for 15 min by adding 20 μl of 15 mmmonobromobimane. The reaction was stopped by adding 250 μl of 0.25% (v/v) methanesulfonic acid at room temperature. Derivatized thiols were separated and quantified by reverse-phase HPLC (10Newton G.L. Dorian R. Fahey R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).O-Acetylserine(thiol)lyase activity was measured in crude extracts from wild-type or transformed Arabidopsisplants following a previously described method (11Barroso C. Vega J.M. Gotor C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Three-week-old plants were irrigated for 14 days with Hoagland medium supplemented with 250 μm CdCl2, final concentration. The leaves were collected and dried at 65 °C during 5 h. The dried material was wet-ashed in HNO3-HClO4(7:1) (v/v) at 65 °C until the volume of the solution was reduced from 20 to 2 ml. Finally, the samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry using a Fisons-ARL 3410 sequential multielement instrument. Total RNA was isolated from leaves, and Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (11Barroso C. Vega J.M. Gotor C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The blots were sequentially hybridized with a gene-specific Atcys-3A probe and then with maize 17 S DNA for detection of Arabidopsis 18 S rRNA (12Gotor C. Cejudo F.J. Barroso C. Vega J.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hybridization with CCA1 gene probe was used as a positive control of plant circadian oscillator (13Wang Z.-Y. Tobin E.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). For quantifying mRNA levels, radioactivity distributed on the blots was imaged and determined using an InstantImager electronic autoradiographer (Packard Instrument Co.). The level of Atcys-3A mRNA was normalized to the level of the 18 S rRNA obtained for each sample. Probes for in situhybridization were labeled with uridine 5′-[α-thio][35S]triphosphate. The Atcys-3AcDNA insert (11Barroso C. Vega J.M. Gotor C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) subcloned into pBluescriptII KS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using standard M13 reverse and forward primers. About 1 μg of the polymerase chain reaction product was used as template to synthesize 35S-labeled RNA using T7 RNA polymerase (antisense probe) or T3 RNA polymerase (sense probe). Mature Arabidopsis plants grown under standard conditions or treated with cadmium chloride (50 μm) for 18 h were used for in situ hybridization. Leaves, stems, and roots were cut into small pieces, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in wax, and sections were processed and hybridized under conditions as described previously (12Gotor C. Cejudo F.J. Barroso C. Vega J.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For autoradiography, slides were coated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hypercoat LM-1 nuclear emulsion and exposed for 11 days at 4 °C. The samples were then developed in Eastman Kodak Co. D19 developer prechilled at 14 °C and were fixed in 30% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min. After developing, the tissues were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue in water for 0.5 min, rinsed, dehydrated, and air-dried. For purposes of comparison, the tissue sections from control and stressed plants were fixed onto a single glass slide and hybridized with the same labeled probe. Tissue sections were observed in an Olympus BX50 microscope attached to a JVC TKC-1381 digital CCD color video camera for image capture. Images were processed and mounted by using the Olympus MicroImage analysis program and Adobe Photoshop software, respectively. For plant transformation, the β-glucuronidase gene in the binary vector pBI121 (CLONTECH), under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, was replaced by the full-lengthAtcys-3A cDNA (11Barroso C. Vega J.M. Gotor C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A 260-base pair fragment containing the polyadenylation signal from the nopaline synthase gene of theAgrobacterium Ti plasmid was placed downstream of theAtcys-3A gene. The resulting plasmid, named pBIOAS, was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain CV50.A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was transformed by using the vacuum infiltration method described by Bechtold et al. (14Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). Transformed seeds were tested for kanamycin resistance on solid MS medium containing 50 mg l−1 kanamycin. Integration into the nuclear genome of the plant was analyzed by genomic Southern blot analysis. T5 or subsequent generations of each line were used for the experiments. Northern analysis showed a 7-fold induction ofAtcys-3A transcript level in leaves in response to cadmium chloride treatment when compared with nontreated plants (Fig.1, A and B). Although the maximum level of induction was observed 18 h after treatment, a significant increase in RNA accumulation after 1 h was observed. Concomitant with the increasing mRNA levels, OASTL enzyme activity increased by 2.5-fold after 18 h of exposure to metal (Fig. 1 C). The time course of changes inAtcys-3A transcript and OASTL enzyme activity levels could reflect a diurnal rhythm of this gene. To check this possibility, circadian experiments were performed on plants not exposed to Cd, using as a positive control the CCA1 (circadianclock-associated 1) gene (13Wang Z.-Y. Tobin E.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). We were unable to observe any fluctuation of Atcys-3A gene expression over a 60-h period, suggesting that the pattern of induction of Atcys-3A mRNA is specific to the heavy metal treatment (data not shown). To gain insight into this response, the effect of cadmium chloride onAtcys-3A expression was investigated at the tissue level byin situ hybridization. In roots, the transcript of theO-acetylserine(thiol)lyase Atcys-3A gene was localized in the cortex, but the amount of detected signal was higher in cadmium-treated plants as compared with nontreated plants (Fig.2, C and D). In stem sections, the level of expression of Atcys-3A was almost undetectable above background in control plants (Fig. 2,E and F). However, it was possible to detect signal in the cortex and the vascular tissue of cadmium-stressed plants (Fig. 2, G and H). In leaf, the basal level of expression observed in all cell types was increased throughout the leaf lamina after cadmium treatment (Fig. 2, L–O). Although thein situ hybridization technique is not a quantitative method, for purposes of comparison we hybridized the tissue sections on the same slide and therefore processed them under the same conditions. The high level of Atcys-3A mRNA detected in trichomes of untreated plants (12Gotor C. Cejudo F.J. Barroso C. Vega J.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Gutiérrez-Alcalá G. Gotor C. Meyer A.J. Fricker M. Vega J.M. Romero L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was maintained or even increased in cadmium-treated Arabidopsis (data not shown). Other workers have demonstrated that cadmium induces the biosynthesis of phytochelatin peptides from GSH. To investigate whether cadmium treatment induces the biosynthesis of the precursor molecules, cysteine and GSH, we determined by HPLC analysis the content of both compounds in leaf tissues from cadmium-treatedArabidopsis. It was clearly observed that the GSH content increased about 2-fold after 18 h of treatment with 50 μm cadmium and dropped to the basal level within 24 h of treatment. However, the level of cysteine was not significantly increased. Similarly to the mRNA accumulation, a rapid increase that peaks after 1 h was also observed (TableI). However, after exposure of higher concentrations of cadmium for 24 h, a depletion of the cysteine and GSH levels was observed. At 100 μm Cd, the level of cysteine declined 35% with respect to untreated plants, and a decrease of 30% was observed in the GSH level. Larger decreases in either cysteine (43% depletion) or GSH (34% depletion) levels were detected at the highest concentration of 500 μm Cd used (data not shown). These results are in concordance with the behavior of the GSH content upon Cd treatment of Arabidopsis also observed by other authors (3Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Circadian fluctuation of cysteine or GSH levels (without Cd treatment) was not observed (data not shown).Table ICysteine and glutathione content upon cadmium treatmentTime (h)01361824cys13.7 ± 2.119.9* ± 1.716.86* ± 2.015.2 ± 1.519.8* ± 1.816.4* ± 1.2GSH134.8 ± 21210.3* ± 25179.9* ± 32191.6* ± 12250.6* ± 25143.6 ± 19Arabidopsis plants were incubated with 50 μmCdCl2 for the indicated times, and the leaves were collected for cysteine and GSH determination as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent nmol/g fresh weight of leaf, and means and standard deviations of at least four replicate experiments are shown.

The symbol * indicates significant differences (p < 0.05) from the data at t = 0. We have producedArabidopsis-transformed plants overexpressing theAtcys-3A gene via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Full-length Atcys-3A cDNA was fused in sense orientation to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter to obtain constitutive expression of the gene. Six independent transformed lines, tested by Southern blot, were used for further analysis. Northern blot analysis of the transformed plants showed up to a 9-fold increase in Atcys-3A mRNA accumulation in the pBIOAS-10 line compared with control-transformed plants expressing the pBI121 plasmid (lines pBI121-C1, -C3, -C5, and -C7) (Fig.3 A). The transformed plants also showed a concomitant increase in OASTL activity in leaf extracts (Fig. 3 B). We have tested the effect of the cadmium ion on the transformed plants by growing seeds on solid MS medium containing 250 μmCdCl2. The transformed lines showing the higher levels of overexpression of the Atcys-3A gene were able to germinate and grow on this medium (Fig. 3 C). Wild-type or transformed pBI121-C1 control plants germinate poorly in the presence of the metal, and those plants that did develop cotyledons did not produce leaves and died after 5–7 days (Fig. 3 C). The high cadmium resistance shown by the transformed lines overexpressing Atcys-3A could suggest that cysteine availability is a main factor for tolerance. In this sense, we investigated whether exogenous addition of cysteine to pBI121 control seedlings is sufficient to mimic the cadmium resistance observed in theAtcys-3A-overexpressing transformed seedlings. To avoid reaction in the medium between the heavy metal and the thiol group of cysteine, we used exogenous addition of cystine, which lacks the free thiol group. Addition of 200 μm cystine to control plants was sufficient to support their growth in the presence of 250 μm cadmium, although not to the extent observed in the transformed lines (Fig. 4). Cadmium analysis by atomic emission spectrometry of mature transformedAtcys-3A plants growing for 14 days on cadmium-containing media showed an increase of cadmium accumulation in leaves compared with control plants (Table II). Cadmium accumulation in different lines correlates with mRNA and OASTL activity levels, with line pBIOAS-10 having the highest level of cadmium accumulation, a 72% higher cadmium concentration than control plants.Table IICadmium concentration in leaves of transformed Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the Atcys 3A genePlant lineCadmium concentrationmg Cd/g DWControl0.39 ± 0.02pBIOAS-10.49* ± 0.06pBIOAS-20.45* ± 0.05pBIOAS-30.34 ± 0.03pBIOAS-40.47* ± 0.03pBIOAS-50.37 ± 0.03pBIOAS-100.67* ± 0.06Mature Arabidopsis plants were incubated with 250 μm CdCl2 for 14 days, and leaves were then collected from different pots of the same plant line for Cd determination, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values ± S.E. are shown from five independent measurements.

The symbol * indicates significant differences (p < 0.05) from the control plants. DW, dried weight. Two different Cd resistance tests were performed. In the first test, transformed seeds were germinated in the presence of a range of Cd concentrations and compared with wild-type. Transformed seeds were able to germinate in the presence of CdCl2 up to 400 μm, producing green leaves. By contrast, wild-type seedlings either failed to germinate or germinated but were unable to produce leaves, at 250 μm CdCl2 and bleached white and died at a cadmium concentration of 400 μm (Fig.5 A). In the other test, we studied the inhibition of growth of wild-type and line pBIOAS-10 seedlings upon Cd treatment. pBIOAS-10 was able to survive over 300 μm concentration, whereas wild-type died. Dead seedlings showed a fresh weight of around 2 mg (Fig. 5 B). The glutathione level was also determined in the transformed pBIOAS line 10 and compared with the level in wild-type plants. In the absence of cadmium, the concentrations of GSH in the transformed line and wild-type were similar. However, treatment with 250 μmCdCl2 for 18 h produced opposite effects in wild-type and the transformed line, a 30% decrease of the GSH content in wild-type, and an increase of 54% in the line 10 (Fig.6). Heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and arsenic are highly reactive with sulfydryl groups and can affect a vast array of biochemical processes. It is now well established that the thiolate peptides, the phytochelatins, play an essential role in the detoxification of cadmium and some other heavy metals. Thus, theArabidopsis cad1 mutant deficient in PC synthase is highly sensitive to cadmium ion (16Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants treated with heavy metals such as cadmium and copper respond by increasing transcription of genes involved in GSH synthesis and reduction (gsh1, gsh2, and gr1) (3Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased levels of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase have also been observed in cadmium-treated species such as maize (17Rüegssegger A. Brunold C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), tobacco, and tomato cells (18Schneider S. Bergmann L. Bot. Acta. 1995; 108: 34-40Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Chen J. Zhou J. Goldsbrough P.B. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 165-172Crossref Google Scholar) andBrassica juncea (20Schäfer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because phytochelatin synthesis produces a detectable depletion in GSH content (3Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), it is expected that the GSH precursor thiol molecule, cysteine, has to be produced at higher rates to support GSH biosynthesis under cadmium treatment. The data reported here clearly show a transient increase of theO-acetylserine(thiol)lyase upon cadmium treatment, and this effect is observed at the transcriptional and enzymatic level. Although the increase in OASTL activity is only 2.5-fold, we have to point out that these measurements represent the sum of the three OASTL isoforms identified in the cell. In situ hybridization data also show that the transcript is significantly induced in the whole leaf lamina and in the cortex and the vascular tissue of root and stem. In B. juncea, coordinate changes of expression for several sulfur assimilation enzymes, including OASTL, have been observed in response to cadmium treatment (20Schäfer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Heiss S. Schafer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All these data support the idea that plants respond to cadmium toxicity by inducing the genes required for phytochelatin synthesis, the genes involved in cysteine, and in glutathione biosynthesis (3Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In addition, because cadmium and other heavy metals are very reactive with thiol molecules, the reduced availability of free cysteine for GSH biosynthesis can significantly reduce and limit the amount of phytochelatin synthesis. Addition of exogenous cystine supports plant growth in cadmium-containing media and suggests an important role for the cysteine molecule. In fact, in transformed plants overexpressing the Atcys-3A gene, the tolerance to cadmium ion also increases, up to 400 μm CdCl2, in the case of the line pBIOAS-10. By increasing the OASTL mRNA and enzyme level, the cysteine synthesis machinery within the transformed plants seems to be able to supply the required precursor for GSH synthesis and therefore for PC synthesis. Although the level ofO-acetylserine, the precursor of cysteine, has been considered to be a limiting step for cysteine biosynthesis, we have not observed differences in metal tolerance by addingO-acetylserine to the MS media (data not shown). The effect of induction of cysteine biosynthesis in Cd resistance can be clearly observed in the transformed line pBIOAS-10 where high levels of OASTL mRNA and catalytic activity correlate with a higher capacity for Cd accumulation. Characterization of this transformed line has shown an enhanced cadmium tolerance when compared with wild-type, probably because of its capacity to respond to the Cd treatment with a dramatic increase of GSH biosynthesis. The manipulation of O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase gene expression and, therefore, cysteine biosynthesis in transformed plants enhances the capacity of plants for toxic metal sequestration, which may be useful for phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments. Overexpression of PC synthase in yeast leads to increased tolerance to heavy metals, but no data have been reported about tolerance in plants (22Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Ha S.-B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether manipulation of the PC synthase in Arabidopsis is sufficient to support metal tolerance or whether its precursor, cysteine, is the limiting step in the process. However, the limiting step could be different between species; thus in B. junceaGSH biosynthesis and not cysteine availability seems to be the limiting step, although an increase in OASTL expression is also observed on cadmium treatment (20Schäfer H.J. Haag-Kerwer A. Rausch T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Overexpression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase in this species enhances cadmium tolerance to the same level (24Zhu Y.L. Pilon-Smits E.A.H. Tarun A.S. Weber S.U. Jouanin L. Terry N. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) as that reported here. To conclude, in Arabidopsis, cysteine availability seems to be one of the limiting steps for GSH and, therefore, for PC biosynthesis. We thank Dr. John L.

Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 contains several serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are thought to be important for regulating the opening and closure (“gating”) of Cx43-based channels (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), but little is still known about how phosphorylation of Cx43 may be linked to the regulation of GJC. We have reported that Cx43-based GJC in normal fibroblasts is rapidly inhibited after activation of certain G protein-coupled receptors, such as those for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), endothelin, and thrombin (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We found that agonist-induced gap junction closure is independent of classic second messengers, such as calcium and cyclic nucleotides, and does not require the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Instead, gap junction closure was prevented by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, by dominant-negative c-Src, and in c-Src-deficient cells (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the c-Src tyrosine kinase is required for disruption of Cx43-based GJC by these G protein-coupled receptor agonists. Although agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 could not be detected (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the possibility remains that active c-Src may directly interact with Cx43 by analogy of what has been reported for oncogenic v-Src, whose effects on Cx43 and Cx43-based GJC have been investigated extensively (1Goodenough D.A.

Residue Tyr265 in the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 has been implicated as a major target for the v-Src kinase, but uncertainty exists as to the relevance of Tyr265 phosphorylation in channel gating (12Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). InXenopus oocyte pairs, v-Src-mediated closure of Cx43-based gap junctions was shown to be critically dependent on residue Tyr265, since mutation of Tyr265 in Cx43 prevented gap junction closure (12Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast, more recent experiments using the Xenopus system have suggested that v-Src-induced inhibition of Cx43-based GJC occurs via a pathway that is independent of the Tyr265 site but seems to require serine phosphorylation sites for mitogen-activated protein kinase (13Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy between both studies is unclear. While the action of oncogenic v-Src on Cx43 has been examined in considerable detail, it remains unknown whether endogenous wild-type c-Src can act similarly on Cx43. Overexpressed c-Src has long been known to mimic v-Src in inhibiting GJC in 3T3 cells (14Azarnia R. Reddy S. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Loewenstein W.R. Science. 1988; 239: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, where tested, an association between wild-type c-Src and Cx43 in vivo could not be detected (11Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the possible interaction between c-Src and Cx43, both in vitro and in transfected cells. We find that residue Tyr265 in the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 is phosphorylated by active c-Src and, furthermore, that Cx43 and active c-Src can be coprecipitated, whereas kinase-dead c-Src fails to stably interact with Cx43. Tyrosine phosphorylation and coprecipitation of Cx43 are abolished after mutation of residue Cx43 Tyr265. The communication-defective phenotype can be bypassed after introduction of mutant versions of Cx43 that cannot be tyrosine-phosphorylated on Tyr265. We conclude that activated c-Src phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of Cx43 on residue Tyr265, resulting in a stable interaction between both proteins that contributes to the inhibition of GJC by extracellular agonists. Rat-1 cells, COS-7, A431, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to experimentation, cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Chicken c-SrcY527A (SrcK+), c-SrcK295m (SrcK−), and c-Src in pMT2 were kindly provided by S. Courtneidge (Sugen, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Myc epitope-tagged full-length Cx43 and Cx43Δ263 in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) were constructed as described previously (15Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The Cx43Y265F and Cx43Y267F mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using 5′ oligonucleotides (5′ TGC GGA TCC CCA AAA TTC GCC TAC TTC AAT GGC T 3′ and 5′ TGC GGA TCC CCA AAA TAC GCC TTC TTC AAT GGC TGC TCC T 3′, respectively) and the 3′ oligonucleotide (5′ GGG GCGGCCGC C AAT CTC CAG GTC ATC AG 3′). Polymerase chain reaction was performed according to standard procedures, using rat Cx43 cDNA as template. Polymerase chain reaction products were isolated from gel andBamHI/NotI ligated into Cx43Δ263Myc, in which aBamHI site was introduced in the nucleotides encoding amino acids 261 and 262 (silent mutation). Mutations were verified by sequencing. To construct GST-Cx43CT, the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 was isolated from pMD4Cx43CT (15Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) with SalI/EcoRI and ligated, in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) cDNA, into pGEX-1n (XhoI/EcoRI). GST and GSTCxCT proteins were isolated from DH5α bacteria induced with isopropyl-β-d-thioglactopyranoside according standard procedures. GFP in pMT2 was obtained from G. Zondag (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). Cells were transfected with pCDNA3 plasmid encoding Myc-tagged Cx43 and/or versions of c-Src using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. COS cells were transfected by the standard DEAE-dextran transfection method, using 1 “g of plasmid DNA per 105 cells. Mouse anti-Cx43 and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse anti-Myc was applied as culture supernatant from the 9E10 hybridoma (ATCC). Rabbit anti-human c-Src (SRC2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse anti v-Src monoclonal antibody was from Calbiochem. Secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse and swine anti-rabbit) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), and antibodies conjungated to Texas Red were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate lysis buffer as described previously (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified and precipitated with antibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose Cl-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Incubation was for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed, and proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (LSB: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Src was expressed in COS-7 cells as described above. Cells were lysed 40 h post-transfection in Triton X-100 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Src immunoprecipitates were washed in in vitro kinase buffer (IVKB: 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). Substrate (10 “g of GST and GST-Cx43CT) and 0.37 Mbq of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added in IVKB. Reactions carried out at 30 °C were stopped after 1 h with LSB. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting. Samples in LSB were boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel), and transferred to nitrocellulose, as described previously (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked and subsequently probed with primary and secondary antibodies. Immunostained proteins were visualized using enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Scrape-loading of lucifer yellow, microinjections, electrophysiological measurements, and immunofluorescence assays were carried out as described previously (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J.

Previous studies have shown that Cx43 is tyrosine-phoshorylated by oncogenic v-Src, which correlates with permanent disruption of GJC in v-Src-transformed cells (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A.

We set out to examine whether c-Src can phosphorylate Cx43 on its COOH-terminal tail in vitro. To this end, we used the Cx43 tail (residues 227–382; Fig.1, upper panel) fused to GST (GST-Cx43CT) and three distinct versions of c-Src: (i) wild-type (wt) c-Src; (ii) constitutively active c-Src (c-SrcK +), in which the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between phosphotyrosine 527 and the SH2 domain is disrupted (Y527A mutation); and (iii) kinase-dead c-Src (c-SrcK−, K295M mutation) (Fig. 1, lower panel). Src proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells and incubated with GST-Cx43CT. [γ-32P]ATP was then added for in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig.2, the Cx43CT fusion protein is phosphorylated by c-SrcK+ (although radiolabeling is low relative to the in vitro autophosphorylation of c-Src), but not by kinase-dead SrcK−, and only very weakly by wt c-Src. Thus, the COOH-terminal tail of Cx43 can serve as a substrate for active c-Src. For further analysis we turned to intact cell systems.Figure 2In vitro phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal of Cx43 tail by c-Src. Different versions of c-Src (c-SrcK+, wt c-Src, and c-SrcK−) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Src proteins were immunoprecipitated, probed with anti-Src antibody (lower panel), and used for in vitro kinase assays (upper panel), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Cx43 COOH-terminal tail (amino acids 227–382) fused to GST was used as a substrate (GST-Cx43CT) (right lane, Ponceau S staining).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Swenson et al. (12Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) reported that residue Tyr265 in the Cx43 tail is critical for v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJC in paired Xenopus oocytes. Coexpression experiments in HEK293 cells have confirmed that oncogenic v-Src can phosphorylate Cx43 on residue Tyr265 (11Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, since v-Src and c-Src show differential association to cellular substrates (16Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 17Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether c-Src may act similarly to v-Src in phosphorylating Cx43. To examine the importance of Cx43 residue Tyr265 in the action of c-Src, we generated mutant versions of Cx43 in which tyrosine residues 265 and 267 were substituted by phenylalanine (Cx43-Y265F and Cx43-Y267F, respectively; Fig. 1, upper panel). COS-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Cx43 (wt, Y265F, and Y267F) with or without the various versions of c-Src. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates reveals that the three distinct Cx43 proteins are properly expressed to comparable levels (Fig. 3A, middle panels). No tyrosine phosphorylation of any of the Cx43 proteins is detected in control transfectants, nor in cells expressing kinase-dead c-Src (Fig.3). When c-Src or c-SrcK+ is cotransfected, however, phosphotyrosine is detected in wt Cx43 and Cx43-Y267F, but not in the Cx43-Y265F mutant (Fig. 3 A). We also analyzed Cx43 immunoprecipitates for the presence of phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 3 B, wt Cx43 and mutant Cx43Y267F are tyrosine-phosphorylated in c-Src-overexpressing cells, whereas Cx43Y265F (precipitated at comparable amounts) is not. From these results we conclude that active c-Src phosphorylates Cx43 on residue Tyr265 and that residue Tyr267 is not a Src phosphorylation site. We note that, at least in some experiments, a faint phosphotyrosine signal was still detectable in the Cx43-Y265F mutant (Fig.3 B). This may represent endogenous Cx43 that is coprecipitated with transfected Myc-tagged Cx43. An alternative or additional possibility is that c-Src may phosphorylate Cx43 on another tyrosine residue with very low stoichiometry. The latter possibility was not investigated in further detail. We next examined whether c-Src can stably interact with Cx43 in intact cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged versions of Cx43 (wt, Y265F, and Y267F mutants) together with the various c-Src constructs. We then assayed for the presence of Cx43 in Src precipitates. In SrcK+ precipitates, both wt Cx43 and the Cx43-Y267F mutant are readily detected, whereas the Cx43-Y265F mutant is not (Fig.4, upper right panel). Fig. 4further shows that a very weak association is detected between wt Cx43 and wt c-Src and that Cx43 fails to interact with kinase-dead c-Src (SrcK−). These results emphasize the importance of Cx43 residue Tyr265, and they support a model in which phosphorylation of Cx43-Tyr265 is essential for stable interaction between Cx43 and active c-Src. Our efforts to detect an interaction between endogenous c-Src and Cx43 in agonist-stimulated Rat-1 cells were not successful. This negative result is not entirely unexpected, however, given that: (i) agonist-induced c-Src activation and disruption of GJC are transient events (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); (ii) c-Src and Cx43 are expressed at relatively low levels in normal fibroblasts; and (iii) the high stringency lysis conditions required to solubilize Cx43 from junctional plaques is likely to disrupt protein-protein interactions, particularly when such interactions are labile and of transient nature. We next examined the importance of Cx43 residue Tyr265 in c-Src-mediated closure of gap junctions in fibroblasts. Rat-1 cells are ideally suited for these studies, because they express Cx43 as the sole gap junction protein and Cx43-based communication is tightly regulated (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding c-SrcK+ together with different versions of Cx43. In all cases, GFP cDNA was cotransfected to identify successfully transfected cells. At about 40 h after transfection functional cell-cell contacts were formed and GFP-expressing cells were micro-injected with Lucifer Yellow (LY) together with ethidium bromide (EtBr) as a marker to detect injected cells. Cell-to-cell diffusion of LY was measured at 3 min after LY/EtBr injection. LY diffusion from the transfected cell (GFP- and EtBr-positive) to its direct neighbor indicates the open state of Cx43-based gap junctions. When two or more adjacent cells showed LY fluorescence, communication was scored positive. Of note, this assay measures single-cell “all-or-none” responses, since GJC is subject to regulation only in the transfected cell (GFP-positive) in a cell-autonomous manner. Fig. 5 A shows representative results of the LY diffusion experiments, while quantitation of all experiments is summarized in Fig. 5 B. In nontransfected Rat-1 cells (“control”), 90% of the micro-injected cells show LY diffusion to their neighbors, indicative of normal gap junctional communication. When active c-SrcK+ is introduced, however, communication is strongly inhibited: in about 80% of the transfected cells gap junctional communication is completely lost (Fig.5 B). Cotransfection of wt Cx43 does not restore normal communication, nor does expression of Cx43-Y267F, which both serve as Src substrates (Fig. 5A, middle left). Strikingly, when the Src phosphorylation site Tyr265 in Cx43 is removed either by point mutation (Cx43Y265F) or by COOH-terminal tail truncation (Cx43Δ63), gap junctional communication is restored (Fig. 5,A and B). Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells did not reveal gross differences in expression levels of the Cx43 mutants (Fig. 5 C), although we cannot rule out the formal possibility that activated Src may somehow affect Cx43 localization and/or gap junction assembly. Nevertheless, our results suggest that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 on residue Tyr265 is a key event in closure of Cx43-based gap junctions. Our findings support a model in which G protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as LPA, endothelin, and thrombin, transiently disrupt GJC through a pathway that involves c-Src-mediated phoshorylation of Cx43 residue Tyr265 as a critical step (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an attempt to test this model directly, we stably expressed either wt Cx43 or mutant Cx43-Y265F in communication-defective A431 and HeLa carcinoma cells, and subsequently examined GJC in response to LPA and other growth factors. Unexpectedly, however, while expression of wt Cx43 or Cx43-Y265F did confer GJC to these cells (as determined by dye diffusion and electrophysiological measurements), coupling in the transfectants could not be inhibited by LPA, thrombin, epidermal growth factor, or phorbol ester. 2B. Giepmans, T. Hengeveld, F. Postma, and W. Moolenaar, unpublished observations. It thus appears that, although transfected Cx43 does restore GJC, its regulation by extracellular agonists is impaired, as if an essential signaling component or Cx43-interacting partner is lacking or nonfunctional in the Cx43 transfectants. We have shown that Tyr265 in Cx43 is a critical site for an interaction between Cx43 and active c-Src and inhibition of GJC. Our results support a model in which activated c-Src phosphorylates the Cx43 tail on residue Tyr265, resulting in a stable interaction between both proteins, most likely via a Src SH2-domain interaction, which then leads to inhibition of GJC. A similar model emphasizing the importance of Cx43 residue Tyr265 has been proposed for oncogenic v-Src in closing Cx43-based gap junctions (Ref. 10Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Shalloway D. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1993; 4: 541-558PubMed Google Scholar; but see also Ref.13Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar for a model in which the Cx43-Tyr265 has no major role). Yet, it should be noted that there are various important differences between v-Src and c-Src. Not only is v-Src constitutively active because it lacks the auto-inhibitory Tyr527 residue, c-Src and v-Src also show differential association to cellular substrates (16Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 17Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance is the finding that the isolated SH3 domain of v-Src binds to proline-rich motifs in Cx43 in vitro, whereas the c-Src SH3 domain mediates only weak binding to Cx43 under the same conditions (11Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hence, it will be very difficult to detect a pre-existing SH3-mediated association between endogenous c-Src and Cx43 in vivo. Although tyrosine phoshorylation of Cx43 could not be detected in Rat-1 cells following receptor stimulation (for likely reasons outlined above), a recent study showed tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 in cardiomyopathic heart tissue (20Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This correlated with increased c-Src activity and decreased GJC (20Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), consistent with a model in which active c-Src interacts with Cx43 and thereby mediates inhibition of GJC. In conclusion, our results provide further evidence for the direct involvement of c-Src in inhibiting Cx43-based GJC following stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (5Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and they emphasize the importance of residue Tyr265 as a c-Src target in this process. Obviously, a full understanding of how Cx43-based GJC is regulated by physiological and/or pathophysiological stimuli can only be obtained if all Cx43-interacting partners are known. In addition to c-Src, we have identified the ZO-1 protein as an interacting partner of the Cx43 COOH-terminal tail (a PDZ-domain interaction; Ref. 15Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). One challenge for future studies is to elucidate if and how c-Src and ZO-1 may interact to regulate the function of the Cx43 multiprotein complex and channel gating. Future studies should also elucidate the G protein-effector pathway that is responsible for Src-dependent inhibition of Cx43-based GJC in normal cells.

The homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange system described should be valuable for dissecting the action mechanism of hRad51 and for deciphering its functional interactions with other recombination factors. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA Genetic studies in various eukaryotic organisms have indicated that homologous recombination processes are mediated by a group of evolutionarily conserved genes known as the RAD52 epistasis group. As revealed in studies on meiotic recombination and mating type switching in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA double-strand breaks are formed and then processed exonucleolytically to yield long single-stranded tails with a 3′ extremity. Nucleation of variousRAD52 group proteins onto these ssDNA1 tails renders them recombinogenic, leading to the search for a homologous DNA target (sister chromatid or homologous chromosome), formation of DNA joints with the target, and an exchange of genetic information with it. The repair by recombination of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging agents very likely follows the same mechanistic route, as it too is dependent on genes of theRAD52 epistasis group (reviewed in Refs. 1Paques F.

Among members of the RAD52 group, theRAD51-encoded product is of particular interest because of its structural and functional similarities to the Escherichia coli recombination protein RecA (2Sung P.

RecA promotes the pairing and strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules to form heteroduplex DNA (4Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front.

Likewise, homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange activities have been shown for S. cerevisiae Rad51 (yRad51) (6Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Under optimized conditions, the length of heteroduplex DNA joints formed by yRad51 and RecA can extend over quite a few kilobase pairs (4Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front.

In published studies, human Rad51 (hRad51) was found to have the ability to make DNA joints but the maximal potential for forming only about 1 kilobase pairs of heteroduplex DNA (8Baumann P.

Furthermore, while yRad51 and RecA require their cognate single-strand DNA binding factors, SSB and yRPA, for optimal recombinase activity, hRPA has been suggested to stimulate the hRad51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange reaction only when the hRad51 concentration is suboptimal (9Baumann P.

Given the central role of hRad51 in recombination processes and the fact that the activities of hRad51 are apparently subject to modulation by tumor suppressor proteins such as BRCA2 (reviewed in Ref. 12Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7883-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), establishing an efficient hRad51-mediated DNA strand exchange system will be important for dissecting the functional interactions among hRad51, other recombination factors, and tumor suppressors. In this work, a variety of reaction parameters that could influence the recombinase activity of hRad51 were explored. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, hRad51 makes DNA joints avidly and promotes highly efficient strand exchange over at least 5.4 kilobase pairs. Importantly, under the new reaction conditions, the efficiency of the hRad51-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction is strongly dependent on hRPA over a wide range of Rad51 concentrations tested. φX174 viral (+)-strand was purchased from New England Biolabs and φX174 replicative form I DNA was from Life Technologies, Inc.

The labeled duplex was purified from 10% polyacrylamide gels by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA). DNA substrates were stored in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.5 mm EDTA). Plasmid pRh51.1 consists of human RAD51 K313 cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter in vector pET11 (Novagen). Plasmid pRh51.1 was then subject to in vitromutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), to change Lys313 (AAA codon) to a glutamine residue (CAA codon). The resulting plasmid, pRh51.2, was sequenced to ensure that no other undesired change has occurred in theRAD51 sequence. Plasmid p11d-tRPA (13Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which coexpresses all three subunits of hRPA, was used for purification of this factor. Plasmids pRh51.1 and pRh51.2 were introduced into the RecA-deficient E. coli strain BLR (DE3) with pLysS. Following transformation, single clones were picked and grown for 15 h in 30 ml of Luria broth. The starter culture was diluted 200 times with fresh Luria broth and incubated at 37 °C. When theA600 of the cultures reached 0.6 to 1, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mm and the induction of hRad51 continued at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored frozen at −70 °C. Plasmid p11d-tRPA was introduced into E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) and the induction of hRPA was carried out as described previously (13Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the following steps were carried out at 4 °C. For the purification of hRad51 Lys313 and hRad51 Gln313 proteins, E. coli cell paste, 30 g from 20 liters of culture, was suspended in 150 ml cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstation A at 3 μg/ml each, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then passed through a French press once at 20,000 p.s.i. The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 120 min), and the supernatant (Fraction I) was treated with ammonium sulfate at 0.23 g/ml to precipitate hRad51 and about 20% of the total extract protein. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 300 ml of T buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) with the set of protease inhibitors used in extract preparation, and then clarified by centrifugation (10,000 ×g for 30 min). The cleared protein solution (Fraction II) was then applied onto a column of Q-Sepharose (2.6 × 6 cm; total 30-ml matrix) equilibrated in T buffer with 100 mm KCl and eluted with a 400 ml of gradient of 100 to 600 mm KCl in T buffer. The peak of hRad51 (Fraction III), eluting at about 330 mm KCl (60 ml), was dialyzed against T buffer with 100 mm KCl and then fractionated in a column of Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad; 1.6 × 5 cm; total 10-ml matrix) with a 100-ml gradient of 100 to 2000 mm KCl in T buffer. The hRad51 protein eluted from Affi-Gel Blue at 800 to 1200 mm KCl, and the pool of which (Fraction IV; 20 ml) was dialyzed against T buffer with 100 mm KCl and fractionated in a column of Macro hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad; 1 × 7.5 cm; total 6-ml matrix) with a 100-ml 30 to 320 mm KH2PO4 gradient in buffer T. hRad51 eluted from 150 to 220 mmKH2PO4, and the peak fractions were pooled (Fraction V; 15 ml containing 7.5 mg of hRad51), dialyzed against T buffer with 50 mm KCl, and applied onto a Mono S column (HR5/5), which was developed with a 30-ml 100 to 400 mm KCl gradient in buffer T. The Mono S fractions containing the peak of hRad51, eluting at about 250 mm KCl, were pooled (Fraction VI; 4 ml containing 6 mg of hRad51), diluted with an equal volume of 10% glycerol and then fractionated in Mono Q (HR 5/5) with a 30-ml 100 to 600 mm KCl gradient. The final pool of hRad51 (Fraction VII; 3 ml containing 5 mg of hRad51 in ∼350 mm KCl) was concentrated in Centricon-30 microconcentrators and stored at −70 °C. The hRad51 concentration was determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 12,800m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm(10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the purification of hRPA, extract was made from E. coliBL21 (DE3) harboring the plasmid p11d-tRPA (13Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to the purification procedure we have used for yRPA (14Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The concentration of hRPA was determined by comparison of multiple loadings of hRPA against known amounts of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin in a Coomassie Blue R-stained polyacrylamide gel. All the reaction steps were carried out at 37 °C. In Fig. 2, the reaction (50 μl final volume) was assembled by mixing hRad51 (7.5 μm) added in 2 μl of storage buffer and φX174 viral (+)-strand (30 μm nucleotides) added in 2 μl in 40 μl of buffer R (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP regenerating system consisting of 8 mm creatine phosphate and 28 μg/ml creatine kinase). After a 5-min incubation, hRPA (2 μm) in 2 μl of storage buffer was added, followed by a 5-min incubation, and then 5 μl of ammonium sulfate (1m stock, final concentration of 100 mm), followed by another 1-min incubation. To complete the reaction, linear φX174 replicative form I DNA (30 μm nucleotides) in 3 μl of TE and 4 μl of 50 mm spermidine (4 mm) were incorporated. At the indicated times, 4.5-μl portions were withdrawn, mixed with 7 μl of 0.8% SDS and 800 μg/ml proteinase K, incubated for 15 min before electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer. The gels were stained in ethidium bromide (2 μg/ml in H2O) for 1 h, destained for 12 to 18 h in a large volume of water, and then subjected to image analysis in a NucleoTech gel documentation station equipped with a CCD camera using Gel Expert for quantification of the data. Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixtures in other experiments were assembled in the same manner with the indicated amounts and order of addition of reaction components, except that they were scaled down two and one-half times. The reaction mixture had a final volume of 12.5 μl and the steps were carried out at 37 °C. hRad51 (7.5 μm) was incubated with oligonucleotide 2 (30 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer R. The reaction mixture was completed by adding ammonium sulfate in 1 μl, 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine, and the radiolabeled duplex (30 μm nucleotides) in 0.5 μl. At all the times indicated, a 3-μl portion of the reaction mixture was deproteinized as described above and then subjected to electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer. The level of DNA strand exchange was determined by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gels. Oligonucleotides F1 and F1b (Midland) both have the sequence 5′-TGGCTTGAACGCGTCATGGAAGCGATAAAACTCTGCAGGTTGGATACGCCAATCATTTTTATCGAAGCGCGCCGCCC-3′, except that the latter also contains a biotin molecule positioned at the 5′ terminus. In these oligonucleotides, nucleotide residues 11 to 72 are complementary to positions 5348 to 23 of the φX (+)-strand DNA. These oligonucleotides were hybridized to φX (+)-strand by incubating a 3 m excess of the oligonucleotide with the latter in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The F1-φX (+)-strand and F1b-φX (+)-strand hybrids (30 μm nucleotides) were mixed with 10 μl of magnetic beads containing streptavidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. About 70% of the F1b-(+)-strand hybrid was immobilized on the beads, whereas, as expected, less than 5% of the F1-(+)-strand hybrid was retained. To assemble hRad51 filament on the immobilized φX (+)-strand, magnetic beads preloaded with the F1b-φX (+)-strand hybrid were incubated with 4 μm hRad51 in 20 μl of buffer R. Reproducibly, ∼85% of the hRad51 was bound to the magnetic beads under the stated conditions, as determined by eluting the bound hRad51 with 2% SDS followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue; this procedure gave an immobilized hRad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein complex of ∼3 nucleotides/hRad51 monomer. The magnetic beads containing hRad51-ssDNA complex was then washed once each with 20 μl of buffer R with 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 20 μl buffer R, before being incubated with linear φX duplex (8 μm nucleotides) for 3 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of buffer R containing 4 mm spermidine and the indicated concentrations of ammonium sulfate. The beads were treated with 20 μl of 2% SDS at 37 °C for 5 min to elute bound duplex and hRad51. The supernatants and SDS eluates were analyzed in agarose gels followed by staining with ethidium bromide to quantify DNA and in polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue staining to determine the amount of hRad51. As controls, magnetic beads alone, magnetic beads preincubated with the F1-φX (+)-strand hybrid, and magnetic beads preincubated with F1b but without φX (+)-strand were similarly incubated with the linear φX duplex and then processed for analyses. The cDNA for hRad51 was amplified from a human B-cell cDNA library. Sequencing of thehRAD51 cDNA insert revealed that it was identical to one of the published hRAD51 sequences (15Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Yamamoto A. Matsushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but differed from the other sequence (16Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at amino acid residue 313; the former has a lysine (an AAA codon) while the latter has a glutamine (a CAA codon) at this position. The cloned cDNA was subjected to targeted mutagenesis to change lysine 313 to glutamine. Both hRad51 Lys313 and hRad51 Gln313 variants were expressed in E. coliand purified to near homogeneity (Fig.1 A). The two hRad51 isoforms behaved identically during purification and gave indistinguishable results in all the enzymatic assays described here. Only the results with hRad51 Lys313 are shown. We presume that the two hRad51 isoforms correspond to naturally occurring polymorphic variants. For DNA strand exchange experiments, the human ssDNA binding factor replication protein A (hRPA), a heterotrimer of 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits, was also purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 B) from E. coli cells harboring a plasmid which coexpresses all three subunits of this factor (13Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For characterizing the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange activity of hRad51, we used as substrates φX 174 viral (+)-strand and linear duplex that are 5.4 kilobase pairs in length (Ref. 6Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar; schematic shown in Fig.2 A). In this system, hRad51 is preincubated with the (+)-strand, followed by the addition of hRPA, and the linear duplex is incorporated last. Pairing between the DNA substrates yields a joint molecule, and branch migration, if successful, over 5.4 kilobase pairs produces nicked circular duplex as product (Fig. 2 A). We have examined a variety of reaction conditions including the levels of magnesium, pH, and various types of salt on the hRad51 recombinase activity. As documented below, the most dramatic effects were seen with the addition of salts. We tested the effects of increasing concentrations of potassium acetate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, potassium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium sulfate, and found that while all of these salts were stimulatory, ammonium sulfate produced the most stimulation, followed by potassium sulfate. Panel I in Fig.2 B shows a time course experiment in which 7.5 μm hRad51 was used with 2 μm hRPA, φX (+)-strand (30 μm nucleotides), and φX linear duplex (30 μm nucleotides) in pH 7.8 buffer and 100 mm ammonium sulfate. Following the published conditions of Baumann and West (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), another reaction was also carried out in which hRad51, at 5 μm, was used with 1 μmhRPA and the same concentrations of DNA substrates and 80 mm potassium acetate at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2 B, panel II). The results showed a much higher level of DNA strand exchange under the new conditions. Specifically, whereas no full strand exchange product (nicked circular duplex) was detected under the published conditions (Fig. 2, B, panel II, and C, panel I) (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the inclusion of ammonium sulfate resulted in conversion of ∼30 and ∼60% of the linear duplex to nicked circular duplex after 30 and 60 min, respectively (Fig. 2, B, panel I, andC, panel I). Overall, there was a 3–4-fold increase in total products (joint molecules plus nicked circular duplex) in the reaction that employed ammonium sulfate (Fig. 2 C, panel II). Even though 100 mm ammonium sulfate was found to be optimal, highly significant levels of homologous DNA pairing and complete DNA strand exchange were seen at reduced concentrations (50 and 75 mm) of the salt (data not shown). In published studies (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), 80 mm potassium acetate was employed. In agreement with the published work (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), neither higher (up to 200 mm in 20 mm increments) nor lower concentrations of potassium acetate would improve homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange efficiency beyond the level seen inpanel II of Fig. 2 B. As expected from published work (8Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), omission of ATP from the reaction abolished strand exchange, either under our reaction conditions (Fig. 2 B, panel I, lanes 10–12) or the published conditions (Fig. 2 B, panel II, lanes 11–13) (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the inclusion of ammonium sulfate renders hRad51-mediated ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange highly efficient. Under the new reaction conditions, the optimal levels of hRad51 for pairing and strand exchange were found to be between 2 and 4 nucleotides/protein monomer. Increasing hRad51 above 2 nucleotides/protein monomer resulted in gradual inhibition (data not shown), which was likely due to binding of hRad51 to the duplex and its sequestration from pairing with the hRad51-ssDNA complex (7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the yRad51-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction that uses plasmid length DNA substrates, a strong dependence of the reaction efficiency on yRPA has been observed (2Sung P. Trujillo K. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the published work, when hRad51 was used at the optimal ratio of 3 nucleotides of ssDNA/hRad51 monomer, hRPA has no stimulatory effect on the reaction efficiency, and relatively high levels of hRPA were in fact strongly inhibitory (9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have examined whether under the newly devised reaction conditions, hRPA is required for strand exchange efficiency. Fig. 3 summarizes the results obtained with 7.5 μm hRad51, 30 μmnucleotides of ssDNA, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and increasing concentrations of hRPA, from 0.4 to 4.0 μm. Whereas only negligible pairing and strand exchange was seen in the absence of hRPA, increasing concentrations of hRPA gave progressively higher levels of products (Fig. 3, panels I and II). The optimal level of hRPA was ∼2 μm, although addition of as little as 0.4 μm hRPA gave highly notable stimulation. Importantly, increasing the hRPA concentration to 4 μm did not lower the level of products, which is very different from published studies (10Baumann P. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in which concentrations of hRPA ≥0.8 μm were found to be strongly inhibitory. Additional experiments revealed that at levels of hRad51 higher (2 nucleotides/hRad51 monomer) or lower (6 nucleotides/hRad51 monomer) than that (4 nucleotides/hRad51 monomer) used in Fig. 3, there is also a similar dependence of homologous pairing and strand exchange on hRPA. Likewise, at ammonium sulfate levels higher and lower than that used in prior experiments, we have also observed a similar dependence of the strand exchange reaction on hRPA. Control experiments confirmed that hRPA by itself does not have homologous pairing and strand exchange activity under the new conditions (data not shown). In summary, under our reaction conditions, there is a uniform dependence of DNA strand exchange on hRPA, regardless of the amount of hRad51 used. In the experiments described thus far, ammonium sulfate was added to the reaction mixture after hRad51 had already nucleated onto the ssDNA but before the incorporation of hRPA. We have also examined whether the addition of ammonium sulfate at other stages would affect the reaction efficiency, as such an endeavor could yield important clues as to the basis of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4, similar levels of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange were observed when ammonium sulfate was added at the beginning with hRad51, after hRad51 but before the incorporation of hRPA (as in the standard reaction), and after hRPA but before the incorporation of the duplex. Interestingly, when ammonium sulfate was incorporated a few minutes after the duplex, there was little product formed even at the reaction end point of 60 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 11–13). Since dsDNA coated with hRad51 or yRad51 has been found to be inactive in the DNA strand exchange reaction (7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 9Baumann P. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5198-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that perhaps the suppression of DNA strand exchange seen with ammonium sulfate being added after the duplex might have stemmed from free hRad51 binding to the duplex (7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, two lines of evidence strongly suggest that this was not the main reason for the lack of strand exchange stimulation. First, even at levels of hRad51 (6 nucleotides and 9 nucleotides of ssDNA/hRad51 monomer) lower than that (4 nucleotides ssDNA/hRad51 monomer) used in Fig. 4 and with much longer preincubation of hRad51 with ssDNA to minimize the level of free hRad51, addition of ammonium sulfate before the duplex molecule is still necessary to see significant strand exchange (data not shown). Second, an excess of a heterologous duplex (pBluescript) added together with the homologous duplex or before the homologous duplex, in an attempt to titrate out any free hRad51, also did not compensate for the stimulatory effect of adding ammonium sulfate before the homologous duplex (see below). Taken together, the results strongly suggested that the lack of DNA strand exchange when ammonium sulfate was incorporated after the homologous duplex was due to a reason other than free hRad51 coating the duplex molecule. Interestingly, whereas the incorporation of increasing amounts of the heterologous pBluescript duplex in the presence of ammonium sulfate lowered the reaction efficiency only slightly (Fig.5, A, panel I, and B, panel I), the addition of pBluescript duplex before ammonium sulfate resulted in much more pronounced inhibition (Fig. 5, A, panel II, and B, panel II). These results, coupled with those presented above, indicated that binding of duplex to the hRad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament, regardless of whether the duplex is homologous to the ssDNA situated in the hRad51 filament, has a strong suppressive effect on pairing and strand exchange, unless salt is already present. In summary, the results have revealed a strict dependence of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange efficiency on ammonium sulfate being incorporated into the reaction prior to the duplex, and they suggest that ammonium sulfate exerts its stimulatory effect via modulation of the interactions between the hRad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein complex and the incoming duplex molecule. This premise is further tested and verified in the experiments below. Extensive biochemical studies conducted with RecA have revealed that the incoming duplex molecule is bound only transiently within the RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament (4, 5, see “Discussion”). We reasoned that if the hRad51-ssDNA filament has a relatively high affinity for the duplex, then the DNA homology search process might occur efficiently only when the association of the duplex molecule and the hRad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is rendered transient, which could conceivably be realized by salt inclusion. Intrinsic to this hypothesis are two predictions. First, it might be expected that the salt dependence of the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange process would be lessened with reduction in the length of the DNA substrates, such as when oligonucleotides are used (11Gupta R.C.

PGHSs catalyze two separate reactions including a cyclooxygenase (bisoxygenase) reaction in which AA is converted to PGG2and a peroxidase reaction in which PGG2 undergoes a two-electron reduction to PGH2 (1Smith W.L.

These reactions occur at physically distinct but interactive sites within the cyclooxygenase structure. The cyclooxygenase reaction begins with a rate-limiting abstraction of the 13-pro-S-hydrogen from AA to yield an arachidonyl radical (13Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol.

NSAIDs compete directly with AA for binding to the cyclooxygenase site (15Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 16Kurumbail R.G.

Crystallographic studies of enzyme-inhibitor complexes have suggested that the cyclooxygenase active site exists in the form of a hydrophobic channel that protrudes into the body of the major globular domain of the protein (15Picot D.

More recently we determined the structure of AA bound within the cyclooxygenase active site of ovine (o) PGHS-1 (21Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). AA is bound in an extended L-shaped conformation and makes a total of 48 hydrophobic contacts (i.e. 2.5–4.0 Å) and two hydrophilic contacts with the protein, involving a total of 19 different residues (see Fig. 1 below). Additionally, there are several amino acids that are in the first shell of the cyclooxygenase hydrophobic tunnel and contact other first shell amino acids but lie outside of van der Waals distance to AA. Although AA can assume some 107 low energy conformations (22Gund P. Shen T.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1977; 9: 1146-1152Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), only three of these conformations are catalytically competent (23Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Other than for Arg-120 and Tyr-385 relatively little is known about the functions of residues located in the core of the hydrophobic cyclooxygenase tunnel (31Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

In the study reported here we have performed mutational analyses of a number of the residues that line the hydrophobic active site channel to determine their functional importance in arachidonate binding and oxygenation. Our results suggest that individually and collectively these residues function primarily to position arachidonate in a specific conformation that optimizes its conversion to PGG2. Fatty acids were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (40–60 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Flurbiprofen was purchased from Sigma. Diazald® (N-methyl-N-nitroso-p-toluenesulfonamide) was from Aldrich. Restriction enzymes and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf serum and fetal bovine serum were purchased from HyClone. Primary antibodies used for Western blotting were raised in rabbits against purified oPGHS-1 and purified as an IgG fraction (36Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L.

Oligonucleotides used as primers for mutagenesis were prepared by the Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure and Sequencing Facility. All other reagents were from common commercial sources. Mutants were prepared either starting with M13mp19-PGHSov, which contains a 2.3-kilobaseSalI fragment coding for native oPGHS-1 and employing the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit and the protocol as described by the manufacturer (36Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), employing the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit and the protocol of the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides used in the preparation of various mutants are summarized in the supplemental table. Plasmids used for transfections were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, and mutations were reconfirmed by double-stranded sequencing of the pSVT7 constructs using Sequenase (version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the protocol described by the manufacturer. COS-1 cells (ATTC CRL-1650) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% calf serum and 2% fetal bovine serum until near confluence (∼3 × 106 cells/10 cm dish). Cells were then transfected with pSVT7 plasmids containing cDNAs coding for native oPGHS-1 or mutant oPGHS-1 using the DEAE dextran/chloroquine transfection method as reported previously (36Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Forty hours following transfection, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and microsomal membrane fractions were prepared at 0–4 °C, as described previously (36Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L.

Membranes were isolated from sham-transfected cells in an identical manner. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Microsomal preparations were used for Western blotting and for cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays. Cyclooxygenase assays were performed at 37 °C by monitoring the initial rate of O2 uptake using an oxygen electrode (23Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each standard assay mixture contained 3.0 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 85 μg of bovine hemoglobin, and 100 μm arachidonic acid. Reactions were initiated by adding ∼250 μg of microsomal protein in a volume of 20–50 μl to the assay chamber. Km values were measured using 0.5–500 μm arachidonate. The shareware program “Hyper” copyrighted in 1993 by J. S. Easterly was used to perform a hyperbolic regression analysis of the enzyme kinetic data to generate Km and Vmaxvalues. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity was measured by adding aliquots of microsomal suspensions to assay mixtures containing 100 μm arachidonate and 200 μm flurbiprofen. Peroxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically withN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD) as the reducing cosubstrate (39Kulmacz R.J. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm TMPD, ∼100 μg of microsomal protein, and 1.7 μm hematin in a total volume of 3 ml. Reactions were initiated by adding 100 ml of 0.3 mmH2O2, and the absorbance at 610 nm was monitored with time. To determine the rates of inactivation of native and mutant oPGHS-1 by aspirin, microsomal enzyme samples were incubated with or without 0.1 mm acetylsalicylate at 37 °C; aliquots were removed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 min, and cyclooxygenase activity was measured as described above. Values for t12 were determined from plots of the logarithm of activity versustime. For determination of the stereoselectivity of Tyr-355 mutant enzymes with R versus S-ibuprofen, these inhibitors were added to the O2 electrode assay chamber at various concentrations prior to the addition of microsomal enzyme preparations. IC50 values for each of the stereoisomers of ibuprofen were determined, and the R/S ratios for inhibition of each of the Tyr-355 mutant enzymes and native oPGHS-1 were calculated. For time-dependent inhibition studies, flurbiprofen at an appropriate concentration (e.g. 50 μm) was preincubated with the enzyme (250 μg of microsomal protein) at 37 °C for various times; cyclooxygenase measurements were then performed upon adding enzyme-inhibitor complex to the assay chamber. Microsomal samples (∼5 μg of protein) were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes using a Hoeffer Scientific Semi-dry Transfer apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 12 h in 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline, followed by a 2-h incubation with a peptide-directed antibody against oPGHS-1 (40Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 1% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline at room temperature. Membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, after which they were incubated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents and exposed to film for chemiluminescence. A general protocol for product analysis is as follows. Forty hours following transfection, COS-1 cells were collected, sonicated, and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the cell suspension (100–250 μg of protein) were incubated for 1–10 min at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm phenol and 6.8 μg of bovine hemoglobin in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were initiated with 35 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid and were performed with or without 200 μm flurbiprofen and stopped by adding 1.4 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1; v/v). Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 0.6 ml of CHCl3 and 0.32 ml of 0.88% formic acid were added to the resulting supernatant. The organic phase was collected, dried under N2, redissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3, and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate; the lipid products were chromatographed for 1 h in benzene:dioxane:formic acid:acetic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v). Products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Negative control values from samples incubated with 200 μm flurbiprofen were subtracted from the experimental values observed for each sample in the absence of flurbiprofen. For RP-HPLC analyses of products, native or mutant oPGHS-1 (1 mg of microsomal protein) was reacted with 100 μm arachidonic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, and products were collected as described previously (23Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Products were dried under N2 and resuspended in HPLC buffers (1:1, v/v). 15- and 11-HETEs were separated by reverse phase-HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac); the Waters model 600 HPLC was equipped with a 990 photo diode array detector set to 200 and 234 nm. The strong component of the mobile phase was 0.1% acetic acid, and the eluting solvent was acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The following elution profile was used. Initial conditions were 30% acetonitrile, increased linearly over 30 min to 50% acetonitrile, then increased linearly from 30 to 100 min to 75% acetonitrile, then increased linearly from 100 to 125 min to 100% acetonitrile and held for 5 min at 100% before returning to initial conditions. The retention times of 15-HETE and 11-HETE averaged 36 and 38 min, respectively. Material obtained by RP-HPLC was esterified by treatment with excess diazomethane and subjected to chiral-phase HPLC. Chiral-phase HPLC separations of the methyl esters of 11- and 15-HETEs were performed with a Chiralcel OC column (250 × 4.6 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) using hexane/2-propanol (90:10, v/v) as the solvent and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Diazomethane was prepared from Diazald® and distilled in ether per the Aldrich Technical Bulletin AL-180. Mutations were modeled and analyzed in the program CHAIN (41Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar) using the coordinates from the crystal structure of Co3+-oPGHS-1 complexed with AA (Protein Data Bank code 1DIY) and Fe3+-oPGHS-1 complexed with flurbiprofen (Protein Data Bank code 1CQE). Statistical significance of the kinetic data (Fig. 5) was determined using a two-sample t test assuming equal variances. As illustrated in Fig. 1, arachidonic acid (AA) is bound in an extended L-conformation in the AA/Co3+-heme oPGHS-1 co-crystal structure (21Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The carboxylate group of AA interacts with Arg-120; the ω end abuts Ile-377 and Gly-533; the 13-pro-S-hydrogen is appropriately aligned with Tyr-385, and there is ample space for the first O2 insertion at C-11 and facile bridging of the incipient 11-hydroperoxyl radical to C-9 to form the endoperoxide. Formation of the cyclopentane ring is proposed to involve rotation about the C-10/C-11 bond and consequent movement of the ω terminus so that C-12 can react with the C-8 radical that is produced upon formation of the endoperoxide group; this movement, in turn, positions C-15 adjacent to Tyr-385 for a second antarafacial O2 insertion and a one-electron reduction of the 15-hydroperoxyl radical by Tyr-385 to regenerate the Tyr-385 radical (21Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the AA/Co3+-heme oPGHS-1 co-crystal structure AA makes two hydrophilic and 48 hydrophobic contacts involving a total of 19 residues in the first shell of the cyclooxygenase active site (Fig. 1and Table I (21Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). We have now mutated a total of 14 of the residues that are putatively involved in direct interactions with AA as well as four other residues (Leu-384, Phe-518, Met-522, and Leu-531) that are in the first shell of the active site but do not directly contact the substrate (Fig. 1; Tables I andII). In analyzing the various mutants, we identified the AA oxygenation products, determined kinetic constants for AA oxygenation, and measured peroxidase activity (TableIII). Cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities for native and all mutant enzymes were normalized to levels of protein expression determined from Western blot analysis and densitometric quantitation (23Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The results of Western transfer blotting indicated that the native enzyme as well as all mutants tested were expressed at similar levels by COS-1 cells (data not shown). A discussion of the implications of the results is presented below for individual residues.Table IContacts between AA and cyclooxygenase active site residuesvan der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions were calculated using CHAIN (41Sack J.S.

To identify such targets, we have synthesized and coupled PA to an agarose-based matrix, Affi-Gel 10. Using this matrix as an affinity reagent, we have identified a substantial number of potential PA-binding proteins from brain cytosol. One class of such proteins is known to be involved in intracellular traffic and it included coatomer, ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf), N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), and kinesin. Binding of these proteins to PA beads was suppressed by soluble PA, and it occurred preferentially over binding to beads coupled to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. For coatomer, Arf, and NSF, we verified direct binding to PA beads using purified proteins. For recombinant Arf1 and Arf6, binding to PA required myristoylation. In addition, for NSF and Arf6, an ATPase and a GTPase, respectively, binding to PA beads was extremely sensitive to the nucleotide state of the protein. Binding to PA may be a property linking together distinct participants in one complete round of membrane transport from a donor to an acceptor compartment.

Diacylglycerol was among the first lipids to emerge as a specific binding partner for protein kinase C, and more recently the phosphoinositides are attracting considerable attention in their roles of recruiting important signaling proteins to defined membrane compartments (1Newton A.C.

PA1 synthesized via the glycerol-3-phosphate or the hydroxyacetone phosphate pathway is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols (6Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The contribution of PA to lipid-based signaling is less well understood. Apart from the biosynthetic routes mentioned above, PA can be rapidly elevated in cells through hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D (PLD) (7Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 457-509Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 8Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because activation of PLD has been implicated in the regulation of cellular processes ranging from growth control to traffic, it is generally assumed that PA-interacting proteins downstream of PLD activation exist to mediate those functions (9Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 10Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, because PA elevated through PLD activation is unstable and rapidly converted to diacylglycerol via hydrolysis by PA hydrolases, in pathways where PLD activation is measurable it is not always clear whether PA or diacylglycerol is the relevant signaling lipid (11Hodgin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). One protein that has been shown to interact directly with PA is the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (12Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 13Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Translocation of Raf-1 from the cytosol to intracellular membranes (primarily endosomes) depends on the presence of PA and can be blocked by point mutations that abolish this interaction. The discovery of at least one protein that appears to interact directly with PA raises the possibility that additional such proteins exist, and their identification should be of considerable interest. In addition to a function in signaling, PA has been proposed to have a role in intracellular traffic. It was originally shown that artificial vesicles made with a mixture of lipids including PA were better able to bind coatomer (a coat protein complex involved in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex) than their counterparts prepared without PA (14Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, assays that recapitulate vesicle formation in vitro with pure lipid and protein components revealed that acidic phospholipids such as PA enhanced vesicle formation (15Matsuoka K. Orci L.

Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In other experiments, PA supplied exogenously to cells was able to rescue a block in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport of viral proteins imposed by primary alcohols (18Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, altering PA levels was shown to disrupt the structure of the Golgi complex and affect traffic through this organelle (19Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12023-12031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also indicated that PA synthesized via acylation of lysoPA may be involved in vesicle fission (“pinching off”) in the Golgi complex or at the plasma membrane (20Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchunk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D.

Narure. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The inherent instability of PA as discussed above complicates any attempt to assign significance to PA as opposed to diacylglycerol in some of these experimental settings. More importantly perhaps, because PA can stimulate formation of PI (4,5)P2 by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase directly (22Moritz A. De Graan P.N. Gispen W.H. Wirtz K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7207-7210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the search for the relevant lipid(s) in those pathways becomes even more complex and must include PI (4,5)P2. PI (4,5)P2has been shown to influence on its own the activation cycle of several small GTPases such as Arf that are crucially involved in membrane transport pathways (24Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI (4,5)P2 also interacts with other proteins involved in trafficking such as dynamin and clathrin-associated protein complex 2 (25Roth M.G. Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One way to identify PA-binding proteins is to use this lipid in an immobilized form and to isolate proteins that bind to it. A similar reagent containing immobilized PI (4,5)P2 can be used in parallel to determine whether candidate proteins show differential affinity for those two lipids. In this work, we have synthesized and used such reagents to identify a set of traffic-related proteins that showed strong binding to immobilized PA but not to immobilized PI (4,5)P2. The amino functionalized PA (Fig. 1 A, 2) was prepared in seven steps from the commercially available (S)-(+)-1,2-O-isopropylideneglycerol (Fig.1 A, 3) (Aldrich). The coupling of 2with the N-hydroxysuccinimide activated ester-agarose resin, Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad), required the solvent combination chloroform-methanol-water (0.8:1.0:0.2) to afford the PA-affinity reagent (1Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Excess resin (∼5 equivalents ofN-hydroxysuccinimide groups) was used. The resulting loading capacity was estimated to be 2.6 μmol/ml. The estimation was done by1H NMR analysis of the concentration of residual2 in the reaction mixture in the presence of the internal standard 1,3,5-myo-inositol orthoformate. In addition to the 2-palmitoyl derivative shown here, a 2-lauroyl derivative was prepared that showed identical binding characteristics. As a control of binding specificity we have also prepared and employed a 3-(ω-aminoacyl)-functionalized PI (4,5)P2 (Fig.1 B, 4) coupled via the amino function to an Affi-Gel 10 solid support. Details of both syntheses will be reported separately. 2Z. Y. Lim, J. W. Thuring, A. B. Holmes, M. Manifava, and N. T. Ktistakis, submitted for publication. All steps including centrifugation were carried out at 4 °C. 180 g of deep-frozen sheep brain was broken into small pieces and resuspended in ice-cold buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of antipain, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin) to a volume of 500 ml for 10–15 min until thawed. The tissue was then blended in a polytron until it reached a fine consistency and was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant from this spin contained the membrane and cytosolic fractions. For preparing cytosol, the supernatant from above was centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The new supernatant was dialyzed for 24 h against buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 90 mm KCl. The dialyzed material was centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, and the supernatant (cytosol) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The pellet from the first 100,000 × g spin was resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2m sucrose plus protease inhibitors as above) and placed in a steel Dounce homogenizer for 20 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm to remove debris, and the supernatant that contained membranes was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet after this spin (membranes) was resuspended by homogenization to a total of 20 ml of homogenization buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Cytosol at 6 mg/ml was mixed 1:1 with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) on ice and centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge to remove any aggregates. The PA beads, which were stored in water plus 0.02% sodium azide, were equilibrated with three washes in ipp buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide) and were resuspended in this buffer to give a 10% (v/v) suspension. In a typical binding reaction, 450 μl of diluted cytosol were mixed with 35 μl of bead solution in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube on ice. A few air bubbles were created to effect better mixing. The tubes were put in a rotator at 4 °C for 1.5–2 h. Following binding, the beads were washed quickly three times with ipp buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, soluble PA was included in the binding reaction as follows: l-α-phosphatidic acid (dioctanoyl, dilauroyl, or dipalmitoyl purchased from Sigma) that was dissolved in chloroform at 10 mg/ml and kept at −20 °C was warmed to room temperature and put into a glass tube. The lipid solution was dried for 10 min under a stream of nitrogen. To the dried lipid film, lysis buffer was added carefully to avoid creating any bubbles. The tubes were then sonicated for 5 min until a clear solution was obtained. This solution was stable for a few hours at room temperature until ready to use. In competition experiments, the cytosol was mixed 1:1 with lysis buffer that had been supplemented with PA solution and kept on ice for 15 min. Lipid beads were then added, and the binding reaction was carried out as described above. The beads could be reused up to five times. At the end of an experiment, beads were collected using ipp buffer and centrifuged. To the pellet, sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol) was added to make a 25% bead suspension for 10 min. The beads were then washed six times with ipp buffer and were stored at 4 °C as a 10% suspension in ipp buffer. Coomassie-stained gel bands were excised and fragmented. The gel pieces were subjected to the following steps, 30 min each at room temperature on a tube rotator, and then the washes were discarded: 1) wash with 250 μl 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate/50%MeCN; 2) reduce with 5 mmtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 200 μl of 200 mmammonium bicarbonate, 50% MeCN; 3) alkylate in the dark by adding 20 μl of 0.25 m iodoacetamide (final concentration, 23 mm); 4) wash as in step 1; and 5) dry under vacuum. Gel pieces were reswollen at 0 °C in 40 μl of 100 mmammonium bicarbonate containing 10 μg/ml modified trypsin (Promega). After 45 min, excess solution was aspirated (54Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar), and digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C, for 22 h. The digest supernatant was acidified with 2 μl of 10% formic acid, and peptides were recovered by immobilization and subsequent desalting on a Vydac C8 guard cartridge (μPurifierTM; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Washing was with 1% formic acid, and peptides were eluted to a nanospray needle (Protana, Odense, Denmark) using 1–2 μl of 0.1% formic acid, 70% methanol. Peptide masses were examined using a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer fitted with a Protana nanospray interface. All significant peaks were examined for charge state and monoisotopic mass value in zoomscan mode and subjected to collision induced dissociation. Mass/fragmentation data sets were submitted to Mascot for data base searching (55Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). Results were scored by Mascot, and only those scoring significantly higher (p < 0.05) than a chance match were regarded as positive identifications. Only peptides giving matching fragmentation data were scored; matching by peptide mass only was not included. The number of peptides matched per protein discussed in this work were 12 for kinesin, 17 for puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, 12 for neurochondrin, and 5 for NSF.

Plasmids expressing wild type and mutant Arf1 and Arf6 genes were a kind gift of Dr. Julie Donaldson (45Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Transfection into COS-7 cells was using DEAE-dextran as described before (57Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Detection of Arf1 and Arf6 proteins by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence was done using antibodies to the hemagglutinin epitope. To identify potential PA-binding proteins we synthesized a solid phase PA-based matrix as shown in Fig.1 A. In this reagent, the head group of the phospholipid is expected to be exposed to the solvent (and therefore available for binding), whereas the fatty acid at the 3 position anchors the PA to the Affi-Gel 10 resin. Although the 2-palmitoyl derivative is shown here, we have also synthesized and used a 2-lauroyl derivative, which showed identical binding characteristics. In addition, we have used a 2-palmitoyl PI (4,5)P2immobilized Affi-Gel 10 reagent (shown in Fig. 1 B) to directly compare affinities of candidate proteins to the two lipids. We initially used brain cytosol as a source of material. In preliminary experiments we found that cytosol without detergent gave unacceptably high binding to the beads (data not shown). We used nonionic detergent in the cytosol solution to overcome this problem, because other types of detergent (ionic or zwitterionic) appeared to reduce binding to very low levels. When cytosol supplemented with Nonidet P-40 was incubated with the PA beads and unbound material was removed with several washes, a reasonable number of polypeptides were seen to be in the PA-bound fraction (Fig. 2). This pattern of staining is very reproducible. If those polypeptides were binding specifically to immobilized PA, then soluble PA should reduce their binding to the beads. Initial attempts at such inhibition of binding using dipalmitoyl PA (the same lipid as that coupled to the beads) were unsuccessful, perhaps because of the poor solubility of this lipid. Inhibition of binding was obtained, however, with shorter chain analogs of PA (dilauroyl, C:12 or dioctanoyl, C:8), which also showed superior solubility and sonication properties. When cytosol was preincubated with soluble dilauroyl PA, a substantial number of PA-bound bands were reduced in intensity (Fig. 2, asterisks). Interestingly, the presence of soluble PA also seemed to enhance the binding of some proteins to the PA beads, whereas binding for other polypeptides was unaffected. Here we deal with polypeptides whose binding to the PA beads is reduced in the presence of soluble PA. Mass spectrometry was used to establish the identity of the PA-binding polypeptides. In addition, we determined directly the identity of some polypeptides using immunoblotting. From both protocols, we have identified 15 known and 5 novel proteins in the PA-bound fraction from brain cytosol. An additional 8–10 polypeptides have been obtained from brain membranes extracted with detergent, and their identification by mass spectrometry is in progress. In this work, we will discuss proteins involved in intracellular traffic (coatomer, Arf, kinesin, and NSF) whose binding to PA beads has been characterized further. From the remaining known proteins, we have cloned, expressed, and verified binding to PA beads of nordin (or neurochondrin), thought to be involved in somatodendritic functions in neuronal cells (26Ishizuka Y.

The Raf-1 kinase bound to the PA beads at levels comparable with neurochondrin and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase. Immunoblotting of PA-bound fractions with antibodies to the β-cop coatomer subunit or to native Arf revealed binding of these proteins to the PA beads (Fig.3 A). There was no binding to uncoupled Affi-Gel beads or aggregation in the absence of any beads (data not shown). More importantly, β-cop and Arf bound weakly to 2-palmitoyl PI (4,5)P2 beads (Fig. 3 A), indicating that binding was to the head group and not to the acyl chain of PA. To verify that the PI (4,5)P2 beads bound proteins known to interact with this lipid, we probed the blots with antibodies to PLCδ1, a protein known to bind PI (4,5)P2 through its pleckstrin homology domain with a Kd value in the range of 0.1–10 μm (29Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 30Yagisawa H. Sakuma K. Paterson H.F. Cheung R. Allen V. Hirata H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Under conditions where binding of β-cop and Arf to PI (4,5)P2 was minimal, there was strong binding of PLCδ (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, there was undetectable PLCδ bound to the PA beads (Fig. 3 A). As an additional control of the specificity of binding, we determined that protein kinase C, a protein abundant in the cytosol and known to bind to acidic phospholipids (such as phosphatidylserine) and to diacylglycerol (a dephosphorylated PA) did not bind to the PA or PI (4,5)P2 beads (Fig. 3 A). Additional traffic-related proteins were identified from mass spectrometric analysis of the PA-bound bands shown in Fig. 2. One such was NSF, an ATPase involved in numerous transport steps (31Beckers C.J.M. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and its presence in the PA-bound fraction was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, little SNAP (solubleNSF attachment protein), which is a binding partner of NSF (33Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), was detected in the PA-bound fraction (Fig. 3 B). A second protein identified from mass spectrometric analysis of the PA-bound bands shown in Fig. 2 was the heavy chain of kinesin, a microtubule motor protein involved in numerous transport steps (34Bloom G.S. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1277-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The presence of kinesin in the PA-bound fraction was verified using two monoclonal antibodies to this protein (Fig. 3 C) (36Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.A. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There was no NSF or kinesin bound to uncoupled or to PI (4,5)P2 beads (data not shown but see Fig. 5). For all traffic-related proteins discussed above, we verified that binding to PA beads could be competed with exogenously supplied short chain PA (Fig. 3 D and data not shown for NSF). In all cases, dilauroyl PA inhibited binding at lower doses than dioctanoyl PA (data not shown). We speculate that this may be related to the height of the head group in the mixed micelles used for competition, with the “taller” dilauroyl lipid having a more accessible head group to serve as a competitor in the binding reaction. Because we used the shorter chain lipid in the competition reaction, we also synthesized the 2-lauroyl-PA resin and were able to show that its binding characteristics were very similar to the 2-palmitoyl counterpart (data not shown). We have tried to compete binding to PA beads with a number of other reagents, in all cases obtaining negative results. Those included phosphate ions (up to 100 mm), glycerolphosphate (up to 50 mm), ATP (up to 10 mm), GTP (up to 10 mm), and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (up to 300 μm) (data not shown). The observed binding of β-cop to PA beads raises the question of whether the entire coatomer complex (37Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) is present in the PA-bound fraction and whether binding is direct. Using native coatomer that was 50% pure and did not contain any Arf, we found all coatomer subunits in the PA-bound fraction (Fig.4 A, lanes 6 and7). Prominent noncoatomer-related bands contaminating the starting preparation were totally excluded from the bound fraction (Fig. 4 A, bands marked withasterisks). We also attempted to disassemble coatomer using high salt to find which of the subunit(s) contain(s) PA-binding sites. We were unable to answer this question because conditions of disassembly also interfere with binding to the PA beads (data not shown). It was of interest to ask whether coats related to coatomer also showed binding to PA beads. The PA-bound fraction from cytosol was resolved in triplicate and probed with antibodies to β-cop, γ-adaptin (a subunit of the AP-1 coat involved in Golgi traffic (38Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)) and α-adaptin (a subunit of the AP-2 coat involved in endosome and plasma membrane traffic (39West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Only β-cop showed strong binding to the PA beads (Fig. 4 B). Because coatomer and Arf are capable of interacting in vivo(40Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 1993: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 41Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 43Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the presence of one would affect the ability of the other to bind to PA beads under nonactivating conditions for Arf. When purified coatomer was incubated with PA beads in the presence of increasing amounts of purified Arf, there was no effect of Arf on the amount of coatomer bound (Fig. 4 C). The converse experiment (increasing coatomer in the presence of constant Arf) showed similar results (data not shown). Thus, both coatomer and Arf bound to PA independently of each other and without assistance from other factors. For interaction of activated Arf with coatomer"

It consists of linear repeating disaccharide chains cross-linked by short peptide bridges. During the cytoplasmic steps involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor, four ADP-forming ligases (namely the Mur ligases) catalyze the assembly of the peptide moiety by the successive addition of l-alanine,d-glutamate, diaminopimelic acid, or l-lysine, and, finally, dipeptide d-alanyl-d-alanine to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (1Bugg T.D.

Because all these enzymes are essential for cell viability, they are attractive targets for antibacterial chemotherapy. In Escherichia coli, these ligases are the products of the murC, murD,murE, and murF genes, located in themra region (3Mengin-Lecreulx D. Ayala J. Bouhss A. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Hara H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the four E. coli Mur ligases shows several homologous regions, suggesting that these enzymes may be evolutionarily related and may use similar enzymatic mechanisms (4Ikeda M. Wachi M. Jung H.K. Ishino F. Matsuhashi M. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1990; 36: 179-187Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In earlier publications, we reported the structure of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine:d-glutamate ligase (MurD),1 both in the native form and complexed with substrates (7Bertrand J.A. Auger G. Fanchon E. Martin L. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3416-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Bertrand J.A. Auger G. Martin L. Fanchon E. Blanot D.

Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MurD consists of three domains with topologies reminiscent of a nucleotide-binding fold; the N- and C-terminal domains have a dinucleotide-binding fold (the Rossmann fold), and the central domain displays a mononucleotide-binding fold, also seen in ATP-binding proteins. A comparison of six MurD structures reveals that large C-terminal rotation, loop rearrangement, and subdomain movements occur upon substrate binding (9Bertrand J.A. Fanchon E. Martin L. Chantalat L. Auger G. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, several potentially important residues for substrate binding and/or catalysis have been identified (10Bouhss A. Dementin S. Parquet C. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Bertrand J.A. Le Beller D. Dideberg O. van Heijenoort J. Blanot D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12240-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray structure of the folylpoly-γ-l-glutamate synthetase (FGS) of Lactobacillus caseihas been reported (11Sun X. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite low sequence identity, FGS and MurD are clearly both members of the Mur ADP-forming ligase superfamily (9Bertrand J.A. Fanchon E. Martin L. Chantalat L. Auger G. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,12Sheng Y. Sun X. Shen Y. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 425-438Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In E. coli, MurE catalyzes the addition ofmeso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm) to the nucleotide precursor, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu (UMAG), according to the reaction: UMAG + meso-A2pm + ATP ↔ UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-A2pm (UMT) + ADP + Pi. As established with other Mur ligases, the MurE reaction presumably proceeds by phosphorylation of the C-terminal carboxylate of UMAG by the γ-phosphate of ATP to form an acyl phosphate intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by the α-amino group of A2pm to produce UMT (Fig.1), ADP, and inorganic phosphate (13Falk P.J. Ervin K.M. Volk K.S. Ho H.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Vaganay S. Tanner M.E. van Heijenoort J. Blanot D. Microbial Drug Resistance. 1996; 2: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Bouhss A. Dementin S. van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Blanot D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This mechanism is supported by the three-dimensional structures of MurD and MurD complexes. Some bacteria (such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis) containmeso-A2pm, and others (such asStreptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) contain l-lysine at the third position of the peptide side chain of cell wall peptidoglycan. In each case, the MurE enzymes have been shown to efficiently discriminate between these two amino acids in vitro, because they are only able to catalyze the addition of either meso-A2pm orl-lysine to UMAG (16Ito E. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3131-3136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because these two amino acids effectively coexist in bacterial cells, the high specificity of the MurE enzymes acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that only the specific substrate is incorporated in the peptidoglycan presursor. However, this difference in specificity is not clearly reflected in the protein sequence, because only 28 and 32‥ identity is seen between theE. coli and S. pneumoniae or E. coliand B. subtilis sequences, respectively. This report describes the crystal structure of E. coli MurE in the presence of the UMT reaction product. The structure reveals that the enzyme has a three-domain topology and allows the localization of the active site and the identification of the residues involved in UMT binding. In addition, we compare and discuss the two structurally characterized ligases, MurD and MurE. DNA restriction enzymes and synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec or New England Biolabs. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA was performed in a Thermocycler 60 apparatus (Bio-med) using Taq polymerase (Appligene), and DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard purification system.meso-[14C]A2pm was obtained from the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France). UMAG was synthesized from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-Ala, using purified MurD (18Auger G. Martin L. Bertrand J. Ferrari P. Fanchon E. Vaganay S. Pétillot Y. van Heijenoort J. Blanot D. Dideberg O. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and UMT was prepared as previously described (19Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). E. coli strains JM83 (ara Δ [lac-proAB] rpsL thi φ80 dlacZ Δ M15) (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) and B180 (ΔmetA::Cmr) (21Richaud C. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Pochet S. Johnson E.J. Cohen G.N. Marlière P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26827-26835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as plasmid hosts and for the preparation of the overproduced His6-tagged MurE enzyme. The pTrcHis60 plasmid, a pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) derivative for the production of C-terminal His6-tagged proteins, has been recently described (22Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2YT medium (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) or M9 minimal medium (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for growing cells, with growth being monitored at 600 nm with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. For strains carrying drug resistance genes, the antibiotics used were ampicillin (100 μg·ml−1) and chloramphenicol (25 μg·ml−1). Small and large scale plasmid isolations were carried out by the alkaline lysis method, and standard procedures were used for endonuclease digestions, ligation, and agarose electrophoresis (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli cells were made competent and transformed with plasmid DNA using the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (25Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). A plasmid suitable for high level overproduction of MurE (C-terminal His6-tagged form) was constructed as follows. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to incorporate a NcoI site (shown in boldface type) 5′ to the initiation codon (underlined) of murE, 5′-GGGACCCATGGCAGATCGTAATTTGCGCGAC-3′, and a BglII site (in boldface type) 3′ to the gene without its stop codon, 5′-TACGCAGATCTTGCAATCACCCCCAGCAG-3′. These primers were used to amplify the murE gene from the E. coli chromosome, and then the resulting material was treated with NcoI and BglII and ligated between the same sites of vector pTrcHis60, resulting in pMLD117, a plasmid allowing expression of the gene under the control of the strong isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducibletrc promoter. JM83 (pMLD117) cells were grown exponentially at 37 °C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (18 liters of culture in a fermenter). At an optical density of 0.1, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h (final optical density was 1.3). The cells were harvested at 4 °C (about 45 g of wet weight), and the cell pellets were washed with cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 mmMgCl2 (buffer A) and then stored at −20 °C. Cells from one-fifth of the preparation were suspended in 9 ml of buffer A and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C using a Bioblock Vibracell 72412 sonicator. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 200,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that MurE accounted for about 20‥ of the crude protein soluble extract (data not shown). For the preparation of the MurE protein in which all methionine residues were replaced by selenomethionine (SeMurE), E. colimethionine-auxotrophic strain β180 was transformed with plasmid pMLD117, and the resulting strain was cultured in M9 medium (2 liter culture) supplemented with 0.4‥ glucose, ampicillin, and all the usual amino acids (100 μg·ml−1), except thatl-selenomethionine was substituted forl-methionine. Expression of murE was induced at mid-log phase (optical density was 0.6) with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cell growth was allowed to continue for a further 3 h (final optical density was 1.8). The cells were then harvested, washed in buffer A, and disrupted by sonication, and the crude protein extract was prepared as described above. The His6-tagged proteins (MurE and SeMurE) were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose essentially following the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen): binding to the resin, washing with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl, and elution of the adsorbed proteins by a discontinuous gradient of 20–300 mm imidazole (MurE and SeMurE behaved similarly and eluted at a concentration of imidazole of about 150 mm). The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmdithiothreitol and 200 mm NaCl and then concentrated on PM10 membranes (Millipore) to ∼12 mg·ml−1 for use in crystallization experiments. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of proteins performed on 12‥ polyacrylamide gels (26Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) showed that the His6-tagged proteins were at least 90‥ pure. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Typically, 15–20 mg of pure protein (MurE or SeMurE) were obtained per liter of culture. Amino acid and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) analyses confirmed the composition and molecular mass of the two proteins as well as the 100‥ selenomethionine substitution in SeMurE. The meso-A2pm adding activity was assayed by measuring the formation of radioactive UMT. The reaction mixture (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, 0.1m MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm UMAG, and 0.1 mm meso-[14C]A2pm (1.5 KBq); total volume, 75 μl) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of glacial acetic acid and the radioactive substrate and product were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil 5C18column (4.6 × 150 mm; Alltech France, Templemars, France) using 50 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.9, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml·min−1. Detection was performed with a radioactive flow detector (model LB506-C1; EG&G Wallac/Berthold, Evry, France) using the Quicksafe Flow 2 scintillator (Zinsser Analytic, Maidenhead, UK), and quantification was carried out using the Winflow software (EG&G Wallac/Berthold). The activity of the pure preparation of His6-tagged MurE enzyme was 625 nmol ofmeso-A2pm incorporated in UMT per min and mg of protein. MurE, expressed as a C-terminal His6-tagged protein, consists of 502 amino acids (molecular mass was 54,278.5 Da). Crystals of native and selenomethionyl MurE were grown in the presence of the reaction product, UMT. Drops of 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg·ml−1 of purified enzyme, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm UMT) and 2 μl of reservoir buffer (0.1 mHEPES, pH 7.5, 13‥ polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5,000, 0.5m LiCl, 10‥ isopropanol, and 5 mmdithiothreitol) were equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir buffer. The crystals, space group C2221, had unit cell dimensions ofa = 93.27 Å, b = 99.51 Å, andc = 234.34 Å, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data collection was carried out on a single flash cooled crystal at three wavelengths on a BM14 beam line (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). The long c axis was aligned so that it was almost coincident with the spindle axis, and data were collected at 2.8 Å resolution using a MAR ccd detector. The range of data collection was determined using STRATEGY (28Ravelli R.B.G. Sweet R.M. Skinner J.M. Duisenberg A.J.M. Kroon J. J. Appl.

All 24 selenium positions in the asymmetric unit were found, and experimental phases were calculated from these using a multiple isomorphous approach. The noncrystallographic symmetry was defined using FINDNCS (32Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar). Density modification (33Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The resulting experimental map was of excellent quality. The majority of the model was traced automatically using wARP (34Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Refinement to 2 Å was carried out by sequential use of the Crystallography and NMR Systems program (35Adams P.D.

The final model consists of two molecules of MurE (992 visible residues, of which 10 have been modeled with double conformations), 141 ligand atoms, and 394 water molecules. The stereochemistry of the final model was evaluated using the PROCHECK program (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates of the MurE structure have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession code 1e8c) and will be released 1 year after publication. The final model, which contains 992 residues, two UMT molecules, and 394 water molecules, had a crystallographic R factor of 20.2‥ (Rfree = 23.0‥; Ref. 38Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) for all 72,674 reflections in the resolution range 46.7–2.0 Å (TableII). The root mean square (rms) deviations were 0.006 Å from ideal bond lengths and 1.3° from ideal bond angles. After density modification, the experimental density map was of good quality. Fig. 2 shows the chemical modification of Lys224 by covalent binding to three atoms (see “Discussion”). The asymmetric unit contains two molecules (A and B) of MurE, essentially identical in conformation. After superimposition, the rms deviation between 495 pairs of equivalent Cα was 0.45 Å. No symmetry was seen between the two molecules. The Ramachandran plot (39Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar) for the present model showed all the nonglycine residues to be in allowed regions. The average temperature factors were slightly different for molecules A and B (29.9 and 31.4 Å2, respectively) but identical for the two UMT molecules (39.5 Å2). A few residues at either end of the polypeptide chain had no visible electron density and were therefore not included in the model. However, 25 and 20 residues (molecule A and B, respectively) clearly showed holes in the electron density map. The damage was produced by third generation synchrotron radiation (40Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (336) Google Scholar), the most frequent being decarboxylation of acidic residues.

Domain 1 comprises residues 1–88 and consists of a five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by two helices (Fig.4 a). Comparison of its structure with the data base of known protein structures carried out using the DALI server (41Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) revealed no homology with known protein structures; the structure showing the greatest similarity is a fragment of the transferrin receptor (42Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) with a rms deviation of 3.9 Å for the 70 structurally equivalent Cα atoms. Domain 2 (Fig. 4 b) comprises residues 90–338 and consists of a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices. The fold of the central β-sheet is similar to the classic “mononucleotide-binding fold” found in many ATP-binding proteins, and domain 2 will therefore be referred to as the ATP-binding domain. As expected, using DALI, the structures with the highest Z scores were the central domain of MurD (7Bertrand J.A. Auger G. Fanchon E. Martin L. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3416-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code1uag; Z score = 20.0) and the N-terminal domain of FGS (11Sun X. Bognar A.L. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1fgs; Z score = 9.7). Superposition of domain 2 on the corresponding domain of the two ligases gave an rms deviation of 3.1 Å for the 193 structurally equivalent Cαs for MurD and 3.5 Å for the 168 Cαs for FGS. The loop between β6 and α4 of the ATPase domain (also referred to as the P loop) is probably involved in ATP binding. Domain 3 (340) contains a six-stranded β-sheet with parallel strands (β17, β18, β19, β20, and β21) and an antiparallel strand (β16), and five surrounding α-helices (Fig. 4 c). Surprisingly, as already observed for the C-terminal domains of MurD and FGS, domain 3 contains a Rossmann fold (Z score = 10.9 and 10.8 for MurD and FGS, respectively). Moreover, superposition of domain 3 on the corresponding domain of the two ligases gave an rms deviation of 2.7 Å for the 119 structurally equivalents Cαs for MurD and 2.4 Å for the 107 Cαs for FGS. The large insertion (464) between strands β22 and β23 has no structural equivalent in MurD and FGS. The product, UMT, binds in the cleft between the three domains. The experimental electron density map showed almost all of both UMT molecules. In the early stage of refinement, only the A2pm density was difficult to interpret. As shown in Fig.5, the bound UMT makes many polar interactions with the protein. The domain 1 residues involved in UMT binding are located in the two loops connecting β1 with β2 and β2 with α2. The geometry of the uridine-ribose moiety of the two UMT molecules is C2′-endo for the ribose ring pucker (χ = −114.5°) and an anti-orientation about the glycosyl bond. The uracyl ring forms two hydrogen bonds with Ser28, these being between O2 and the main chain nitrogen and between N3 and Oγ. In addition, it is inserted between a salt bridge (between Asp27 and Arg29) and Tyr50. Interestingly, C5and C6 of the pyrimidine ring are exposed to the solvent, explaining how dihydrouridine can replace uridine in the nucleotide substrate with little effect on the Km (97 μm versus 55 μm for the natural substrate) (43Abo-Ghalia M. Michaud C. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pyrophosphate of UMT interacts with the loop connecting β2 with α2 (residues 42–47). The protein-phosphate interactions are made mainly through hydrogen bonds with main chain nitrogens, the α-phosphate oxygens forming hydrogen bonds with Gln44 and Ala45, and the β-phosphate oxygens with His43. One of the β-phosphate oxygens forms hydrogen bonds with ND1 of His43; the latter is the only residue to balance the negative charges of the pyrophosphate. The N-acetylmuramic acid ring bridges the gap between domain 1 and the ATP-binding domain. Two groups of hydrogen bonds are important; Oδ1 of Asn156 interact with O4′, and Gln190 and Arg192 are in contact with the acetyl group. Interestingly, Arg192 forms three other hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of l-Ala and Oε1 of d-Glu. In the ATP-binding domain, three loops are close to the product (β8-α5, β9-α6, and α6-β10). Finally, the A2pm-containing region of UMT forms five hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal domain, the atoms involved being located in two loops connecting secondary structure elements (β19-α14) and (β21-β22). These very important interactions are discussed below. An alignment analysis using the 20 MurE sequences currently available shows that 24 amino acid residues are strictly conserved; none of these are found in the N-terminal domain, whereas 14 occur in the ATP-binding domain and 10 are in the C-terminal domain. Fig. 6shows the sequence alignment; for clarity, only four representative MurE ligase sequences were used (E. coli, B. subtilis, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae). Of the 24 strictly conserved residues, only three (Thr158, Ser185, and Arg192) interact with the product, UMT. Eight others (Gly115, Gly118, Lys119, Glu182, His210, Asn310, Arg341, and Asp356) are invariant residues conserved in all the members of"

CD98hc also binds specifically to the integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain and regulates integrin function. In this study, we examined the relationship between the ability of CD98hc to stimulate amino acid transport and to affect integrin function. By constructing chimeras with CD98hc and a type II transmembrane protein (CD69), we found that the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc are required for its effects on integrin function, while the extracellular domain is required for stimulation of isoleucine transport. Consequently, the capacity to promote amino acid transport is not required for CD98hc's effect on integrin function. Furthermore, a mutant of CD98hc that lacks its integrin binding site can still promote increased isoleucine transport. Thus, these two functions of CD98hc are separable and require distinct domains of the protein.

CD98hc expression is tightly linked to cell proliferation, and antibodies against CD98hc can inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis in specific cell types (2Yagita H. Masuko T. Hashimoto Y.

A compelling body of evidence implicates CD98hc in the transport of amino acids. CD98hc overexpression stimulates multiple amino acid transport systems including L, y+L, and xc− (4Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in its closest paralogue, D2 (r-BAT), lead to a disorder of cysteine transport (5Calonge M.J. Gasparini P. Chillaron J. Chillon M. Gallucci M. Rousaud F. Zelante L. Testar X.

Structurally, CD98 is a disulfide-bonded heterodimer of a common ∼80-kDa heavy chain (CD98hc) with one of several ∼40-kDa light chains. Because these light chains have multiple membrane-spanning domains, they resemble permeases and are believed to provide the amino acid transport activity of CD98 (6Mastroberardino L. Spindler B.

CD98hc may act to regulate the expression and cellular localization of the amino acid transporting activity of the light chain (6Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J.

Thus, this widely distributed membrane protein is strongly implicated in amino acid transport.There is also a growing literature implicating CD98hc in integrin function. Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors expressed in almost every multicellular animal cell type (10Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Cells can rapidly modulate their integrins' affinity for extracellular ligands (activation), thereby regulating multiple integrin-dependent functions (11Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is inhibited by overexpression of isolated β1A integrin cytoplasmic domains (dominant suppression) (12Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD98hc was identified as an integrin regulator in an expression-cloning scheme for proteins that can complement dominant suppression (CODS)1 (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, CD98hc binds to integrin β1A cytoplasmic domains, and this interaction correlates with CODS (14Zent R.

Furthermore, clustering CD98hc activates multiple integrin-dependent functions (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H.

Woodside D.G. McIntyre B.W. Immunology. 2000; 99: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, CD98hc physically and functionally interacts with integrin adhesion receptors. Indeed, clustering of CD98hc can stimulate several classes of integrins in multiple cell types (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Morikawa S. Kawano M. Kusugawa S. Komada H. Nishio M. Ito Y.

We found that the CD98hc alone is necessary and sufficient for the interaction of CD98 with the β1A integrin tail and for CODS. By forming chimeras between CD98hc and another type II transmembrane protein, we found that the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc are required for integrin interactions but not for stimulation of isoleucine transport. In contrast, the CD98hc extracellular domain was required for stimulation of amino acid transport. Thus, the amino acid transport activity and integrin interactions of CD98 are independent activities of the protein and are mediated by different domains of CD98hc.DISCUSSIONCD98hc combines with several different light chains to form a series of heterodimers that are involved in amino acid transport. CD98hc binds to integrin β1A cytoplasmic domains and blocks the capacity of β1A cytoplasmic domains to suppress integrin activation (CODS). We have compared the structural requirements of CD98hc for interaction with integrins with those involved in regulation of amino acid transport. Here we report that: 1) mutation of cysteines that disrupt CD98 heavy-light chain association and reduce amino acid transport do not disrupt its binding to β1A or its effect on integrin activation. 2) The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc fused to another type II transmembrane protein are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the integrin β1A tail and for CODS. This chimera failed to stimulate amino acid transport. 3) Replacement of the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of CD98hc with those of CD69 blocked the capacity of CD98hc to bind to β1A and regulate integrin activation, but had minimal effects on the amino acid transport function of CD98. Thus, the amino acid transport function of CD98 is not required for its effects on integrin function, and amino acid transport can occur in the absence of CD98hc-integrin association.The formation of a covalent CD98 heterodimer is not required for its effects on integrin function. CD98hc has two extracellular cysteines Cys109 and Cys330. Cys109 is near the transmembrane domain of CD98hc and results in a disulfide bridge with a cysteine in an extracellular loop of the light chain between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (25Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys109 and Cys330 disrupted the covalent association with the light chain but did not impair interactions with or effects on integrins. While the covalent association was lost, it is possible that there was still a noncovalent interaction. Indeed, Pfeiffer et al. (25Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that the C109S mutant does still support the surface expression of the light chain. The C109S mutation still displays the same transport characteristics as the disulfide-bound heterodimers, albeit at a reduced rate. Moreover, we also found that overexpressed free heavy chains could also bind to the β1A tail. Furthermore, cotransfection of the hLAT1 light chain increased formation of heterodimers and amino acid transport but did not augment integrin interactions or effects. Consequently, our results indicate that the covalent association of CD98hc with a light chain is not required for its interaction with integrins or for the functional regulation of integrins.The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the integrin β1A tail and for effects on integrin function. When either of these domains was removed from CD98hc, integrin interactions were lost. Conversely, effects on integrins could be conveyed to CD69 by addition of these two domains. What is the role of the CD98hc transmembrane domain in binding to the β1A cytoplasmic tail? It is possible that the CD98hc transmembrane domain influences the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain to promote binding to integrin cytoplasmic domains. Alternatively, our integrin cytoplasmic domain model protein was based on that predicted from the sequence (ITB1_human) in the Swiss-Prot data base (Entry P05556). Glycosylation mapping studies have suggested that β1A (Lys752–Ile757) of the predicted “cytoplasmic” domain may reside in the membrane (27Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consequently, the CD98hc transmembrane domain may directly interact with a transmembrane portion of our model protein “tail.” Furthermore, other integrin-binding proteins, such as cytohesin-1, Rack1, and skelemin also bind the membrane proximal region (28Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of this region in the membrane may specify preferential binding of integrin-associated proteins. Finally, the CD98hc solubilized from membranes could be associated with other proteins via the transmembrane domains. These “adapters” might contribute to the CD98hc-β1A tail interaction. In any case, our studies provide the first delineation of a specific functional role for the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc, interaction with and regulation of β1A integrin function.Regulation of amino acid transport and integrins by CD98hc is a distinct and separable function of the polypeptide. Chimeras in which the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of CD98hc were replaced with those of CD69 lost the capacity to bind to β1A and regulate integrin activation. In contrast, these replacements had little effect on the amino acid transport function of CD98. Conversely, the exchange of the extracellular domain of CD98hc with that of CD69 resulted in a protein that was still capable of affecting integrin function but did not stimulate isoleucine transport. Thus, the amino acid transport activity of CD98hc is not required for its effect on integrin function.CD98hc functions as a chaperone to bring the associated light chains (LAT1, LAT2, y+LAT1, y+LAT2, xCT, and asc-1) to the plasma membrane (29Verrey F.

Hypertens. 2000; 9: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the interaction of CD98hc with integrins and amino acid transporters are ascribable to distinct domains of the protein and are not mutually exclusive. Integrin-mediated adhesion often leads to the polarization of these receptors to the adherent cell surface. Consequently, the integrin-CD98hc interaction may serve to polarize the localization of CD98 and, consequently, amino acid transport. Conversely, CD98hc can influence multiple integrin-dependent functions, including virus-induced cell fusion, T-cell costimulation, and cell adhesion (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,15Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Morikawa S. Kawano M. Kusugawa S. Komada H. Nishio M. Ito Y.

Thus, the CD98hc-integrin association can promote integrin-mediated cell adhesion that, in turn, could serve to localize the activities of CD98hc-linked amino acid transporters.

CD98hc may act to regulate the expression and cellular localization of the amino acid transporting activity of the light chain (6Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J.

There is also a growing literature implicating CD98hc in integrin function. Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors expressed in almost every multicellular animal cell type (10Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Cells can rapidly modulate their integrins' affinity for extracellular ligands (activation), thereby regulating multiple integrin-dependent functions (11Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Integrin activation is inhibited by overexpression of isolated β1A integrin cytoplasmic domains (dominant suppression) (12Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD98hc was identified as an integrin regulator in an expression-cloning scheme for proteins that can complement dominant suppression (CODS)1 (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, CD98hc binds to integrin β1A cytoplasmic domains, and this interaction correlates with CODS (14Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, clustering CD98hc activates multiple integrin-dependent functions (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H.

Woodside D.G. McIntyre B.W. Immunology. 2000; 99: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, CD98hc physically and functionally interacts with integrin adhesion receptors. Indeed, clustering of CD98hc can stimulate several classes of integrins in multiple cell types (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Morikawa S. Kawano M. Kusugawa S. Komada H. Nishio M. Ito Y.

In the present study, we have assessed the relationship between the amino acid transport and integrin regulatory activities of CD98hc. We found that the CD98hc alone is necessary and sufficient for the interaction of CD98 with the β1A integrin tail and for CODS. By forming chimeras between CD98hc and another type II transmembrane protein, we found that the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc are required for integrin interactions but not for stimulation of isoleucine transport. In contrast, the CD98hc extracellular domain was required for stimulation of amino acid transport. Thus, the amino acid transport activity and integrin interactions of CD98 are independent activities of the protein and are mediated by different domains of CD98hc. DISCUSSIONCD98hc combines with several different light chains to form a series of heterodimers that are involved in amino acid transport. CD98hc binds to integrin β1A cytoplasmic domains and blocks the capacity of β1A cytoplasmic domains to suppress integrin activation (CODS). We have compared the structural requirements of CD98hc for interaction with integrins with those involved in regulation of amino acid transport. Here we report that: 1) mutation of cysteines that disrupt CD98 heavy-light chain association and reduce amino acid transport do not disrupt its binding to β1A or its effect on integrin activation. 2) The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc fused to another type II transmembrane protein are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the integrin β1A tail and for CODS. This chimera failed to stimulate amino acid transport. 3) Replacement of the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of CD98hc with those of CD69 blocked the capacity of CD98hc to bind to β1A and regulate integrin activation, but had minimal effects on the amino acid transport function of CD98. Thus, the amino acid transport function of CD98 is not required for its effects on integrin function, and amino acid transport can occur in the absence of CD98hc-integrin association.The formation of a covalent CD98 heterodimer is not required for its effects on integrin function. CD98hc has two extracellular cysteines Cys109 and Cys330. Cys109 is near the transmembrane domain of CD98hc and results in a disulfide bridge with a cysteine in an extracellular loop of the light chain between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (25Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys109 and Cys330 disrupted the covalent association with the light chain but did not impair interactions with or effects on integrins. While the covalent association was lost, it is possible that there was still a noncovalent interaction. Indeed, Pfeiffer et al. (25Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that the C109S mutant does still support the surface expression of the light chain. The C109S mutation still displays the same transport characteristics as the disulfide-bound heterodimers, albeit at a reduced rate. Moreover, we also found that overexpressed free heavy chains could also bind to the β1A tail. Furthermore, cotransfection of the hLAT1 light chain increased formation of heterodimers and amino acid transport but did not augment integrin interactions or effects. Consequently, our results indicate that the covalent association of CD98hc with a light chain is not required for its interaction with integrins or for the functional regulation of integrins.The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the integrin β1A tail and for effects on integrin function. When either of these domains was removed from CD98hc, integrin interactions were lost. Conversely, effects on integrins could be conveyed to CD69 by addition of these two domains. What is the role of the CD98hc transmembrane domain in binding to the β1A cytoplasmic tail? It is possible that the CD98hc transmembrane domain influences the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain to promote binding to integrin cytoplasmic domains. Alternatively, our integrin cytoplasmic domain model protein was based on that predicted from the sequence (ITB1_human) in the Swiss-Prot data base (Entry P05556). Glycosylation mapping studies have suggested that β1A (Lys752–Ile757) of the predicted “cytoplasmic” domain may reside in the membrane (27Armulik A. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37030-37034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consequently, the CD98hc transmembrane domain may directly interact with a transmembrane portion of our model protein “tail.” Furthermore, other integrin-binding proteins, such as cytohesin-1, Rack1, and skelemin also bind the membrane proximal region (28Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of this region in the membrane may specify preferential binding of integrin-associated proteins. Finally, the CD98hc solubilized from membranes could be associated with other proteins via the transmembrane domains. These “adapters” might contribute to the CD98hc-β1A tail interaction. In any case, our studies provide the first delineation of a specific functional role for the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD98hc, interaction with and regulation of β1A integrin function.Regulation of amino acid transport and integrins by CD98hc is a distinct and separable function of the polypeptide. Chimeras in which the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of CD98hc were replaced with those of CD69 lost the capacity to bind to β1A and regulate integrin activation. In contrast, these replacements had little effect on the amino acid transport function of CD98. Conversely, the exchange of the extracellular domain of CD98hc with that of CD69 resulted in a protein that was still capable of affecting integrin function but did not stimulate isoleucine transport. Thus, the amino acid transport activity of CD98hc is not required for its effect on integrin function.CD98hc functions as a chaperone to bring the associated light chains (LAT1, LAT2, y+LAT1, y+LAT2, xCT, and asc-1) to the plasma membrane (29Verrey F. Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Pfeiffer R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Palacin M. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the interaction of CD98hc with integrins and amino acid transporters are ascribable to distinct domains of the protein and are not mutually exclusive. Integrin-mediated adhesion often leads to the polarization of these receptors to the adherent cell surface. Consequently, the integrin-CD98hc interaction may serve to polarize the localization of CD98 and, consequently, amino acid transport. Conversely, CD98hc can influence multiple integrin-dependent functions, including virus-induced cell fusion, T-cell costimulation, and cell adhesion (13Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,15Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Morikawa S. Kawano M. Kusugawa S. Komada H. Nishio M. Ito Y.

We report that chromatin from human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells possesses such a biosynthetic pathway. First, membrane-free nuclei retain all three CDP-choline pathway enzymes in proportions comparable with the content of chromatin-associated phosphatidylcholine. Second, following supplementation of cells with deuterated choline and using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, both the time course and molecular species labeling pattern of newly synthesized endonuclear and whole cell phosphatidylcholine revealed the operation of spatially separate, compositionally distinct biosynthetic routes. Specifically, endogenous and newly synthesized endonuclear phosphatidylcholine species are both characterized by a high degree of diacyl/alkylacyl chain saturation. This unusual species content and synthetic pattern (evident within 10 min of supplementation) are maintained through cell growth arrest by serum depletion and when proliferation is restored, suggesting that endonuclear disaturated phosphatidylcholine enrichment is essential and closely regulated. We propose that endonuclear phosphatidylcholine synthesis may regulate periodic nuclear accumulations of phosphatidylcholine-derived lipid second messengers. Furthermore, our estimates of saturated phosphatidylcholine nuclear volume occupancy of around 10% may imply a significant additional role in regulating chromatin structure.

Although all the major membrane phospholipids, predominantly phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho),1phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), may be present typically at 4–10% of total cell content (2Vann L.R.

Science. 2000; 288: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Hence the molecular organization of endonuclear phospholipids in eukaryotic cells is still unclear. Extensive histochemical and cytochemical studies suggest that their spatial distributions overlap that of decondensed chromatin domains (3Albi E. Mersel M. LeRay C. Tomassoni M.L. ViolaMagni M.P.

The potential physiological importance of intranuclear phospholipid has recently been highlighted by the recognition that the α isoform (CCTα) of CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, the principal regulatory enzyme of PtdCho biosynthesis (11Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), is confined to the nucleus throughout the cell cycle (12DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modified Chinese hamster ovary MT 58 cells (13Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) expressing a temperature-sensitive mutation of CCTα are not viable when grown at the restrictive temperature (12DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that endonuclear synthesis of PtdCho is essential for cell survival. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that extranuclear PtdCho biosynthesis, which occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (14Vance D.E. Choy P.C. Farren S.B. Lim P.H. Schneider W.J. Nature. 1977; 270: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and involves one or both of the β isoform(s) of cytidylyltransferase (CCTβ-1, CCTβ-2) (15Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism whereby endonuclear PtdCho biosynthesis regulates cell proliferation is not clear, and as yet there has been no direct demonstration of the intact pathway within the nucleus. One possible role for endonuclear PtdCho biosynthesis might be to regulate the periodic accumulations of diacylglycerol (DAG) within the nucleus that are functionally linked to cell proliferation (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Mobilization of DAG in the nucleus is bipartite (17D'Santos C. Clarke J.H. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and involves two pools: one derived from predominantly unsaturated PtdIns and one derived from largely saturated PtdCho. Accordingly, a nuclear CDP-choline pathway for endonuclear PtdCho biosynthesis could regulate the nuclear DAG content by recycling endonuclear PtdCho-derived DAG together with choline and or phosphocholine. Consequently, we sought to determine whether expression of CCT activity within the nucleus does indeed represent part of an intact compartmentalized CDP-choline pathway for intranuclear PtdCho biosynthesis. First, we measured activities of individual CDP-choline pathway enzymes to establish the potential capacity for PtdCho synthesis within the nucleus. Subsequently, we employed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of PtdCho isolated from cells cultured with deuterated choline to quantify the rate of endonuclear PtdCho synthesis. ESI-MS also permitted a detailed analysis of the molecular species compositions of endogenous and newly synthesized molecular species of PtdCho within the nucleus. Stock IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells, obtained from Imperial Laboratories (Andover, Hampshire, UK), were maintained in monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. Sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+ was also obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Electrophoresis chemicals were from Promega (Southampton, Hampshire, UK). PtdCho standards were obtained from Sigma. Specialist chemicals for electron microscopy were from Agar Scientific (Stansted, Essex, UK), and other chemicals were of AnalaR grade from Merck or from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Phospho[14C]methylcholine and CDP-[14C]methylcholine were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [14C]methyl choline was from ICN Biomedicals (Thame, Oxfordshire, UK). Trypsinized, subconfluent IMR-32 cells (2–6 × 107cells/experiment) were washed twice with 10 ml of HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+ at 4 °C, with fractions removed for cell counting, enzyme assay, and electrophoresis. After removal of excess HBSS the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer (HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. After 15 min of incubation on ice, cells were resuspended and layered over 400 μl of 30% sucrose in extraction buffer. The nuclear pellet recovered from centrifugation through the sucrose cushion at 4,500 ×g for 3 min was resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+ at 4 °C and centrifuged again at 4,500 × g for 3 min. Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+, and 50 μl was removed, stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml), and counted on a hemocytometer. Aliquots (200 μl) were separated for electrophoresis or enzyme activities. Whole IMR-32 cell pellets or membrane-depleted nuclei pellets, washed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 2 mmCaCl2 buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated in 2% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing in distilled water they were then incubated in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min, followed by a further rinse in distilled water and a sequential dehydration protocol using 10-min incubations in ethanol at 70 and 90% and finally three changes of 100% ethanol. Pellets were then incubated with Histosol (Life Sciences International, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) for 30 min, Histosol/Spurr's resin (50/50) for 1 h, and finally Spurr's resin and vinyl cyclohexene dioxide:polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ether:nonenyl succinic anhydride:dimethylamino ethanol (23:16.3:60.5:1, w/w) for 24 h. The processed pellets were embedded using an 8-mm flat polythene TAAB capsule (TAAB Laboratory Equipment Ltd., Aldermaston, Berkshire, UK) in fresh Spurr's resin followed by polymerization for 16 h at 60 °C. Electron microscopy silver sections were cut using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome and diamond knife. Sections were then placed on TAAB 100-μm copper grids and counterstained with Reynold's lead citrate, 8 mmPb(NO3)2, 0.12 m sodium citrate, 0.16 m NaOH. Examination of sections was then performed on a Hitachi H7000 transmission electron microscope. The method of choice for purification of the nuclear matrix from cells, free from contamination with nuclear envelope, was detergent extraction followed by separation over a sucrose gradient. This procedure is based on the observation that the buoyant density of nuclei containing residual nuclear envelope membranes is decreased (18Rickwood D. Messent M. Patel D. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 72-106Google Scholar). Consequently, such contaminated nuclei are effectively removed from the preparation, because they will not sediment through the sucrose cushion (18Rickwood D. Messent M. Patel D. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 72-106Google Scholar). No unambiguous protein marker that is specific for the nuclear envelope is currently recognized (18Rickwood D. Messent M. Patel D. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1997: 72-106Google Scholar). β-tubulin has been used as a marker of both endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope contamination of nuclear matrix preparations in other studies, and absence of immunoreactivity upon Western blotting is an accepted criterion used to assess purity of nuclear matrix preparations (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 19Rubbini S. Cocco L. Manzoli L. Lutterman J. Billi A.M.

Paired protein fractions from post-mitochondrial supernatants of cell homogenates (105cells; 10,000 × g; 10 min) and isolated nuclear matrices (105 nuclei) from the same preparation were separated by 10% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, analysis by Western blotting was performed using monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (1/500, Sigma T5293) with detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Ely, Cambridge, UK) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine-stabilized substrate (Promega). Molecular weights were determined using a mid-range protein mix (Promega). Phospholipids from whole cells or isolated nuclei were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43406) Google Scholar), and the PtdCho component was separated in the chloroform:methanol (60:40; 1 ml) wash of 100-mg Bond Elut aminopropyl solid phase extraction cartridges (Varian) as previously described (22Caesar P.A. Wilson S.J. Normand I.C.S. Postle A.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following a further methanol wash (1 ml) to elute PtdEtn, an acidic phospholipid fraction containing PtdOH, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and PtdIns was eluted with methanol:water:phosphoric acid (96:4:1; 3 × 1 ml) containing 40 mm choline chloride. Back-extraction, using chloroform methanol, was performed to remove choline chloride before mass spectrometry. Internal standards of dimyristoyl PtdCho (PtdCho 14:0/14:0; 15 nmol/107 cells; 0.5 nmol/107nuclei), dimyristoyl PtdEtn (PtdEtn 14:0/14:0; 4 nmol/107cells; 0.133 nmol/107 nuclei) and dimyristoyl PtdOH (PtdOH 14:0/14:0; 0.5 nmol/107 cells; 0.0167 nmol/107nuclei) were added at the start of the extraction to quantify individual molecular species. For endogenous versusnewly synthesized PtdCho composition analysis, IMR-32 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with choline containing nine deuterons in methyl groups (d 9; C/D/N Isotopes Inc., Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada) at 8 mg/100 ml (96% enrichment in the medium) for up to 3 h. ESI-MS of PtdCho extracted from whole cells or from nuclei was performed on a Micromass Quatro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshaw, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. Samples were dissolved in methanol:chloroform:water (7:2:1, v/v) and introduced into the mass spectrometer either by syringe pump or by nanoflow infusion. Following fragmentation with argon gas, endogenous PtdCho molecules produced a fragment with m/z = 184 (23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), corresponding to the protonated phosphocholine headgroup. Newly synthesized PtdCho, which contained nine deuterons, produced an analogous fragment atm/z = 193 (23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Sequential parent scans of the m/z 184 and 193 moieties permitted the determination of endogenous and newly synthesized PtdCho species (23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Total ion counts for the PtdCho species collected sequentially for the two fragments over identical time scales were ratioed to give percentages synthesized. Data were acquired and processed using MassLynx NT software. After conversion to centroid format according to area and correction for 13C isotope effects and for reduced response with increasing m/z values, the PtdCho species were expressed as a percentage of the total present in the sample. The formula for reduced response with increasedm/z was determined experimentally for PtdCho as follows: a = 2 × 1013 ·b −3.9873, where a = reduced response factor relative to a value of 1.00 for PtdCho 14:0/14:0, andb = m/z value. In them/z = 184 parent scans, disaturated species occurred at the following m/z values: 16:0 alkyl/14:0, m/z = 693; 16:0/14:0,m/z = 707; 16:0 alkyl/16:0,m/z = 721; 16:0/16:0,m/z = 735; 16:0 alkyl/18:0,m/z = 749; 16:0/18:0, m/z = 763; 18:0/18:0, m/z = 791. In them/z = 193 parent scans the corresponding peaks were 9 m/z mass units higher. Peak identifications were confirmed by product ion scanning of fatty acyl groups by tandem MS/MS. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS of PtdEtn from whole cell or nuclei was performed in methanol:chloroform:water (7:2:1 with 0.5% w/v NaI). Following fragmentation with argon gas, sodium adducts of PtdEtn lost a neutral fragment of m/z = 141, corresponding to the protonated phosphoethanolamine headgroup (24Han X. Gross R.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Sequential constant neutral loss scans ofm/z = 141 permitted determination of PtdEtn species present within the samples. CK activity was determined by the method of Ishidate and Nakazawa (25Ishidate K. Nakazawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CCT assays were performed as previously described (26Hunt A.N. Normand I.C.S. Postle A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Charcoal washes with water were increased to five, and elution washes in ethanol/ammonia were increased to three; all were performed at room temperature. Lipid-stimulated activity was measured in the presence of PtdCho/oleate vesicles prepared as described by Weinhold and Feldman (27Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ADP (6 mm) and additional MgCl2(3 mm) were included to block intrinsic nucleotidase activity (27Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and all determined activities were corrected using CDP-[methyl-14C]-choline recovery standards in each batch of assays (27Weinhold P.A. Feldman D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (EC 2.7.8.2) activities were determined as reported previously (28Burdge G.C. Hunt A.N. Postle A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but included additional lipid blanks for nuclear activity determinations to correct for high endogenous DAG. All activities were expressed in relation to a unit number of cells or isolated nuclei (1 × 106) as determined during nuclei preparation. Exclusion of both endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope membranes from experimental nuclear matrix preparations is an essential requirement for quantification of chromatin-associated phospholipid compositions and biosynthetic capacities. Detergent-based extraction protocols have been successfully exploited by other groups studying aspects of nuclear phosphoinositide metabolism and can be designed either to retain (29Bunce C.M. Thick J.A. Lord J.M. Mills D. Brown G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or remove (2Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem.

Trans. 1997; 25: S590Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) the nuclear membrane from isolated nuclei. Triton X-100 was selected for the present study based upon a report that concentrations above 0.04% (w/v) completely removed the nuclear envelope from isolated nuclei of rat liver (2Vann L.R. Wooding F.B.P. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Low and high power electron microscopy clearly showed a typical limiting double bilayer membrane in whole IMR-32 cell nuclei (Fig.1, a and b) that was absent from nuclei isolated in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, c and d). Strong evidence for removal of endoplasmic reticulum and weaker evidence of nuclear envelope membrane removal were also provided by the lack of reactivity to anti-β-tubulin upon Western blotting of isolated nuclei (Fig.1 e). Absence of β-tubulin has been widely accepted as indicative of pure nuclear matrix preparations in previous studies (16Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar,19Rubbini S. Cocco L. Manzoli L. Lutterman J. Billi A.M. Matteucci A. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2978-2980PubMed Google Scholar), although nuclear envelope content below the level of immunoreactivity cannot be excluded by such methodology. This procedure resulted in a reproducibly high recovery of membrane-free nuclei (67.3 ± 6.7% (mean ± S.D.); n = 18). It was highly dependent upon exclusion of Ca2+/Mg2+ from the extraction medium, because the presence of these ions induced a denaturing aggregation of nuclear matrix preparations. The capacity of the nuclear matrix of IMR-32 cells to sustain a compartmentalized synthesis of PtdCho was determined by evaluating the presence, and assaying the activities, of each of the three enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway, namely choline kinase (EC 2.7.1.32), CCT, and CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (TableI). Endonuclear choline kinase activity was 10.3% that of the whole cell, whereas endonuclear CCT without PtdCho/oleate stimulation was 25.5% of whole cell activity. This endonuclear CCT activity was not stimulated by incubation with PtdCho/oleate, in contrast to the 15-fold stimulation of the extranuclear enzyme by lipid. The absence of an effect of exogenous lipid on nuclear CCT may have been due either to an inability of the PtdCho/oleate vesicles to penetrate the nuclear matrices or to residual Triton X-100, which may compromise lipid stimulation. Chromatin-associated CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activity comprised 12.8% of whole cell activity. Likewise, it is probable that Triton X-100 residue and inability of exogenous DAG vesicles to penetrate the nuclear matrices may have diminished CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activity determinations in this compartment. Notwithstanding the possibility that choline kinase activity may also have been affected by Triton X-100 exposure, substrate accessibility was less likely to be problematic.Table IChromatin-associated CDP-choline pathway enzymes in IMR-32 cells and nucleiEnzymeActivityExtranuclearNuclearnmol synthesized/min/106 nucleiCK1.57 ± 0.830.18 ± 0.14CCT without PtdCho/oleate0.98 ± 0.700.33 ± 0.09CCT with PtdCho/oleate15.14 ± 4.020.47 ± 0.18CPT2.72 ± 0.950.40 ± 0.08The activities of choline kinase (CK), CCT, and CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) were determined in post-mitochondrial (10,000 × g; 10 min) supernatants of cells and of a proportion of nuclei stripped of their nuclear membranes from the same flask as described under “Materials and Methods.“ Each value represents the mean activity corrected for cell/nuclei count (n = 5) ± S.D. Open table in a new tab The activities of choline kinase (CK), CCT, and CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) were determined in post-mitochondrial (10,000 × g; 10 min) supernatants of cells and of a proportion of nuclei stripped of their nuclear membranes from the same flask as described under “Materials and Methods.“ Each value represents the mean activity corrected for cell/nuclei count (n = 5) ± S.D. Whereas the enzyme activities we observed demonstrate the capacity forin vitro endonuclear transformation of each of the PtdCho intermediates to their proximal biosynthetic products, they do not prove the existence of functionally compartmentalized pathways in intact cells. Consequently we used deuterium-enriched choline-d 9 as a labeled substrate in conjunction with ESI-MS to probe PtdCho biosynthesis (23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The ratio of endogenous to newly synthesized PtdCho molecular species was determined by incubating IMR-32 cells with choline-d 9 and then extracting the PtdCho from isolated nuclei and from whole cells. Sequential scans of the parents of fragments withm/z of 184 and 193 were used to quantify endogenous and newly synthesized PtdCho species (23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, a–d). Incorporation of choline-d 9 into PtdCho from whole cells was readily detectable by 10 min and linear for up to 3 h (Fig.3 b), after which time 8.6% of whole cell PtdCho contained the d 9 headgroup (Fig.3 a). The time scale for the incorporation of choline-d 9 into the endonuclear PtdCho was equally rapid; the parents of the m/z 193 species were detectable within 10 min (Fig. 3 b). However, a constant rate of labeled choline incorporation was only achieved after the first hour of supplementation (Fig. 3 b), presumably representing the time required for equilibration of the d 9 substrate into the endonuclear choline pool.Figure 3Cell and nuclear PtdCho synthesis in normal and serum-starved IMR-32 cells. a , fraction of endogenous PtdCho synthesized in cell and nuclei, following 3 h of incubation with choline-d 9, in normal (control) cells (mean ± S.D., n = 8), starved (0.5% FCS for 72 h) cells (mean ± S.D., n = 4), and supplemented (suppl) (0.5% FCS for 72 h and then 10% FCS during choline-d 9supplementation) cells (mean ± S.D., n = 5 cells). b , IMR-32 cells were incubated with choline-d 9 for 10, 30, 60, or 180 min.

https://openalex.org/W2015651255,"We have recombinantly expressed a soluble form of human α2β1 integrin that lacks the membrane-anchoring transmembrane domains as well as the cytoplasmic tails of both integrin subunits. This soluble α2β1 integrin binds to its collagen ligands the same way as the wild-type α2β1integrin. Furthermore, like the wild-type form, it can be activated by manganese ions and an integrin-activating antibody. However, it does not bind to rhodocytin, a postulated agonist of α2β1 integrin from the snake venom ofCalloselasma rhodostoma, which elicits platelet aggregation. Taking advantage of the recombinantly expressed, soluble α2β1 integrin, an inhibition assay was established in which samples can be tested for their capability to inhibit binding of soluble α2β1 integrin to immobilized collagen. Thus, by scrutinizing the C. rhodostoma snake venom in this protein-protein interaction assay, we found a component of the snake venom that inhibits the interaction of soluble α2β1 integrin to type I collagen efficiently. N-terminal sequences identified this inhibitor as rhodocetin, a recently published antagonist of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. We could demonstrate that its inhibitory effect bases on its strong and specific binding to α2β1 integrin, proving that rhodocetin is a disintegrin. Standing apart from the growing group of RGD-dependent snake venom disintegrins, rhodocetin interacts with α2β1 integrin in an RGD-independent manner. Furthermore, its native conformation, which is stabilized by disulfide bridges, is indispensibly required for its inhibitory activity. Rhodocetin does not contain any major collagenous structure despite its high affinity to α2β1integrin, which binds to collagenous molecules much more avidly than to noncollagenous ligands, such as laminin. Blocking α2β1 integrin as the major collagen receptor on platelets, rhodocetin is responsible for hampering collagen-induced, α2β1 integrin-mediated platelet activation, leading to hemorrhages and bleeding disorders of the snakebite victim. Moreover, having a widespread tissue distribution, α2β1 integrin also mediates cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. We showed that rhodocetin is able to inhibit α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of fibrosarcoma cells to type I collagen completely.

We showed that rhodocetin is able to inhibit α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of fibrosarcoma cells to type I collagen completely. Integrins are cell adhesion molecules that consist of two noncovalently associated subunits, α and β (for review see Refs. 1Eble J.A. Eble J.A. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interaction. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 1-40Crossref Google Scholarand 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). The subfamily of integrins sharing the β1 subunit are well known receptors for extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagens, laminins, and fibronectin. The subfamily of β3subunit containing cytoadhesins comprise the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3 which binds fibrinogen/fibrin (3Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the vitronectin receptor αVβ3. The latter ones, along with several β1 integrin, such as the fibronectin receptor α5β1 integrin, recognize a linear arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl sequence within their respective ligands, such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin (4Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar). In contrast, the collagen binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1recognize arginine and aspartate/glutamate residues of different collagen chains, which are in close proximity to each other within the triple helical collagenous framework of the collagen (5Eble J.A.

Integrin-mediated cell adhesion not only anchors the cell mechanically within the extracellular matrix of the tissue but also elicits several cellular responses, such as cell spreading and migration, cell proliferation, and differentiation (for review see Ref. 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). A well studied example of cellular response triggered by integrin-ligand interaction is platelet activation and aggregation (8Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.-P.W. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb.

Thrombocytes abundantly possess the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 on their surface, which unless activated does not bind to fibrinogen/fibrin (3Calvete J.J. Thromb.

Ablation of endothelial cells from the blood vessel wall or other injuries of blood vessels make type IV and type I collagen of the basement membrane and the underlying connective tissue, respectively, accessible to platelets. Once getting in contact with collagen, platelets avidly bind to collagen via their collagen receptors (9Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.-P.W. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Moroi M. Jung S.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), such as the α2β1 integrin, GPVI, or indirectly via von Willebrand factor, which binds to both collagen and the vWF receptor on the platelet surface. Receptor-mediated adhesion to collagen elicits a cascade of signals within the platelets, which eventually results in secretion of platelet granula, in platelet aggregation and activation of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 which then binds to fibrin with high affinity. Insoluble fibrin, which has been produced by the enzymatic blood clotting cascade and provides a scaffold, which together with platelets form the blood clot as the first and essential step in hemostasis. The key role of the α2β1 as the sole integrin collagen receptor on platelets is drastically manifested in patients with severe bleeding disorders, caused either by a genetic defect or lack of the integrin α2 subunit (11Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W.N. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) or by auto-antibodies against the integrin α2 subunit (12Deckmyn H. Chew S.L. Vermylen J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, snake, leeches, and ticks have developed natural inhibitors of integrin-ligand interactions, called disintegrins, that target at the integrin-mediated platelet adhesion to fibrinogen/fibrin and collagen (9Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.-P.W. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By inhibiting blood clotting, their venoms lead to severe bleeding, hemorrhages, or even death of their victims. Besides proteolytic enzymes, disintegrins are mainly responsible for these poisonous effects. Most of the known disintegrins contain a linear RGD sequence placed within a rather flexible loop, which prevents the RGD-dependent platelet integrin αIIbβ3 from binding to fibrin (13Calvete J.J. Eble J.A. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interaction. R. G. Landes, Georgetown, TX1997: 157-174Crossref Google Scholar). However, very little is known about disintegrins that act on the interaction of α2β1 integrin with collagen, the initial step of platelet activation and aggregation. From the venom of the Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma), rhodocytin/aggretin (14Chung C.-H. Au L.-C. Huang T.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Huang T.-F. Liu C.-Z. Yang S.-H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and, more recently, rhodocetin (16Wang R. Kini R.M. Chung M.C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have been shown to induce and inhibit, respectively, collagen-elicited platelet activation and aggretion. However, no direct proof was provided that rhodocytin/aggretin and rhodocetin are the agonist and antagonist, respectively, that interact directly and specifically with α2β1 integrin among the different collagen receptors of blood platelets. Using a recombinantly expressed, soluble human α2β1 integrin, we could rule out that rhodocytin/aggretin binds directly to α2β1integrin. On the other hand, having established an inhibition assay with the purified soluble α2β1 integrin apart from whole platelets, we could isolate an inhibitor of C. rhodostoma venom that inhibits the binding of soluble α2β1 integrin to collagen on the molecular level. N-terminal sequencing identified this inhibitor to be the lately published rhodocetin (16Wang R. Kini R.M. Chung M.C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate that rhodocetin binds directly to the α2β1 integrin. Rhodocetin efficiently competes with collagen for the α2β1 integrin, even though it does not contain any collagenous triple helix domain, which has been surmised to be a prerequisite for high affinity binding to collagen-binding integrins. Nevertheless, the native conformation that is stabilized by disulfide bridges is essential for binding to α2β1 integrin. In contrast to the majority of snake venom disintegrins, rhodocetin binds to α2β1 integrin in an RGD-independent manner. Of even more general importance, α2β1integrin is not only the integrin receptor for collagen on platelets but also abundantly expressed in various tissues (17Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of α2β1 integrin within the organism. Having proved rhodocetin to be a very specific α2β1-integrin antagonist, we have started to test rhodocetin as a tool in studying α2β1-related functions on the cellular level and have demonstrated that rhodocetin can efficiently and entirely inhibit α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells to collagen. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α2 subunit were substituted for a GGSTGGG spacer and the dimerizing motif of the transcription factor Fos. The cloning strategy started from the construct pUC-HygMT-α3fos, which was described in a previous paper (18Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA sequence coding for the α3 ectodomain within the pUC-HygMT-α3fos was replaced by the cDNA sequence coding for the ectodomain of the integrin α2 subunit. To this end, pUC-HygMT-α3fos was cleaved by SalI and dephosporylated by calf intestine phosphatase. The 7.2-kilobase pair-long vector fragment still contains the Fos-coding sequence of the original construct pUC-HygMT-α3fos, yet lacking the complete sequence coding for the integrin α3 ectodomain. The human cDNA coding for the signal sequence and the N-terminal 912 amino acids of the mature α2 ectodmain were excised from pFneo-α2 construct (19Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) using SalI andBglII. The cDNA coding for the C-terminal 131 amino acids of the α2 ectodomain and the first few amino acids of the GGSTGGG spacer, the latter one of which contains theSalI restriction site, were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the α2 cDNA of pFneo-α2as template, and the oligonucleotides ATGCTGAAATTCACTTAACAAGATCTACC with the BglII site underlined and GCCGCCCGTCGACCCTCCTGTTGGTACTTCGGCTTTCTC with the SalI site underlined as forward and reverse primer, respectively. In a triple ligation the SalI-cleaved vector fragment and the cDNA fragments for both the N- and C-terminal part of the α2 ectodomain were ligated to the pUC-HygMT-α2fos construct coding for the soluble α2 ectodomain, which bears at its C terminus the short spacer sequence GGSTGGG and the dimerizing motif of Fos. The pUC-HygMT-β1jun construct was generated as described in a previous paper (18Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both constructs were transfected in an equimolar ratio into Drosophila Schneider cells, using TransFastTM Transfection Reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected under 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B. After two rounds of subcloning by limited dilution and after screening for positive clones by a sandwich ELISA 1The abbreviations used are: ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTBSTris-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMMPmatrix metalloprotease described below, the stable clone α2β1-G1.2 was established, which after induction of the metallothionine promoters upstream of both integrin α2 and β1ectodomain cDNAs secreted soluble α2β1integrin into the cell supernatant in concentrations of about 40 μg/liter. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline bovine serum albumin dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid matrix metalloprotease To screen hygromycin B-resistant clones for their ability to secrete soluble α2β1 integrin, supernatants of transfectant clones were tested in a sandwich ELISA 4–5 days after induction by copper sulfate. For the sandwich ELISA, the mouse monoclonal anti-integrin α2 antibody JA218 (kindly provided by Danny Tuckwell, University of Manchester, UK) (20Tuckwell D.S. Smith L. Korda M. Askari J.A. Santoso S. Barnes M. Farndale Richard W. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 485-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was immobilized to the plastic surface of a microtiter plate at 8 μg/ml in TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl ) with MgCl2 (TBS/MgCl2). After blockage of nonspecific binding sites on the microtiter plate with 1% (w/v) heat denatured BSA in TBS/MgCl2 (BSA/TBS/MgCl2), the cell supernatants were added into the coated wells. The antibody JA218 captured the soluble α2β1 integrin, which was then detected by an rabbit anti-human β1integrin-antiserum as primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) as secondary antibody, diluted 1:300 and 1:600, respectively, in BSA/TBS/MgCl2. Before each antibody incubation and the final enzymatic detection reaction, wells were washed three times with TBS/MgCl2. As substrate of alkaline phosphatase,p-nitrophenylphosphate tablets were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an ELISA-reader (Dynatech, Burlington, MA). In spinner flasks, α2β1 G1.2 cells were grown in Sf900 Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B and 10% fetal calf serum. Once they had reached a density of about 12 million cells/ml, they were induced by addition of copper sulfate at 0.6 mm. Simultanously, glucose was added to 0.1% (v/w) and glutamine was added to 0.8 mm. Cell supernatant was harvested 5 days after induction and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a YM30 membrane cartridge (Amicon, Witten, Germany). Protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were added at 1 μg/ml. Mn2+ ions that increase integrin affinity to ligands were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT) was adjusted to 2 mm, before the concentrated cell supernatant was loaded onto the collagen I column. The collagen I column had been generated by covalently coupling bovine type I collagen to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B CL according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The loaded collagen I column was washed with TBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm DTT (wash buffer A). After a stringent wash with buffer A with a NaCl concentration of 300 mm, the collagen I column was washed with buffer A, before the soluble α2β1 integrin was eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA. Immediately after elution, MgCl2 was added to 30 mm, and the eluate fraction was neutralized with 2 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The α2β1 containing eluate fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Diluted with Mono Q buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2), the α2β1containing solution was loaded onto a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 50% Mono Q buffer B (1 m NaCl in Mono Q buffer A) within 60 min. The α2β1containing eluate fractions were concentrated by centrifugational ultrafiltration using a Centricon 50 tube (Amicon, Witten, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using the bichinonic acid assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie staining. Bovine type I collagen and chicken type II collagen was kindly provided by Peter Bruckner (University of Münster, Germany). Type IV collagen, the type IV collagen fragment CB3[IV], type V collagen, and murine Laminin-1 (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-Laminin) were gratefully obtained from Klaus Kühn, Rupert Timpl, and Albert Ries (Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Collagens were plated in 0.1m acetic acid, except for CB3[IV], which like laminin was coated in TBS/MgCl2 onto the microtiter plate. After the wells were blocked with a BSA/TBS/MgCl2, the integrin dissolved in the same solution was allowed to bind to the immobilized substratum. MnCl2, activating antibody 9EG7 or EDTA were added as indicated. The activating monoclonal anti β1integrin antibody 9EG7 (21Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Henö P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) was isolated from cell supernatant according to standard protocols. The 9EG7 hybridoma was kindly provided by Dieter Vestweber (University of Münster, Münster, Germany). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, nonbound integrin was washed away with HEPES wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2) twice. Then collagen-bound α2β1 integrin was covalently cross-linked to the substratum with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in HEPES wash buffer for 10 min at room temperature. After washing the plate three times with TBS/MgCl2, the amount of bound α2β1 was measured in an ELISA-like procedure with a rabbit anti-human integrin β1 subunit antiserum as primary antibody and an anti-rabbit IgG-antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as secondary antibody, diluted 1:300 and 1:600, respectively, in BSA/TBS/MgCl2. Each antibody incubation, all of which lasted for 1.5 h, was followed by washing the plate with TBS/MgCl2 three times. For detection,p-nitrophenylphosphate tablets (Sigma) were used as substrate for the alkaline phosphatase according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The yellow reaction product was measured at 405 nm in an ELISA reader. Snake venom lyophilizate from C. rhodostoma(Sigma) was dissolved in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA (TBS/EDTA) at a protein concentration of about 200 mg/ml. The proteins were separated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column HR30/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using TBS/EDTA at 0.3 ml/min. Two distinct pools of fractions were able to inhibit the binding of soluble α2β1 integrin to immobilized type I collagen. The fractions containing the Low molecular weightCalloselasma inhibitor (LMW-CI) was diluted in 20 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5 (Mono S buffer A) and passed through a Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The retained proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–20% Mono S-buffer B (1m NaCl in Mono S-buffer A) within 60 min. In the third purification step, the LMW-CI containing solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 by diluting into 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5 (Mono Q-buffer A). The LMW-CI was eluted from the Mono Q column using a linear gradient of 0–50% Mono Q-buffer B (1 m NaCl in Mono Q-buffer A). The elute fractions containing LMW-CI were concentrated in a Centricon 10 tube by centrifugal ultrafiltration. To reduce contaminating proteins any further, a final gel filtration on a TSK G3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany) was performed at 0.4 ml/min. N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation identified LMW-CI to be identical to rhodocetin (16Wang R. Kini R.M. Chung M.C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by bichinonic acid. Purity of LMW-CI and the apparent molecular masses of its subunits were assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Dissolved in 0.1m acetic acid at 40 μg/ml, type I collagen was coated as monomeric molecule onto the plastic surface of a microtiter plate at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS/MgCl2, nonspecific binding sites on the plastic surface were blocked with BSA/TBS/MgCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. Then soluble α2β1 integrin was added as a 6 μg/ml solution in BSA/TBS/MgCl2 either without any inhibitor (positive control of 100% binding), in the presence of a snake venom fraction, or with 10 mm EDTA (nonspecific binding; negative control with 0% binding). To increase the binding signal of α2β1 integrin, both 1 mm MnCl2 and a 3-fold molar surplus of integrin-activating antibody 9EG7 was added. To prevent any protease activity of the snake venom that could degrade the α2β1 integrin or the collagen substratum, resulting in a likewise decrease of binding signals, the following protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations as follows: 2 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 2 mm of each 1,10-phenanthroline and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After having bound to the immobilized collagen ligand in either the presence or the absence of inhibitor for 2 h at room temperature, nonbound α2β1 integrin was washed off the plate with HEPES wash buffer. After chemical fixation, the bound integrin was measured in the ELISA-like procedure described above. As blank value, the binding signal obtained in the presence of EDTA was subtracted from all other values. To calculate relative binding values, the binding signal of α2β1integrin to type I collagen without any inhibitor was taken as 100%. Both native and inactive rhodocetin were coated onto a microtiter plate at 50 μg/ml in TBS/MgCl2 at 4 °C overnight. Rhodocetin had been inactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 20 min in the presence of 40 mm DTT, followed by blockage of free thiol groups with 120 mm iodacetamide for 10 min at room temperature. After the microtiter plate was blocked with BSA/TBS/MgCl2, soluble α2β1 integrin at different concentrations was incubated with the immobilized rhodocetin. Soluble α2β1 integrin was dissolved in BSA/TBS/MgCl2 containing 1 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, as well as 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1,10-phenanthroline. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, wells were washed twice with HEPES wash buffer. Bound α2β1 integrin was fixed, and its amount was determined by ELISA as described above. Nonspecific binding signals measured as α2β1 binding to the blocking agent BSA were subtracted from the binding values for α2β1 binding to native and denatured rhodocetin, respectively. The titration curves were linearized, and aK d value was determined according to the algorithm given by Heyn and Weischet (22Heyn M.P. Weischet W.O. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2962-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Inhibition of α2β1 binding to immobilized rhodocetin by RGD peptide was performed similarly to the titration experiments. After the microtiter plate was coated with rhodocetin at 50 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C and blocked with BSA/TBS/MgCl2 at room temperature for 2 h, soluble α2β1 at 15 μg/ml was added either in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the linear GRGDSP peptide (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) for 2 h at room temperature. Then unbound α2β1 integrin was removed by washing with HEPES wash buffer twice. Bound α2β1integrin was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in HEPES wash buffer. Its amount was determined by ELISA as described above. The binding signals were corrected for the blank values measured as α2β1 binding to BSA and afterward normalized to the noninhibited binding of α2β1 to rhodocetin in the absence of GRGDSP peptide (positive control, 100% binding). The buffer of the rhodocetin solution was changed to 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl by gel filtration on a TSK G3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany). The rhodocetin containing eluate fractions were concentrated in a Centricon 10 tube by centrifugal ultrafiltration to reach a concentration of about 0.3 mg/ml. The CD spectrum was recorded from 190 to 260 nm in a 0.1-mm cuvette in a CD spectrophotometer type CD6 (Jobin Yvon, Paris, France). Temperature was controlled by a self-constructed Peltier element cuvette holder. The relative amount of secondary structures (α helix, parallel, and anti-parallel β strands, random coil) were calculated with the deconvolution program of CDNN by Gerhard Böhm (23Böhm G. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Monomeric bovine type I collagen at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid was immobilized onto a microtiter plate at 4 °C overnight. After being washed with TBS/MgCl2 for three times, the plate was blocked with BSA/TBS/MgCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells at a density of 500,000 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated onto the plate for 35 min in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C in both absence and presence of various concentrations of rhodocetin. Adherent cells were detected by staining with crystal violet (24Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherent cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) solution of ethanol for 7 min and stained with a 0.1% (w/v) solution of crystal violet in destilled water. After washing the wells, cell bound dye was extracted with a 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution, and its amount was measured in an ELISA reader at 560 nm. Experiments with cells were done in triplicates. The adhesion signal of HT1080 cells measured on BSA was considered nonspecific background and subtracted from the adhesion signals of cells on type I collagen. Adhesion signals in the presence of rhodocetin were normalized to the adhesion signal of the noninhibited cell adhesion to type I collagen without any inhibitor. A recombinant soluble human α2β1 integrin that consists of the ectodomains of both α2 and β1 integrin subunits being noncovalently associated by the dimerizing motif of Fos and Jun, respectively, was secreted by transfectedDrosophila Schneider cells. Affinity purification of the cell supernatant on a type I collagen column yielded not only the soluble α2β1 integrin but also a protein of 45 kDa as dete"

In addition to the helicase domain, the eukaryotic proteins contain a large NH2-terminal domain of about 650 amino acids whose sequence is poorly conserved between members. The NH2-terminal domain is important for activity in yeast (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but with the exception of the 3′- to 5′-exonuclease domain of WRN (17Mushegian A.R. Bassett Jr., D.E. Boguski M.S. Bork P. Koonin E.V.

A subset of the eukaryotic RecQ family members has been shown to interact with DNA topoisomerase III (Top3)1 (19Johnson F.B. Lombard D.B. Neff N.F. Mastrangelo M.A. Dewolf W. Ellis N.A.

Eukaryotic Top3 was first identified as a hyperrecombination mutant in yeast that also displayed a slow growth phenotype (23Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Top3 has since been identified in several organisms including S. pombe (21Goodwin A. Wang S.W. Toda T. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Maftahi M. Han C.S. Langston L.D. Hope J.C. Zigouras N. Freyer G.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like the bacterial enzyme, eukaryotic Top3 is a type I 5′-DNA topoisomerase with weak superhelical relaxing activity and a strict requirement for substrates containing single-stranded DNA or strand-passing activity (28Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of Top3 is unclear, but in addition to its relaxing activity E. colitopoisomerase III is notable for its ability to decatenate gapped single-stranded DNA circles (29DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that eukaryotic Top3 and E. coli RecQ helicase functionally interact to catenate fully duplex DNA circles (30Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggested a role for these enzymes at the termination of DNA replication to decatenate daughter chromosomes (31Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rothstein R. Gangloff S. Genome Res. 1995; 5: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that RecQ helicases might function to restart stalled replication forks (7Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,33Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Karow J.K.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) a role for Top3 in this process is unclear. The SGS1 gene of yeast was identified as a mutation that suppressed the slow growth phenotype of top3 mutants (22Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to top3 strains, top3 sgs1double mutants exhibit a near wild type growth rate as well as suppression of other top3 phenotypes (22Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 36Gangloff S. de Massy B. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Fabre F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type cells the sgs1 single mutant displays increased rates of mitotic recombination, both at the ribosomal DNA locus and throughout the genome (22Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 37Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as increased rates of chromosome loss and missegregation (38Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Like mutations inBLM, SGS1 mutations result in a hypersensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hydroxyurea (HU) (39Yamagata K. Kato J. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8733-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). SGS1 was cloned in a two-hybrid screen with TOP3, suggesting that Top3 interacted with the first 550 amino acids of Sgs1 (22Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Because two-hybrid results do not provide evidence for direct binding, we set out to confirm this result biochemically, refine the domain of interaction, and determine whether binding was through direct protein-protein interaction. We identified an Top3·Sgs1 complex by coimmunoprecipitating and cofractionating these proteins from yeast extracts. The results indicate that Sgs1 and Top3 are present in a stable complex and that the NH2-terminal 158 amino acids of Sgs1 are sufficient for complex formation. The proteins do not appear to form a simple heterodimer, however, because the full-length proteins cofractionate at a large native molecular weight. We determined that only the NH2-terminal 158 amino acids of Sgs1 were required to bind Top3 based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified proteins. These biochemical results are consistent with our observation that phenotypes caused by mutations in the first 158 amino acids of Sgs1 can be suppressed by overexpressing Top3, whereas larger deletions cannot. Strain construction, growth, and transformation followed standard protocols (40Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 119-133Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strain NJY620 expresses epitope-tagged versions of Sgs1 and Top3. This strain was constructed by modifying the chromosomalSGS1 gene of wild type strain CHY125 (41Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by integratingBglII-linearized plasmid pJM1526, which places three consecutive HA epitopes (YPYDVPDYA) at the COOH terminus of Sgs1. This gene and protein are henceforth called SGS1-HA and Sgs1-HA, respectively. The chromosomal TOP3 gene was modified by integrating SphI-linearized pJM2565, which places a single V5 epitope (GKPIPNPLLGLDSTRTG, Invitrogen) followed by six histidines at the COOH terminus of Top3. This gene is henceforth referred to asTOP3-V5 and its encoded protein as Top3-V5. Strain WFY822 was created by integrating pJM2565 into strain NJY531 (sgs1::loxP) (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain NJY560 was constructed by deleting the SGS1 and SLX4 genes of CHY125 (41Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with loxP-KAN-loxP cassettes (42Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) and maintaining the strain with plasmid pJM500 (SGS1/URA3). SGS1 andsgs1–34 were integrated at the LEU2 locus of NJY560 to create strains BSY1228 and BSY1229, respectively.SGS1 mutant phenotypes were assayed as described (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pJM1526, which expresses the epitope-tagged truncation Sgs1645–1447-HA, contains the insert from pSM105-HA (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the vector pRS405 (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 12: 19-27Crossref Google Scholar). Plasmid pJM2565 contains a fragment of theTOP3 gene encoding a COOH-terminal in-frame fusion to the V5-His6 epitope (Invitrogen) in pRS404. To overexpress Top3 in yeast,TOP3 was subcloned downstream of the GAL1promoter in pRS424 to make pJM2566. Plasmids expressing Sgs1-HA truncations were described (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for pKR1554 and pKR1555, which express epitope-tagged proteins Sgs11–158-HA and Sgs11–322-HA, respectively. To create these plasmids the first 474 and 966 base pairs of SGS1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction so as to place an NdeI site in the context of the initiating ATG and an NotI site at the end of the coding region. These fragments were subcloned intoNdeI/NotI- digested pSM100-HA (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of recombinant yeast proteins in E. coli, TOP3-V5was subcloned into the T7-inducible vector pET11a (44Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pSAS402. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed by subcloning NdeI/BamHI fragments from pKR1554 and pKR1555 into pET11GTK-WF to create pKR1564 and pKR1565. Plasmid pET11GTK-WF was created by destroying theNdeI site of pET11GTK (45Ruppert J.M. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and placing an in-frameNdeI downstream of the GST target coding region by polymerase chain reaction. Extract preparation and chromatography were performed at 4 °C. To prepare large scale extracts, yeast cells were grown in 12 liters of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) at 30 °C to A600 = 1.5; the medium was supplemented with an additional 2% dextrose and growth continued toA600 = 2.8, which yielded 90 g of cells, wet weight. Cells were washed once with H2O and resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT) plus 200 mm NaCl and the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 100 μg/ml bacitracin. The cells were broken in a bead-beater (Biospec Products) with 50% volume of glass beads in 30-s bursts (separated by 90-s pauses) for a total of 5 min of breakage. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant cleared at 235,000 × g for 90 min in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. This centrifugation was observed to pellet a significant portion of the chromatin as reported (46Frei C. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 81-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleared lysate was precipitated by stirring 350 mg of (NH4)2SO4 /ml of lysate for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 188,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 84 ml of Buffer A and dialyzed to a conductivity of Buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl. Small scale extracts for immunoprecipitations were prepared as described (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Superose 6 chromatography was performed in Buffer B (25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT) containing 150 mm NaCl at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed at 4 °C essentially as described (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all IPs were performed by incubating extract with 1 μl of anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 5 μg/μl) or anti-V5 (Invitrogen, 1 μg/μl) antibodies for 1 h in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) (47Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 447-470Google Scholar). 20 μl of protein-A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each sample, followed by rocking for 1 h. The immune complexes were then washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Following SDS-PAGE the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44922) Google Scholar) and treated with either anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase or anti-V5 as the primary antibody (1:10,000). Blots were treated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody as required (1:10,000; Life Technologies, Inc.) and developed with chemiluminescence reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) to detect Top3-V5. Blots were reprobed with anti-HA (1:10,000) as the primary antibody and treated as above to detect Sgs1-HA. For phosphate labeling experiments, yeast cells were grown and labeled with [32P]PO4 as described (49Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Extract preparation and immunoprecipitations were then performed as described above. Plasmids pET11GTK (expressing GST alone), pKR1564 (GST-Sgs11–158-HA), pKR1565 (GST-Sgs11–322-HA), and pSAS402 (Top3-V5) were transformed into E. coli BL21-RIL cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown by shaking in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4. To induce the expression of the recombinant protein, cultures were treated with isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.1 mm for 2 h at 37 °C, except for cells expressing Top3-V5, which were induced for 6 h at 20 °C. Induced cells were pelleted and resuspended in Buffer A plus protease inhibitors (above) containing 250 mm NaCl for GST and GST fusions, and 150 mm KCl for Top3. Extractions and chromatography were performed at 4 °C, except where noted. Cell suspensions were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min and then sonicated three times for 1 min using a Branson sonifier 450 microtip at setting 4, 60% duty cycle. Lysed cells were clarified by centrifugation at 32,500 × g and the supernatant collected as extract. GST and GST-Sgs11–158-HA proteins were purified by batch binding the extract from 1 liter of cells to 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h. The resin was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl, then half-column volume fractions were eluted at room temperature with Buffer A (pH 8.0) plus 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm glutathione. The peak fraction was determined by Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE, then 200 μl was fractionated on a Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column in Buffer B plus 150 mm NaCl to achieve greater purity. GST-Sgs11–322-HA extract from 2 liters of cells was diluted in Buffer A to a conductivity of Buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl and bound to an SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at 20 mg of extract/ml of resin. SP-Sepharose was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A plus 200 mm NaCl, then GST-Sgs11–322-HA was eluted in Buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl. The resulting SP 500 mm pool was diluted in half with Buffer A and affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B and Superdex 75 chromatography as above. Top3-V5 containing extract from 3 liters of cells was bound to P-11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) at a ratio of 10 mg of extract/ml of resin in Buffer A plus 150 mm KCl. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A plus 400 mm KCl, then Top3-V5-containing fractions were eluted from the column in Buffer A plus 600 mm KCl. Top3-V5-containing fractions were precipitated with 400 mg/ml (NH4)2SO4 for 1 h and then pelleted at 32,500 × g. The resulting Top3-V5-containing pellet was resuspended in Buffer N (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 250 mm NaCl) plus 20 mm imidazole and batch bound to 1.5 ml of Probond nickel resin (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Resin was poured into a column and washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer N plus 20 mm imidazole and 10 column volumes of Buffer N plus 50 mm imidazole. Top3-V5 protein was then eluted in 6 half-column volume fractions of Buffer N plus 250 mmimidazole. To detect a direct interaction between Top3 protein and the NH2 terminus of Sgs1, 15 pmol of purified GST and GST-Sgs1-HA fragments were first immobilized in DYNEX Imulon 2 HB 0.4-ml wells. Immobilization of GST and GST-Sgs1-HA fragments was carried out in 75 μl of PBS (10.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.4 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl), pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1 mm DTT by shaking at 60 rpm for 1 h at room temperature. After immobilization, wells were washed once with 0.4 ml of PBST plus 1 mm DTT, then blocked with 0.4 ml of 5% dried milk (w/v) in PBST plus 1 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, cells were washed three times with 0.4 ml of PBST plus 1 mm DTT. A titration of 0–40 pmol of Top3 protein was added to each set of coated wells in PBST plus 1 mm DTT in a volume of 75 μl and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with Top3-V5 protein the wells were washed three times with 0.4 ml of PBST. To detect the Top3-V5 protein, 100 μl of anti-V5 antibody (diluted 1:5,000 in PBST plus 0.5% dried milk) was added to each well for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed three times with PBST, and 100 μl of anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody (diluted 1:5,000 in PBST plus 0.75% (w/v) dried milk) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the secondary antibody incubation, wells were washed three times with 0.4 ml of PBST, and then 200 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system for ELISA (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 100 μl of 0.5 nH2SO4 was added to each well and theA450 of each solution read to determine the amount of Top3-V5 protein present. To characterize the interaction between Top3 and Sgs1, we constructed yeast strains whose chromosomal copies of the SGS1 andTOP3 genes were modified to express the COOH-terminally tagged proteins Sgs1-HA and Top3-V5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). These strains allowed us to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot the products of stable single-copy genes expressed under their native promoters. To verify that the epitope-tagged alleles behaved like wild type, we tested their ability to complement varioussgs1 and top3 phenotypes. Two very sensitive measures of SGS1 and TOP3 activity are resistance to the DNA-damaging agent MMS and resistance to the DNA synthesis inhibitor HU (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains expressing the tagged proteins were serially diluted and replica plated to medium containing MMS or HU. As shown in Fig. 1, the epitope-tagged strains grew as well as wild type on YPD plates and did not show the HU or MMS hypersensitivity characteristic of sgs1 ortop3 strains. For example, top3 mutants grow very slowly on YPD; SGS1 TOP3-V5 cells do not display the slow growth of SGS1 top3 cells and in fact grow at the wild type rate (data not shown). Similarly, sgs1 strains grow somewhat slower than wild type, and SGS1-HA TOP3 cells grow noticeably faster than sgs1 cells. Whereas sgs1and top3 single mutants are hypersensitive to MMS and HU (Fig. 1), the SGS1-HA and TOP3-V5 strains do not display either of these sensitivities; these strains grow like wild type in the presence of these drugs as does the SGS1-HA TOP3-V5 double-tagged strain. Based on these growth phenotypes we conclude that the epitope-tagged alleles SGS1-HA andTOP3-V5 function exactly like wild type. To identify an interaction between Sgs1 and Top3, extracts were prepared from a wild type strain and from strain NJY620 expressing Sgs1-HA and Top3-V5. Following incubation of the extracts with anti-HA or anti-V5 antibodies, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A beads and analyzed by immunoblot. Using extracts from cells expressing the tagged proteins, we observed that anti-V5 precipitated Top3-V5, as expected, and coprecipitated Sgs1-HA (Fig.2 A, lane 6). Similarly, anti-HA precipitated Sgs1-HA, as expected, and coprecipitated Top3-V5 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). These signals are specific to the epitope-tagged proteins as extract from the untagged wild type strain showed no bands of corresponding size. We note that under optimal conditions Top3-V5 coprecipitated Sgs1-HA more efficiently than Sgs1-HA coprecipitated Top3-V5 (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with 6 and8). The simplest explanation for this effect is that there is an excess of Top3 over Sgs1 protein in the extract. Such a result is consistent with the genetics of this system; lowering the Top3:Sgs1 ratio either by mutating TOP3 (22Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) or by overexpressingSGS1 (16Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a profound growth defect. The previous experiment indicates that Sgs1 and Top3 interact in cell extracts but does not address the strength of the interaction or whether these proteins require DNA to interact. We addressed these questions by varying the conditions of the immunoprecipitation from nonstringent (Buffer A plus 150"
https://openalex.org/W2012957144,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a transmembrane protein conferring multidrug resistance to cells by extruding a variety of amphipathic cytotoxic agents using energy from ATP hydrolysis. The objective of this study was to understand how substrates affect the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by Pgp. The ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted recombinant human Pgp was measured using a continuous cycling assay. Pgp hydrolyzes ATP in the absence of drug at a basal rate of 0.5 μmol·min·mg−1 with aKm for ATP of 0.33 mm. This basal rate can be either increased or decreased depending on the Pgp substrate used, without an effect on the Km for ATP or 8-azidoATP and Ki for ADP, suggesting that substrates do not affect nucleotide binding to Pgp. Although inhibitors of Pgp activity, cyclosporin A, its analog PSC833, and rapamycin decrease the rate of ATP hydrolysis with respect to the basal rate, they do not completely inhibit the activity. Therefore, these drugs can be classified as substrates. Vanadate (Vi)-induced trapping of [α-32P]8-azidoADP was used to probe the effect of substrates on the transition state of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. TheKm for [α-32P]8-azidoATP (20 μm) is decreased in the presence of Vi; however, it is not changed by drugs such as verapamil or cyclosporin A. Strikingly, the extent of Vi-induced [α-32P]8-azidoADP trapping correlates directly with the fold stimulation of ATPase activity at steady state. Furthermore, Pi exhibits very low affinity for Pgp (Ki ∼30 mm for Vi-induced 8-azidoADP trapping). In aggregate, these data demonstrate that the release of Vi trapped [α-32P]8-azidoADP from Pgp is the rate-limiting step in the steady-state reaction. We suggest that substrates modulate the rate of ATPase activity of Pgp by controlling the rate of dissociation of ADP following ATP hydrolysis and that ADP release is the rate-limiting step in the normal catalytic cycle of Pgp.

P-glycoprotein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis vanadate 2[N-morpholino]ethane sulfonic acid Multidrug resistance, the reduced sensitivity to a variety of structurally unrelated, hydrophobic, chemotherapeutic agents, is a major problem in cancer treatment. This phenomenon is often associated with the overexpression of the human multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). MDR1 encodes a 170-kDa plasma membrane protein, P-glycoprotein (Pgp),1 that uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to expel a variety of anticancer drugs from cells, thus making them ineffective during chemotherapy. The secondary structure of Pgp is predicted to consist of two homologous halves each containing six putative transmembrane helices and a nucleotide-binding domain. These structural elements are common to a large family of membrane transporters called the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar,4Croop J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The widely accepted hypothesis of Pgp function is that substrate transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. However, the mechanism for this reaction is not well understood. In the absence of added substrate, Pgp catalyzes basal ATP hydrolysis (ATPase activity). This basal activity has been suggested to occur because of an endogenous lipid substrate(s) or an uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and drug extrusion (5Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Ambudkar S.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 6Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Hrycyna C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The basal rate is stimulated by adding any one of a variety of hydrophobic drug substrates; these drugs bind with unique apparent affinities and affect the ATPase activity of Pgp to varying degrees (7Sarkadi B.

However, a detailed assessment of the kinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of amphipathic drugs for the identification of the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle has not been carried out. Expression, purification, and reconstitution procedures of endogenous and six histidine-tagged (His6) human Pgp in a heterologous expression system are well described (10Ambudkar S.V.

Studies on the ATPase activity of Pgp in crude membrane preparations have indicated various drug-stimulated effects on the ATPase activity of Pgp (5Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Ambudkar S.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar); such experiments with crude protein can be difficult to interpret. Clearly, when purifying Pgp, the lipid environment of this membrane protein affects the ATPase activity and should remain constant for comparison of drug-stimulated activities (13Urbatsch I.L.

Vi is a proposed transition state analog that replaces Pi immediately after its release upon ATP hydrolysis. No phospho-enzyme intermediate of Pgp has been identified in the catalytic cycle of Pgp, indicating that all intermediates in the Pgp reaction are noncovalent (18Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J.

Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Our objective in this study is to understand how Pgp drug substrates might affect the overall kinetic mechanism of Pgp. Kinetic constants for various drugs that affect the steady-state ATPase activity of Pgp are quantified, and the extent of Vi-induced ADP trapping is compared in the presence and absence of various Pgp drug substrates. The correlation of these values has mechanistic implications. Our results suggest that ADP release is a rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of Pgp, and substrates and modulators exert their effect on ATPase activity by modulating this step. Octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and cyclosporin A were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). ATP (disodium salt), ADP, progesterone, prazosin, valinomycin, verapamil, vinblastine, and staurosporin were purchased from Sigma; tetraphenylphosphonium chloride was from Aldrich; tamoxifen was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); rapamycin was obtained from the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (Bethesda, MD); and PSC833 was the generous gift of Novartis Corp. (East Hanover, NJ). Acetone-ether washed Escherichia coli bulk phospholipids, egg phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cycling components, as described below, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 8-AzidoATP and [α-32P]8-azidoATP (10–20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Human Pgp was expressed and purified as previously described (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with minor changes. Briefly, His6-tagged Pgp was expressed using Trichoplusia ni (High FiveTM; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) insect cells grown in monolayer cultures and infected with a recombinant baculovirus BV-MDR1(H6) that contains a humanMDR1 that encodes Pgp. Crude Pgp-containing membranes were prepared by Dounce homogenization under hypotonic conditions (23Germann U.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and membrane proteins were solubilized with octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (1.25%) in the presence of 20% glycerol and lipid mixture (0.1%) (see “Routine Procedures”). Solubilized proteins were subjected to metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin from CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 0.95% octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.04% lipid; 80% purified Pgp was eluted with 100 mm imidazole (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Pgp in 100 mm imidazole fraction was then concentrated (Centriprep-50, Amicon, Beverly, MA) to ∼0.5 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. Pgp was identified by immunoblot analysis (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and quantitated by Amido Black protein estimation method as previously described (24Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Purified Pgp was combined with a lipid mixture (acetone-ether washed E. coli bulk phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol (60:17.5:10:12.5 w/w/w/w) (8Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar)), previously sonicated for 20 min in the ratio of 1:8 (protein:lipid w/w). This reconstitution mixture was dialyzed extensively (3 h with four buffer changes at 4 °C) with dialysis buffer (50 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% aprotinin) using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 cut-off from Pierce). Pgp-containing proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in dialysis buffer. Protein concentration was estimated by the Amido Black assay as described above. ATPase activity of purified, reconstituted Pgp was measured by two methods; the end point Pi assay and the continuous cycling assay. In both assays, Pgp-specific activity was recorded as the Vi (0.3 mm)-sensitive ATPase activity. Various test agents were added from 100× stock solutions in Me2SO so that the Me2SO concentration was no greater than 1%; this concentration of Me2SO had no effect on the activity of Pgp or the cycling assay components. For the Pi assay, the amount of inorganic phosphate released over 20 min at 37 °C was measured. ATPase assay buffer (50 mmMES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 5 mmNaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ouabain, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) was combined with either 5 mm MgCl2 or CoCl2, 0.5–2 μg of purified, reconstituted Pgp, and various Pgp drug substrates for a 5-min preincubation at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5–7.5 mm ATP and quenched with SDS (final concentration, 2.5%); the amount of Pi released was quantitated using a colorimetric method as previously described (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For the cycling assay, cycling components (3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.33 mm NADH, and 10 units/ml both pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) were added to the ATPase assay buffer (described above) with 10–15 mmMgCl2 to link the hydrolysis of ATP directly with the oxidation of NADH (12Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purified, reconstituted Pgp (1–10 μg in 100 μl of assay volume) was preincubated with various Pgp drug substrates at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled, 96-well plate spectrophotometer (Spectra MAX 250; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and monitored at OD340 nm using SoftMax Pro 2.4 software (Molecular Devices) for 5–10 min. The rate of change in absorbance was converted to nmol NADH oxidized per minute using an NADH standard curve; this value is equivalent to nmol ATP hydrolyzed per minute. The drug-stimulated ATPase activities in the presence of saturating ATP concentrations (5–7.5 mm) and various Pgp drug substrates were fit to Equation 1. υ/E=[V·S/(Kapp+S)]+VbEquation 1 υ/E is the ATPase activity at given concentrations of substrates, V is Vmax −Vb with Vmax as the maximal activity, S is the drug substrate concentration,Kapp is the apparent concentration at half-maximal activity, and Vb is the basal rate in the absence of added drug. The fold stimulation of ATPase activity by a given substrate is calculated byVmax/Vb. Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined for ATP and 8-azidoATP in the presence of saturating Pgp drug substrates, verapamil (50 μm) and cyclosporin A (10 μm); for basal activity (in the absence of added drug) an equivalent volume of Me2SO was added. ATPase activities using various nucleotide concentrations were fit to Equation 2.υ/E=Vmax·[NTP]/(Km+[NTP])Equation 2 [NTP] is the concentration of ATP or 8-azidoATP andKm is the concentration of NTP at half-maximal activity. Inhibition constants for ADP were determined using various concentrations of ADP and ATP in the presence and absence of 50 μm verapamil. ATPase activities were fit to Equation 3for competitive inhibition.υ/E=Vmax·[ATP]/(Km(1+[ADP]/Ki)+[ATP])Equation 3 Ki is the concentration of ADP at half-maximal inhibition. All curve fits in kinetic analyses were performed using Prism 2.0 software for Power-Mac (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Vi-induced 8-azidoADP trapping assays contained ATPase assay buffer, 0.3 mm Vi, either MgCl2 or CoCl2 (5 mm), 0.2–0.8 mg/ml purified Pgp (reconstituted), Pgp drug substrate, and 5–100 μm[α-32P]8-azidoATP (2.5–10 μCi/nmol). Reactions were preincubated in low light or semi-darkness in the absence of [α-32P]8-azidoATP at 37 °C for 5 min, initiated by the addition of [α-32P]8-azidoATP, and quenched by the addition of ice-cold ATP (12.5 mm). Reactions were exposed to UV light (UV-A long wave-F15T8BLB tubes, 365-nm wavelength; PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD) on ice for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The extent of 32P labeling was quantified using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The quantification of 32P incorporation/mg Pgp was performed using SDS-PAGE samples, previously dried for PhosphorImager detection, and then dissolved in Solvable (Packard, Meriden, CT) before scintillation counting as described previously (25Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Purified Pgp was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and incubated in the ATPase assay buffer containing 0.3 mm Vi and increasing concentrations (1–75 μm) of [α-32P]8-azidoATP (3–5 μCi/nmol) in the dark at 37 °C for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP and placing the sample on ice. Trapping of Pgp into the Pgp·Mg8-azidoADP·Vi conformation was carried out under basal conditions and in the presence of either 50 μmverapamil or 10 μm cyclosporin A. Following SDS-PAGE on an 8% Tris-glycine gel, the radioactivity in the Pgp bands was quantified on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager system. TheKm values for 8-azidoATP under basal conditions and in the presence of saturating concentrations of verapamil and cyclosporin A were obtained by fitting the data to Equation 2 using the software Prism as described above. Proteoliposomes containing purified Pgp (5–10 μg) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer containing 0.30 mm Vi. The proteoliposomes were then treated with Me2SO (control), 50 μm verapamil, or 10 μm cyclosporin A either in the presence of 0–150 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.8) or KCl. Finally, 50 μm [α-32P]8-azidoATP (2.5–5 μCi/nmol) was added in the dark and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by quenching with 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP solution and placing on ice. Following SDS-PAGE on an 8% Tris-glycine gel, the extent of trapping of 8-azidoADP was determined as described above. Proteoliposomes (5–10 μg of protein) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer in the presence of Me2SO, 50 μm verapamil, or 10 μm cyclosporin A for 5 min at 37 °C and transferred to ice. After 5 min on ice, 10 μm [α-32P]8-azidoATP (5–10 μCi/nmol) was added to each sample in the dark and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. The samples were then irradiated with UV light (365 nm) on ice (4 °C) as described above. Ice-cold ATP (12.5 mm) was added to displace excess noncovalently bound [α-32P]8-azidoATP. Excess nucleotides were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min by using S120-AT2 rotor in a RC-M120EX micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Newtown, CT) and the pellet resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on a 8% Tris-glycine gel at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the Pgp band was quantified using the STORM 860 PhosphorImager and the software ImageQuaNT. The lipid mixture was made by combining acetone/ether washed E. coli bulk phospholipids, phosphotidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in the ratio of 60:17.5:10:12.5 by weight and evaporating to dryness under N2 gas (26Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This dried stock was stored at −70 °C until resuspension at 50 mg/ml in a 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol solution. SDS-PAGE was performed using precast 8% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described (27Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1708-1716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) using the monoclonal antibody, C219 (a gift from Centocor). The Colloidal Blue Staining Kit (Novex, San Diego, CA) was used for total protein staining of SDS-PAGE samples. Sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was prepared by boiling a 50 mm solution in water for 3 min, and concentration was determined by using molar absorbance (λ268 nm = 3600 m−1). The previously described method was adopted for the purification of large amounts of pure Pgp (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). From ∼4 × 109 cells of baculovirus-infected High Five insect cells in suspension culture, 500–600 mg of crude membrane protein was routinely obtained. 60–70% of this crude membrane protein was recovered after solubilization with octylglucoside, and 4–6 mg of purified Pgp was collected following metal affinity chromatography. The reconstitution of purified Pgp into an artificial lipid bilayer, which is required to obtain a Pgp preparation totally free of the detergent, typically yielded 65% recovery, a value common among dialysis reconstitution procedures for Pgp (12Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 492-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of purified, reconstituted Pgp was routinely measured using two techniques: 1) an end point, Pi release assay measuring the amount of Pi released by the hydrolysis of ATP in a given amount of time and 2) a continuous cycling assay linking the hydrolysis of ATP to the oxidation of NADH using pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and their substrates. The cycling assay was preferred to the end point Pi assay because of its ability to monitor the ATPase reaction continuously in real time; in this way, the rates of ATPase activity were easily identified as steady-state, linear rates. Although the cycling assay was used to quantitate the kinetics of ATP and all Pgp drug substrates, some drawbacks were inherent in the method. As the cycling assay measures decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm resulting from the oxidation of NADH, activity measurements using 8-azidoATP, a light-sensitive substrate, were impossible and, therefore, quantitated using the Pi assay. Furthermore, the ATPase activity could not be monitored in the presence of ADP because of its stimulatory effect of cycling in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. A typical ATPase cycling experiment is shown in Fig.1, where the rate (mOD340/sec) of ATPase activity specific to Pgp is determined as the Vi-sensitive activity in the presence or absence of verapamil. The rate of change of absorbance per second is converted to nmol NADH oxidized·min−1 using an NADH standard curve. This value is directly comparable with the ATPase activity of Pgp recorded as nmol ATP hydrolyzed·min−1·mg−1. Typically, verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted Pgp was 0.6–1.2 μmol ATP hydrolyzed·min−1·mg−1, which is consistent with the values obtained using the Pi assay. This specific activity is slightly lower than previously reported for the human Pgp reconstituted by using the rapid dilution procedure (11Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To characterize how human Pgp uses different drugs to stimulate ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, several Pgp substrates were assayed over large concentration ranges. A trueKm value cannot be obtained because of the ATPase activity in the absence of added drug substrates (the basal rate, fold stimulation = 1.0). A similar parameter,Kapp, is used to describe the concentration of progesterone, prazosin, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride ion, valinomycin, verapamil, cyclosporin A, PSC833 (a cyclosporin A analog), and rapamycin at half-maximal ATPase activity (TableI). These drugs either increased (fold stimulation > 1.0) or decreased (fold stimulation < 1.0) the ATPase activity of Pgp.

https://openalex.org/W1976137262,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of circulating lipoprotein triglyceride molecules, is synthesized in myocytes and adipocytes but functions while bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells. This requires transfer of LPL from the abluminal side to the luminal side of endothelial cells. Studies were performed to investigate the mechanisms of LPL transcytosis using cultured monolayers of bovine aortic endothelial cells. We tested whether HSPGs and members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor superfamily were involved in transfer of LPL from the basolateral to the apical side of cultured endothelial cells. Heparinase/heparinitase treatment of the basolateral cell surface or addition of heparin to the basolateral medium decreased the movement of LPL. This suggested a requirement for HSPGs. To assess the role of receptors, we used either receptor-associated protein, the 39-kDa inhibitor of ligand binding to the LDL receptor-related protein and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, or specific receptor antibodies. Receptor-associated protein reduced (125)I-LPL and LPL activity transfer across the monolayers. When the basolateral surface of the cells was treated with antibodies, only anti-VLDL receptor antibodies inhibited transcytosis. Moreover, overexpression of the VLDL receptor using adenoviral-mediated gene transfer increased LPL transcytosis. Thus, movement of active LPL across endothelial cells involves both HSPGs and VLDL receptor."

Recently, NSP2 has been shown to form multimers and to possess an NTPase activity, but its precise function remains unclear. In the present study, we have characterized the solution structure of recombinant NSP2 by velocity and equilibrium ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that NSP2 exists as an octamer, which is functional in the binding of RNA and ADP. In the presence of magnesium, a partial dissociation of the octamer into smaller oligomers was observed. This was reversed by binding of ADP and RNA. We observed an increased sedimentation rate in the presence of ADP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, which suggests a change toward a significantly more compact octameric conformation. The secondary structure of NSP2 showed a high fraction of β-sheet, with small changes induced by magnesium that were reversed in the presence of RNA. That NSP2 can exist in different conformations lends support to the previously proposed hypothesis (Taraporewala, Z., Chen, D., and Patton, J. T. (1999) J.

It is a member of the Reoviridae, and its genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which codes for six structural and six nonstructural proteins. The structural proteins include VP2, VP6, and VP7, which form the triple layered icosahedral virion capsid, the spike protein VP4, the RNA polymerase VP1, and the multifunctional capping enzyme VP3 (1Chen D. Luongo C.L. Nibert M.L. Patton J.T. Virology. 1999; 265: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 2Estes M.K. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1996: 731-761Google Scholar). Many studies have addressed the properties of the structural proteins, for example their spatial configuration in the virus particle using cryo-EM (3Prasad B.V. Chiu W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 185: 9-29PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prasad B.V. Burns J.W. Marietta E. Estes M.K. Chiu W. Nature. 1990; 343: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), their antigenicity, and their role in viral entry, replication, or morphogenesis. Unfortunately, much less is known about the nonstructural proteins that are expressed and left behind in the infected cells. Although it has been shown that these nonstructural proteins are not essential for replicase activity in vitro (5Chen D. Zeng C.Q. Wentz M.J. Gorziglia M. Estes M.K. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7030-7039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they are important in several aspects of the replication cycle of the virusin vivo. Some of the more intensively studied nonstructural proteins include, for example, NSP4, which has a membrane-destabilizing activity and assists in the budding of newly synthesized inner capsid particles into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (6Tian P. Ball J.M. Zeng C.Q. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tian P. Ball J.M. Zeng C.Q. Estes M.K. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1996; 12: 69-77PubMed Google Scholar), where they acquire the outer coat protein VP7. NSP3 binds to the 3′-end of the viral mRNA and interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G to enhance efficiency of translation (8Vende P. Piron M. Castagne N. Poncet D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7064-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NSP2 and NSP5 interact to form viroplasms, large inclusions in the cytoplasm where core-like replication intermediates (core RIs)1 are assembled and RNA replication takes place (2Estes M.K. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1996: 731-761Google Scholar, 9Patton J.T. Spencer E.

Virol. 1999; 80: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As was shown in a study of a temperature-sensitive mutant, NSP2 is required for the formation of the viroplasm and is also essential in the synthesis of double-stranded RNAin vivo (11Chen D. Gombold J.L. Ramig R.F. Virology. 1990; 178: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this observation and the function of NSP2 on a molecular level. NSP2 is a 35-kDa protein that forms homomultimers and interacts with the RNA polymerase VP1 (12Kattoura M.D. Chen X. Patton J.T. Virology. 1994; 202: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, NSP2 interacts with and induces hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 (13Afrikanova I. Fabbretti E. Miozzo M.C. Burrone O.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which, in turn, interacts with NSP6 (14Torres-Vega M.A. Gonzalez R.A. Duarte M. Poncet D. Lopez S. Arias C.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Gonzalez R.A. Torres-Vega M.A. Lopez S. Arias C.F. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 981-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), possibly forming a regulatory multiprotein complex. Both NSP2 and NSP5 possess a sequence-independent affinity for the binding of RNA (17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are associated with the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 that form the core RIs that catalyze the synthesis of double-stranded RNA (16Gallegos C.O. Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is thought that NSP2 and NSP5 have an active role in the packaging of RNA into cores (9Patton J.T. Spencer E. Virology. 2000; 277: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that NSP2 possesses an NTPase activity, which suggests an energy-dependent function for NSP2, possibly that of a molecular motor involved in the packaging of mRNA into core RIs (17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have applied biophysical methods for the characterization of recombinant NSP2, with the goal to better understand the molecular structure of NSP2 in solution and the interaction with its ligands. In particular, we have studied the secondary structure, the oligomeric state, and the hydrodynamic shape of the protein in the presence of magnesium, nucleotide diphosphate and triphosphate, RNA, and DNA. As will be described below, we found that NPS2 self-assembles into relatively stable octamers, which can undergo conformational changes in the presence of magnesium and ADP. This may be of significance for understanding the function of NSP2. Recombinant NSP2 was prepared as described in detail in Ref. 17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In brief, a cDNA containing the NSP2 open reading frame of the simian rotavirus SA11 was cloned into the expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen). His-tagged rNSP2 was expressed inEscherichia coli M15[pREP4] cells (Qiagen) and purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm EDTA (except where noted otherwise). The protein was obtained with a purity of >98%. The extinction coefficient and the partial specific volume of the protein were calculated from the amino acid composition using the program Sednterp (18Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). For the experiments with phosphorylated NSP2, the protocol described previously was applied (17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ATP. This was followed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmEDTA. For the study of nucleic acid binding of NSP2, a single-stranded 23-mer of RNA (RNA23) (5′-UGAAAACGGCGACUGAGGAUACC3′; Dharmacon Research) and single-stranded 23-mer of DNA (DNA23) (5′-TGAAAACGGCGACTGAGGATACC-3′; Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. The extinction coefficients of the oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically. Sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge, using an An50 Ti eight-hole rotor and absorbance optics. Double-sector charcoal-filled epon centerpieces were filled with 120–130 μl of sample at concentrations between 4 and 17 μm. Sedimentation equilibrium was attained at a rotor temperature of 4 °C and at rotor speeds of 8,000 rpm and 12,000 rpm. Absorbance profiles were acquired at wavelengths of 230, 250, and 280 nm, chosen according to the protein concentration. In the presence of oligonucleotide, ADP, or ATPγS, additional scans at 260 and 285 nm were taken. Data analysis was performed by global analysis of several data sets obtained at different loading concentrations and rotor speeds using the mathematical modeling software MLAB (Civilized Software, Silver Spring, MD). No thermodynamic nonidealities were observed, and least-squares fits were based on Boltzmann distributions of ideal species in the centrifugal field, aλ(r)=c(r0)ɛλdexpM(1−v̄ρ)ω2(r2−r02)2RT+δEquation 1 where aλ denotes the experimentally measured absorbance at a wavelength λ and at the distancer from the center of rotation, c and ελ the concentration and extinction coefficient of the protein, d the optical path length of 1.2 cm, Mand v̄ the protein molar mass and partial specific volume, ρ the solvent density, ω the angular velocity of the rotor, T the absolute temperature, R the gas constant, r0 an arbitrary reference radius, and δ a base-line absorbance (19Svedberg T. Pedersen K.O. The ultracentrifuge. Oxford University Press, London1940Google Scholar), and their well known combination for models involving multiple species (20Laue T.M. Stafford W.F.I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P.

Reported errors in the equilibrium analyses are calculated confidence intervals fromF statistics (23Johnson M.L. Straume M. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge, using an An50 Ti eight-hole rotor and the interference optical detection system. Double-sector charcoal-filled epon centerpieces were filled with 350 μl of sample at concentrations between 1 and 10 μm. The rotor temperature was set between 20 and 24 °C, chosen to minimize temperature changes during a 1–2-h equilibration period of the rotor in the vacuum chamber prior to the start of the run. The rotor was then accelerated to 45,000 or 50,000 rpm at maximal rate, during which already visible sedimentation took place, as judged by the camera picture of the fringe profiles. Fringe displacement profiles were acquired in intervals of 30–40 s. Data were analyzed with the software SEDFIT, and errors reported are from replicate experiments. The analysis of the sedimentation velocity profiles was performed by direct boundary modeling by solutions of the Lamm equation,a(r,t)=χ(r,t)+ɛ+δEquation 2 dχdt=1rddrrDdχdr−sω2r2χwhere a(r, t) denotes the experimentally measured absorbance, ε and δ the systematic and random signal offset,s and D the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of the protein, and χ its concentration at positionr and time t (24Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar). This was combined with the algebraic calculation of systematic time-invariant and radial-invariant noise components ε (25Schuck P. Demeler B. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because these systematic signals are arbitrary offsets introduced from the detection system, calculated systematic offsets can be subtracted from the raw data without introduction of bias if the degrees of freedom in the analysis are not reduced. Therefore, the final calculated best-fit offsets are subtracted from the raw data for presentation. The Lamm equation solutions were calculated by using the finite element and moving frame of reference method described in Refs. 26Claverie J.-M. Dreux H. Cohen R. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 1685-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Schuck P. Biophys.

J. 1998; 74: 466-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, at a radial increment of ∼0.001 cm. The finite element simulations were modified to include the consideration of the acceleration phase of the rotor. An average acceleration rate and duration was calculated based on the difference of the ω 2 t and the t entry of the data files, and the rotor speed-dependent matrix elements in the finite element algorithm were dynamically updated in intervals of 10 s for the calculated duration of the acceleration phase. In contrast to the previous strategy of calculating effective sedimentation times from the elapsed ω 2 t, which provides the correct boundary positions, the simulated acceleration phase additionally calculates the extent of diffusion during the acceleration phase and thereby improves the accuracy of the boundary shapes and leads to slightly improved quality of the fits. Using a model for multiple discrete species, the location of the meniscus was treated as a floating parameter and optimized in the nonlinear regression of the data. The resulting meniscus position was then used in the continuous size distribution analysis (see below). To facilitate the analysis of systematic deviations in the fit, a two-dimensional bitmap representation of the residuals was calculated as described elsewhere. 2P. Schuck, D. Burkwall, W. Newcomb, D. Schubert, and J. Brown, submitted for publication. In this picture, pixel rows represent the sequence of scans, and pixel columns represent different radial values. The brightness at each pixel is calculated by linearly mapping the values between −0.05 and +0.05 to grayscale values from 0 to 256. This transformation should result in a neutral gray picture without structure for a perfect fit, and any visible structure represents systematic deviations of the model from the data. The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by thec(s) method by direct modeling with distributions of Lamm equation solutions,a(r,t)=∫c0(s)χ(s,D(s),r,t)ds+ɛ+δEquation 3 where c0(s)ds is the loading concentration of species with a sedimentation coefficient between s and s + ds). Following the procedure outlined in detail in Ref. 30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, the integral was solved by discretization into 250–300 s values between 4 and 18 S (unless noted otherwise), and a value of 1.3 for the frictional ratio f/f0 was used for estimating the average diffusional broadening of the sedimentation boundariesD(s). Maximum entropy regularization was used to calculate the simplest size distribution within a confidence level of 0.68 of the best-fit distribution (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). While the use of the same frictional ratio for all species estimates the average degree of diffusion (corrected for the different macromolecular sizes via Stokes-Einstein relationship), a more refined calculation was performed once the ∼12 S peak was identified as an octamer. The known molar mass of the oligomer was applied to all species in the sedimentation coefficient distribution within the range from 10 to 13.5 S, and diffusion coefficients were calculated directly by insertion ofs and M into the Svedberg equation (19Svedberg T. Pedersen K.O. The ultracentrifuge. Oxford University Press, London1940Google Scholar),D=sRTM(1−v̄ρ)Equation 4 For all species outside this predefined range of svalues, the approximation by using the frictional ratio was maintained. This method allows analyzing more rigorously the distribution of sedimentation coefficients for a macromolecule with known molar mass that can be present in different conformations, and its application leads to slightly sharper sedimentation coefficient distributions. To distinguish this distribution and indicate the use of a molar mass value, it will be referred to as cM (s) in the following. Dynamic light scattering experiments were conducted with a Protein Solutions DynaPro 99 instrument with DynaPro-MSTC200 microsampler (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Protein samples were drawn from the solution column after equilibrium sedimentation after the ultracentrifuge was stopped, and the cells were taken from the rotor with minimal convection. Although it is difficult to control the protein concentration in this way, this procedure is adequate for species analysis, and because of the persistent gradient close to equilibrium (31Darawshe S. Rivas G. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it very effectively eliminates signal contributions from particles outside the size range of interest. A 20-μl sample was inserted in the 90° light scattering cuvette with the temperature control set to 20 °C. The autocorrelation coefficients were exported for analysis with the software SEDFIT, adapted for dynamic light scattering analysis by replacing the single species Lamm equation solutions by the intensity correlation function, g(2)(τ)=exp[−2Dq2τ]Equation 5 where τ represents the decay time and q = (4πn/λ)sin(Θ/2), with the solvent refractive indexn, the wavelength of the incident light λ, and the scattering angle Θ (32Murphy R.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The size distribution analysis was performed analogous to the sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis, by replacing the Lamm equation solutions in the kernel by autocorrelation functions of the form in Equation 5. CD spectra of NSP2 and its complexes with ADP, RNA, and DNA were measured in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C, using 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Control spectra were also measured on ADP, RNA, and DNA alone at the same concentrations, and the spectrum of the protein in the complexes was calculated as the difference between each sample and its control. Protein concentrations were 130–150 μg/ml. Four scans were made between 190 and 320 nm, at a speed of 50 nm/min, and with a time constant of 1 s. The measured ellipticities (mdeg) were converted into the mean residue ellipticity θ as follows, Θ=mdeg×10×MRWl×c×100Equation 6 where MRW is the mean residue weight (115.9),l is the path length in cm, and c is the protein concentration in mg/ml. Secondary structure was estimated from averaged spectra using the CONTIN program (33Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), and reported errors are from the variation of results for fits of a quality close to that of the best fit. To characterize the state of association of NSP2, we have performed sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and dynamic light scattering experiments. Fig.1 shows results from the hydrodynamic measurements. The sedimentation velocity profiles can be fit very well with a single species Lamm equation model with an s value ofs20 = 11.96 ± 0.1 S. The analysis of the boundary spreading of the data shown in Fig. 1 A gives a molar mass of 301 kDa, which is virtually identical to the molar mass of an octameric NSP2 of 301.4 kDa calculated from the amino acid composition. However, the error associated with this estimate from replicate experiments was observed to be approximately ±10–20 kDa. Therefore, direct measurements of the diffusion coefficients were performed separately by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 1 D). The autocorrelation data were well described by a single component withD20 = 3.63 × 10−7cm2/s (with very minor impurities visible outside the size range of the protein). This value for D is consistent with the boundary spreading of the sedimentation velocity data, as indicated by the excellent fit to the Lamm equation model using the predeterminedD (Fig. 1, B and C) with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation in the order of the instrument noise, and only minor systematic deviation visible in the residuals bitmap. Taking the values of s and D together, a molar mass estimate of 312 kDa is obtained. This strongly suggests that NSP2 is octameric in solution. An independent confirmation of this result was obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments. As shown in Fig.2, the sedimentation equilibrium distributions are well described at several loading concentrations and rotor speeds by a model for a single octameric species. When the molar mass is treated as an unknown parameter in the global analysis, a value corresponding to 7.8 ± 0.2 subunits is obtained. From the sedimentation equilibrium data alone, it cannot be ruled out that there might be significant populations of both heptamers and nonamers. However, the fact that the boundary spreading in sedimentation velocity experiments is consistent with that of a single octameric species strongly indicates the absence of heterogeneity of NSP2 and suggests that octamer formation is a highly specific process. Sedimentation velocity experiments with phosphorylated NSP2 led to results indistinguishable from those of nonphosphorylated protein (data not shown). We also performed sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments with (nonphosphorylated) NSP2 in solutions of pH 5.2 and pH 9.2 and in varying concentrations of NaCl (0–100 mm). These experiments also led to virtually identical results (data not shown), indicating a high stability of the oligomer. Furthermore, consistent with the apparent absence of a slower sedimentation boundary in Fig. 1 A, the fit to the sedimentation velocity data cannot be improved by allowing for a smaller species in the model, which indicates that the free NSP2 monomer concentration is below the sensitivity of the interference optical systems, which corresponds to concentrations of <0.1 μm. After identifying the oligomeric state of NSP2 as an octamer, the sedimentation coefficient of s20 of 11.96 S can be used to calculate a frictional ratio of 1.30 and a Stokes radius of 5.8 nm. In terms of gross hydrodynamic shape, with an estimated hydration ratio of 0.383 g/g calculated from the amino acid composition (18Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E.

Open table in a new tab Since it was shown recently that NSP2 has an NTPase activity, for which the presence of magnesium is an essential cofactor, with optimal concentrations between 1 and 5 mm MgCl2 (17Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next studied the protein in 5 mm MgCl2. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that under these conditions NSP2 exists in a heterogeneous mixture of species, including populations that sediment significantly slower than the octamer. This effect disappeared when overnight dialysis in buffer without MgCl2 followed the incubation with magnesium, which indicates the reversibility of the observed magnesium effect. As is described below, this change in the oligomeric state by magnesium is also accompanied by small changes in secondary structure. To unravel the distribution of species, the sedimentation coefficient distribution was determined. The commonly used approach for a model-free analysis is an apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution g*(s), which operates in the approximation of D = 0 (no diffusion). A much more realistic treatment for diffusion has recently been developed, where an approximate average frictional ratio is used to estimate the diffusion coefficients D(s) as a function of the sedimentation coefficient (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), and initial applications have demonstrated the high resolution achieved (35Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36758-36765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).2 The resulting distributions c(s) are not diffusionally broadened, and the residual width of the peaks obtained for discrete protein species is dependent on the correctness of the shape assumption and (due to the maximum entropy regularization employed) on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We have used this method in the present study with the estimate 1.3 forf/f0 of all species, using the property of c(s) that it is not very sensitive to this value and assuming that the frictional ratio of the octameric NSP2 may be a reasonable approximation for the other unknown species. The resulting c(s) distribution obtained from the data presented in Fig. 3 A shows two main peaks at 6.4 S (24%) and 11.9 S (57%) as well as very small populations at 3.5 S (2%), between 8 and 10 S (7.6%), and at 14.5 S (3.1%). A discrete Lamm equation analysis was also performed to analyze the boundary spreading from the ∼12 S species. This resulted in a molar mass estimate of 306 ± 10 kDa, suggesting that this species is still octameric. To further improve the size distribution analysis by utilizing this knowledge of the 12 S species being octameric with a theoretical molar mass of 301 kDa, we have modified thec(s) method such that the diffusion coefficients of the species between 10 and"

To examine this possibility, Asp-140 was mutated to an alanine, phenylalanine, histidine, leucine, or asparagine, and the properties of the purified proteins were investigated. UV-visible and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that the distal water ligand is lost from the iron in all the mutants except, to some extent, the D140N mutant. In the D140H mutant, the distal water ligand is replaced by the new His-140 as the sixth iron ligand, giving a bis-histidine complex. The D140A, D140H, and D140N mutants retain a trace (<3%) of biliverdin forming activity, but the D140F and D140L mutants are inactive in this respect. However, the two latter mutants retain a low ability to form verdoheme, an intermediate in the reaction sequence. All the Asp-140 mutants exhibit a new peroxidase activity. The results indicate that disruption of the distal hydrogen bonding environment by mutation of Asp-140 destabilizes the ferrous dioxygen complex and promotes conversion of the ferrous hydroperoxy intermediate obtained by reduction of the ferrous dioxygen complex to a ferryl species at the expense of its normal reaction with the porphyrin ring."
https://openalex.org/W2108787781,"Tyrosinase is essential for pigmentation and is a source of tumor-derived antigenic peptides and cellular immune response. Wild type tyrosinase in melanoma cells and certain albino mutants in untransformed melanocytes are targeted to proteolytic degradation by the 26 S proteasome due to retention of the misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and its subsequent retranslocation to the cytosol. Here, we demonstrate that the substrates DOPA and tyrosine induced in melanoma cells a transition of misfolded wild type tyrosinase to the native form that is resistant to proteolysis, competent to exit the endoplasmic reticulum, and able to produce melanin. Because the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase is induced by DOPA, we propose that proper folding of the wild type protein, just like mutant forms, is tightly linked to its catalytic state. Loss of pigmentation, therefore, in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cells is a consequence of tumor-induced metabolic changes that suppress tyrosinase activity and DOPA production within these cells.

Loss of pigmentation, therefore, in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cells is a consequence of tumor-induced metabolic changes that suppress tyrosinase activity and DOPA production within these cells. Loss of pigmentation in human melanoma cells is common in advanced and metastatic lesions due to suppression of melanocyte-specific proteins. Down-regulation at the transcriptional level is likely to involve inactivation of microphthalmia, the transcription factor controlling pigment-specific genes such as tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin synthesis (1Halaban R.

Currie G. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 123-134PubMed Google Scholar). However, post-transcriptional processes cause the amelanotic phenotype of melanoma cells expressing wild type tyrosinase. In these cells tyrosinase is synthesized at levels similar to those of pigmented normal melanocytes but is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1as an early 70-kDa glycoform that is subsequently degraded by the proteasome (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Retention of tyrosinase in the ER is also characteristic of mutant tyrosinase proteins associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (4Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N.

Individuals with this recessively inherited condition have a normal number of melanocytes in the skin that are defective in melanin production. Thus, in melanoma cells, wild type tyrosinase behaves like a mutant protein in that it is not processed to the 80-kDa mature form, and its level in the melanosomes, the site of melanin synthesis, is not sufficient to induce pigmentation. These observations explain not only the loss of pigmentation but also suggest a mechanism by which tyrosinase peptides are produced for antigen presentation at the cell surface (see for example Refs. 6Kang X.Q. Kawakami Y. Elgamil M. Wang R.F. Sakaguchi K. Yannelli J.R. Appella E. Rosenberg S.A. Robbins P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1343-1348PubMed Google Scholar and 7Mosse C.A. Meadows L. Luckey C.J.

Tyrosinase (monophenol, l-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of tyrosine and DOPA to DOPAquinone, the rate-limiting reactions in melanin synthesis (8Lerner A.B. Fitzpatrick T.B. Calkins E. Summerson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the catalytic activity of tyrosinase is dependent on DOPA (8Lerner A.B. Fitzpatrick T.B. Calkins E. Summerson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cooksey C.J. Garratt P.J. Land E.J. Pavel S. Ramsden C.A. Riley P.A. Smit N.P. J. Biol.

Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that DOPA also elicits a conformational change favorable for exit of tyrosinase from the ER to the Golgi. Here we show that the release of wild type tyrosinase from the ER was enhanced in melanoma cells by treatment with the cofactor DOPA and the substrate tyrosine. DOPA/tyrosine promoted the accumulation of proteolytically resistant and Golgi-processed tyrosinase, as confirmed by biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy. Normal human melanocytes were cultured from newborn foreskins in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 7% fetal bovine serum (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), termed basal medium, that was further enriched with several ingredients required for normal melanocyte proliferation. They included 85 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (IBMX), 2.5 nm cholera toxin, 1 μmNa3VO4, and 0.1 mm dbcAMP, all from Sigma (11Halaban R. Cheng C. Smicun Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) designated TICVA. The highly pigmented state of normal melanocytes was stable regardless of passage number or changes in the composition of the external growth factors. Human metastatic melanoma cells YUGEN8, 501 mel, 888 mel, YUSAC2, and YUSIT1 (all expressing wild type tyrosinase) were maintained in Ham's F-10 basal medium as described (11Halaban R. Cheng C. Smicun Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with the basal medium and unmodified OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 2% fetal bovine serum or tyrosine-free minimal essential medium or RPMI medium. Experimental medium was supplemented with 50 μm freshly prepared DOPA (stock solution 1 mmin PBS) or tyrosine (Life Technologies, Inc.; at the indicated concentration) and adjusted to pH 7.4–7.7 prior to use. The concentration of tyrosine in the unmodified Ham's F-10 and OptiMEM media was 10 and 200 μm, respectively. To test the effect of tyrosine elimination, cells were starved in tyrosine-free medium for 2–4 h prior to any further manipulations. The effect of external tyrosinase activity was explored by adding cell extract of normal human melanocytes prepared in a solution containing 0.5% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Tyrosinase activity in the melanocyte cell extract was determined as described below. CHAPS lysis buffer (2% CHAPS in 50 mm HEPES and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used to lyse cells and to wash bead-bound precipitated material as described (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analyses of whole cell lysates (40 μg protein/lane, as measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent), or affinity purified glycoproteins using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) bound to beads (lectin fromtriticum vulgaris; Sigma;) were performed following standard procedures or the manufacturer's instructions. Tyrosinase was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody T311 (12Chen Y.T. Stockert E. Tsang S. Coplan K.A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8125-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and equal protein loading was verified by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after transfer of the proteins to membranes and by subsequent immunoblotting with anti-actin antibodies. Densities of tyrosinase bands on the x-ray films were determined using an NIH image analyzer, selecting all visible bands, as described in the manual. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein in ∼100 μl of CHAPS lysis buffer) were incubated with 50–70-μl slurry of WGA bound to beads and shaking for 2 h at 8 °C. Bead-bound proteins were hydrolyzed with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were stopped with sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins were subjected to Western blotting as above. Melanoma cells were grown on chamber slides in unmodified Ham's F-10 medium at pH 7.6. Cells were incubated with and without 50 μm DOPA in Ham's F-10 medium for 4 h. Attached cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. The permeabilized and fixed cells were then incubated with polyclonal antibodies against tyrosinase (goat C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or calnexin (rabbit; StressGen BiotechnologiesCorp., Victoria, BC, Canada) to localize the ER and then with fluorescein anti-goat conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or rhodamine anti-rabbit conjugates (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), all diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Indirect immunofluorescence was visualized with an inverted Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal microscope system. Images were processed with Bio-Rad Confocal Assistant software. Whole cell lysates (4 μg protein/μl in 2% CHAPS lysis buffer without protease inhibitors) were digested with trypsin (TPCK (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone)-treated) at the indicated concentration at 27 °C for 10 or 15 min. Digestion was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 3× SDS sample buffer and heating for 1 min at 95 °C. Reaction products (40 μg/lane) were subjected to Western analysis with anti-tyrosinase mAb followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against actin (Sigma) as a control. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described (4Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pulse-labeled (15 min) with [35S]Met/Cys (0.7 mCi/ml; EasyTag, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI medium (200 μm tyrosine; Life Technologies, Inc.) and either collected immediately or after 4 h of chase incubation with nonradioactive medium. DOPA (50 μm) was added to half of the samples during the pulse, chase, or both incubation times. Cell extracts (2–10 × 107 cpm in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material) were treated with Zysorbin (fixed and killed Staphylococcus aureus; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) to remove nonspecific binding proteins and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal T311 anti-tyrosinase mAb. Following extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, half of the precipitated products were digested with Endo H overnight followed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses fractionation and autoradiography. Densities of radioactive tyrosinase bands on the x-ray films were determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Total cell lysates were prepared in 2% CHAPS buffer plus protease inhibitors as above, and tyrosinase assays were performed with l-tyrosine-[3,5-3H] (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a substrate (13Pomerantz S.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Halaban R. Lerner A.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 108: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Halaban R.

Briefly, reaction mixtures (200-μl final volume), contained 50–150 μg of cell extract protein, 50 μml-tyrosine, and 50 μml-DOPA (in triplicates or duplicates, as indicated) and 1 μCi/assayl-tyrosine-[3,5-3H]. After 15–120 min (as indicated) of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped with 200 μl of charcoal slurry, passed through 350-μl packed Dowex columns, and radioactivity of the eluate in scintillation fluid was measured with a scintillation counter. One unit of tyrosinase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the oxidation of 1 mmol of tyrosine in 1 min. Standard errors were in the range of 15% of total counts. The amelanotic YUGEN8 human melanoma cells that originated from a pigmented metastatic tumor were first tested for the effect of DOPA, because they displayed unstable pigmentation and variability in the levels of ER- and Golgi-processed tyrosinase proteins (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in medium supplemented with DOPA for increasing periods of time. Visual examination of the harvested and sedimented cell pellets revealed increased pigmentation after 4 h of DOPA treatment (data not shown). Western blotting with anti-tyrosinase antibodies of melanoma whole cell lysates, or affinity fractionated glycoproteins digested with Endo H, confirmed previous observations (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Under conditions that allowed tyrosinase to become fully mature in normal human melanocytes (Ref. 3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3 B, lane 9), the steady-state tyrosinase in the amelanotic YUGEN8 melanoma cells was mainly a distinct ∼70-kDa species sensitive to Endo H digestion, indicative of an immature ER glycoform (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and7, empty arrow). However, within 2 h of DOPA treatment, mature Endo H-resistant glycoforms accumulated (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 8). Most of the enzyme was fully processed and Endo H-resistant after 8 h of treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11). In addition, DOPA caused an increase in the abundance of the 70-kDa species, as well as the 6D-kDa forms, distinctly visible after 2 and 4 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3,bands marked with empty arrow andarrowhead, respectively). Tyrosinase of 60 kDa was previously identified as the deglucosylated protein that accumulated after treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin but not with the lysosomal inhibitors E64 (l-trans-epoxysuccinic acid) and NH4Cl (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, DOPA stabilized the ER glycoform of tyrosinase, as well as protein that had been diverted from the ER to the cytoplasm for degradation.Figure 1DOPA-induced Golgi processing and increased tyrosinase levels. A, YUGEN8 melanoma cells were incubated for increasing duration in unmodified OptiMEM medium (5 ml of 200 μm tyrosine), in the presence or absence of 50 μm DOPA. The pH value was maintained at 7.4. Western blotting was performed with whole cell lysates (WCL) or with WGA precipitated proteins that were incubated overnight with or without Endo H. The open and closed arrows designate the 70-kDa ER form and the 60-kDa deglycosylated form of tyrosinase, respectively. B, tyrosinase processing in 501 mel cells in response to DOPA. Cells were incubated with 50 μm DOPA in OptiMEM medium and harvested for Western blot analysis with anti-tyrosinase mAb followed by blotting with anti-actin (lanes 1 and 2). Tyrosinase is marked with abracket. Alternatively, the same batch of treated cells were harvested and processed for mRNA analysis using quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction and primers for human actin (lanes 3 and 4) or human TYR (lanes 5 and 6).

Perlis R. Eliyahu S. Yarden Y. Givol D. Lyman S.D. Halaban R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2221-2229PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B, compare lane 1 to lane 2, and data not shown). Quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction analysis of tyrosinase mRNA showed no increase in message levels (Fig.1 B, compare lane 5 to lane 6), suggesting that the changes occurred post-transcriptionally. Taken together, the increased abundance of tyrosinase species of 70 and 60 kDa and the accumulation of Endo H-resistant glycoforms indicated that DOPA induced a conformational change that conferred resistance to endogenous proteolytic degradation and competency to exit from the ER to the Golgi. Subcellular localization by indirect confocal immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed the biochemical analyses. Tyrosinase in amelanotic YUGEN8 melanoma cells was displayed in a perinuclear reticular pattern coincident with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2, panels marked−DOPA, compare TYR and CNX toMerge). In contrast, after 4 h of incubation with DOPA, tyrosinase was distributed outside of the ER and Golgi, as observed by the abundant appearance of spots at distal sites that did not merge with calnexin staining (Fig. 2, panels marked+DOPA, compare TYR and CNX toMerge). Therefore, DOPA treatment permitted tyrosinase to become transport-competent. As the experiments described above were performed in Ham's F-10 or OptiMEM medium containing tyrosine (10 and 200 μm, respectively), DOPA supplementation may have served to enhance tyrosinase maturation in cooperation with tyrosine. Indeed, the requirement for substrate in this process was confirmed by exclusion of tyrosine from the medium. There was no induction of DOPA-mediated tyrosinase maturation in tyrosine-free minimal essential medium (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1and 2), indicating that the substrate and cofactor of tyrosinase are both critical for inducing export-competent tyrosinase species. We then explored the possibility that tyrosine by itself can induce maturation, because DOPA is generated by an autocatalytic process during the initial phase of the tyrosinase reaction (8Lerner A.B. Fitzpatrick T.B. Calkins E. Summerson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cooksey C.J. Garratt P.J. Land E.J. Pavel S. Ramsden C.A. Riley P.A.

Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In these experiments, accumulation of endogenously produced DOPA was favored by supplementing the medium with excess tyrosine and maintaining high ratio of melanoma cells to medium (such as ∼1.5 × 105 cells/cm2/ml). The results showed that enriching the medium with additional tyrosine to a final concentration of 400 μm was sufficient to induce maturation of YUGEN8 tyrosinase within 2 h (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 3 to lanes 5 and 6). Accumulation of tyrosinase reaction products sufficient to stabilize tyrosinase and induce maturation was dependent on the concentration of extracellular tyrosine, the level of residual tyrosinase within the melanoma cells, the density of the cells, the volume of the medium, and the duration of the incubation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–6;B, lanes 1–8; C, lanes 1–3, and data not shown). The likely enzymatic source of intracellular DOPA in the tyrosine-supplemented medium is tyrosinase and not the dopaminergic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). These melanoma cells did not express TH mRNA (tested by RT polymerase chain reaction with TH-specific primers; data not shown), and endogenous TH protein was not detected by Western blotting with anti-TH antibodies (sc-7847; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; data not shown). Furthermore, ectopic expression of l-DOPA-producing TH rendered constitutively active by truncation of the N-terminal regulatory domain (termed tHTH; see Ref.17Moffat M. Harmon S. Haycock J. O'Malley K.L. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) did not induce any changes in tyrosinase processing in 501 mel amelanotic melanoma cells (data not shown). In contrast, the effect of DOPA and tyrosine on maturation was enhanced by exogenous tyrosinase from normal human melanocytes (40 microunits/ml) supplied to the medium as whole cell extract (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 3and 4). Altogether, these results showed that aberrant ER retention of tyrosinase in melanoma cells could be corrected by the concerted effect of the cofactor DOPA and the substrate tyrosine. DOPA and tyrosine enhanced the formation of tyrosinase that was more resistant to endogenous proteolytic degradation, as seen by accumulation of the 70-kDa early glycoforms and the apparent deglucosylated 60-kDa species (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, we further explored structural differences between the 70-kDa and fully processed protein by probing their resistance to trypsin digestion using tyrosinase from normal human melanocytes as a control. The results showed that the Golgi-processed enzyme produced in normal human melanocytes was resistant to up to 200 μg of trypsin, whereas the faster migrating 70-kDa ER form was trypsin-sensitive (Fig.4, lanes 1–8). In melanoma cells that solely accumulated the 70-kDa protein, TYR was highly sensitive to proteolytic digestion as it was completely digested by 50 μg of trypsin in 10 min (Fig. 4, lanes 9–14). Incubation of 501 mel melanoma cells with 400 μm tyrosine for 5 h induced the accumulation of processed tyrosinase protein that was trypsin-resistant up to 200 μg/ml of trypsin (Fig. 4, lanes 15–20). In contrast, high levels of tyrosine in the medium did not confer trypsin resistance to actin (data not shown). These results suggest that the ER-retained tyrosinase is a trypsin-sensitive conformer, compared with the trypsin-resistant Golgi-processed species whose production was enhanced by the presence of high concentrations of tyrosine in the medium. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments were carried out to determine the stage at which DOPA stabilized the ER-retained tyrosinase. As shown in Fig. 5, newly synthesized tyrosinase remained an ER-retained and Endo H-sensitive conformer in the absence of DOPA (Fig. 5, lanes 1,2, 5, and 6). The addition of DOPA during the 4-h chase period was sufficient to stabilize the protein into an exit-competent conformation and induced maturation into an Endo-H resistant form (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). Including DOPA during the pulse and chase periods further enhanced its stability and maturation (Fig. 5, lanes 9 and10). These results indicated that DOPA stabilization of tyrosinase occurred both co- and post-translationally. The data suggested that DOPA is in low abundance in melanoma cells probably because of inactive tyrosinase. Because normal melanocytes always possessed Golgi-processed tyrosinase even in the low tyrosine Ham's F-10 medium, we tested whether the mitogenic ingredients (TICVA) added to maintain growth and known to stimulate intracellular levels of cAMP (cholera toxin and IBMX), or protein kinase C (the phorbol ester TPA), can also promote maturation. However, no changes in tyrosinase processing or activity were observed in the melanoma cells in response to TPA, IBMX, or TICVA (data not shown). Conversely, normal melanocytes expressed normal tyrosinase glycoforms and remained highly pigmented when grown in the presence of peptide growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and endothelin (without TICVA) (18Lerner A.B. Halaban R. Klaus S.N. Moellmann G.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 219-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Böhm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the ER form of tyrosinase from melanoma cells can be activated by DOPA and tyrosine after cell lysis. Tyrosinase activity in whole cell lysates from normal melanocytes that represented largely the mature form and from YUGEN8 and 501 mel melanoma cells expressing low levels of proteins mostly of the immature Endo H-sensitive forms was measured in the presence of DOPA (Fig.6 A; see also Ref. 3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Compared with normal melanocytes, extracts from melanoma cells possessed low levels but nevertheless measurable tyrosinase activity (Fig.6 B). This activity is likely a result of the post-lysis activation of the immature protein, because standardizing the activity to tyrosinase band density displayed by the Western blot (Fig.6 A, numbers indicated on the bottom) eliminated the differences between the three samples (Fig.6 C). Thus, DOPA in the in vitro assay clearly activated not only fully matured but also immature tyrosinase species. Malignant transformation of normal melanocytes to melanoma cells is associated with down-regulation of pigmentation. In previous studies, we showed that tumor-specific retention of tyrosinase in the ER is the cause of the amelanotic phenotype in tyrosinase-positive melanoma cells (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, wild type tyrosinase in these cells displays a phenotype similar to inactive mutant tyrosinase proteins common in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (4Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Berson J.F. Frank D.W. Calvo P.A. Bieler B.M. Marks M.S. J. Biol.

In this report, we provide evidence that DOPA and tyrosine, the cofactor and substrates of tyrosinase, are required for wild type tyrosinase maturation in melanoma cells. DOPA and tyrosine stabilize the ER-retained protein and permit its transport through the secretory pathway in these amelanotic melanoma cells. The two lectin ER molecular chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, appear to be responsible for the ER retention of incompletely or improperly folded tyrosinase (3Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5229-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These chaperones bind and retain proteins possessing monoglucosylated glycans (22Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The retention of a protein is the result of continued reglucosylation of the protein by the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, an ER sensor that reglucosylates glycoproteins containing misfolded or mobile regions (24Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, DOPA/tyrosine binding must stabilize tyrosinase so that it is no longer a substrate for reglucosylation and is therefore subsequently released from the ER. DOPA/tyrosine can be added to the growing list of chemical chaperones that stabilize target proteins, including otherwise inactive mutants. For example, drug substrates or modulators allowed mutant forms of the human ATP-dependent drug pump, P-glycoprotein, to attain an ER export-competent configuration (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol"

We demonstrate here that Epo as well as IL-3 activates Rap1 in an IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, 32D, expressing the Epo receptor. The cytokine-induced activation of Rap1 was augmented in cells that inducibly overexpress CrkL or C3G. The CrkL-mediated enhancement of cell adhesion was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rap1, Rap1A-17N, whereas an activated mutant of Rap1, Rap1A-63E, activated β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of hematopoietic cells. In 32D cells, Rap1 was also activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, which also enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin, whereas U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, inhibited both cytokine-induced activation of Rap1 and cell adhesion. It was also demonstrated that Rap1 as well as CrkL is involved in signaling from the EpoR endogenously expressed in a human leukemic cell line, UT-7. These results suggest that Epo and IL-3 activate Rap1 at least partly through the CrkL-C3G complex as well as through additional pathways most likely involving phospholipase Cγ and strongly implicate Rap1 in regulation of β1integrin-mediated hematopoietic cell adhesion.

The hematopoietic cytokine receptors mainly couple with Jak2, a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, to activate various signal transduction pathways, including those involving the Ras/Erk activation cascade, Stats, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ (1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Most of the hematopoietic cytokines, such as stem cell factor, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), thrombopoietin, and Epo, also activate adhesion of hematopoietic cells to extracellular matrix components through integrins of the β1 subfamily, mainly VLA-4 (α4β1) and VLA-5 (α5β1) (2Levesque J.P.

Broxmeyer H.E. Ann. Hematol. 1997; 75: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which receptors for these cytokines transduce signals to activate integrins (inside-out signaling) have remained elusive. CrkL is a member of the Crk family of adaptor proteins originally identified as homologues of the product of the v-crkoncogene and is most abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells (6Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CrkL has the domain structure Src homology (SH)2-SH3-SH3 and has been shown to bind through its N-terminal SH3 domain with various signaling molecules including Sos1 and C3G, two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins (7Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that CrkL is involved in hematopoietic cytokine receptor signaling because CrkL becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in hematopoietic cells in response to stimulation with Epo or IL-3 and forms complexes with several tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, such as Cbl, Shc, and SHP-2 (9Chin H. Saito T. Arai A. Yamamoto K. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that CrkL is involved through its interaction with C3G in activation of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway leading to the induction of c-fos gene expression in response to Epo or IL-3 (10Nosaka Y. Arai A. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30154-30162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, hematopoietic cells overexpressing CrkL or C3G showed an enhanced adhesion through β1 integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 in response to cytokines, whereas cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of CrkL or C3G showed an impairment in adhesion (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CrkL-mediated enhancement of hematopoietic cell adhesion, also reported by others (12Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Uemura N. Salgia R. Ewaniuk D.S. Little M.T. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3343-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was observed without changes in expression levels of these integrins, thus suggesting that it is through the increase in ligand binding activity of integrins (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, thus, indicate that CrkL as well as C3G is involved in cytokine signaling leading to the activation of hematopoietic cell adhesion through β1 integrins. However, the CrkL-mediated activation of hematopoietic cell adhesion was independent of Ras activation (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has remained unknown how the CrkL-C3G complex activates the downstream signaling pathways leading to integrin activation. Rap1 is a small GTPase of the Ras family which was first identified as a homologue of Ras (14Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar) and was also identified independently by its ability to induce a flat revertant phenotype in K-Ras-transformed cells (15Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Two highly homologous forms of Rap1, Rap1A and Rap1B, have been identified (16Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar), but their functional difference has been unclear. Recent studies have shown that Rap1 is activated in fibroblasts after stimulation with a variety of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and lysophosphatidic acid (17Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Rap1 is also activated after stimulation of the T cell or B cell antigen receptor in lymphocytes (19Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 20McLeod S.J. Ingham R.J. Bos J.L. Kurosaki T. Gold M.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Depending on cell types, different types of intracellular second messengers, including calcium, diacylglycerol, and cyclic AMP, have been implicated in Rap1 activation (17Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently identified, two GEFs for Rap1, Epac (22de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), which is directly activated by cyclic AMP, and CalDAG-GEFI (23Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), which is sensitive to both calcium and diacylglycerol, have been supposed to mediate Rap1 activation in response to these second messengers. C3G, which forms a complex with CrkL, also efficiently activates Rap1 in vitro as well as when expressed in COS cells (24Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C3G as well as CrkL has recently been implicated in Rap1 activation induced by stimulation with nerve growth factor (25York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), interferon-γ (26Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Ahmad S. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10772-10778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or by stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (19Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). With an effector domain that is nearly identical to Ras and binds to many of the same effectors, Rap1 has been hypothesized to have antagonistic effects on the downstream signaling events of Ras. However, roles for Rap1 in physiological signaling pathways largely remain elusive (17Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Previously, M'Rabet et al. (28M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that GM-CSF, a hematopoietic cytokine that shares a receptor chain with IL-3, stimulates Rap1 in mature neutrophils. Rap1 is also activated in neutrophils by other stimuli that are involved in neutrophil activation, including fMet-Leu-Phe, platelet-activating factor, and IgG-coated particles (28M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms for GM-CSF-induced Rap1 activation in neutrophils and its physiological significance remain to be understood. Furthermore, although Rap1 has been shown to be activated in highly differentiated and specialized hematopoietic cells, such as mature neutrophils (28M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and platelets (21Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), it has remained to be determined whether Rap1 is involved in cytokine receptor signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells. In the present study, we have examined the possible involvement of Rap1 in cytokine receptor signaling and reveal that Epo as well as IL-3 activates Rap1 in hematopoietic 32D cells, most likely through the signaling pathways involving the CrkL-C3G complex and PLC-γ. Furthermore, the present study indicates that Rap1 is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic cell adhesion through β1integrins. A clone of IL-3-dependent 32D cells expressing the wild-type murine Epo receptor (EpoR), 32D/EpoR-Wt, was described previously (29Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

A. 1990; 87: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) tagged with the T7 epitope, pSRα-T7-Rap1A-17N and pSRα-T7-Rap1A-63E, respectively, were kindly provided by Drs. Makoto Noda and Masakazu Hattori (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). For construction of pTet-Rap1A-63E, a tetracycline-responsive expression plasmid for Rap1A-63E, the BamHI/EcoRV fragment of pSRα-T7-Rap1A-63E coding for T7-tagged Rap1A-63E, was excised and subcloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to give pcDNA-Rap1A-63E. The region coding for T7-tagged Rap1A-63E was then excised from pcDNA3-Rap1A-63E by digestion with both HindIII andXbaI and subcloned between the HindIII andSpeI sites of pTet-Splice to give pTet-Rap1A-63E. The pGEX-RalGDS-RBD plasmid encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the 97-amino acid Rap1 binding domain (RBD) of the RalGDS protein (34Reedquist K.A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4944-4949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands). A control luciferase plasmid, pGL-cont, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Transfection for stable expression was carried out essentially as described previously (29Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In brief, 32DE/TA cells were transfected with 10 μg of pTet-Rap1A-63E along with 1 μg of pMAM2-BSD, purchased from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan), by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 300 V, followed by selection in medium containing blasticidin-S (Funakoshi) and 500 ng/ml tetracycline. Six clones transfected with pTet-Rap1A-63E were isolated by limiting dilution and examined for the induction of Rap1A-63E expression by anti-T7 immunoblotting of cell lysates prepared after withdrawal from tetracycline for 24 h. The clone inducibly expressing the highest level of Rap1A-63E, 32DE/TA-Rap1A-63E, was selected for the subsequent studies. Similarly, a clone of 32D/EpoR-Wt, 32DE/CrkL, which constitutively overexpresses CrkL, was obtained by transfection of pSG-CrkL. Transfection of expression plasmids into COS-7 cells was carried out using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described previously (35Chin H. Nakamura N. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Ihle J.N. Miura O. Blood. 1996; 88: 4415-4425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 days after transfection, cells were harvested for analysis. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (36Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rap1 activation in cells was determined by using an activation-specific probe, essentially as described by Zwartkruis et al. (37Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Cell lysates were incubated with the GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein, prepared as described previously and precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads. After incubation for 45 min at 4 °C, beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Rap1-GTP bound to beads was eluted by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rap1 antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, U. K.). For immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates, samples were prepared by mixing an aliquot of cell lysates with an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. All Rap1 activation assays were performed at least three times with reproducible results. Quantification of blots was performed with NIH Image software. Adhesion assays of transiently transfected cells were performed essentially as described previously (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 32D/EpoR-Wt and UT-7 cells were electroporated with the indicated amounts of relevant plasmids and 1 μg of a control luciferase plasmid, pGL-cont. The total amount of expression plasmids for each transfection was adjusted to become equal by adding an empty plasmid. After a recovery period of 1 day in medium containing 1 unit/ml Epo, cells were plated in triplicate on wells coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After wells were washed three times to remove unbound cells, cells remaining attached to the wells were measured by the luciferase assay. After subtraction of background cell binding to bovine serum albumin-coated wells, the percentage of adherent cells was determined by dividing the luciferase activity of the adherent cells by that of the initial cell input. For adhesion assays of stably transfected clones, cells were labeled with 5 μm2′7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxy fluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h. After being washed three times, fluorescently labeled cells were subjected to cell adhesion assay as described above. Cells were measured by Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Alternatively, unlabeled cells were subjected to cell adhesion assays and measured by using the sodium XTT colorimetric assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), as described previously (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell adhesion assays under “Results” were carried out using fibronectin-coated plates unless described otherwise and repeated at least three times, and the results were reproducible. Previously, we have shown that CrkL is involved in hematopoietic cytokine receptor signaling and plays a role in activation of integrin-mediated hematopoietic cell adhesion through its interaction with C3G (9Chin H. Saito T. Arai A. Yamamoto K. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a GEF that most efficiently activates Rap1 (24Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Rap1 may be involved in the CrkL-mediated cytokine receptor signaling pathway regulating hematopoietic cell adhesion, we first examined whether IL-3 or Epo induces Rap1 activation in hematopoietic cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, the affinity purification assay using the GST-RalGDS-RBD, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” demonstrated that IL-3 as well as Epo stimulation induces activation of Rap1 in 32D/EpoR-Wt cells, a clone of murine IL-3-dependent 32D cells expressing the EpoR (29Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Rap1 activation induced by IL-3 or Epo was observed as early as 1 min after stimulation, increased to plateau at 5–20 min, and was sustained as long as 60 min. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Rap1 was significantly activated when cells were stimulated with Epo or IL-3 at a concentration as low as 1 unit/ml or 1 ng/ml, respectively. When stimulated with a higher concentration of Epo (10 units/ml) or IL-3 (10 ng/ml), a further increase in Rap1 activity was observed. Anti-Rap1 blotting of total cell lysates showed that the total amount of Rap1 in the cells did not change significantly after stimulation with IL-3 or Epo (Fig. 1, lower panels). These results thus demonstrate that IL-3 and Epo induce time- and dose-dependent activation of Rap1 in hematopoietic cells. To examine whether CrkL is involved in cytokine-induced activation of Rap1 in hematopoietic cells, we next examined the cytokine-induced activation of Rap1 in a clone of 32D/EpoR-Wt cells, 32DE/Tet-CrkL, which inducibly overexpresses CrkL when withdrawn from tetracycline (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A and B, the Rap1 activation induced by IL-3 as well as the basal level of Rap1 activity in 32DE/Tet-CrkL was augmented when cells were depleted overnight from tetracycline. Anti-Rap1 and anti-CrkL blotting of total cell lysates confirmed that the depletion of tetracycline increased the expression level of CrkL but not that of Rap1 in 32DE/Tet-CrkL cells. Similarly, Epo-induced activation of Rap1 was augmented when 32DE/Tet-CrkL cells were induced to overexpress CrkL (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that CrkL is involved, most likely through its interaction with C3G, in IL-3- and Epo-induced activation of Rap1. To confirm that C3G is also involved in cytokine-induced Rap1 activation, we examined 32DE/Tet-C3G cells, which overexpress C3G when withdrawn from tetracycline (11Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the Rap1 activation induced by Epo or IL-3 was augmented significantly when C3G was overexpressed. Anti-phospho-Erk blotting of total cell lysates demonstrated that the Epo- or IL-3-induced activation of Erk is also enhanced when C3G was overexpressed, which is in agreement with our previous observation that C3G is also involved in cytokine-induced activation of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway. Together, these results strongly suggest that the CrkL-C3G complex is involved in Epo- and IL-3-induced activation of Rap1. To explore the possibility that CrkL-mediated activation of hematopoietic cell adhesion is mediated by Rap1, we first employed Rap1A-17N, a putative dominant negative mutant of Rap1 (25York R.D.

Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). However, because the dominant negative effect of Rap1A-17N has been disputed by recent in vitro studies (39van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we first examined whether Rap1A-17N inhibits Rap1 activation mediated by C3G in COS cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, when transiently overexpressed in COS cells, the activated form of wild-type Rap1, but not that of Rap1A-17N, was detected by affinity purification assays with GST-RalGDS-RBD. In accordance with a previously report (24Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), when C3G was coexpressed, the activated form of wild-type Rap1 was increased drastically. However, the C3G-induced activation of wild-type Rap1 was abrogated by coexpression of Rap1A-17N (Fig. 3 A, upper panel), which indicates that Rap1A-17N inhibits the activation of Rap1 by C3G in a dominant negative manner. Anti-T7 blotting of total cell lysates demonstrated that the expression level of wild-type Rap1 is significantly higher than that of Rap1A-17N in repeated experiments (Fig. 3 A, middle panel, and data not shown). In addition, when coexpressed with and activated by C3G, the expression level of Rap1 was found to be significantly increased in rep"
https://openalex.org/W2050050296,"Abstract Most adenoviruses bind to the N-terminal immunoglobulin domain D1 of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor via the head part of their fiber proteins. Three receptor molecules can bind per fiber head. We expressed the D1 domain and the adenovirus type 2 fiber head in bacteria and studied binding interactions by surface plasmon resonance measurements. When receptor domains bind adenovirus fiber independently of each other, the dissociation constant is 20–25 nm. However, when adenovirus fiber binds to receptors immobilized on the sensor chip, a situation better mimicking adenovirus binding to receptors on the cell surface, the dissociation constant was around 1 nm. Kinetic analysis shows that this happens via an avidity mechanism; three identical interactions with high on and off rate constants lead to tight binding of one fiber head to three receptor molecules with a very low overall off rate. The avidity mechanism could be used by other viruses that have multimeric adhesion proteins to attach to target cells. It could also be more general to trimeric receptor-ligand interactions, including those involved in intracellular signaling."

HP1 has dosage-dependent effects on the silencing of euchromatic genes that are mislocalized to heterochromatin and is required for the normal expression of at least two heterochromatic genes. HP1 is multiply phosphorylated in vivo, and HP1 hyperphosphorylation is correlated with heterochromatin assembly during development. The purpose of this study was to test whether HP1 phosphorylation modifies biological activity and biochemical properties of HP1. To determine sites of HP1 phosphorylation in vivo and whether phosphorylation affects any biochemical properties of HP1, we expressed DrosophilaHP1 in lepidopteran cultured cells using a recombinant baculovirus vector. Phosphopeptides were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectroscopy; these peptides contain target sites for casein kinase II, protein tyrosine kinase, and PIM-1 kinase. Purified HP1 from bacterial (unphosphorylated) and lepidopteran (phosphorylated) cells has similar secondary structure. Phosphorylation has no effect on HP1 self-association but alters the DNA binding properties of HP1, suggesting that phosphorylation could differentially regulate HP1-dependent interactions. Serine-to-alanine and serine-to-glutamate substitutions at consensus protein kinase motifs resulted in reduction or loss of silencing activity of mutant HP1 in transgenic flies. These results suggest that dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates HP1 activity in heterochromatic silencing. HP1 is an essential heterochromatin-associated protein in Drosophila.

Hyperphosphorylation of HP1 correlates with heterochromatin assembly during development. In Tetrahymena, the HP1 family protein Hhp1p becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to starvation; this is associated with reduction in macronuclear volume and increased chromatin condensation (28Huang H. Smothers J.F. Wiley E.A. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3624-3634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human HP1 family proteins are phosphorylated in vivo (29Minc E. Allory Y. Courvalin J.-C.

This study also found a correlation between the extent of HP1 phosphorylation and salt extractability from embryo nuclei. These findings suggest that HP1 phosphorylation regulates distinct macromolecular interactions in vivo. Consensus kinase target sites are found near the N- and C-terminal ends of Drosophila HP1 and in the hinge domain between the chromo domain motifs. We recently reported that casein kinase II (CKII) from embryo nuclear extract phosphorylates HP1 at three target sitesin vitro and that alanine substitutions for CKII target serines interfere with efficient heterochromatin targeting in a transient expression assay (32Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our study did not test the transcriptional regulatory activity of mutant HP1 proteins. In this report, we compare the biochemical properties of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated HP1. We map sites of phosphorylation in HP1 by expressing Drosophila HP1 in lepidopteran cells using a recombinant baculovirus. MALDI-TOF mass analysis of proteolytic cleavage products identified products consistent with phosphorylation at consensus casein kinase II sites and a protein tyrosine kinase consensus, as well as a phosphopeptide containing a putative PIM-1 kinase target site. We find that phosphorylation leads to no significant change in HP1 secondary structure or self-association but inhibits HP1 binding to DNA in vitro. Amino acid substitutions in consensus phosphorylation sites reduced or eliminated silencing activity in transgenic flies, implicating phosphorylation in the regulation of HP1 in vivo. HP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (32Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The BacPAKTM Baculovirus Expression system (CLONTECH) was used to express HP1 in Sf21 cells. An XbaI-KpnI fragment with HP1 cDNA was inserted into the pBacPAK8 vector, and infections were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown at room temperature. After 5 days of infection, the cells were harvested, and HP1 expression was verified by Western blot analysis. For both the bacterially expressed and baculovirus expressed proteins, the glycine residue that is normally Gly2 in HP1 is preceded by the amino acid sequence MARVDL in both recombinant proteins. To purify HP1 from the infected cells, 10 75-cm2 flasks of cells or 500 ml of suspension cell culture was infected with passage two virus. After 5 days, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was lysed in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mNa3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100 by sonication on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor (Sorvall) for 30 min, and the supernatant liquid was applied to a 1-ml DEAE column. Proteins were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in lysis buffer from the column and diluted to 0.1 m NaCl in the same buffer. The sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column on a Smart System high pressure liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with a 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient, with HP1 eluting in a single peak at about 0.4 mNaCl. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was done as described (27Eissenberg J.C. Ge Y.-W. Hartnett T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21315-21321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase treatment of baculovirus-expressed HP1 was performed as described (27Eissenberg J.C. Ge Y.-W. Hartnett T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21315-21321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of potato acid phosphatase (0.8 units/mg; Sigma) was added to a 20-μl solution of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 2 μg baculovirus-expressed HP1, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 4 μl of 10× shrimp alkaline phosphatase buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl) and 1 μl of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 units/μl) was added to the reaction, and the volume was brought to 40 μl with distilled water. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the sample was stored at −70 °C until use. CD spectra were recorded using AVIV 60DS CD spectrophotometer. Five spectra were collected every 0.5 nm at room temperature for each sample. The spectra were then averaged and corrected for the buffer. Purified HP1 (10 μm) was mixed with 1 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl and 0.05% bovine serum albumin and was incubated on ice for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) using a Mini-TransBlot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers' instructions. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 30 min. The rabbit anti-HP1 serum was a gift of Dr. S. C. R. Elgin (Washington University) and was used at a 1:10,000 dilution in TBST buffer. The secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega) and was used at a 1:7500 dilution in TBST buffer. Detection was with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega) as described (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 505Google Scholar). DNA binding assay was performed as described (17Zhao T. Heyduk T. Allis C.D. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28332-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), using a 146-bp sea urchin 5 S rDNA end-labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5. Two methods were used to prepare peptides for MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. One method involved solution digestion by one of three enzymes. (i) For trypsin of Glu-C, 5 μg of HP1 was mixed with 0.25 μg of trypsin (Sigma) or Glu-C (Sigma) in a 20-μl buffer of 25 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight. (ii) For Lys-C, 5 μg of HP1 was mixed with 0.25 of Lys-C (Sigma) in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After digestion, the peptides were purified and desalted by C18 reverse phase chromatography (ZipTip; Millipore), dried in a vacuum, and subject to mass spectroscopy. The second method for peptide preparation was to subject intact HP1 to SDS-PAGE, transfer the protein to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane electrophoretically, localize transferred protein by transient staining with 0.5% Ponceau S for 30 s, wash briefly with water, and excise the region of membrane-containing protein. The membrane fragment was further sliced into small pieces, washed in water until free of stain, and incubated in 200 μl of 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 (Sigma) in methanol for 30 min. The blocked membrane was then incubated in 200 μl of water at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed three more times in water, and submerged in ∼20 μl of protease in appropriate buffer for overnight digestion at 37 °C overnight to achieve extensive digestion, or for 1–2 h at room temperature to yield a higher fraction of partial digestion products. Following digestion, the sample was vortexed briefly, and the supernatant liquid was recovered. The membrane fragments were washed once in 20 μl of water or 10% acetonitrile, and this supernatant was combined with the first for mass spectroscopy. All MALDI spectra were obtained using a Voyager Biospectrometry Work station (Perspective Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) in positive ion linear mode. Three matrices were used as follows: sinapinic acid was used for intact HP1 analysis, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid and 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were used for peptides. 10 mg/ml sinapinic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid was dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. 25 mg/ml 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was dissolved in 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid, 33% acetonitrile. Typically, 0.1–5 pmol of protein or peptide was dried and resuspended in 2.5–10 μl of matrix and then 1–2 μl was immediately spotted on the sample plate. Spectra were obtained from different regions of the dried sample, and representative spectra were selected for further analysis. Time-to-mass conversion was achieved by internal calibration using angiotensin II (Sigma; m/z = 1046.54), Peptide Sequencing Standard (Sigma, catalog number P2046; m/z = 1657.84), and specific HP1 peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed directly on a pYC1.8-containing HP1 cDNA under the Hsp70 heat shock promoter (34Platero J.S. Hartnett T. Eissenberg J.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To measure the ability of the different kinase target mutations to affect heterochromatic position-effect silencing, the following crosses were performed: In (1)wm4/In(1)wm4;Su(var)2-101/InCyRoi ×v/Y; transgene/Sco;ry506 (when the transgene is on the second chromosome) or In 1)wm4/In(1)wm4;Su(var)2-101/InCyRoi ×v/Y; transgenery506/Sb ry506 (when the transgene is on the third chromosome), where “transgene” refers to either wild-type or mutant HP1 cDNA transgene constructs. Progeny from each cross were heat-shocked twice daily at 37 °C for 45 min throughout development. Heat shocks were spaced at least 8 h apart. Sons were collected, aged for 3 or more days, and red eye pigment was extracted and measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of Ephrussi and Herold (35Ephrussi B. Herold J.L. Genetics. 1944; 29: 148-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pigment values are expressed as percentage of wild-type (Canton S) red eye pigment, and each measurement was made using a minimum of 30 fly heads. Most of HP1 phosphorylation occurs at serines and threonines (27Eissenberg J.C. Ge Y.-W. Hartnett T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21315-21321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of HP1 reveals consensus target sites for several different protein kinases (Fig.1). We previously showed that the N- and C-terminal CKII consensus sites are phosphorylated in vitroby an embryo nuclear extract CKII activity, suggesting that these sites are used in vivo. However, the CKII sites cannot explain the 7–8 distinct HP1 isoforms previously observed in whole tissue extracts (27Eissenberg J.C. Ge Y.-W. Hartnett T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21315-21321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify sites of HP1 phosphorylation, we expressed HP1 in Sf21 lepidopteran (Spodoptera frugiperda; the fall armyworm) cells using recombinant baculovirus. We reasoned that since HP1 is highly conserved, and since lepidoptera are insects, these cells would likely phosphorylate HP1 at the same sites as for HP1 expressed in Drosophila. Fig. 2 shows two-dimensional gel analysis of total cellular protein from Sf21 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing HP1. At least seven HP1 isoforms are visible, the most basic of which represents unphosphorylated HP1. We refer to the baculovirus-expressed recombinant HP1 as “SfHP1” and to the bacterially expressed recombinant HP1 as “rHP1.” Previous work (32Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that rHP1 is unphosphorylated, so rHP1 was used as a reference polypeptide with which SfHP1 was compared.Figure 2Two-dimensional gel analysis of recombinant baculovirus-expressed HP1. Whole cell proteins were extracted, fractionated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Asterisks are placed over each HP1 isoform.Top, total cell lysate. Bottom, unphosphorylated bacterially expressed HP1 (∼1 μg) was added to the lysate as a mobility standard (arrow), demonstrating that baculovirus-expressed HP1 isoforms are more negatively charged. Identities of the HP1 spots were independently confirmed by Western blot using anti-HP1 serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After purifying Sf HP1 from infected cells (see “Experimental Procedures”), we used matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy to examine the posttranslational modifications in SfHP1. A single major mass is present in the rHP1 preparation (Fig.3A) corresponding to the expected mass of HP1 minus the N-terminal methionine, confirming that rHP1 is not posttranslationally modified beyond N-terminal processing. In contrast, the SfHP1 is distributed over multiple masses (Fig.3B), many separated by the mass of one phosphate (80) and all major masses larger than the mass of HP1. After phosphatase treatment, the SfHP1 mass profile collapses into a single major peak whose mass is equivalent to that of HP1 minus the N-terminal methionine (Fig. 3C). Thus, SfHP1, like the endogenous HP1 inDrosophila, is multiply phosphorylated. This analysis also shows that there are no significant posttranslational modifications in SfHP1 besides phosphorylation and N-terminal processing. To determine whether consensus kinase sites in HP1 are phosphorylatedin vivo, we looked for evidence that these motifs are phosphorylated in SfHP1. We digested purified SfHP1 with different endopeptidases and subjected the peptides to MALDI-TOF mass analysis to identify phosphopeptides (36Liao P.-C. Leykam J. Andrews P.D. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were identified that contained each of the consensus CKII sites (Fig. 4, A andB). We previously showed that these sites are phosphorylated in bHP1 by an embryo nuclear extract in vitro; these results strongly suggest that the CKII consensus sites are significantly phosphorylated in vivo. Interestingly, a LysC peptide containing the N-terminal CKII site was found to be doubly phosphorylated (Fig. 4A). This peptide also contains a consensus protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) motif. Platero et al. (34Platero J.S. Hartnett T. Eissenberg J.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) showed that the conservative substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine in this PTK motif resulted in loss of silencing activity of the mutant protein. The detection of a doubly-phosphorylated peptide containing both a CKII and PTK motif suggests that the consensus PTK site is used in vivo. Unexpectedly, we found a LysC peptide whose mass corresponds to that of a singly phosphorylated internal peptide of HP1 without a consensus kinase motif. While this study was in progress, Koike et al.(30Koike N. Maita H. Taira T. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported that the human HP1 family protein HP1Hsγ is a target for the pim-1 kinase proto-oncogene. Multiple sites of Pim-1 phosphorylation occur in HP1Hsγ, at and downstream from the sequence motif KRKS in the hinge region. Fig. 4C shows that a peptide containing the single KRKS motif, which also occurs in the hinge domain ofDrosophila HP1, is singly phosphorylated. We found no consistent evidence for phosphorylation at either of the two PKA/CaCKII consensus sequences or at the PKC consensus sequence motif. To test whether phosphorylation causes significant changes in HP1 structure in solution, circular dichroism spectra were obtained using purified rHP1 (unphosphorylated) and SfHP1 (phosphorylated). No significant differences were observed (Fig.5A), indicating that phosphorylation does not significantly affect HP1 secondary structure. The HP1 C-terminal chromo domain can dimerize in vitro (16Smothers J.F. Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which could account for self-association of rHP1 in solution (17Zhao T. Heyduk T. Allis C.D. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28332-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation can affect HP1 self-association, we exposed solutions of purified rHP1 and SfHP1 to the bifunctional cross-linking agent dissuccinimidyl suberate and then separated proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunolocalized HP1 by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5B (compare lanes 2 and 4), both SfHP1 and rHP1 preparations are cross-linkable as dimers to similar extents, indicating that phosphorylation has no significant effect on the efficiency of HP1 self-association. We showed previously that rHP1 binds to DNA in vitro (17Zhao T. Heyduk T. Allis C.D. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28332-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation affects DNA binding activity of HP1, we compared rHP1 and SfHP1 binding to a 146-bp DNA fragment in vitro. As shown in Fig.6A, only rHP1 detectably binds DNA. To test whether the SfHP1 protein preparation contains an inhibitor of DNA binding, equal amounts of each protein were mixed and challenged to bind DNA; the mixture retards DNA mobility somewhat more than rHP1 alone, suggesting that SfHP1 contributes to a band shift, but only in the presence of unphosphorylated HP1. A likely interpretation of this is that SfHP1 can form heterotypic complexes with rHP1 but does not contribute directly to DNA binding. Surprisingly, phosphatase treatment of SfHP1 fails to restore DNA binding activity (data not shown). Judging from the MALDI mass analysis, phosphatase treatment of SfHP1 yields a spectrum nearly identical to that of unphosphorylated rHP1, with no evidence of residual modifications. This suggests that phosphorylation causes tertiary conformational changes in HP1 structure that inhibit DNA binding and that this structural modification remains after phosphatase treatment. Consistent with this possibility, we find that dephosphorylated SfHP1 becomes insoluble. To test the contribution of CKII phosphorylation to HP1 DNA binding activity, mutant HP1 protein in which both target serines were substituted with either alanine or glutamate (to mimic phosphorylation) were expressed in E. coli and purified. As shown in Fig.6B, the double alanine mutation band-shifts labeled DNA with similar efficiency to wild-type HP1, but the double glutamate mutation band-shifts DNA very poorly and with a distinct mobility from the wild-type protein. This suggests that CKII phosphorylation of HP1 contributes significantly to the loss of DNA binding in phosphorylated HP1 protein. To test whether HP1 phosphorylation is required for heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing in vivo, we replaced serines with either alanines (to block phosphorylation) or glutamate (to mimic constitutive phosphorylation) at sites containing serine/threonine kinase consensus motifs. Ser15 and Ser202 fall within consensus motifs for CKII. Furthermore, these sites were shown previously to be phosphorylated in vitro by Drosophila embryo nuclear extract (32Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test the role of CKII con"

Here we report that the localized release of these nucleotides can sensitize osteoblasts to the activity of systemic factors. We have investigated the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a principal regulator of bone resorption and formation, to potentiate signals arising from nucleotide stimulation of UMR-106 clonal rat osteoblasts.

Bone. 1997; 21: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The bone matrix synthesizing osteoblasts are thought to express multiple P2Y receptor subtypes (5Reimer W.J. Dixon S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1040-C1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with expression profile changing as osteoblasts differentiate (6Dixon J.C. Bowler W.B. Walsh C.A. Gallagher J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that determine focal responsiveness to systemic factors in bone to allow a local tissue turnover, characteristic of the remodeling process, remain unclear. However, our previous observations that coapplication of nucleotides and parathyroid hormone (PTH) can result in synergistic responses in osteoblasts (7Bowler W.B. Dixon C.J. Halleux C. Maier R. Bilbe G. Fraser W.D. Gallagher J.A. Hipskind R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14315-14324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that locally released extracellular nucleotides could sensitize surrounding cells to the action of circulating hormones. Parathyroid hormone is one of the most important systemic regulators of bone and mineral homeostasis. The action of PTH on skeletal cells is complex and can result in the stimulation of both resorption and new bone formation (8Raisz L.G. Nature. 1965; 197: 1015-1017Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Endocrine Rev. 1993; 14: 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This ability to stimulate coupled, but opposing processes, has been attributed to the nature of the receptor that transduces signals arising from PTH stimulation. The PTH1 receptor belongs to a subgroup of seven transmembrane receptors that include those responsive to calcitonin, secretin, and VIP (10Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X-F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). These receptors are distinct in their ability to couple to both Gs and Gq and hence activate dual signal transduction pathways leading to both cyclic AMP formation and release of Ca2+from intracellular stores ([Ca2+]i). The coupling of the PTH receptor to Gs in osteoblasts is well characterized. Activation of the cAMP signaling pathway is responsible for a number of PTH-induced downstream responses, including expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene (11Tyson D.R. Swarthout J.T. Partridge N.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the use of truncated PTH fragments in vivo has confirmed that complete N-terminal sequence (vital for Gs activation) is essential to drive the anabolic skeletal effects of PTH (12ArmamentoVillareal R. Ziambaras K. AbbasiJarhomi S.H. Dimarogonas A. Halstead L. Fausto A. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. J. Bone Min. Res. 1997; 12: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and cAMP accumulation is often used as a measure of PTH receptor activation (13Du P.F. Seitz P.K. Cooper C.W. Endocrine. 2000; 12: 25-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of PTH receptor/Gq-coupling and subsequent downstream responses in osteoblasts following activation remains controversial. Both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent and independent mechanisms for PTH-induced [Ca2+]i release have been reported (14Dunlay R. Hruska K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F223-F231PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tong Y. Zull J. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8183-8191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To further complicate the issue of PTH-induced [Ca2+]i release, recent studies in cell types other than osteoblasts have demonstrated that while PTH alone is unable to induce [Ca2+]i release, it can strongly potentiate the [Ca2+]i elevations induced by agonists acting at other Gq-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor. The mechanism behind this potentiation remains unclear but has been attributed to G protein subunit interaction or shuttling of calcium between intracellular stores (16Short A.D. Taylor C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1807-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a study by Kaplan et al. (17Kaplan A.D. Reimer W.J. Feldman R.D. Dixon S.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using rat UMR-106 cells, PTH alone was shown to produce small [Ca2+]i elevations and also potentiated nucleotide-induced [Ca2+]i elevations. However, in contrast to these findings, we previously demonstrated that PTH alone did not elevate [Ca2+]i and was ineffective at potentiating nucleotide-induced responses in the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 (7Bowler W.B.

In the same study, however, PTH and nucleotide costimulation of SaOS-2 cells did result in synergistic induction of gene expression. Considering the observations described above, the current study has addressed: (i) the controversy concerning the ability of PTH to effect [Ca2+]i release in the rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106, (ii) the mechanisms by which PTH can potentiate [Ca2+]i release induced by locally released nucleotides, and (iii) whether this potentiated [Ca2+]i response can ultimately drive downstream cellular responses in osteoblasts.

Cells were grown in 225-cm2 vented cap flasks, harvested upon confluence, and resuspended in basal salt solution (BSS) composition (mm): NaCl (125), KCl (5Reimer W.J. Dixon S.J. Am. J.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C1040-C1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3. Cells were loaded with 17 μmfluo-3-AM for 1 h at 37 °C with agitation and in the presence of apyrase (2 units/ml), after which cells were washed 3 times in BSS and aliquoted into 96-well black wall, clear base plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. These were then centrifuged to obtain a confluent layer of cells on the base of the plate and cells were subsequently washed 4 times in BSS. Ca2+ flux was measured in all 96 wells simultaneously and in real time using a Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR). When effects of PTH and nucleotides together were studied the cells were incubated for 60 s with PTH prior to exposure to nucleotide. The effects of IBMX and forskolin were assessed by their introduction to the cells 6 min prior to nucleotide addition, H-89 was introduced 10 min before the addition of nucleotides and dibutyryl-cGMP 30 min before nucleotide addition. In all cases [Ca2+]i release was measured for 1 min after nucleotide addition, a measurement of fluorescence being taken every second. Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described (19Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the appropriate time point, plates were placed on ice and the cell layer quickly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.3) containing 10 mmNaF and 100 μm Na3VO4. Cells were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mmNaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm ZnCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 nm okadaic acid. The cell layer was collected by scraping and lysis completed by vortexing for 60 s. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and the protein concentration determined with Bradford's reagent using bovine serum albumin as standard. An aliquot for Western analysis was denatured immediately in 2% SDS, 2% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and the remaining supernatant stored at −70 °C. 15 μg of whole cell extracts were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis minigel and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filter was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) low fat milk powder-TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the specific antiserum indicated below in blocking buffer. After washing in TBST, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody, diluted 1/1500 in 5% (w/v) low fat milk powder-TBST. After washing, the immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. The antisera used were: anti-CREB and anti-phospho Ser133CREB, diluted 1:1000. Total RNA was extracted from control and stimulated cells according to the protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, followed by acid phenol/chloroform extraction. RNA was stored as a precipitate at −70 °C. 10 μg of total RNA was denatured and electrophoresed through a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 3.7% formaldehyde (v:v), followed by transfer to Zetabind hybridization membrane. Blots were prehybridized at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 1% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 5 mg/ml total calf liver RNA, 200 μg of tRNA, and probed with a c-fosriboprobe spanning exons 3 and 4 of the human c-fos gene mixed with a riboprobe derived from the rat gapdh cDNA as previously described (19Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2 × SSC, 1% SDS solution and mRNAs visualized using phosphorstorage technology and autoradiography with Kodak X-AR film and intensifying screens at −70 °C. RNA loading and integrity were measured by UV shadowing of the filter prior to hybridization. Reporter cells were seeded into white 96-well plates (Dynex) at a density of 96,000 cells/well in 50% DMEM, 50% Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated for 24 h, after which time medium was replaced by 50% DMEM, 50% Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for a further 24 h. Cells were induced for 4 h with ×10 concentration of agonist stock solution prepared in serum-free medium to the final concentrations indicated in Fig. 9. After induction, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in luciferase cell culture lysis reagent for 15 min at room temperature (10 μl/well). A microtiter plate luminometer (ML 3000, Dynex Technologies) was set up in the enhanced flash mode (maximum sensitivity, delay time = 2 s, integration time = 10 s). Luciferase reagent (100 μl) was automatically added and light emission was measured every 10 ms during a period of 10 s. Data was recorded as the peak value of relative light units. Treatments were performed in triplicate and the mean fold increase in luciferase activity was calculated relative to mock-induced cells, which was taken as 1-fold. Since osteoblasts have been described to express numerous subtypes of the P2Y family, and previous studies to receptor profile UMR-106 cells have been incomplete, we used the FLIPR system to fully investigate P2Y receptor expression by these cells. The effects of a series of known P2 agonists on [Ca2+]i elevation were measured in fluo-3-loaded cells. The agonist potency order (p[A]50) was as follows: 2-MeSADP (5.27 ± 0.09) > 2-MeSATP (4.89 ± 0.15) > ADP (4.60 ± 0.15) > ATP (4.57 ± 0.11), suggesting that P2Y1is the predominant P2 receptor expressed by UMR-106 cells (Fig.1). While AMP, αβMeATP, and UDP were inactive at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μm (data not shown), UTP evoked a small [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 1). This profile differs from that suggested by Kaplan et al. (17Kaplan A.D. Reimer W.J. Feldman R.D. Dixon S.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in an earlier study, where predominant functional effects were elicited by P2Y2/Y4 receptor agonists. We have previously reported heterogeneity of P2 receptor expression in populations of primary and clonal osteoblasts (7Bowler W.B. Dixon C.J. Halleux C. Maier R. Bilbe G. Fraser W.D. Gallagher J.A. Hipskind R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14315-14324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a process that appears to be differentiation-dependent (6Dixon J.C. Bowler W.B. Walsh C.A. Gallagher J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Diverse experimental culture methods or passage number may therefore account for the apparent differences in receptor profile between cells in this study and those used in the study of Kaplan et al. (17Kaplan A.D. Reimer W.J. Feldman R.D. Dixon S.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study using UMR-106 cells PTH potentiated [Ca2+]i elevations induced by certain nucleotide agonists (17Kaplan A.D. Reimer W.J. Feldman R.D. Dixon S.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one of our earlier studies, however, using the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2, we observed no potentiation of nucleotide-induced [Ca2+]i release following costimulation with PTH (7Bowler W.B. Dixon C.J. Halleux C. Maier R. Bilbe G. Fraser W.D. Gallagher J.A. Hipskind R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14315-14324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To clarify these differences, the effects of human PTH-(1–34) (100 ng/ml), in combination with known nucleotide agonists, on [Ca2+]i were investigated in UMR-106 cells using the FLIPR. In contrast to the earlier study of Kaplan et al. (17Kaplan A.D. Reimer W.J. Feldman R.D. Dixon S.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we repeatedly saw no elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to PTH (0.1–500 ng/ml, data not shown). We did, however, observe a striking potentiation to the [Ca2+]i response with all nucleotides tested (Fig.2 shows just ADP for clarity). A potentiated calcium response was observed when cells were stimulated with UTP and PTH, therefore confirming that P2Y2 receptors are expressed by these cells, albeit at low levels. To begin to investigate the mechanism behind this observed potentiation we wondered whether calcium influx contributed to this response. Again using the FLIPR we found that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, ADP and PTH costimulation induced a [Ca2+]i response approximately six times greater than that induced by ADP alone (Fig.3 A). However, this response was depressed in comparison to that resulting from the same experiment performed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, introduction of the receptor-activated calcium channel blocker SKF96365 resulted in an increase in the observed potentiation between ADP and PTH (Fig. 3 B). Thus calcium influx is not the major component in the potentiation we observe. To further elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed potentiated [Ca2+]i release we used truncated forms of the PTH peptide, which have previously been reported to have selective stimulatory effects upon the G-proteins that couple second messenger signaling pathways to the PTH receptor. It has been reported that stimulation of the PTH receptor by PTH-(1–34) results in activation of both Gq and Gs and therefore utilizes both PKC and adenylyl cyclase to initiate signaling cascades (10Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X-F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). We report here that PTH-(1–31) (100 ng/ml), which stimulates adenylyl cyclase but not PKC (21Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Gagnon L. Maclean S. Isaacs R. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. J. Bone Min. Res. 1994; 9: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), is able to potentiate ADP-induced Ca2+responses as effectively as the full-length peptide (PTH-(1–34)) (Fig.4 A). In contrast, PTH-(3–34) (100 ng/ml) which does not activate adenylyl cyclase (22Goltzman D. Peytremann A. Callahan E. Tregear G.W. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3199-3203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was unable to potentiate the [Ca2+]i release induced by ADP (Fig. 4 A). To confirm that this peptide was functionally interacting with the PTH receptor it was introduced in combination with ADP and the active peptides, PTH-(1–34) or -(1–31). PTH-(3–34) was shown to act as a functional antagonist at the PTH receptor as it depressed the [Ca2+]i release induced by ADP in combination with either PTH-(1–34) or PTH-(1–31) (Fig.4 B). As a main downstream target for activated adenylyl cyclase pathways, we next investigated the potential role of PKA in driving potentiated [Ca2+]i release in UMR-106 cells. Preincubation of UMR-106 cells with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (1–100 μm) did not affect potentiated [Ca2+]i release induced by ADP and PTH, indicating that PKA activity is not necessary to initiate the potentiation (Table I). H-89 was inhibitory in these cells, since it blocked PTH-induced phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133, the residue phosphorylated by active PKA (Fig.5).Table IH-89 does not depress ADP/PTH-induced potentiated Ca2+ elevationsAgonist(s)Response of ADP (10−4m) + PTH (100 ng/ml)ADP22%ADP + PTH100%ADP + PTH + H89104%H-89 (1–100 μm) was introduced to fluo-3-loaded UMR-106 cells 10 min before ADP (100 μm) and PTH (100 ng/ml) addition. Ca2+ release was measured according to fluorescence every 30 s for 10 min after H-89 addition, then every second for a further 1 min after ADP/PTH addition. Fluorescence is expressed as a percentage of the response to 100 μm ADP + 100 ng/ml PTH. H-89 had no effect on the potentiation at any concentration tested, figures show effects of 10 μm H-89 (n = 3). Open table in a new tab H-89 (1–100 μm) was introduced to fluo-3-loaded UMR-106 cells 10 min before ADP (100 μm) and PTH (100 ng/ml) addition. Ca2+ release was measured according to fluorescence every 30 s for 10 min after H-89 addition, then every second for a further 1 min after ADP/PTH addition. Fluorescence is expressed as a percentage of the response to 100 μm ADP + 100 ng/ml PTH. H-89 had no effect on the potentiation at any concentration tested, figures show effects of 10 μm H-89 (n = 3). The results above showed that potentiation occurs with a PTH peptide that activates a signaling pathway involving adenylyl cyclase but not PKA. To assess whether elevated cAMP could drive potentiated [Ca2+]i release, cells were costimulated with ADP and the cell permeable adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (50 μm), in the absence of extracellular calcium. Forskolin was unable to potentiate ADP-induced calcium responses (TableII). Forskolin alone was shown to elevate intracellular cAMP levels in these cells and to induce CREB phoshorylation via PKA phosphorylation (data not shown). We also tested the ability of the nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX (1 mm) to potentiate ADP-induced [Ca2+]i release. In contrast to forskolin, IBMX effectively potentiated ADP-induced [Ca2+]i release (Table II).Table IIIBMX, but not forskolin can potentiate nucleotide-induced [Ca2+]i releaseAgonist(s)Response of ADP (10−4m) + PTH (100 ng/ml)ADP65%ADP + PTH100%ADP + forskolin64%ADP + IBMX96%Forskolin (50 μm), IBMX (1 mm), and PTH (100 ng/ml) were introduced to fluo-3-loaded UMR-106 cells 6 min before ADP addition (ADP concentration range, 0.3 μm to 1 mm). Ca2+ release was measured according to fluorescence every second for 1 min after ADP addition. Fluorescence is expressed as a percentage of the response to 100 μmADP + 100 ng/ml PTH (n = 3). Open table in a new tab Forskolin (50 μm), IBMX (1 mm), and PTH (100 ng/ml) were introduced to fluo-3-loaded UMR-106 cells 6 min before ADP addition (ADP concentration range, 0.3 μm to 1 mm). Ca2+ release was measured according to fluorescence every second for 1 min after ADP addition. Fluorescence is expressed as a percentage of the response to 100 μmADP + 100 ng/ml PTH (n = 3). Since the results obtained with forskolin and IBMX suggested that accumulation of cGMP, downstream of the activated PTH receptor, may be causing the potentiation of ADP-induced [Ca2+]i levels, we costimulated cells with ADP and the cell permeable cGMP analogue, dibutyryl-cGMP (300 μm), in the absence of extracellular calcium. Dibutyryl-cGMP was unable to potentiate ADP-induced [Ca2+]i elevations (Fig.6), eliminating accumulation of this cyclic monophosphate as a possible mechanism of potentiation. Dibutyryl-cGMP alone produced no [Ca2+]i elevation (data not shown). Phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 is strongly linked to signaling-induced transcriptional activation. Ser133 is a substrate for PKA but also for kinases activated by elevated intracellular calcium. We investigated whether ADP and PTH alone or in combination induced CREB phosphorylation in UMR-106 cells. We performed Western analysis of whole cell extracts using antisera directed against CREB phosphorylated on Ser133. The P2Y1 agonist ADP (100 μm) induced low CREB activation following 15 min stimulation, while PTH-(1–34) (100 ng/ml) gave rise to a robust transcription factor phosphorylation. In combination, however, agonists induced levels of CREB activation greater than those seen with either agonist alone. Quantitative values for CREB and phospho-CREB were obtained by densitometric analysis (Fig.7). To determine the impact of the observed potentiated calcium response on gene expression we measured the effects of P2Y1 agonists and PTH on the levels of endogenous c-fos transcription in UMR-106 cells. This proto-oncogene is of particular relevance when studying osteoblasts as it has been implicated in many of the processes that govern skeletal tissue remodeling (23Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z-Q.

Subsequently, the susceptibility of these mutants to protein N-myristoylation was evaluated by metabolic labeling in an in vitro translation system or in transfected cells. It was found that the amino acid residue at position 3 in an N-myristoylation consensus motif, Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-X, strongly affected the susceptibility of the protein to two different cotranslational protein modifications, N-myristoylation andN-acetylation; 10 amino acids (Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr, Val, Asn, Leu, Ile, Gln, and His) with a radius of gyration smaller than 1.80 Å directed N-myristoylation, two negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) directed N-acetylation, and two amino acids (Gly and Met) directed heterogeneous modification with bothN-myristoylation and N-acetylation. The amino acid requirements at this position for the two modifications were dramatically changed when Ser at position 6 in the consensus motif was replaced with Ala. Thus, the amino acid residue penultimate to the N-terminal Gly residue strongly affected two cotranslational protein modifications, N-myristoylation andN-acetylation, and the amino acid requirements at this position for these two modifications were significantly affected by downstream residues.

ProteinN-myristoylation is the result of the cotranslational addition of myristic acid to a Gly residue at the extreme N terminus after removal of the initiating Met. The requirement for Gly at the N terminus is absolute, and no other amino acid can take its place. A stable amide bond links myristic acid irreversibly to proteins. TheN-myristoyltransferase (NMT),1 which catalyzes the transfer of myristic acid from myristoyl-CoA to the N-terminal Gly has been purified and cloned from several organisms (7Towler D.A. Adams S.P.

In general, Ser or Thr is preferred at position 6, and the N-terminal consensus motifs such as Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser/Thr-X-X(13Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev.

Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) that direct protein N-myristoylation have been defined. However, Ser or Thr at position 6 is neither sufficient nor critical for the recognition of the protein substrate by the NMT. For instance, the peptide Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys-Lys derived from the N terminus of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was found to be a good substrate for the yeast NMT, and the peptide Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg was used as a reference substrate for the yeast NMT in earlier reports on the substrate specificity of this enzyme (7Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Heuckelroth R.O.

Protein N-myristoylation in intact cells is not a single enzymatic reaction catalyzed by NMT. This modification appears to be a highly regulated reaction involving the coordinated participation of the protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) and several different enzymes/proteins such as N-methionylaminopeptidase, fatty acid synthase, long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, acyl-CoA-binding proteins, etc. Therefore, the substrate specificity of NMT analyzed by using purified NMT and synthetic peptide substrates may not fully reflect the substrate specificity of NMT in intact cells. In addition, other cotranslational protein modification such as proteinN-acetylation might also affect the reaction. It has been estimated that as many as 70% of soluble proteins (cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic) in eukaryotes bear this modification (16Brown J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 221: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, several proteins having an N-terminal Gly residue, such as ovalbumin (17Palmiter R.D. Gagnon J. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl.

However, the difference in the N-terminal sequence requirement for protein N-myristoylation and protein N-acetylation has not been characterized so far. Since the in vitro translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains the components involved in cotranslational protein N-myristoylation and N-acetylation (17Palmiter R.D. Gagnon J. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,19Mayer A. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A.

In fact, we previously demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a nonmyristoylated model protein, could be efficiently myristoylated in the in vitrotranslation system when an N-myristoylation motif of Rasheed leukemia virus-Gag protein or Gi1α protein was linked to the mature domain of TNF (21Utsumi T.

In this study, to examine the N-terminal sequence requirements for the cotranslational protein N-myristoylation and to reveal the difference in the N-terminal sequence requirements for proteinN-myristoylation and N-acetylation, several series of site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal region of protein were performed using TNF as a nonmyristoylated model protein. Subsequently, the susceptibility of these mutants to the cotranslational N-myristoylation andN-acetylation reactions was evaluated by an in vitro transcription/translation system using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate.

The cDNAs coding for other TNF mutants (designated R3X-TNF), in which Arg at position 3 in V2G-TNF was replaced with each of the 19 other amino acids, were constructed by a method similar to that of V2G-TNF. The mutagenic primers used in these procedures are listed in Table I. Plasmids pBGag-TNF and pBGi1α-TNF were constructed as described previously (22Utsumi T. Tou E. Takemura D. Ishisaka R. Yabuki M. Iwata H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBOVA, which contains the full-length chicken ovalbumin cDNA was constructed by using PCR. In this case, pET-22b-OVA served as a template, and two oligonucleotides (OVA-N and OVA-C) served as primers (Table I). After digestion with BamHI andEcoRI, the amplified product was subcloned into pB atBamHI and EcoRI sites. The cDNA coding for OVA60-TNF in which the N-terminal 60 residues of ovalbumin were linked to the N terminus of the mature domain of TNF was constructed by using PCR. For this procedure, pBOVA served as a template, and two oligonucleotides (OVA-N and OVA-60) served as primers (Table I). After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, the amplified product was subcloned into pBGag-TNF at BamHI andXhoI sites. The cDNAs coding for R3X,S6A-TNF in which Ser at position 6 in R3X-TNF mutants was replaced with Ala, were constructed by using PCR. In this case, each of the pBR3X-TNF constructs served as a template, and two oligonucleotides (T3 and S6A) served as primers (Table I). After digestion with SacI andAvaI, the amplified product was subcloned into pBΔpro-TNF at SacI and AvaI sites. The cDNAs coding for Gag-Q3K-TNF and Gi1α-C3K-TNF in which the amino acid at position 3 in Gag-TNF or Gi1α-TNF was replaced with Lys were constructed by using PCR. In this case, pBGag-TNF or pBGi1α-TNF served as a template, and two oligonucleotides (Gag-Q3K plus B1 and Gi1-C3K plus B1, respectively) as primers (Table I). After digestion with BamHI and PstI, the amplified products were subcloned into pB at BamHI andPstI sites. The cDNAs coding for Arf6-TNF and hippocalcin-TNF, in which the N-terminal 10 residues of Δpro-TNF were replaced with those of Arf6 or hippocalcin, were constructed by using PCR. For this procedure, pBΔpro-TNF served as a template, and two oligonucleotides (Arf6 plus B1 and HC plus B1, respectively) served as primers (Table I). After digestion with BamHI andPstI, the amplified products were subcloned into pB atBamHI and PstI sites. The DNA sequences of these recombinant cDNAs were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nickelen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Methods essentially identical to those described previously were employed (23Utsumi T. Akimaru K. Kawabata Z. Levitan A. Tokunaga T. Tang P. Ide A. Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6389-6405Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T3 polymerase was used to obtain transcripts of these cDNAs subcloned into pB vector. These were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to use. Subsequently, the translation reaction was carried out using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [3H]leucine, [35S]methionine, [3H]myristic acid, or [3H]acetyl-CoA under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The mixture (composed of 20.0 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate; 1.0 μl of 1 mm leucine- or methionine-free amino acid mixture or 1 mm complete amino acid mixture; 4.0 μl of [3H]leucine (5 μCi), [35S]methionine (1 μCi), [3H]myristic acid (25 μCi), or [3H]acetyl-CoA (2 μCi); and 4.0 μl of mRNA) was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The simian virus 40-transformed African Green monkey kidney cell line, COS-1, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (2 × 105) were plated onto 35-mm diameter dishes 1 day before transfection. pcDNA3 construct (2 μg; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing mutant TNF cDNA was used to transfect each plate of COS-1 cells along with 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (2 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free medium. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, the cells were refed with serum-containing medium and incubated again at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 5 h in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum containing [3H]myristic acid (100 μCi/ml). Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and collected with cell scrapers, followed by lysis with 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, proteinase inhibitors) on ice for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min in a microcentrifuge (Hitachi; model CF15D2), and supernatants were collected. After immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF antibody, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. TNF samples immunoprecipitated fromin vitro translation products or total cell lysates of each group of transfected cells were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Corp.). After blocking with nonfat milk, the membrane was probed with a specific goat anti-human TNF antibody as described previously (25Utsumi T. Levitan A. Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9511-9516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were specifically detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The membrane was developed with ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitative analysis of immunoreactive proteins on the membrane was carried out using the storage phosphor imaging screen and GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Samples containing TNF mutants were immunoprecipitated with a specific goat anti-human TNF polyclonal antibody (R & D systems) as described (23Utsumi T. Akimaru K. Kawabata Z. Levitan A. Tokunaga T. Tang P. Ide A. Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6389-6405Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured by boiling for 3 min in SDS-sample buffer followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. Thereafter, the gel was fixed and soaked in AmplifyTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak) for an appropriate period. Quantitative analysis of the labeled proteins was carried out by scanning the fluorogram using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad; model GS-700). Fatty acid-labeled TNF mutants immunoprecipitated from in vitro translation products were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane. The region of membrane containing the labeled TNF mutant, identified by Western blotting with anti-human TNF antibody, was excised and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 16 h. The released fatty acids were extracted in hexane and run on a thin-layer chromatography plate (RP18; Merck) with acetonitrile/acetic acid (9:1) as the solvent system. Radioactivity on the thin layer plate was made visible by spraying with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To examine the amino-terminal sequence requirements for cotranslational protein N-myristoylation, and to reveal the difference in the N-terminal sequence requirement for proteinN-myristoylation and N-acetylation, the N-terminal 9 residues of the mature domain of TNF including the initiating Met were changed to the N-myristoylation consensus motif, and the susceptibility to cotranslational proteinN-myristoylation and N-acetylation was evaluated by an in vitro translation system. Since Δpro-TNF, a mature domain of TNF in which the initiating Met was introduced at the N terminus, has Met and Ser residues at positions 1 and 6, respectively, Val at position 2 was replaced with Gly to obtain V2G-TNF, in which the N-terminal 9 residues were adapted to theN-myristoylation consensus motif, Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-X(Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and 2), translation of mRNAs coding for Δpro-TNF and V2G-TNF in the presence of [3H]leucine gave rise to two translation products; one is the major product with an expected molecular mass (17 kDa), and the other is a fainter band with an ∼2-kDa larger molecular mass. However, no incorporation of [3H]myristic acid and [3H]acetyl-CoA was detected in these translation products as shown in Fig. 2(lanes 5, 6, 9, and10). From early experiments performed by Towler et al. (2Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using purified yeast NMT and the synthetic peptide substrates, it has been reported that an amino acid residue at position 3 affects the susceptibility to protein N-myristoylation. We therefore prepared two additional constructs, R3A- and R3D-TNF, in which Arg at position 3 in V2G-TNF was replaced with Ala and Asp, respectively. [3H]Leucine labeling revealed an efficient expression of R3A- and R3D-TNF as observed with V2G-TNF (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). In R3A-TNF, significant incorporation of [3H]myristic acid, but not [3H]acetyl-CoA, was observed (lanes 7 and 11). Conversely, significant incorporation of [3H]acetyl-CoA, but not [3H]myristic acid, was observed with R3D-TNF (lanes 8 and12). To determine whether the incorporation of [3H]myristic acid into R3A-TNF was comparable with that into proteins having a natural N-myristoylation motif, incorporation of [3H]leucine and [3H]myristic acid into R3A-TNF was compared with those into Gag-TNF and Gi1α-TNF (22Utsumi T. Tou E. Takemura D. Ishisaka R. Yabuki M. Iwata H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in which the N-terminal 10 residues of the Gag protein or Gi1α were linked to the N terminus of the mature domain of TNF. As shown in Fig. 3 A(lanes 1–3 and 7–9), incorporations of [3H]leucine and [3H]myristic acid into these three TNF mutants were found to be comparable, indicating that R3A-TNF is efficiently myristoylated, similar to proteins having a natural N-myristoylation motif. Next, we compared the incorporation of [3H]acetyl-CoA into R3D-TNF with that into ovalbumin, a naturally acetylated protein (17Palmiter R.D. Gagnon J. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this case, since specific antibody against ovalbumin was not available for the immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated products, OVA60-TNF, in which the N-terminal 60 residues of ovalbumin were linked to the N terminus of TNF, was used. As expected, only a low level of [3H]leucine- and [3H]acetyl-CoA incorporation was observed with ovalbumin, as shown in Fig.3 A (lanes 6 and 18). In contrast, efficient [3H]leucine- and [3H]acetyl-CoA incorporation was detected with OVA60-TNF (lanes 5 and 17). As shown in Fig.3 A (lanes 4, 5,16, and 17), incorporation of [3H]leucine and [3H]acetyl-CoA into R3D-TNF was comparable with those of OVA60-TNF, indicating that R3D-TNF is as efficiently acetylated as the naturally acetylated protein. Analysis of the 3H-labeled fatty acid attached to the R3A-TNF by TLC confirmed the presence of [3H]myristic acid (Fig.3 B, lane 3). In contrast,3H-labeled fatty acid attached to the R3D-TNF was not detected on the TLC plate (lane 4). However, acetic acid liberated from the acetylated protein is volatile and will be evaporated by the extraction and concentration procedure. Therefore, this result is consistent with the fatty acid attached to the R3D-TNF being acetic acid. Taken together, it is suggested that the amino acid residue at position 3 in the Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-Xmotif strongly affects the susceptibility of the protein to two different cotranslational protein modifications,N-myristoylation and N-acetylation. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 3, 4,7, and 12), protein N-myristoylation and N-acetylation were specifically observed in the lower [3H]leucine-labeled band, with no modification of the upper band observed. To clarify the basis for this, differential labeling of these two protein bands with [3H]leucine, [35S]methionine, [3H]myristic acid, and [3H]acetyl-CoA was performed using Δpro-, R3A-, and R3D-TNF mRNA. In these three TNF variants, the initiating Met is the only Met residue in the entire molecule; in contrast, these TNFs contain several residues of Leu in their amino acid sequences. As shown in Fig. 4, [35S]methionine was specifically incorporated into the upper band, whereas [3H]leucine was incorporated into both bands. Incorporation of [3H]myristic acid into R3A-TNF and [3H]acetyl-CoA into R3D-TNF was observed exclusively in the lower band. Since protein N-myristoylation and proteinN-acetylation occurs on Gly-2 after removal of the initiating Met and there is no Met residue in the mature domain of TNF, these results clearly indicated that the upper band corresponds to the protein species retaining the initiating Met residue and the lower band to the one lacking this residue. To investigate the amino acid requirement at position 3 in the Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-Xmotif for protein N-myristoylation andN-acetylation, 20 mutants, each with a different amino acid at position 3, were generated, and their susceptibility to the two cotranslational modifications was evaluated by the same method as above. The results of 20 amino acids are arranged according to their radius of gyration. All of these mutants were efficiently expressed as determined by the incorporation of [3H]leucine as shown in the upper panels of Fig.5 A. The ratio of the amount of the two [3H]leucine-labeled protein bands was almost the same in these 20 mutants, indicating that there is no significant difference in the efficiency of the removal of the initiating Met residue in these mutants. The labeling with [3H]myristic acid revealed a strong correlation between the radius of gyration of the amino acid at position 3 and the efficiency of protein N-myristoylation as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 5 A. The relationship between the relative N-myristoylation efficiency and the radius of gyration of amino acid at position 3 is summarized in Fig. 5 B. The presence of Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr, Val, Asn, Leu, Ile, Gln, and His residues, each having a radius of gyration smaller than 1.80 Å, at position 3 led to efficient [3H]myristic acid labeling. In contrast, the presence of amino acids with a radius of gyration larger than 1.80 Å (Phe, Lys, Tyr, Trp, and Arg) at this position completely inhibited the [3H]myristic acid incorporation. The presence of the Met residue, which has an intermediate radius of gyration (1.80 Å) led to a diminished efficiency of N-myristoylation. In addition to the restriction by the radius of gyration of the amino acid, it was also revealed that the presence of negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and Pro residue at this position completely inhibited the myristoylation reaction. Labeling of these TNF mutants with [3H]acetyl-CoA revealed that nonmyristoylated mutants with Asp or Glu at position 3 and a weakly myristoylated mutant having Met at this position were efficiently acetylated as shown in thelower panels of Fig.6 A. In addition, a low level of [3H]acetyl-CoA incorporation was observed with an effectively myristoylated mutant having Gly at position 3. These results indicate that the amino acid at position 3 in the Met-Gly-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-Xmotif affected differently the two cotranslational protein modifications, N-myristoylation andN-acetylation. It is generally accepted that Ser or Thr is preferred at position"
https://openalex.org/W2025301695,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder associated with genomic instability and cancer predisposition. Cultured cells from FA patients display a high level of spontaneous chromosome breaks and an increased frequency of intragenic deletions, suggesting that FA cells may have deficiencies in properly processing DNA double strand breaks. In this study, an in vitro plasmid DNA end joining assay was used to characterize the end joining capabilities of nuclear extracts from diploid FA fibroblasts from complementation groups A, C, and D. The Fanconi anemia extracts had 3–9-fold less DNA end joining activity and rejoined substrates with significantly less fidelity than normal extracts. Wild-type end joining activity could be reconstituted by mixing FA-D extracts with FA-A or FA-C extracts, while mixing FA-A and FA-C extracts had no effect on end joining activity. Protein expression levels of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)/Ku-dependent nonhomologous DNA end-joining proteins Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, and Ku86 in FA and normal extracts were indistinguishable, as were DNA-dependent protein kinase and DNA end binding activities. The end joining activity as measured by the assay was not sensitive to the DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin or dependent on the nonhomologous DNA end-joining factor Xrcc4. However, when DNA/protein ratios were lowered, the end joining activity became wortmannin-sensitive and no difference in end joining activity was observed between normal and FA extracts. Taken together, these results suggest that the FA fibroblast extracts have a deficiency in a DNA end joining process that is distinct from the DNA-PK/Ku-dependent nonhomologous DNA end joining pathway.

Cytogenet. 1991; 51: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). FA cells also experience spontaneous and psoralen-induced DNA deletions at a higher frequency than normal cells. These DNA deletions have been detected both within the endogenous hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene and within a target gene present on an autonomously replicating plasmid (9Bredberg A. Sandor Z. Brant M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Mohrenweiser H. Moustacchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These cellular phenotypes suggested that FA cells may have deficiencies in processing DNA double strand breaks. Recent reports have supported the hypothesis that FA cells have deficiencies in rejoining double strand breaks (DSBs) (11Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these studies, linearized plasmid DNA was transfected into immortalized FA lymphoblasts and recovered after 48 h. Analysis of recircularized products revealed that the overall efficiency of plasmid end joining was normal in FA lymphoblasts from complementation groups B, C, and D, but error-free processing of blunt-ended substrates was significantly compromised in these cells. To gain further insight into the process of DNA end joining in FA cells, we used an in vitro assay to examine the ability of nuclear protein extracts prepared from diploid FA fibroblasts to rejoin linear plasmid DNA substrates. Nuclear extracts from diploid fibroblasts from patients from complementation groups A, C, and D had 3–9-fold less end joining activity and rejoined linear substrates imprecisely at a higher frequency than extracts from normal donors. This end joining deficiency was not due to the presence of an inhibitor in the FA extracts or to deficiencies in proteins or activities known to be involved in the well characterized DNA-PK/Ku nonhomologous DNA end joining pathway (13Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Wild-type end joining activity could be reconstituted by mixing FA-D extracts with FA-A or FA-C extracts but not by mixing FA-A with FA-C extracts. The end joining activity that was deficient in the FA extracts was not sensitive to the DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin or dependent on Xrcc4. When a lower substrate DNA/protein ratio was used in the end joining assay, the end joining activity was wortmannin-sensitive, and indistinguishable end joining levels were observed between normal and FA extracts. The diploid FA fibroblast cell strains PD.134.F (FA-C), PD.220.F (FA-A), and PD.20.F (FA-D) as well as the normal diploid cell strains PD.715.F, PD.13.F, PD.793.F, PD.792.F, and PD.751.F were kindly provided by Dr. Markus Grompe (Oregon Health Sciences University). These cells were maintained in minimum essential α-medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 15% fetal bovine serum. Normal diploid strains CRL-2115, CRL-2068, and CRL-2072 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (14Jessberger R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harvested from confluent 100-mm tissue culture dishes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2 ml of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and kept on ice for 15 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes with a tight pestle). The released nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A containing 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/μl aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin and incubated for 1 h on ice. The nuclei were centrifuged at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TL-100.3 rotor at 4 °C for 30 min, and the clear supernatant was adjusted to 10% glycerol and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The resulting extracts were dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). DNA end joining reactions were carried out essentially as described previously (16North P. Ganesh A. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6205-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Circular pCR 2.1 plasmid DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was linearized by restriction digestion with KpnI to create linear substrates with 3′-cohesive ends, EcoRI to produce 5′-cohesive ends, orEcoRV to generate blunt-ended substrates (all endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After restriction digest, substrates were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer, pH 8.0. 1 μg of linearized DNA was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein extract in 70 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was carried out at 14 °C for 12 h unless otherwise noted. The reaction mixture was then treated with proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min and electrophoretically separated on a 0.8% agarose gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 0.55 V/cm for 12–15 h. After staining in ethidium bromide, gels were scanned on a Bio-Rad scanner using the Molecular Analyst program and quantified using IP Lab Gel (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). A band that migrated with form II of the uncut substrate DNA was labeled CC and called closed circular; a band that migrated at the predicted size of a linear dimer was labeled D; and bands that migrated larger than the linear dimer were labeled as higher molecular weight products (HM). To quantitate the percentage of rejoining, total product formation was calculated (CC + D +HM) and divided by the sum of total substrate DNA in the reaction (L + CC + D +HM). The anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku86 antibodies were purchased from Serotech, (Raleigh, NC). The anti-Xrcc4 and anti-DNA ligase IV antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. Susan Critchlow and Stephen Jackson (Welcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge, UK). All primary antibodies were raised in rabbits against recombinant human proteins. Protein samples (10 μg) were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After a 1-h incubation in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was probed with antibody (1:2000 dilution for anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku86 antibodies; 1:1000 dilution for anti-Xrcc4 and anti-DNA ligase IV antibodies). The membrane was then washed three times in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with diluted (1:5000) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by three additional washes in 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Incubation with Sigma Fast (Sigma), which contains the alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium, was then carried out to detect the presence of the proteins. A modification of the assay used by Rathmell and Chu (18Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was used to detect DNA end binding activity in the nuclear extracts. A 394-base pair fragment from anEcoRI digest of the plasmid pREP4 was radioactively end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP by using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. 0.2 ng of probe was incubated with 0.3 μg of nuclear extract in 12 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.6 nm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 6% glycerol in the presence of 200 ng of unlabeled supercoiled DNA. To specifically compete for the DNA end binding activity, 200 ng of unlabeled linear plasmid DNA was added in place of circular DNA to the reaction mix. Reactions were carried out at 14 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 10 μl. Following incubation, 5× loading dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 30% glycerol) was added to each reaction and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in TBE (90 mmTris borate, 2 mm EDTA) running buffer. The gel was run at 20 V/cm for 2 h at 4 °C. Detection of radioactivity was achieved using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Foster City, CA). The SignaTECT DNA-dependent Protein Kinase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to detect DNA-PK activity following instructions provided by the manufacturer. A 0.1 mm stock of wortmannin (Sigma) was prepared in 10% Me2SO. Wortmannin was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice. Plasmid DNA end joining experiments as previously described were then performed at 14 °C. Extracts (50 μg) were incubated with antisera for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotary wheel. The extract/antibody mixture was added to 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated with rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were removed by repeated centrifugation at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis and end joining experiments. End joining assays were carried out as described above. After the 14 °C incubation, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h. Samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of TE buffer, pH 8.0. Electrocompetent E. coli (strain DH10B) was then electroporated with 1 μl of recovered plasmid DNA using a Life Technologies, Inc. Gene Pulser at a field strength of 2.44 kV/cm and plated on ampicillin-containing LB plates containing isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside. Bacterial transformants containing imprecisely end-joined plasmids were detected as white colonies, whereas transformants harboring precisely rejoined plasmids formed blue colonies. Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method, characterized by restriction mapping, and sequenced using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences automated DNA sequencer (Microchemical Facility, University of Minnesota). To test the end joining activity of FA fibroblasts, an in vitro DNA end joining assay that has been previously described was employed (16North P. Ganesh A. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6205-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from diploid fibroblasts from normal donors and diploid fibroblasts from FA patients of complementation groups A (FA-A), C (FA-C), and D (FA-D). 5 μg of extract was incubated for 12 h at 14 °C with 1 μg of plasmid pCR2.1 DNA that had been linearized by restriction digestion to have either blunt or cohesive ends. End joining activity was detected by the presence of closed circular, linear substrate, and high molecular weight products when the reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In end joining experiments performed with blunt-ended substrate, closed circular was the predominant product formed. When cohesive-ended substrates were used, closed circular, linear substrate, and high molecular weight products were detected on the ethidium bromide-stained gels. Fig. 1 a shows the results of an end joining experiment performed with blunt-ended substrate. Scanning laser densitometry was used to quantitate the bands, and the percentage of linear substrate that had been rejoined was determined. This analysis revealed that the normal extract rejoined 34% of the linearized substrate as compared with 3, 7, and 7%, respectively, by the FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts. To confirm that the FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts were deficient in DNA end joining, two or three independent extracts were prepared from each cell line and tested multiple times in end joining experiments with blunt and cohesive-ended substrates. Also, nuclear extracts were prepared from seven normal fibroblast strains in addition to the normal fibroblast strain used in Fig. 1a (PD.715.F) and tested for end joining activity. Fig. 1 b depicts the average end joining activity (percentage rejoined ± S.E.) in the normal, FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts. The mean end joining activity of blunt-ended substrate in extracts from the normal strains ranged from 19 to 45% with a cumulative mean of 31 ± 4%. Rejoining of cohesive-ended substrate by the normal extracts ranged from 16 to 37% (cumulative mean, 26 ± 3%). The normal strain, PD.715.F, used in Fig.1 a and subsequent figures, rejoined 41 ± 3% of blunt-ended substrate and 35 ± 4% of cohesive-ended substrate. In comparison, the extracts from the FA-A cell strain rejoined 4 ± 1% of both substrates, the extracts from the FA-C cell strain rejoined 6 ± 2% of blunt-ended substrate and 12 ± 2% of cohesive-ended substrate, and the extracts from the FA-D cells rejoined 15 ± 3% and 10 ± 2% of the blunt- and cohesive-ended substrates, respectively. Comparison of the mean end joining activities in the eight normal fibroblast strains with the mean end joining activities in the FA extracts revealed that the FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts were significantly less able to rejoin linearized plasmid substrates with blunt and cohesive ends than the normal extracts. In the above experiments, the cohesive-ended substrate had a 5′-overhang. To determine whether the FA extracts were also deficient at rejoining substrates with 3′-cohesive ends, end joining experiments were performed with a substrate that was linearized by restriction digest with KpnI. Nuclear extracts from the eight normal fibroblast strains rejoined a mean of 48 ± 4% of the substrate, with a range from 35 to 64%. The FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts rejoined 3, 2, and 12%, respectively, of the 3′-cohesive-ended substrate (data not shown). We concluded that FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D extracts were deficient in rejoining plasmid DNA substrates with blunt-, 5′-cohesive, and 3′-cohesive ends. To determine whether the observed end joining deficiency in the FA extracts was due to reduced kinetics of activity, a time course experiment was performed with normal and FA-C extracts. The plasmid end joining assay was performed using a blunt-ended substrate, and aliquots were removed for analysis at 4, 8, and 12 h. As shown in Fig.2 a, the normal cell extract rejoined the blunt-ended substrate in a linear fashion between 4 h (25% rejoined) and 8 h (44% rejoined) before reaching saturation at 12 h (52% rejoined). On the other hand, no activity was detected in samples incubated with the FA fibroblast extract for up to 8 h. Following a 12-h incubation period, 4% rejoining was detected. Similarly, we tested the end joining activity of the normal and the FA-C fibroblast extracts as a function of protein concentration. Plasmid DNA end joining with blunt-ended substrate was performed using 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 μg of protein. As seen in Fig. 2 b, there was a noticeable difference in end joining activity between the two extracts at all protein concentrations tested. Similar observations were made when cohesive-ended substrates or FA-A and FA-D extracts were used (data not shown). Deficient end joining capabilities of the FA extracts can be explained by two alternate hypotheses; either the extracts derived from the FA fibroblasts contain an inhibitor of the end joining reaction, or, conversely, a factor or factors essential for the end joining reaction may be absent from the FA extracts. To distinguish between these two possibilities, an end joining experiment with blunt-ended substrate was performed using a mixture of equal amounts of nuclear protein extract from normal and FA-C cells. To keep the total protein present in the reaction at 5 μg, 2.5 μg of the normal extract was mixed with 2.5 μg of the FA extract. As seen in Fig.3, 5 μg of normal extract alone yielded 42% product formation. When a mixture of normal and FA extracts was tested, 34% product formation was detected. This level of end joining is consistent with the percentage of end joining obtained when 2.5 μg of normal extract is used in end joining reactions (see Fig.2 b). The same results were obtained when FA-A or FA-D extracts were mixed with normal extracts or when cohesive-ended substrates were used (data not shown). The wild-type level of plasmid end joining activity present in the mixed sample is inconsistent with the notion that an inhibitor of end joining is present in the FA nuclear extract. This finding indicates that nuclear extracts from FA fibroblasts lack a factor or factors essential for the end joining reaction. The reduced DNA end joining activity in extracts prepared from FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D fibroblast strains raised the possibility that wild-type end joining activity could be reconstituted by mixing combinations of the FA extracts. We therefore mixed 2.5 μg of extract from FA-A, FA-C, and FA-D fibroblasts in combination with one another and performed DNA end joining experiments. As seen in Fig.4, 5 μg of normal extract alone rejoined 33% of the linearized DNA substrate. Combining 2.5 μg of FA-A or FA-C extracts with 2.5 μg of FA-D extract resulted in 29 and 32%, respectively, of DNA end joining activity, whereas a mixture of the FA-A and FA-C extracts had no effect on end joining levels (7% end joining activity). It has been previously established that immortalized FA lymphoblasts rejoin blunt-ended DNA substrates in an error-prone manner in vivo relative to control lymphoblasts (12Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the nature of DNA end joining in nuclear extracts from FA-C fibroblasts and nuclear extracts from normal donors. A bacterial transformation assay was employed to analyze the fidelity of end joining in the extracts (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using blunt-ended substrate, a significantly higher number of white colonies were recovered from rejoining by the FA-C extract as compared with the normal extract, 27% (217 of 588) versus 18% (171 of 780) (p < 0.005, χ2 = 36.67) (Fig.5). Similarly, a significantly higher number of white colonies were recovered from the FA-C extract when cohesive-ended substrates were used. 4% (33 of 899) of the colonies resulting from the rejoining by the FA-C extract were white compared with 0.5% (15 of 2917) from the normal fibroblast extract. Statistical analysis again revealed that the difference was significant (p < 0.005, χ2 = 52.8). Restriction digest analysis of imprecisely rejoined plasmids from the FA-C (101 plasmids) and normal (69 plasmids) end joining experiments revealed that all imprecise rejoining events resulted in deletions (data not shown). Sequence data of the region flanking the rejoining site obtained from 26 plasmids that resulted from imprecise rejoining (13 from FA and 13 from normal extracts) showed no difference in the range of the sizes of the deletions (2–47 base pairs). It also showed that all deletions, irrespective of whether obtained from the FA-C or normal extract, were flanked by direct repeat sequences of between 1 and 7 base pairs in length (data not shown). From this analysis, we concluded that there was no difference in the nature of the imprecise end joining events between the normal and FA-C extracts. Currently, two independent pathways are known to repair DSBs in cells: homologous recombination and nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). In contrast to genetic screens of x-ray-sensitive yeast cells, which identified genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) (19Game J.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar, 20Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), mutant screens of x-ray-hypersensitive mammalian cells have led to the identification of factors involved in NHEJ (21Zdzienicka M.Z. Mut. Res. 1995; 336: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that DSBs are preferentially repaired by NHEJ in mammalian cells (13Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A NHEJ pathway, generally referred to as the DNA-PK- or Ku-dependent pathway, has been well characterized in recent years. It has been demonstrated to be minimally dependent upon five proteins: Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, Ku86, and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) (22Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To test if any of these proteins were absent from FA-C extracts, Western blot analysis was performed using antisera specific for the Ku70, Ku86, DNA ligase IV, and Xrcc4 proteins. The levels of these four proteins present in nuclear extracts from FA-C fibroblasts were essentially identical to those seen in the normal fibroblast extract (Fig. 6 a), suggesting that low expression of any of these four proteins was not the cause of the deficient end joining in the FA extracts. The presence of wild-type levels of these proteins does not prove that they are functional. However, the amount of DNA end binding activity, which is dependent upon the functional Ku70/Ku86 heterodimer as determined by the ability of Ku70 and Ku86 antibodies to supershift the end binding band (23Coffey C. Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3348-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was identical in control and FA-C extracts (Fig.6 b). Similarly, DNA-PK activities in FA-C extracts were indistinguishable from those present in extracts from control fibroblasts (not shown). Western blot analysis, DNA end binding, and DNA-PK assays performed with FA-A and FA-D extracts revealed no differences from normal fibroblasts in these extracts as well (data not shown). Previous studies performed with FA lymphoblasts also found no deficiencies in these factors or activities (11Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We next wished to determine whether the assay used in this study was measuring NHEJ activity. To do this, we determined if the end joining activity was dependent on DNA-PK or Xrcc4, two components of the DNA-PK/Ku-dependent NHEJ pathway (22Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (24Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindley G. Vlahos C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to inhibit DNA-PK activity (25Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). 5.0 μg of nuclear extract prepared from normal diploid fibroblasts was incubated for 30 min on ice with 5.0 μm wortmannin. This concentration of wortmannin abolished DNA-PK activity in the extract as measured by anin vitro DNA-PK activity kit (Fig.7 a). DNA end joining reactions with 5′-cohesive-ended substrates were then performed at 14 °C for 4 h. Wortmannin had no inhibitory effects on the end joining activity of these extracts (Fig. 7 b). Wortmannin also had no inhibitory effects on the end joining activity detected in FA extracts (Fig. 7 c). To determine whether Xrcc4 was required for the end joining activity, antiserum raised against the human Xrcc4 protein was used to immunodeplete Xrcc4 from a nuclear extract prepared from fibroblasts from a normal donor. Western blot analysis confirmed that the extract was depleted of this protein (Fig.8 A). DNA end joining experiments were performed at 14 °C for 4 h with the Xrcc4-immunodepleted extract. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the Xrcc4-immunodepleted extract had wild-type end joining activity. We concluded that the end joining assay as used in this study was measuring an activity that was not dependent on the NHEJ factors DNA-PK or Xrcc4. Baumann and West described an in vitro end joining assay that was dependent on the NHEJ factors Ku70, Ku86, Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, and DNA-PKcs (22Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of this assay, 10–100 ng of substrate DNA was incubated with 20–60 μg of cellular extract (0.001 μg of DNA/μg of protein as compared with 0.2 μg of DNA/μg of protein in the current study). To more closely resemble the conditions described by Baumann and West, we performed end joining experiments for 2 h at 14 °C using 50 ng of linearized DNA and 5 μg of nuclear extracts (0.05 μg of DNA/μg of protein) from normal and FA fibroblasts. As shown in Fig.9, similar to what was reported by Baumann and West, the end joining activity was sensitive to wortmannin under these conditions. The end joining activity observed in the normal and FA extract were identical under these conditions. The substrate DNA concentration was the only variable changed under the wortmannin-sensitive conditions, suggesting that the DNA/protein ratio is crucial in achieving a DNA-PK-dependent end joining activity. The data presented here demonstrate that extracts from diploid Fanconi anemia fibroblasts are deficient in end joining blunt and cohesive-ended linear plasmid DNA substrates. The end joining deficiency appears to be a common feature of FA, since extracts from fibroblasts from complementation groups A, C, and D share the defect. Several lines of in vitro evidence indicate that eukaryotic cells rely upon more than one DNA end joining pathway. In a study performed by Johnson and Fairman (26Johnson A.P. Fairman M.P. Mut. Res. 1996; 364: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), calf thymus extracts were fractionated into four biochemically distinct fractions. Despite the presence of Ku70 in only one of the fractions, end joining activity was detected in all fractions. In a second study, extracts that were prepared from the DNA-PK mutant tumor cell line MO59 had wild-type end joining activity, suggesting that a DNA-PK-independent end joining pathway was functioning in these cells (27Cheong N. Perrault A.R. Wang H. Wachsberger P. Mammen P. Jackson I. Iliakis G. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have also supported the hypothesis that multiple DNA end joining pathways exist. Genetic inactivation studies carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeconvincingly demonstrate that this organism repairs DNA double strand breaks through precise (Ku-dependent) and imprecise (Ku-independent) pathways (28Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 29Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The same appears to be true in mammalian cells. Both wild-type and xrs6 hamster cells, which lack a functional Ku86 protein, were able to rejoin transfected linear plasmids. However, rejoining occurred in a more error prone manner in the xrs6 cells, and the deletions formed were on average 3–4-fold larger than in control cells (30Liang F. Jasin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest that more than one NHEJ pathways exist. The data presented in this study suggest that the FA extracts are deficient in a DNA end joining pathway that is distinct from the well characterized NHEJ pathway. First, FA extracts have wild type levels of the NHEJ factors Xrcc4, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, and Ku86 as well as normal levels of DNA-PK and DNA end binding activities. Second, the end joining activity in which the FA extracts are deficient is not inhibited by the DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin. Third, extracts immunodepleted of Xrcc4 have wild-type end joining activity as measured by the assay. Finally, when end joining reactions are carried out similar to those previously reported for measuring NHEJ (22Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), there is no difference in end joining between normal and FA extracts, indicating that the well characterized NHEJ pathway is fully functional in the FA extracts. The possibility cannot be ruled out that Ku is involved in this alternate end joining process. However, given that FA extracts have wild-type DNA end binding activity, it seems unlikely that the defect in FA cells is the result of defective Ku proteins. In addition, cells with Ku defects are sensitive to ionizing radiation (13Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Zdzienicka M.Z. Mut. Res. 1995; 336: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a phenotype not associated with FA cells (31Duckworth-Rysiecki G. Taylor A.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 416-420PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the involvement of Ku in this pathway, the data indicates that the end joining activity that is deficient in the FA extracts is independent of DNA-PK and Xrcc4. Thus, this end joining pathway appears to be distinct from that classically referred to as NHEJ. It is tempting to speculate that the DNA end joining deficiency observed in FA extracts is representative of a cellular defect in rejoining double strand breaks. This alternate end joining pathway may represent an additional end joining pathway in cells. This could explain why end joining activity is still detected in Ku-deficient cells (28Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 29Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Liang F. Jasin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This could also explain why Escarceller et al. (11Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found no deficiency in the overall end joining efficiency of linearized plasmid substrates but did see error-prone rejoining of blunt-ended substrates in FA lymphoblasts. In vivo, a defect in this additional end joining pathway would be masked by other DNA end joining pathways. An end joining deficiency in FA cells could account for many of the cellular phenotypes associated with this disorder such as high levels of spontaneous and DNA cross-link-induced chromosomal breaks and high frequencies of spontaneous and psoralen-induced deletions. An end joining deficiency could also explain the predisposition to cancer associated with these patients, since unrepaired or misrepaired DNA lesions could ultimately lead to loss of function of genes essential for proper cellular maintenance and growth. In addition, a DNA end joining defect in FA cells could potentially explain a previous result observed by our laboratory. HR activity was found to be elevated in Fanconi anemia fibroblasts and in nuclear extracts prepared from FA cells as compared with HR activity in fibroblasts from normal donors (32Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have also observed that Rad51, the mammalian homologue of the bacterial recombination protein RecA, is substantially elevated in extracts prepared from FA fibroblasts. 2R. Lundberg and C. Campbell, submitted for publication. Recently, it was demonstrated that the human Rad52 protein, a protein involved in mammalian HR, binds double strand breaks (33Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We speculate that HR and Rad51 may be elevated in FA cells in response to an increased number of unrepaired DSBs that result from the described end joining deficiency. Finally, the data indicate that mixing FA-A or FA-C extracts with FA-D extracts is able to reconstitute wild-type end joining activity levels, while mixing FA-A and FA-C extracts has no effect on end joining levels. While FA-D patients have the same clinical symptoms as FA patients from the other complementation groups, there are reports of FA-D cells having unique biochemical characteristics (34Yamashita T. Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13085-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 36de Winter J.P. van der Wall L. de Groot J. Stone S. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. Scheper R.J. Kruyt F.A.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In particular, a multiprotein complex of four cloned FA gene products (FANCA, FANCC, FANCG, and FANCF) is detected only in wild-type and FA-D cells, indicating that all of the FA proteins, with the exception of FANCD, are required for the proper formation of this complex (36de Winter J.P. van der Wall L. de Groot J. Stone S. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. Scheper R.J. Kruyt F.A.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One could imagine that a preassembled “FA complex” is required for wild-type end joining activity in the extracts. This could only be provided by extracts from FA-D cells. Thus, when FA-A and FA-C extracts are mixed, neither would provide the “FA complex,” and wild-type end joining activity would not be reconstituted."
https://openalex.org/W2006935736,"Some members of the Wnt family of extracellular glycoproteins regulate target gene expression by inducing stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which functions as a transcriptional activator after binding to transcription factors of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family. Three different members of this family have been identified in Xenopus laevis thus far that differ in their ability to influence mesodermal differentiation and to activate expression of the Wnt target gene fibronectin. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of additional variants of XTCF-4. We show that the differential ability of these proteins and other members of the TCF family to activate target genes is neither due to preferential interaction with transcriptional cofactors of the groucho family or SMAD4 nor to different DNA binding affinities. Expression of these proteins in an epithelial cell line reveals differences in their ability to form a ternary complex with DNA and β-catenin. Interestingly, formation of this ternary complex was not sufficient to activate target gene expression as previously thought. Our experiments identify two amino acid sequence motifs, LVPQ and SFLSS, in the central domain of XTCF-4 that regulate the formation of the DNA-TCF-β-catenin complex or activation of target genes, respectively. Biochemical studies reveal that the phosphorylation state of these XTCF-4 variants correlates with their ability to form a ternary complex with β-catenin and DNA but not to activate target gene expression. The described variants of XTFC-4 with their different properties in complex formation provide strong evidence that in addition to the regulation of β-catenin stability the isoforms of TCF/LEF transcription factors and their posttranslational modifications define the cellular response of a Wnt/wingless signal.

T-cell factor lymphoid enhancer factor casein kinase II enhancer of split groucho groucho glutathione S-transferase fibronectin high mobility group T-cell receptor α Wnt-responsive element dithiothreitol polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Wnt-1 was originally identified as a proto-oncogene in mice (1Nusse R. Varmus H. Cell. 1982; 31: 99-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and was found to be a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophilasegment polarity gene wingless. To date at least 15 additional vertebrate homologs have been identified (for review see Ref. 2Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Members of the Wnt family of extracellular glycoproteins are able to activate at least two different signaling pathways in vertebrates (reviewed in Refs. 3Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar and 4Kühl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt pathway is involved in different developmental processes such as cell fate specification and cell migration. The major cytoplasmic effector of this pathway, β-catenin, accumulates in the cytoplasm in response to a Wnt signal. Subsequently, β-catenin can enter the nucleus where it binds to the N terminus of TCF/LEF1 transcription factors to function as a transcriptional coactivator. Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to carcinogenesis. Mutations increasing the stability and thus the cytoplasmic/nuclear pool of β-catenin were found in colon carcinomas and malignant melanomas (4Kühl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The identification of c-myc as a target gene of TCF-4/β-catenin links Wnt signaling with cell proliferation and thus with carcinogenesis (5He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hemeking H. Zawel L. daCosta L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). Another important target gene of TCF/LEF in this context leading to cell cycle deregulation was identified as cyclin D1 (6Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Members of the TCF/LEF family were originally identified as T- and B-lymphocyte-specific transcription factors. Sequence-specific DNA binding is mediated by the HMG box, and the target motif of these factors is given by the sequence (C/G)TTTG(A/T)(A/T) (7Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Members of this family are unable to activate transcription of reporter gene constructs that carry multiple copies of their minimal binding motifs (8Travis A. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and thus lack activation properties on their own. This raises the question how these proteins work as transcriptional regulators. One well characterized target gene regulated by LEF-1 is the T-cell receptor α gene, TCRα. Activation of the TCRα promoter by LEF-1 is strictly context-dependent. Under these circumstances LEF-1 functions as an architectural transcription factor by bending DNA, thus facilitating stable interactions of other known transcription factors like CREB/ATF, PEBP2α, and Ets-1 (9Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, LEF-1 interacts with proteins thought to function as transcriptional activators like ALY (10Bruhn L. Munnerlyn A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and SMADs (11Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W.Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Genes Dev. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Google Scholar). More recently, a functional interaction of LEF-1 as well as XTCF-3 with β-catenin has been demonstrated (13Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar, 14Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech.

Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). As a major player in canonical Wnt signaling, β-catenin has been shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator directly binding TBP (16Hecht A. Litteerst C.M. Huber O. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18017-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), pontin52 (17Bauer A. Huber O. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vlemincks K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP synergizes with β-catenin in activation of target genes. A synergistic effect specific for β-catenin-mediated activation of Xtwin was also reported for SMAD4; however, a direct binding between both β-catenin and SMAD4 remained elusive (11Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W.Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Despite binding to the same target site, members of the TCF/LEF family differ in their function. When overexpressed on the ventral side ofXenopus embryos, mLEF-1 induces the formation of a secondary body axis via activation of the Wnt target gene siamois (13Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar,14Huber O. Korn R. McLaughlin J. Ohsugi M. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 1996; 59: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), whereas XTCF-3 fails in this assay (15Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godasve S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destreé O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). In epithelial A6 cells LEF-1 activates the Wnt target gene fibronectin, whereas XTCF-3 does not (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two hybrid studies demonstrated that unlike LEF-1, XTCF-3 binds transcriptional corepressors of the groucho family (22Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) as well as CtBP (23Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the model that XTCF-3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of β-catenin by recruiting corepressors, whereas LEF-1 is unable to function as a repressor due to lack of interaction with grouchos or CtBP (23Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Levanon et al. (24Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) showed physical and functional interaction of the human groucho homolog TLE-1 with hLEF-1. The contradictory results may be explained by different splice variants of LEF-1 that were used by Roose et al. (22Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and Levanonet al. (24Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), respectively. Analysis of the genomic structure of the human TCF-1gene and analysis of the detected mRNA transcripts revealed extensive alternative splicing events. These result in a maximum of 96 theoretical splice variants, at least 5 of which have been shown to be expressed in vivo (25van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Alternative splice variants also have been reported for TCF-3, TCF-4, and LEF-1. These observations further support the idea that the binding of corepressors or coactivators depends on the expressed splice variant. In this study we report on the isolation of novel XTCF-4 variants. Furthermore, we analyzed the transactivation potential, DNA binding affinities, protein-protein interactions, and posttranslational modifications of these variants in comparison to mLEF-1/XLEF-1 and XTCF-3. Our studies revealed that the complex formation of XTCF-4 and β-catenin and the ability of this complex to activate target genes depends on the absence of two short amino acid motifs, LVPQ and SFLSS. Unexpectedly, these motifs neither influenced groucho nor SMAD4 binding to the transcription factors. Instead, we found that XTCF-4-β-catenin-DNA complex formation was accompanied by a dephosphorylation event observed in XTCF-4 isoforms lacking these motifs. Additional TCF-4 variants were isolated exactly as described (26König A. Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In short, TCF-4 clones were isolated from an A6 λ-ZAP cDNA library. Complete cDNA clones were obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and combining overlapping fragments. The XTCF-3 clone was isolated from a gastrula stage cDNA library and completed by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The Xenopus LEF-1 and the XTCF-3Δgrg constructs were kind gifts of O. Destreé (22Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 27Molenaar M. Roose J. Peterson J. Vinanzi S. Clevers H. Destreé O. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Independently, an identical XLEF-1 clone has been isolated in our laboratory by means of reverse transcriptase-PCR. The C-terminal truncated form of XTCF-3 has been constructed by PCR methods using proofreading Pwopolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primer sequences used for this construct were 5′-GCGCCTCGAGATGCCTCAGCTCAACAGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCCTCGAGTCTCTCTCAACTAGTCACTGGATCTGGTCAC-3′. The correct sequence of this construct was verified by DNA sequencing. All of these constructs were subcloned into pCS2+ containing a cytomegalovirus promoter as well as an sp6 promoter. For the isolation of a full-length Xenopus ESG-1 clone, a λ ZAP Xenopus gastrula cDNA library was screened with a 600-base pair fragment of ESG-1 (28Choudhury B.K. Kim J. Kung H.F. Li S.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 195: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) obtained by PCR amplification of a Xenopus gastrula library. Only partial cDNA clones were isolated, the longest encoding amino acids 34–756. The N-terminal region of ESG-1 (756 base pairs) was amplified by PCR of aXenopus oocyte cDNA library and subcloned into theBamHI site of ESG-1. The obtained full-length sequence was 95% homologous to the previously isolated ESG-1 and submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF289027). For GST pull-down assays with GST-SMAD4, human SMAD4 cloned into pGex4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The truncated version of XTCF-3 lacking the HMG domain and C terminus (amino acids 1–322) which was used as a negative control was prepared by PCR and subcloned into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pCS2+. The primers used were 5′- CGGGAATTCATGCCTCAACTAAACAGCGGC-3′ and 5′CGGCTCGAGACTGGGCTTCTTCTCTTCTTCC-3′. Transfection of epithelial A6 cells with different expression constructs and luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as described (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the use of Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) instead of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell extracts used in bandshift studies were prepared in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The used phosphatase inhibitors were sodium vanadate (10 mm), sodium fluoride (10 mm), and sodium molybdate (10 mm). For expression of His-tagged fusion proteins, cDNAs were subcloned into pRSETA (Invitrogen) with PCR techniques using proofreading Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformed BL21(DE3) bacteria were induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, bacterial pellets were lysed by sonification in lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300–1000 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) including protease inhibitors (complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the cleared supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins for 1 h at 4 °C in a batch procedure. After washing with 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300–1000 mm NaCl, 10–30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, the protein was eluted 10× with 1 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300–1000 mm NaCl, 100–300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining using standard procedures. For Western blot analyses of His-tagged fusion proteins, a commercially available antibody was used (RGS-His by Qiagen). For the electrophoretic mobility shift assays proteins were dialyzed against 1000-fold access of binding buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg bovine serum albumin per ml, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2), and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. In vitro translation was done using a coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega). Bacterially expressed fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blocking was done in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST overnight at 4 °C. The ESG protein was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and added to the blocked nitrocellulose filter in TBST for 8 h at 4 °C. After 3 washes in TBST, 0.25% bovine serum albumin the filter was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and further analyzed. The negative control was a His-tagged fusion protein comprising the cytoplasmic domain of Xenopus cadherin-11 (29Hadeball B. Borchers A. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interaction assays were performed by addition of bacterially expressed GST or GST-SMAD4 proteins, 2–4 μl of 35S-labeled TCF/LEF proteins, and 300 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Binding reactions were rolled for 4 h at 4 °C and washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The beads were boiled in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie to verify the integrity of GST and GST-SMAD4, the gel was dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis to visualize bound TCF/LEF proteins. The oligonucleotide sequences used were as shown in Fig.3 B and as published (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before labeling, oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. Both DNA strands were labeled separately and annealed to form the duplex DNA. Competition studies were performed with a 100-fold excess of either unlabeled probe or an unrelated oligonucleotide as previously published (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-CAATAAAAAAGGGATCTCGCCTGTTAATGA-3′. For quantitative gel shift analysis, the total concentration of the dimer in the binding reaction was 13 nm. Binding conditions using different concentrations of fusion proteins were done exactly as described (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations used are given in the corresponding figures. Quantification of the band shift studies was performed using a PhosphorImager (Fuji). The results shown in Fig. 4, A andB, are the mean of 3–5 independent experiments. Error bars give standard error means. Data analysis was done using CricketGraph III software (Computer Associates International, Inc. Islandia, NY). For supershift analysis 1 μl of either XTCF-4 antibody (Biomol) or β-catenin antibody (Sigma) was added.Figure 4Determination of binding constants of TCF/LEF factors. A, quantitative bandshift studies were done with the proteins as indicated on the siamois-derived oligonucleotide, and the resulting shift in mobility was quantified by a PhosphorImager analysis. The results are represented in two different ways. First, the percentage of bound oligonucleotide is given as a function of the concentration of protein added (left side).Kd is estimated by the protein concentration with 50% occupancy of binding sites. Second, results are shown as Scatchard plots (right side), confirming the Kd values as well as the theoretical concentration of binding sites (13 nm). The linear slope to determine Kd was calculated using Cricket Graph III software (Computer Associates International, Inc., Islandia, NY). The regression coefficientR indicates the performance of regression analyses. Values close to 1 indicate a good correlation; values close to 0 indicate that there is no correlation. The values were obtained from 3 to 5 experiments per protein concentrations. Error bars indicate S.E. B, quantitative bandshift studies were done as described in A except for using an oligonucleotide derived from the fibronectin promoter shown in Fig. 3 B. Note the different binding behavior of XTCF-3 and XTCF-4C with respect to the siamois oligonucleotide. In these cases, Kd is estimated only by the first plotting procedure. C,truncation of the C-terminal domain of XTCF-3 shifts the binding behavior from XTCF-3 on the FN-WntRE toward the one observed in case of mLEF-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphatase treatment lysates were prepared as described above in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Phosphatase treatment was done by adding 1 μl of potato acidic phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.5 μl of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to 1 ml of lysis buffer. Controls were in the absence of phosphatase in presence of 10 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium molybdate. Optimal results were obtained after 10 min of treatment at 30 °C as longer treatment (30 min) resulted in a nearly complete loss of DNA binding. Phosphorylation of bacterially expressed fusion proteins by casein kinase II (CKII) was performed with commercially available CKII (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions within 10 min. In our attempt to isolate Xenopus members of the TCF/LEF family, we recently identified a Xenopus homolog of TCF-4 (26König A. Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to the published XTCF-4 sequence, which we now refer to as XTCF-4B (GenBankTM accession number AF207708), we isolated in this screen two highly identical variants that differ in two short amino acid motifs (Fig. 1 A). Whereas XTCF-4A (GenBankTM accession number AF287150) contains both of these stretches, XTCF-B lacks the sequence SFLSS at position 288–292. XTCF-4C (GenBankTM accession numberAF287151) additionally lacks 4 amino acids (LVPQ) at position 256–259. In comparison to other known members of the TCF/LEF family, XTCF-4A resembles XTCF-3, whereas XTCF-4C is similar to murine LEF-1 (see Fig.1 A). As identical gaps are present in the mLEF-1 sequence, we exclude the possibility that these sequence variations might be an artifact. Based on the fact that the multiple TCF-1 isoforms are due to alternative splicing (25van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we assume that the isolated XTCF-4 variants were also generated by alternative splicing. We also isolated Xenopus homologs of TCF-3 (GenBankTM accession number AF287149) and mLEF-1 (GenBankTM accession numbers AF287147 and AF287148) that are almost identical to the published sequences (15Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Roose J. Peterson J. Vinanzi S. Clevers H. Destreé O. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The isolatedXenopus homologs of mLEF-1 not only lack the two described short amino acid stretches but also the region in between (Fig.1 A). Comparison with the recently characterized genomic structure of the human TCF-1 gene (25van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) reveals that this region is encoded by the alternatively used exon IVA of hTCF-1 (underlined in Fig. 1 A). So far we have not been able to detect a Xenopus homolog of XLEF-1 or TCF-1 encompassing this exon. For functional studies, these splice variants were subcloned into pCS2+ containing a cytomegalovirus promoter allowing expression of the constructs in culture cell lines. To compare the transactivating activities of these HMG box transcription factors, we used theXenopus fibronectin gene as a direct target for the classical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in Xenopus. As shown previously, in epithelial A6 cells mLEF-1 activates a −499/+20 fibronectin (FN) reporter gene construct significantly stronger than XTCF-3 (Ref. 21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1 C). We first tested whether in this assay XLEF-1 behaves in a similar fashion to its mouse counterpart even though it lacks the sequences corresponding to the TCF-1 exon IVA. Indeed, under comparable conditions XLEF-1 was able to activate the FN promoter to the same extent as the mouse homolog (Fig. 1 C). We conclude that the sequence differences between mLEF-1 and XLEF-1 are nonrelevant with respect to activation of the fibronectinpromoter. Given the similarity with respect to the LVPQ and SFLSS motifs between XTFC-4A and XTCF-3 on the one hand and XTCF-4C and mLEF-1 on the other, we next investigated the ability of XTCF-4A and-C to activate target gene expression. Whereas XTCF-4A was only weakly active (1.2-fold activation, n = 14, not significant), XTC-4C gave a strong response of the reporter gene construct (2.6-fold activation,n = 17 with p < 0.001 in Student'st test) (Fig. 1 C). Thus, in their ability to activate the FN promoter, XTCF-4A behaves like XTCF-3 (1.3-fold activation, n = 15, not significant), whereas XTCF-4C shows properties similar to mLEF-1 (2.0-fold activation,n = 7, with p < 0.01 in Student'st test). Unlike XTCF-4C and mLEF-1, XTCF-4B was not able to activate strongly the reporter gene (1.5-fold activation,n = 18) (Fig. 1 C). Fibronectin is highly expressed in XTC fibroblasts, and this is due to an activated Wnt signaling pathway (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the different TCF/LEF factors also in this cell line. As the Wnt pathway is already active in these cells, transfection of XLEF-1 did not lead to a further activation of the FN promoter. However, transfection of XTCF-3, XTCF-4A, or XTCF-4B led to an inhibition of FN expression (Fig.1 E). In contrast, XTCF-4C behaved as XLEF-1. Thus, those TCF/LEF factors that failed to activate the FN promoter in epithelial A6 cells are working as transcriptional repressors in XTC fibroblast, whereas those TCF/LEF factors that activate the reporter in A6 cells do not show repressing activity in XTC cells. In all cases, activation of the reporter gene construct was dependent on the presence of a functional TCF/LEF target site that we further refer to as the Wnt-responsive element, WntRE. Introduction of point mutations into the WntRE of the −499/+20 fragment (21Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby interfering with binding of the transcription factors to their target site, completely eliminated the responsiveness of the promoter upon transfection of TCF/LEF members both in epithelial A6 cells or XTC fibroblasts (Fig. 1, D and F). In summary, despite the high percentage of amino acid sequence identity between different variants of XTCF-4 that differ in the LVPQ and SFLSS motifs, these factors show distinguishable transactivation behavior in two different cell lines. In previous reports it had been speculated that LEF-1 functions as a transcriptional activator, whereas XTCF-3 acts as a repressor of transcription (22Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J.

Based on the age of onset and the severity of the disease, SMA is clinically classified as the severe type I (Werdnig-Hoffman disease), the moderate type II, and the mild type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease). The survival motor neuron (SMN) gene has been established as the disease gene of SMA. The human genome contains two copies of the SMN gene because of an inverted duplication at 5q13. This phenomenon appears to be human-specific, because all other organisms examined to date have a single copy of SMN. Deletions or mutations of the telomericSMN1 gene, which result in reduced SMN protein level, have been found in the vast majority of SMA patients (4Cobben J.M. van der Steege G.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of SMN does not share significant homology with any protein with a known function; nor does it contain any domains of known function. Although several lines of evidence have suggested that SMN participates in several divergent cellular processes, the question of how reduction of the SMN level leads to motor neuron degeneration remains open. In addition to its cytoplasmic localization, SMN is found in a novel subnuclear structure, named gems, which are found in the vicinity of, and often overlap with, coiled bodies (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The function of coiled bodies is unknown, but they contain spliceosomal snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles), which function in pre-mRNA splicing, and components of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles, which are involved in pre-rRNA processing. This has led to the speculation that coiled bodies may play some roles in snRNP and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle metabolism (15Gall J.G. Tsvetkov A. Wu Z. Murphy C. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fact that gems and coiled bodies are often associated and contain similar sets of proteins and RNAs suggests that they have related functions. In line with this idea, SMN has been shown to interact with a group of Sm proteins, the core proteins of snRNPs, and a novel protein, Gemin2 (formerly known as SIP1), both in vitro and in vivo (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Injection of antibodies against either SMN or Gemin2 into Xenopusoocytes inhibits assembly and import of snRNPs, suggesting that the SMN-Gemin2 complex performs an important function in snRNP metabolism (16Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 17Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of SMN, SMNΔN27, also inhibits snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm (18Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nuclear pool of SMN protein was found to be required for pre-mRNA splicing, probably by facilitating regeneration or recycling of snRNPs in the nucleus (18Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional proteins, Gemin3 and Gemin4, that are associated with SMN have been described (19Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). SMN may also be involved in regulation of gene expression by interacting with transcriptional activators (21Strasswimmer J. Lorson C.L. Breiding D.E. Chen J.J. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Campbell L. Hunter K.M. Mohaghegh P. Tinsley J.M. Brasch M.A. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol.

The ability of SMN to directly bind RNA, along with its close localization to microtubules in the cytoplasm and neuronal dendrites and axons, raises a possibility that SMN is involved in the transport of RNA (24Lorson C.L. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bechade C. Rostaing P. Cisterni C. Kalisch R. La Bella V. Pettmann B. Triller A. Eur. J.

Genetic studies have shown that SMN is an essential gene in mice,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (28Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M.

Mice carrying the human centromericSMN2 transgene under an SMN null background are viable and display phenotypes similar to the symptoms of SMA patients, thereby confirming that SMN is the disease gene of SMA (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J. Wu M.H. Wang N.M. Tsai C.H. Li H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar,34Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T.

However, little progress has been made from these studies to elucidate the SMN function.Homologous recombination occurs at exceptionally high frequencies in the chicken pre-B cell line DT40, which makes DT40 a useful genetic system for targeted gene disruption and for studying gene functions (35Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of an essential gene is possible in DT40 when the gene product is expressed from a conditional promoter (36Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of SMN, we constructed a DT40 cell line in which the endogenous SMN gene is disrupted, and SMN protein is produced from an SMN cDNA under the control of the tetracycline (tet)-repressible promoter. Here we have used this system to show that SMN is essential for cell viability and that human SMN can functionally complement for chicken SMN, even though these two proteins are only ∼60% identical in amino acid sequence. This cell line should provide a powerful system for the characterization of SMN function and for screening for potential therapeutic drugs for SMA.DISCUSSIONBy generating a cell line with a knockout of the SMNgene and conditional expression of the SMN protein, we have demonstrated directly that SMN is required for cell viability. This is consistent with genetic analysis of the SMN gene in organisms. Disruption of SMN expression in mice and C. elegans results in early embryonic lethality, which indicates a requirement of SMN for cell viability in embryos (28Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29Miguel-Aliaga I. Culetto E. Walker D.S. Baylis H.A. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Loss of the SMN homologue in S. pombe also shows a lethal phenotype (30Owen N. Doe C.L. Mellor J. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23841-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, SMN is required for fundamental cellular processes that are conserved from fungi to mammals. Although the mice models for SMA generated recently (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J.

Dierich A. Le Meur M. Melki J. Hum. Mol.

First, the SMN level in these cell lines can be modulated precisely and over a broad range,i.e. from none to 3–4-fold overexpression. Second, the homogeneity of a cell line should greatly facilitate characterization of phenotypes at the molecular level. More importantly, expression of huSMN protein in cSMN-depleted cells completely rescued the lethal phenotype, indicating that huSMN performs the same function as cSMN does, at least at the level of supporting cell viability and proliferation. Therefore, the function of cSMN defined by characterization of the phenotypes of cSMN-depleted S5 cells directly reflects the function of huSMN in vivo.The interaction of Gemin2 and SMN has been well characterized (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). First, Gemin2 directly interacts with SMN in vitro. Second, Gemin2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with an SMN antibody, and vice versa. Finally, SMN and Gemin2 are colocalized in cells. Here we observed a significant decrease of the Gemin2 level concomitant with cSMN depletion. This confirms and extends to an in vivosetting the biochemically defined interaction between SMN and Gemin2 and further suggests that components of the SMN-Gemin2 complex are stabilized by forming this complex. The effect of the SMN level on the stability of Gemin2 is reminiscent of the rapid degradation of the constituents of TFIID and SAGA complexes upon inactivation of a single TATA box-binding protein-associated factor subunit (41Apone L.M.

It will be interesting to test whether the level of Gemin2 is also reduced in Type I SMA patients. Additional proteins that are associated with the SMN-Gemin2 complex have been reported (19Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J.

In the most severe type I SMA patients, significant decrease of SMN protein can be seen in all tissues examined (12Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munnich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 13Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). However, motor neurons appear to be the only cells that are affected. Here we show that S5 cells that express low levels of cSMN (∼30% of the protein in wt DT40 cells) display slow growth. Considering that DT40 is a pre-B cell line, this result indicates that cells other than motor neurons are also dependent on SMN and are sensitive to SMN levels. Overall growth defects can be seen in SMA mouse models (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J. Wu M.H. Wang N.M. Tsai C.H. Li H. Nat.

Mice that express low levels of SMN protein and display SMA symptoms are smaller than their normal littermates after birth. Thus, it appears that human cells normally express much more SMN protein than they need, and a fraction of the SMN pool may actually be sufficient to support normal growth of cells except for motor neurons. The S5 cell line, whose growth can be specifically modulated by cSMN levels, provides a powerful system to search for potential SMA therapies. When maintained to express low levels of cSMN, S5 cells should be useful for high throughput screening for molecules that may be able to increase cell growth, presumably by enhancing the activity of cSMN, increasing its production, or slowing its turnover. Furthermore, cSMN-depleted S5 cells should be valuable for high throughput screening for compounds (if such exist) that can completely substitute for cSMN function. Given the high conservation of the SMN function, the chemical compounds that we search for will probably exert the same effect on huSMN and will, therefore, be potential therapeutic drugs for SMA. It should also be possible to carry out such screening on cSMN-depleted S5 cells whose growth is supported only by (low levels of) huSMN. Such compounds should also be useful reagents for further understanding of the normal function of SMN and the pathology of SMA. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),1 an autosomal recessive disease with characteristics of motor neuron degeneration and muscle atrophy, is a common childhood genetic disorder and the most frequent genetic cause of infant mortality (1Roberts D.F. Chavez J. Court S.D. Arch. Dis. Child. 1970; 45: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Pearn J. Lancet. 1980; 1: 919-922Abstract PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Czeizel A. Hamula J. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 26: 761-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the age of onset and the severity of the disease, SMA is clinically classified as the severe type I (Werdnig-Hoffman disease), the moderate type II, and the mild type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease). The survival motor neuron (SMN) gene has been established as the disease gene of SMA. The human genome contains two copies of the SMN gene because of an inverted duplication at 5q13. This phenomenon appears to be human-specific, because all other organisms examined to date have a single copy of SMN. Deletions or mutations of the telomericSMN1 gene, which result in reduced SMN protein level, have been found in the vast majority of SMA patients (4Cobben J.M. van der Steege G.

Although motor neurons seem to be the only known cell type that is affected in SMA patients, SMN protein is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues and cell types examined (8Lefebvre S. Burglen L.

The amino acid sequence of SMN does not share significant homology with any protein with a known function; nor does it contain any domains of known function. Although several lines of evidence have suggested that SMN participates in several divergent cellular processes, the question of how reduction of the SMN level leads to motor neuron degeneration remains open. In addition to its cytoplasmic localization, SMN is found in a novel subnuclear structure, named gems, which are found in the vicinity of, and often overlap with, coiled bodies (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The function of coiled bodies is unknown, but they contain spliceosomal snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles), which function in pre-mRNA splicing, and components of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles, which are involved in pre-rRNA processing. This has led to the speculation that coiled bodies may play some roles in snRNP and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle metabolism (15Gall J.G. Tsvetkov A. Wu Z. Murphy C. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fact that gems and coiled bodies are often associated and contain similar sets of proteins and RNAs suggests that they have related functions. In line with this idea, SMN has been shown to interact with a group of Sm proteins, the core proteins of snRNPs, and a novel protein, Gemin2 (formerly known as SIP1), both in vitro and in vivo (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Injection of antibodies against either SMN or Gemin2 into Xenopusoocytes inhibits assembly and import of snRNPs, suggesting that the SMN-Gemin2 complex performs an important function in snRNP metabolism (16Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 17Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of SMN, SMNΔN27, also inhibits snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm (18Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nuclear pool of SMN protein was found to be required for pre-mRNA splicing, probably by facilitating regeneration or recycling of snRNPs in the nucleus (18Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional proteins, Gemin3 and Gemin4, that are associated with SMN have been described (19Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). SMN may also be involved in regulation of gene expression by interacting with transcriptional activators (21Strasswimmer J. Lorson C.L. Breiding D.E. Chen J.J. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Campbell L. Hunter K.M. Mohaghegh P. Tinsley J.M. Brasch M.A. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol.

The ability of SMN to directly bind RNA, along with its close localization to microtubules in the cytoplasm and neuronal dendrites and axons, raises a possibility that SMN is involved in the transport of RNA (24Lorson C.L. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bechade C. Rostaing P. Cisterni C. Kalisch R. La Bella V. Pettmann B. Triller A. Eur. J.

Genet. 2000; 9: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SMN is evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes, because homologues of SMN have been identified in many organisms. Genetic studies have shown that SMN is an essential gene in mice,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (28Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23841-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the human centromericSMN2 transgene under an SMN null background are viable and display phenotypes similar to the symptoms of SMA patients, thereby confirming that SMN is the disease gene of SMA (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J. Wu M.H. Wang N.M. Tsai C.H. Li H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar,34Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T. Jablonka S. Schrank B. Rossol W. Prior T.W. Morris G.E. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, little progress has been made from these studies to elucidate the SMN function. Homologous recombination occurs at exceptionally high frequencies in the chicken pre-B cell line DT40, which makes DT40 a useful genetic system for targeted gene disruption and for studying gene functions (35Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of an essential gene is possible in DT40 when the gene product is expressed from a conditional promoter (36Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of SMN, we constructed a DT40 cell line in which the endogenous SMN gene is disrupted, and SMN protein is produced from an SMN cDNA under the control of the tetracycline (tet)-repressible promoter. Here we have used this system to show that SMN is essential for cell viability and that human SMN can functionally complement for chicken SMN, even though these two proteins are only ∼60% identical in amino acid sequence. This cell line should provide a powerful system for the characterization of SMN function and for screening for potential therapeutic drugs for SMA. DISCUSSIONBy generating a cell line with a knockout of the SMNgene and conditional expression of the SMN protein, we have demonstrated directly that SMN is required for cell viability. This is consistent with genetic analysis of the SMN gene in organisms. Disruption of SMN expression in mice and C. elegans results in early embryonic lethality, which indicates a requirement of SMN for cell viability in embryos (28Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29Miguel-Aliaga I. Culetto E. Walker D.S. Baylis H.A. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Loss of the SMN homologue in S. pombe also shows a lethal phenotype (30Owen N. Doe C.L. Mellor J. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23841-23846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, SMN is required for fundamental cellular processes that are conserved from fungi to mammals. Although the mice models for SMA generated recently (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J.

First, the SMN level in these cell lines can be modulated precisely and over a broad range,i.e. from none to 3–4-fold overexpression. Second, the homogeneity of a cell line should greatly facilitate characterization of phenotypes at the molecular level. More importantly, expression of huSMN protein in cSMN-depleted cells completely rescued the lethal phenotype, indicating that huSMN performs the same function as cSMN does, at least at the level of supporting cell viability and proliferation. Therefore, the function of cSMN defined by characterization of the phenotypes of cSMN-depleted S5 cells directly reflects the function of huSMN in vivo.The interaction of Gemin2 and SMN has been well characterized (14Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). First, Gemin2 directly interacts with SMN in vitro. Second, Gemin2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with an SMN antibody, and vice versa. Finally, SMN and Gemin2 are colocalized in cells. Here we observed a significant decrease of the Gemin2 level concomitant with cSMN depletion. This confirms and extends to an in vivosetting the biochemically defined interaction between SMN and Gemin2 and further suggests that components of the SMN-Gemin2 complex are stabilized by forming this complex. The effect of the SMN level on the stability of Gemin2 is reminiscent of the rapid degradation of the constituents of TFIID and SAGA complexes upon inactivation of a single TATA box-binding protein-associated factor subunit (41Apone L.M.

It will be interesting to test whether the level of Gemin2 is also reduced in Type I SMA patients. Additional proteins that are associated with the SMN-Gemin2 complex have been reported (19Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it will also be of interest to study what happens to the amounts of these proteins following SMN depletion. The molecular basis of SMA is a reduction in the level of SMN protein. In the most severe type I SMA patients, significant decrease of SMN protein can be seen in all tissues examined (12Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munnich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 13Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E.

However, motor neurons appear to be the only cells that are affected. Here we show that S5 cells that express low levels of cSMN (∼30% of the protein in wt DT40 cells) display slow growth. Considering that DT40 is a pre-B cell line, this result indicates that cells other than motor neurons are also dependent on SMN and are sensitive to SMN levels. Overall growth defects can be seen in SMA mouse models (33Hsieh-Li H.M. Chang J.G. Jong Y.J. Wu M.H. Wang N.M. Tsai C.H. Li H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 34Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T. Jablonka S. Schrank B. Rossol W. Prior T.W. Morris G.E.

Mice that express low levels of SMN protein and display SMA symptoms are smaller than their normal littermates after birth. Thus, it appears that human cells normally express much more SMN protein than they need, and a fraction of the SMN pool may actually be sufficient to support normal growth of cells except for motor neurons. The S5 cell line, whose growth can be specifically modulated by cSMN levels, provides a powerful system to search for potential SMA therapies. When maintained to express low levels of cSMN, S5 cells should be useful for high throughput screening for molecules that may be able to increase cell growth, presumably by enhancing the activity of cSMN, increasing its production, or slowing its turnover. Furthermore, cSMN-depleted S5 cells should be valuable for high throughput screening for compounds (if such exist) that can completely substitute for cSMN function. Given the high conservation of the SMN function, the chemical compounds that we search for will probably exert the same effect on huSMN and will, therefore, be potential therapeutic drugs for SMA. It should also be possible to carry out such screening on cSMN-depleted S5 cells whose growth is supported only by (low levels of) huSMN. Such compounds should also be useful reagents for further understanding of the normal function of SMN and the pathology of SMA.

Among the known functions of p53, one of the best characterized is the transcriptional regulation of certain genes in response to conditions threatening the integrity of the cell (reviewed in Ref. 3Ko L.J.

Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) through p53-mediated pathways (12Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). These events appear to be triggered by an activation and/or accumulation of p53 in the cell, but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. Growing evidence has revealed the importance of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation of p53 in this process (13Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 14Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Modulation of p53 activity in most cases is influenced by changes in its DNA binding properties, including alterations in the regulation of binding by the C-terminal domain (reviewed in Ref. 15Hupp T.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, p53 binds its transcriptional response element as a tetramer, and disruption of this conformation leads to a decrease in binding activity (16McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). p53 function in the cell is not limited to transactivation. Studiesin vivo and in vitro have shown that p53 associates with proteins involved in DNA repair (such as XPB, XPD (17Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 169-196PubMed Google Scholar), and WRN (18Spillare E.A. Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Shen J.C., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)), in recombination (hRad51 (19Sturzbecher H.W. Donzelmann B. Henning W. Knippschild U. Buchhop S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1992-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar)), and in replication (DNA polymerase α (20Kuhn C. Muller F. Melle C. Nasheuer H.P. Janus F. Deppert W. Grosse F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and RPA (21Li R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)), thus pointing to the direct participation of p53 in these processes. This hypothesis has been strengthened by several studies in vivo suggesting an involvement of p53 in the control of recombination and repair (7Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 22Wiesmuller L. Cammenga J. Deppert W.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 737-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although it is generally assumed that p53 acts via mediator proteins in response to primary damage in DNA, there is growing evidence that p53 can bind directly to sites of DNA lesions. p53 can recognize and bind single-stranded (ss)1 DNA and double-stranded (ds) DNA ends (24Bakalkin G. Selivanova G. Yakovleva T. Kiseleva E. Kashuba E. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in a sequence-independent manner. Both types of breaks represent intermediates of DNA damage, repair, and recombination. Additionally, p53 binds tightly in vitro to recombinational intermediates such as Holliday junctions and in doing so enhances their resolution by junction cleaving enzymes (25Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). p53 also binds three-stranded DNA structures (25Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrated that p53 and its C-terminal fragment form stable complexes at sites of extra base bulges (insertion/deletion mismatches) in vitro (27Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). When two similar substrates that contain some nonhomologies undergo recombination, clusters of extra base bulges and single-base mismatches are left behind, and their presence must be signaled for repair. Extra base bulges and single-base mismatches may also occur as a result of replication errors or repair of DNA damage induced by irradiation or carcinogens. For example, the presence of lesions such as thymine dimers could result in the insertion of nucleotides opposite the noninformational site during translesion synthesis, thus leaving behind mispairs and bulges. Collectively, these data suggest that a direct interaction of p53 with such DNA lesions may be a relevant upstream event in the biological function of this protein. However, the role of DNA damage intermediates in activating p53 following DNA damage is not fully understood, nor is the full spectrum of lesions to which p53 may respond known. Currently, two models for how p53 binding to sites of damage might alter events in the cell have been suggested. In one, p53 binding to lesions causes transcriptional activation of a cascade of genes leading to growth arrest or programmed cell death (28Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of p53 transactivation of genes located at a great distance when tethered to sites of DNA damage was unclear (29Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmuller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that once bound to an extra base bulge in DNA, p53 can dissociate in the presence of ATP (30Okorokov A.L. Milner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7501-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is possible that the protein dissociates in an altered form (for example, a structural alteration or a modification such as phosphorylation) and provides the appropriate signals at a distance from damage sites. The second model proposes a more direct participation of p53 in the DNA repair and recombination pathways (26Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmuller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The population of p53 in cells may not be homogeneous and may contain a mixture of molecules with different post-translational modifications (29Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmuller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, some forms of p53 could preferentially bind to response elements, whereas others may show a higher affinity for lesions in DNA. p53 molecules that bind to DNA lesions could, in turn, signal their presence to loci containing p53 response elements as well as recruit one or more proteins with which it interacts. It is also possible that in vivo, p53 exists primarily within different multiprotein complexes. Some of these could be specific for the recognition and repair of DNA damage and might include members of the mismatch repair protein family. Given the growing evidence that p53 is a potential damage recognition protein, it has become important to survey a large number of lesions in DNA to determine the extent to which each is bound by p53. Some lesions may directly induce p53 binding, whereas other lesions may be recognized by different proteins that act as a signal for the p53 response. Determination of the spectrum of lesions to which p53 does or does not bind directly is thus critical to further development of models that explain the role of this protein in the cellular response to DNA damage. Although binding of p53 to extra base bulges has been examined, its ability to directly recognize single-base mismatches has not. Dudenhoffer et al. (26Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) designed DNA substrates consisting of a recombinational intermediate with single-base mismatches and observed p53 binding to these structures when they contained A/G but not G/T mismatches. However, the complexity of these structures made it difficult to determine the influence of the mismatch component alone. Therefore, analysis of p53 binding to single-base mismatches in otherwise simple linear DNA is crucial. To address this need, we generated duplex DNA substrates containing all possible single-base mismatches and have examined their interactions with p53. Single-base mismatches and extra base bulges are repaired by the mismatch repair system. A number of these mismatches are recognized by the Escherichia coli mismatch repair protein, MutS and its eukaryotic homologs (MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6) with differing affinities found for the various mismatches in vitro (Ref. 31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and references therein). p53 and the mismatch repair proteins share many similar functions such as the ability to recognize extra base bulges (27Lee S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol.

Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M.

To place thein vitro p53 binding studies within the context of repair events in the cell, the affinity of p53 and hMSH2-hMSH6 for the various mismatches was compared. Double-stranded DNA substrates (49 bp) were made by annealing complementary single strand oligonucleotides (high pressure liquid chromatography purified from Life Technologies, Inc.). The duplex DNA substrates were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Benzoylated naphtoylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) was used to remove any contaminating ssDNA (37Gamper H. Lehman N. Piette J. Hearst J.E. DNA. 1985; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The substrates were desalted using Sephadex G50 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then purified on 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Human p53 protein was overexpressed in SF9 cells using a vector provided by Dr. Arnold Levine and purified as described previously (38Wu L. Bayle J.H. Elenbaas B. Pavletich N.P. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer was purified as described previously (39Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using a vector provided by Dr. Richard Fishel. For filter binding studies, reactions (20 μl) were carried out in a DNA binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at room temperature. The amount of DNA substrate, competitor DNA, and protein are specified in the figure legends. The samples were applied to presoaked nitrocellulose protein-binding filters (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by vacuum suction. Each filter was washed twice with the DNA binding buffer and air-dried for 30 min. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Binding of the DNA alone to the filters in the reaction mixtures (protein-free background binding) was less than 5%. The amount of p53-bound DNA was calculated as the ratio of the cpm/filter (minus the protein free background) to the total cpm of the reaction mixture. The standard assay for p53 and hMSH2-hMSH6 binding was performed in a buffer optimized for hMSH2-hMSH6 studies (39Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 15% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm EDTA in a 20-μl reaction volume. The concentration of DNA substrates, protein, and unlabeled competitor DNA are indicated in the figure legends. Unlabeled lesion-free dsDNA (Fig. 1) was used as nonspecific competitor DNA. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min unless otherwise indicated. Upon completion, the samples were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) at 200 V at 4 °C for 2 h. Gels were dried and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The affinity of p53 for various forms of damage in linear duplex DNA typical of those generated during replication or recombination needs to be determined to more fully understand how p53 responds to genetic insult of this form. To carry out these experiments, we designed a series of linear 49-bp DNA templates (Fig.1). The lesion-free DNA contains no damage and was based on a template described previously (27Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Variants were constructed containing all mismatches located centrally: A/C, A/G, C/T, G/T, A/A, C/C, G/G, or T/T. Each duplex DNA template contained three lesions spaced by 2–4 bp. This design was based on studies of Alani et al. (Ref. 40Alani E. Chi N.W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and references within) and Leeet al. (27Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) showing that the presence of the triple lesion significantly amplified the binding signal in gel retardation and filter binding assays. Further, clusters of mismatches are frequently left behind following recombination between two similar but not identical DNAs. As a positive control for p53 lesion binding, a template containing a single 3-cytosine bulge was synthesized. Two additional controls for testing the DNA binding properties of p53 were also designed. The first template contained the full 20-bp human GADD45 p53 response element (41Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar) at the center, and the second contained the same response element with 4 nucleotides shown to be particularly important for p53 binding substituted with other bases. Because ssDNA alters p53 binding (28Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 42Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P.

A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the duplex templates were first incubated with benzoylated naphtoylated DEAE-cellulose and then purified from nondenaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels to remove any contaminating ssDNA. For all the studies below, a single buffer previously optimized by Gradia et al. (39Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) for hMSH2-hMSH6 binding studies was employed. Comparative studies showed no significant difference (data not shown) when this buffer was used for p53 as contrasted to buffers containing magnesium (43Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), whose inclusion raised the potential complication of the activation of the putative exonuclease activity in the p53 (44Mummenbrauer T. Janus F. Muller B. Wiesmuller L. Deppert W. Grosse F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Filter binding assays were employed to evaluate p53 binding to these substrates. The human p53 used here was produced in SF9 insect cells, and analysis of this protein indicated that there was at least one phosphorylated site. 2M. Chernov and G. Stark, unpublished results.End-labeled DNA (1 nm) was incubated with p53 (15 nm of tetramers) for 20 min in DNA binding buffer (“Experimental Procedures”) at room temperature in the presence of a 15-fold excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor DNA. The results (Fig. 2) showed that p53 exhibits different affinities for substrates with different mismatches. p53 showed low binding to the negative controls: 4.2% of the lesion free and 3.8% of modified GADD45 templates were protein bound. The 3-cytosine bulge substrate, which serves as a positive control for lesions, showed the high binding (14% of the probe was bound by p53). Similarly, p53 bound extremely well to the full GADD45 response element (38% of binding). For the DNA containing A/G mismatches, 5.8% of the probe was bound by p53, whereas binding to DNA with C/C was 7.1%. Binding of p53 to DNA containing the other mismatches was lower than 4%. When higher concentrations of p53 were used, a small increase in binding was observed (except for C/C); however, the relative order of affinity remained the same: 3-cytosine bulge > C/C > A/G > wild type > A/C > G/T (TableI). It should be noted that a titration of p53 on these probes in the absence of nonspecific competitor showed higher levels of binding (data not shown).Table IDependence of mismatch binding activity on the concentration of p53SubstratesDNA bound45 nmp5375 nm p53%WT9.112.2A/C8.110.2A/G13.116.8G/T7.911.7C/C21.120.6BC40.142.0Filter binding assays were carried out using mismatch containing substrates A/C, A/G, G/T, C/C, 3-cytosine bulge (BC), and lesion-free (WT) DNA (1 nm) containing either 45 or 75 nmp53 in the presence of 15 nm nonspecific competitor. p53 binding to these probes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Filter binding assays were carried out using mismatch containing substrates A/C, A/G, G/T, C/C, 3-cytosine bulge (BC), and lesion-free (WT) DNA (1 nm) containing either 45 or 75 nmp53 in the presence of 15 nm nonspecific competitor. p53 binding to these probes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although filter binding assays provide a comparison of the total amount of bound DNA with the different substrates, this method does not allow direct visualization of protein-DNA complexes. A number of authors have documented nonspecific binding of p53 to DNA (Refs. 24Bakalkin G. Selivanova G. Yakovleva T. Kiseleva E. Kashuba E. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G.

Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmuller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To evaluate specific mismatch-dependent interactions of p53 to these substrates, gel retardation assays were performed. The multi-staged process of substrate purification and the necessity of using different single-stranded oligonucleotides to produce the double-stranded substrates excluded the possibility of having both the same amount of radioactivity and the same concentration of DNA for the different substrates. Therefore, binding of p53 to mismatches was tested in two different ways. First, probes were added to the reactions so that they contained the same amount of cpm for each substrate. As mentioned above, this required the addition of different concentrations of DNA. Therefore, different amounts of p53 were added to each probe to ensure a 1:10 molar ratio of DNA to protein. The DNA substrates and p53 were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of a 20-fold excess of nonspecific unlabeled competitor DNA followed by gel retardation assays (“Experimental Procedures”). p53 formed complexes with some of the mismatched substrates as seen by the retarded mobility of the probes, and complex formation varied depending on the type of the mismatch. As shown in Fig.3, binding was greatest for DNA with a 3-cytosine bulge (Fig. 3 A, lane13) and progressively less for the modified GADD45 sequence (lane 14), followed by the C/C (lane 10) and C/T containing substrates (lane 11). Finally, binding to the G/T (lane 12) and A/C (lane 9) containing DNAs was weak but greater than the lesion-free DNA, which showed no binding (lane 8). p53 also showed modest binding to the modified GADD45 probe. Quantitative phosphorimaging analysis shows that p53 binding to the 3-cytosine bulge was 48-fold greater than lesion-free DNA, whereas binding to DNA with the modified GADD45 sequence was 11-fold higher than lesion-free DNA (Fig. 3 B). The fold increase in binding for the C/C, C/T and G/T containing substrates as compared with the lesion-free DNA was 8.7, 6.0, and 4.6, respectively. The A/C containing substrate behaved similar to the lesion-free DNA. Using a second approach, experiments were set up such that the concentration of DNA in each of the reactions was the same, but because of the reasons described above, the amount of radioactivity for each substrate was not the same. Each reaction contained 3 nmDNA substrate, 40 nm p53 (tetramer), and a 15-fold excess of unlabeled dsDNA (control reactions without p53 are not shown). Gel retardation assay (Fig. 4) shows a series of distinct slow migrating bands corresponding to the position of the p53-DNA complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 11,arrows a, a′, and a“). In addition, there was a smear of faster migrating material (Fig. 4 A,bracket c) that probably represents nonspecific complexes of monomeric p53 with the substrates. These gel retardation assays were carried out multiple times (n = 3), and protein-DNA complexes were quantified. The level of p53 binding to mismatches was compared with the binding to the wild type substrate. The results showing the highest binding were seen with the substrate containing a C/C mispair, followed by A/G, and finally A/C and T/T. DNA containing C/T, G/T, A/A, and G/G mismatches showed binding that was lower than the wild type DNA. As expected, the highest binding was seen with the 3-cytosine bulge. Over the course of these experiments several different preparations of p53 were utilized. Even though the differences between binding to the various mismatches were not great in some cases, the hierarchy of binding to the different substrates was the same among the different p53 and DNA preparations. To ensure that the relative affinities of p53 for the different substrates described above were not due to fortuitous choices of DNA or p53 concentrations, binding of the protein in the gel retardation assays was followed as a function of DNA concentration. The concentration of DNA substrates was increased from 0.75 to 7.7 nm, whereas the concentration of p53 was kept constant at 12 nm. Fig. 5shows representative binding curves from some of the mismatches tested. In all cases, the lesion-free substrate was included as a control. Binding was modeled by PRISM software (GraphPad Inc.), assuming only one binding site (a cluster of mismatches) per DNA template. p53 binding to DNA containing the GADD45 site increased by 5-fold between the lowest and highest concentration of substrate tested (data not shown). At equal concentration of DNA ligands, the amount of bound DNA was higher for the substrates containing the A/G (Fig. 5 A), the 3-cytosine bulge (Fig. 5 B), and C/C (data not shown) lesions than for the lesion-free DNA. Substrates containing A/C, C/T, G/G, and T/T mismatches showed binding curves similar to the lesion-free DNA (curves for A/C and C/T shown in Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, substrates containing G/T and A/A mismatches showed binding curves lower than lesion-free DNA (Fig. 5 B). Although we used a mathematical model describing one-site binding to generate the binding curves, this model does not completely fit the experimental conditions. Specific p53-DNA complexes could be affected by factors such as the presence of DNA ends, which could provide additional sites that might compete for binding. Thus, efforts to calculate association/dissociation constants for p53 based on one-site binding models may not be applicable in this case. A similar series of gel retardation assays were carried out in which the DNA concentration was held constant while the p53 concentration was varied. The data shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the rate of increase in p53 binding for the four substrates examined was different. For example, changing the p53 concentration from 12 to 40 nm led to a 4.3-fold increase in binding to the lesion-free substrate and a 3.2-fold increase in binding of the substrate containing the A/C mismatch. In contrast, 8.9- and 7.2-fold increases were observed for the A/G and C/C substrates, respectively. The binding curves appear to be bi-phasic with little increase between 3 and 20 nm followed by a marked rise when the concentration was increased from 20 to 40 nm. Indeed, at 28 and 40 nm p53, very significant differences were seen in binding to the A/C and lesion-free substrat"

It has also become clear that they are not simple “filler,” but proteins with specific functional roles in the cell. Some major crystallins in non-human species are enzymes, whereas the ubiquitous α-crystallins belong to the small heat-shock protein superfamily and can act as “junior chaperones” (14Wistow G.

Aggregates of structurally perturbed proteins or localized phase separations within the fiber cells can form light-scattering centers capable of randomly dispersing incident light, fogging the lens (19Benedek G.B. Appl. Optics. 1971; 10: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 20Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 21Slingsby C. Clout N.J.

The most interesting genetic cataracts are those that shed some light both on the processes of opacification in normal aging and on the functions of crystallins and other lens components.The Opj (opacity due to poor secondary fiber junctions) mutant was found among the offspring of a male mouse treated with ethylnitrosourea in a mutagenesis experiment (30Favor J.

TheOpj locus was mapped to mouse chromosome 16, 9.5 ± 1.5cM distal to md (mahoganoid) (32Everett C.A. Glenister P.H. Taylor D.M. Lyon M.F. Kratochvilova-Loester J. Favor J.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). γS-crystallin (γS)1 is a major component of the adult mammalian lens, essentially replacing the expression of other γ-crystallins (γA–F), which are expressed from early embryonic development and are major components of the primary lens fibers and the earliest secondary fibers (17Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Davson H. The Eye. 1B. Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Google Scholar, 34Jaworski C. Wistow G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Sinha D.

Vis. 2000; 6: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). γS expression increases after birth and continues as the lens grows throughout life. Thus high levels of γS mark the cortical fibers of the mature lens, the same cells affected by the Opj cataract.Crygs, the gene for γS, was mapped to mouse chromosome 16, close to the locus of Opj (35Sinha D. Esumi N. Jaworski C. Kozak C.A. Pierce E. Wistow G. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 8PubMed Google Scholar).Here we describe the identification of a coding sequence mutation inCrygs which is associated with opacity in Opj and show that the mutation destabilizes the mutant protein in a temperature-sensitive manner and leads to severe disruption of cortical fiber cell morphology and organization.DISCUSSIONOpacity and lens malformation in the inherited murine cataractOpj are associated with a single base mutation in the coding sequence of the Crygs gene, which encodes the major lens structural protein γS. This results in a non-conservative sequence change of Phe → Ser at residue 9 in the protein. Phe-9, and residues at equivalent positions in all four repeated structural motifs in all members of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, is an important part of the closely packed, hydrophobic core of one domain, in this case the N-terminal domain (21Slingsby C. Clout N.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L. Slingsby C. Moss D. Miller L. Lindley P. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, this change does not prevent correct folding of the protein; evidently, the evolutionarily conserved tertiary fold pathway is able to overcome the defect in core packing so that both mutant and wt recombinant γS proteins express well in bacterial hosts and remain soluble at room temperature. Furthermore, both of them exhibit essentially similar CD spectra, consistent with the familiar, predominantly β-sheet structure of the γ-crystallins. Near UV spectra are also similar, although there are some differences, consistent with changes in tryptophan microenvironments, as would be expected for the substitution of serine and the possible concomitant burying of water in the folded domain. Conserved tryptophan residues are also important components of each domain core (21Slingsby C. Clout N.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Wistow G. Turnell B. Summers L. Slingsby C. Moss D. Miller L. Lindley P. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Even though the mutant is capable of folding correctly, it is markedly less stable than the wt, showing a sharply increased tendency to precipitate with increasing temperature. This occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that structurally perturbed proteins are aggregating. At a concentration of 1 mg/ml, the mutant protein precipitates out of solution at about 47 °C. In the lens, where the overall protein concentration may be much higher (17Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Davson H. The Eye. 1B. Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Google Scholar), this is likely to occur at even lower, closer to physiological, temperatures. This temperature-dependent loss of solubility is also reflected in the CD spectra, which show a decrease in the signal at 218 nm, corresponding to organized β-sheet. This occurs for both wt and mutant protein, but the loss in the secondary structure signal is steeper in the mutant than the wt.One of the favored models for senile cataract is the age-related accumulation of damaged crystallins (17Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Davson H. The Eye. 1B. Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Google Scholar, 22Harding J.J. Curr. Opin. Ophthalmol. 1998; 9: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the consequent gradual increase of light-scattering aggregates (41Benedek G.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1911-1921PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years attention has focused on the possibility that transitory structured intermediates with exposed surface hydrophobic residues play an important role in protein-folding diseases (42Wetzel R. Cell. 1996; 86: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that in the eye lens destabilized proteins are captured and solubilized by the small heat-shock protein α-crystallin (43Horwitz J. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the case of lens β- and γ-crystallins there is evidence that early unfolding intermediates characterized by substantial amounts of secondary structure bind to α-crystallin (44Das K.P. Choo-Smith L.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33209-33212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our experiments give no information on the structure of the aggregating state, but are consistent with these views. In the high protein concentrations of the lens, any protein that exposes surface hydrophobic groups, even transiently, could find many protein partners for irreversible aggregation. In this way, the unfolding of previously well behaved proteins, perhaps due to accumulated insults such as oxidation or through simple stochastic processes in the normal aging lens, can lead to opacification once the endogenous α-crystallin is saturated. Opj illustrates this sort of process, with an essentially normally folded protein that is near the edge of stability at physiological temperatures. Histological examination reveals protein inclusion bodies in both Opj/+ and Opj/Opj which would act as light-scattering centers, causing opacity.However, although both Opj/Opj and Opj/+ lenses share the problem of protein aggregate formation, the homozygotes have much more severe defects that may provide some insights into another question, the function of the βγ-crystallins. In Opj/+ mice, which retain some normal γS protein, opacity occurs in lenses that have essentially normal organization. However, inOpj/Opj, cortical lens fiber cells, which happen to be the locales of γS expression (34Jaworski C. Wistow G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), are severely swollen, vacuolated, and disordered. Cell junctions and the normal smooth layering of lens fibers also appear to be highly aberrant. Interestingly, there is also evidence of cell dysfunction in cell layers in contact with the cortical fibers. This includes vacuole formation in epithelial cells and what appears to be a failure of normal cell nuclei breakdown in inner fiber cell layers (45Gao C.Y. Bassnett S. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Counis M.F. Chaudun E. Arruti C. Oliver L. Sanwal M. Courtois Y. Torriglia A. Cell. Death Differ. 1998; 5: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This latter effect is reminiscent of other γ-crystallin-related cataracts in mice which affect nuclear fibers (8Cartier M. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Klopp N. Favor J. Loster J. Lutz R.B. Neuhauser-Klaus A. Prescott A. Pretsch W. Quinlan R.A.

Development. 1991; 113: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects outside the cells that express γS may reflect “collateral damage,” with loss of normal cell contacts and transport processes in the outer cortical fibers causing disruption of adjacent cell layers.So, although unfolded protein and inclusion bodies are common to bothOpj/+ and Opj/Opj, cell structure in the heterozygote is essentially normal, whereas that of the homozygote is severely perturbed. This suggests that the disruption of cell organization and other effects seen in Opj/Opj may be caused through loss of function of γS itself.It seems that all crystallins arose by gene recruitment of preexisting proteins with specific functions to additional structural roles in the lens (14Wistow G.

In terms of sequence and structure, γS is an outlying member of the γ-crystallin family, and it has been suggested that it might represent a hypothetical ancestor of the γ-crystallins, possibly predating their recruitment to the lens (35Sinha D.

Biol. 1997; 4: 685Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The members of this superfamily remain largely mysterious in function, but observations from non-lens relatives of the crystallins have suggested that one common functional theme of these proteins may be some involvement in the control of cell morphology (18Ray M.E. Wistow G. Su Y.A. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3229-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 52Teichmann U. Ray M.E. Ellison J. Graham C. Wistow G. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Pavan W.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The severity of the Opj/Opj phenotype may thus reflect a role for γS in maintenance of normal cell morphology and function in cortical lens fiber cells. Indeed, in Opj/Opj, but not inOpj/+ at most ages examined, electron microscopy reveals unusual tangled structures within individual cells, resembling the collapse of some components of internal structure within each cortical fiber cell. This is evident even at 23 days in Opj/Opj. No similar defects occur in +/+ or Opj/+ through a wide range of ages. Not until 16 months were similar defects observed in oneOpj/+, and even then this lens was less severely affected than younger Opj/Opj. This suggests that even normal γS function may decline with age, eventually causing the heterozygous phenotype to mimic that of the homozygote. If this is the case, some effects of the loss of γS function might occur in normal individuals, perhaps including humans, with extreme age.Because new cells expressing γS continue to differentiate throughout life, this member of the γ-crystallin family may play an especially important part in maintaining transparency in the aging lens. Indeed, recent results show that senile cataract in humans may be associated with specific post-translational modifications to γS (53Takemoto L. Boyle D. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the effects of the twin processes of protein aggregation and loss of function in the Opj cataract, a homologous recombination experiment is in progress to delete the Crygsgene. Cataract is an almost obligatory consequence of aging in humans and, despite the availability of surgical intervention, is a major cause of blindness worldwide (1Bron A.J. Vrensen G.F. Koretz J. Maraini G. Harding J.J. Ophthalmologica. 2000; 214: 86-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition to “normal” age-related opacification of the lens, there are several inherited genetic cataracts in both humans and animal models (2Hejtmancik J.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 520-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

It has also become clear that they are not simple “filler,” but proteins with specific functional roles in the cell. Some major crystallins in non-human species are enzymes, whereas the ubiquitous α-crystallins belong to the small heat-shock protein superfamily and can act as “junior chaperones” (14Wistow G.

Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Google Scholar). The important β- and γ-crystallin families are evolutionarily and structurally related to each other and belong to a diverse superfamily of proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes which may be stress-inducible and may play roles related to maintenance of cell morphology (14Wistow G. Molecular Biology and Evolution of Crystallins: Gene Recruitment and Multifunctional Proteins in the Eye Lens. Molecular Biology Intelligence Series. R. G.

The transparency of the lens depends upon order, at both the molecular and cellular levels. Aggregates of structurally perturbed proteins or localized phase separations within the fiber cells can form light-scattering centers capable of randomly dispersing incident light, fogging the lens (19Benedek G.B. Appl. Optics. 1971; 10: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 20Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 21Slingsby C. Clout N.J.

Light scattering may also result from disruption of the well ordered array of the fiber cell layers and the junctions between them (23Bloemendal H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

The most interesting genetic cataracts are those that shed some light both on the processes of opacification in normal aging and on the functions of crystallins and other lens components. The Opj (opacity due to poor secondary fiber junctions) mutant was found among the offspring of a male mouse treated with ethylnitrosourea in a mutagenesis experiment (30Favor J. Mutat.

TheOpj locus was mapped to mouse chromosome 16, 9.5 ± 1.5cM distal to md (mahoganoid) (32Everett C.A. Glenister P.H. Taylor D.M. Lyon M.F. Kratochvilova-Loester J. Favor J.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). γS-crystallin (γS)1 is a major component of the adult mammalian lens, essentially replacing the expression of other γ-crystallins (γA–F), which are expressed from early embryonic development and are major components of the primary lens fibers and the earliest secondary fibers (17Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Davson H. The Eye. 1B. Academic Press, New York1984: 207-492Google Scholar, 34Jaworski C. Wistow G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Sinha D.

Vis. 2000; 6: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). γS expression increases after birth and continues as the lens grows throughout life. Thus high levels of γS mark the cortical fibers of the mature lens, the same cells affected by the Opj cataract.Crygs, the gene for γS, was mapped to mouse chromosome 16, close to the locus of Opj (35Sinha D. Esumi N. Jaworski C. Kozak C.A. Pierce E. Wistow G. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 8PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification of a coding sequence mutation inCrygs which is associated with opacity in Opj and show that the mutation destabilizes the mutant protein in a temperature-sensitive manner and leads to severe disru"

In this paper, we have cloned a cDNA for a novel importin α homologue from rice which is in addition to our previously isolated rice importin α1a and α2, and we have named it rice importin α1b. In vitro binding and nuclear import assays using recombinant importin α1b protein demonstrate that rice importin α1b functions as a component of the NLS-receptor in plant cells. Analysis of the transcript levels for all three rice importin α genes revealed that the genes were not only differentially expressed but that they also responded to dark-adaptation in green leaves. Furthermore, we also show that the COP1 protein bears a bipartite-type NLS and its nuclear import is mediated preferentially by the rice importin α1b. These data suggest that each of the different rice importin α proteins carry distinct groups of nuclear proteins, such that multiple isoforms of importin α contribute to the regulation of plant nuclear protein transport.

Communication between these two compartments takes place through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)1 (for review, see Refs.1Imamoto N. Kamei Y. Yoneda Y. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 9-20PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 3Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The NPC allows molecules smaller than 40–60 kDa to diffuse across, while larger proteins and RNA-protein complexes must be actively transported through the NPC in a signal-mediated and energy-dependent manner. Nuclear proteins involved in nuclear activities, such as DNA replication, transcriptional RNA synthesis, and RNA splicing, must enter into the nucleus. Conversely, RNA, such as mRNA synthesized in the nucleus, must be transported into the cytoplasm where it is translated to protein. In plants, nucleocytoplasmic transport has been implicated in functional regulation of a number of plant photomorphogenesis related protein factors (4Nagy F. Schafer E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For example, constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1), a repressor of photomorphogenesis, has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to a change of light environment. COP1 exists predominantly in the cytoplasm in the light while it accumulates in the nucleus in the dark, suggesting that nuclear protein transport is an underlying mechanism for the regulation of COP1 activity (5von Arnim V.G. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Multiple pathways of nucleocytoplasmic transport have been identified, each likely to be involved in carrying a distinct group of proteins (for review, see Refs. 3Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and 6Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Among them, the best characterized is the import of proteins containing a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) that consists of either a short stretch of 3–5 basic amino acids or two basic domains separated by a spacer, referred to as monopartite and bipartite NLS, respectively (7Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Yeast mating factor (Matα-2) contains a NLS consisting of basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues and has also been shown to be functional in plants (8Raikhel N. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The NLS-containing proteins are initially recognized and bound in the cytoplasm by NLS-receptor, a heterodimer consisting of importin α and importin β subunits. Importin α binds the NLS specifically, forming a stable pore targeting complex (PTAC) (9Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Kose T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y.

Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), whereas importin β mediates the docking of the PTAC to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (12Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Kraemer D.M. Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Translocation of the docked PTAC into the nucleus is mediated by the small GTPase, Ran (15Melchior F.B. Paschal J. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar,16Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Both importin α and β have been identified in a wide range of species, including vertebrates, yeast, and plants. However, while only a single isoform of importin β involved in classical NLS-directed nuclear transport has been isolated in most species, multiple isoforms of importin α have been identified in various species (2Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 3Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that such multiplicity of importin α isoforms might contribute to the tissue-specific or temporal regulation of nuclear protein import. For example, at least six different human isoforms of importin α have been identified, and they show significantly different tissue-dependent expression patterns (11Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). Intriguingly, in vitro binding assays using recombinant plant importin αs have revealed differential recognition of different types of NLS. The aIMPα can bind all three of the typical classes of plant NLSs, namely, the NLS of SV40 large T-antigen (T-NLS, a monopartite type), that of maize transcription factor Opaque 2 (O2-NLS, a bipartite type), and that of maize transcription factor R (R-NLS, a yeast Matα−2 type) (35Smith H.M.S. Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, rice importin α1 bound to the T- and O2-NLS, but not to the R-NLS (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Rice importin α1 also mediated nuclear import of fusion proteins containing either T-NLS or O2-NLS, but not R-NLS, in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All these data suggest that multiple isoforms of importin α may serve as a control point for the regulation of nuclear protein import. It is also noteworthy that two closely related importin βs have been identified in rice (37Matsuki R. Iwasaki T. Shoji K. Jiang C.J. Yamamoto Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is the only report thus far of multiple importin β isoforms identified in a single species. Whether such multiplicity is a common characteristic among plants is not yet clear, as no importin βs have yet been isolated from other plants. At least in rice, however, this may provide an additional point for regulation of nuclear protein import. In this paper we report the cloning and functional analysis of a novel rice importin α homologue which is in addition to our previously isolated rice importin α1 (33Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. Gene ( Amst .). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and α2 (34Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Shoji K. Sanmiya K. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because it shares very high homology (82.8% identity) with the rice importin α1, we have named this novel homologue rice importin α1b and have renamed the rice importin α1 as rice importin α1a. We show that rice importin α1b selectively binds to different types of plant NLSs and mediates the nuclear import of NLS substrates in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. Comparison of the transcript levels of the three isoforms of rice importin α reveals some differential expression, not only in different tissues, but also in response to light. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the COP1 protein bears a bipartite-type NLS and its nuclear translocation is mediated preferentially by the rice importin α1b. A rice expressed sequence tag (EST) clone C3059 (accession number D23592) with high homology to rice importin α1 (33Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N.

We used this EST clone as a probe to screen a cDNA library constructed in λgt11 using poly(A) RNA from the leaves of rice seedlings grown in the light for 14 days, and obtained a positive clone of about 2.4 kilobases in length. However, since this clone did not cover the full-length coding sequence, we carried out the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The 5′-end of cDNA was amplified by PCR using a gene-specific primer, 5′-GGGGATAATCCTCACGTTGGAGGAAGGC-3′, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products were cloned into pT-Adv vector using the AdvanTAgeTM PCR Cloning Kit (CLONTECH) and sequenced. The full-length importin α1b cDNA was used to generated a GST-rice importin α1b construct, as described below. A fragment corresponding to the amino-terminal portion (about 300 base pairs) of rice importin α1b with an artificial EcoRI site at the 5′-end was generated by PCR using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends fragment as template DNA. The forward and reverse primers used were 5′-GGGAATTCATGTCGCTGCGGCCGAGCGAGCGG-3′ and 5′-GGCAACCCCTCCAACTTCTGCTGGAGCG-3′, respectively. The PCR fragment contains a NotI site near the 3′-end. After double digestion with EcoRI and NotI, the fragment was inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rest of the rice importin α1b sequence was digested from the cDNA clone obtained from the rice seedling cDNA library and then cloned into the NotI site at the 3′-end of the amino-terminal portion. Both nucleotide sequence and orientation were checked by DNA sequencing. Chimeric DNA of GST-COP1 NLS-GFPs were generated essentially as described previously (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R.

The NLS-encoding sequences are indicated by italic and the endonuclease restriction sites are indicated by boldface. Underlined are basic amino acid cluster regions. The 3′-end primer used was 5′-ACGCTCGAGTTATTTGTAGAGCTCATCCATGCCATGTGT-3′. An oligonucleotide encoding an extra 5 amino acids (Leu-Ile-Gly-Gly-Gly) and incorporating three restriction enzyme sites (ApaI,XmaI, and SpeI) was inserted at the 3′-end of the original sGFP (S65T) gene (38Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated as psGFPcs. On the other hand, a PCR product of sGFP withXbaI and XmaI restriction sites at the 5′-end, and a SacI site at the 3′-end was produced and subcloned into pBI221 (CLONTECH) using the XbaI and SacI sites. Then a fragment encoding sGFP and thenos terminator was excised with XmaI andEcoRI digestion, and inserted between the XmaI and EcoRI sites of the psGFPcs plasmid. The resulting plasmid was designated pdsGFP. A PCR fragment corresponding to each COP1 NLS sequence with ApaI and XbaI site at 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, was inserted between two adjacent sGFPs of pdsGFP to generate sGFP-COP1 NLS-sGFP fusions and used for transient expression assays. The sGFP-COP1 NLS-sGFP DNAs were also digested withHindIII and SacI, and the resulting fragments containing the CaM 35S-promoter and the nos terminator flanking the sGFP-COP1 NLS-sGFP were cloned into the pIG121-Hm (39Akama K. Shiraishi H. Ohta S. Nakamura K. Okada K. Shimura Y. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 12: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) transformation vector.

Plant materials and total RNA samples were prepared as previously described (33Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. Gene ( Amst .). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were treated with DNase (RT-grade, Nippon Gene, Tokyo) to remove genomic DNA contaminants. Transcript levels of importin αs in the RNA samples were examined with the ABI PRISMSTM 7700 Sequence Detection System essentially according to the manufacturer's instruction (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were normalized with transcript levels of 18 S rRNA. Reverse transcription and amplification of transcripts were carried out using TaqManTM EZ RT-PCR Kit (PE Applied Biosystems) in the presence of one of the specific primer-probe sets shown below. The sequences of forward and reverse primers and TaqMan probes used for the analyses were as follows: 1) rice importin α1a, 5′-CGATAAGAAGCTCGAAAGCCTT-3′/5′-AAAGCAACTTGCGGAACTGTGT-3′ and 5′-CTGCTATGATTGGTGGAGTTTATTCGGACG-3′; 2) rice importin α1b, 5′-AATCAGGAGTGTTCCCAAGGC-3′/5′-ATCCCCAGTGACGATGTTACC-3′ and 5′-TGGAACTTCTCATGCATCCTTCGGC-3′; 3) rice importin α2, 5′-AGCTCCAATTTCTGGCAGTGAT-3′/5′-CAACAGCATGCGCAGTCTTTGC-3′ and 5′-TGGTCGATGAGGAGAAAGCATGTCTTG-3′; 4) 18 S rRNA, 5′-GAGAAACGGCTACCACATCCAA-3′/5′-CTAAAGCGCCCGGTATTGTTAT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCAGCAGGCGCGCAAATTA-3′. Onion epidermis was peeled off and placed inside up on plates containing MS medium (4.2 g/liter MS plant salt mixture, 30 g/liter sucrose, 4% Gelrite, pH 5.8) and 2.5 mg/liter amphotericin B antifungal agent (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Plasmid DNAs (6.75 μg) harboring the fusion genes were precipitated onto 1.6-μm gold particles (0.75 μg) and the particles were resuspended in 60 μl of 100% ethanol. A 10-μl aliquot of the suspension was loaded onto a particle delivery disc and the segments of onion epidermis were bombarded with the particles (PDS-1000/He; Bio-Rad). Bombardment conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer. Arabidopsis thaliana was grown at 22 °C under constant fluorescent illumination of 85 μmol m−2s−1, using Supermix (Sakata Seeds Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) and vermiculite (mixed in 1:1). Seedlings were germinated aseptically on half-concentrated MS medium supplemented with 2% sucrose, 0.3 mg/ml thiamine (HCl), 0.5 mg/ml nicotinic acid, 0.05 mg/ml pyridoxine (HCl) and as required with 20 μg/ml hygromycin.Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia was transformed byAgrobacterium tumefaciens (EHA 101)-mediated T-DNA transfer using the floral dip procedure (40Clough S.J. Ben A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant seedlings were selected and allowed to self seed for amplification. sGFP fusion proteins in the transient expression assays were observed with a microscope (Olympus AX70, Tokyo, Japan) with Nomarski optics or epifluorescence optics. For subcellular localization of sGFP fusion proteins of the transgenic Arabidopsis, whole roots were viewed under a stereo fluorescence microscope (Leica MZFL III). Photomicrographs were taken using 35 mm film and the figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Expression and purification of recombinant proteins and in vitro binding and nuclear import assays were carried out as described previously (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. By searching the rice EST data base, we identified an EST clone (accession number D23592) showing high homology with rice importin α1 previously reported in Ref. 33Shoji K. Iwasaki T. Matsuki R. Uchimiya H. Miyao M. Yamamoto N. Gene ( Amst .). 1998; 212: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Using this clone as a probe, we screened a rice seedling cDNA library and obtained a positive clone. Since DNA sequence analysis indicated that this clone lacked a 5′-segment of the open reading frame, we employed the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method to isolate a corresponding full-length cDNA clone. The full-length cDNA of the clone is predicted to encode a protein of 534 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58.5 kDa (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the clone showed 82.8% identity with rice importin α1. Therefore, we designated this novel cDNA as rice importin α1b and renamed the rice importin α1 as rice importin α1a. Rice importin α1b also shares significant amino acid homology with other previously identified importin αs, such as rice importin α2 (27.5%), aIMPα (59% (29Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), AtKAPα (68% (30Ballas N. Citovsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5640-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). Like the other importin α homologues, rice importin α1b contains the main characteristics of importin α: the importin β-binding domain (IBB domain) at the amino terminus (45Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 46Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the eight tandem armadillo (arm) repeats of 42 amino acids (47Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), a COOH-terminal acidic region, and two variable regions flanking the arm repeats region (Fig. 1). To address the ability of rice importin α1b to bind NLSs, we performed an in vitro binding assay using native gel electrophoresis. On a native gel, complex formation between two proteins gives a new band with a mobility different from that of either of the proteins alone. NLS-GFP fusion proteins, T-, O2-, R-, and Tm-GFP, were used as NLS substrates (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) throughout the functional analysis of rice importin α1b (Fig. 2 A). Tm-GFP, a point mutant of T-GFP in which the sixth residue, a lysine, of the T-NLS was replaced by a threonine, was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2 B, rice importin α1b and each of the NLS-GFPs migrated as single bands (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and9). A mixture of rice importin α1b with T-GFP gave a new major band of retarded mobility, with a little of the unbound protein running as in the control (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). As was the case with rice importin α1a (36Jiang C.J. Imamoto N. Matsuki R. Yoneda Y. Yamamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24083-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the complex of O2-GFP and rice importin α1b showed almost indistinguishable mobility relative to O2-GFP alone on the gel (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). However, complex formation between the two proteins is apparent as all of the rice importin α1b shifted upward, giving a much darker band (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). In contrast, a mixture of rice importin α1b with either R-GFP or Tm-GFP gave no new visible bands, with migration of each protein as in the control (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 8). These results suggest that the rice importin α1b selectively binds to T- and O2-NLS, but not to R-NLS. The binding was NLS-specific as the rice importin α1b did not bind to the Tm-GFP that has been shown to be nonfunctional (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). We next examined PTAC formation by rice importin α1b with rice importin β1 and NLS-GFPs (Fig. 2 C). Each protein migrated as a single band on the gel (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1, 2, 6, 9, and12). A mixture of rice importin α1b with rice importin β1 gave a new major band of retarded mobility, with some unbound proteins migrating at the position of the controls (Fig. 2 C, lane 5), indicating a direct binding of the two proteins. Addition of either T-GFP (Fig. 2 C, lane 4) or O2-GFP (Fig. 2 C, lane 11), but not Tm-GFP (Fig. 2 C, lane 8), to the mixture resulted in formation of a large complex with lower mobility on the gel relative to the complex formed either between rice importin α1b and β1 (Fig. 2 C, lane 5) or between rice importin α1b and either T- (Fig. 2 C, lane 3) or O2-GFP (Fig.2 C, lane 10). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of these bands confirmed that the complex contained rice importin α1b and β1 and either T- or O2-GFP (data not shown). To assess the functional activity of rice importin α1b in the process of nuclear import of proteins, we performed an in vitro nuclear import assay using digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. T-GFP and Tm-GFP were used as transport substrates, as positive and negative controls, respectively. The T-NLS containing proteins have been most commonly used as the transport substrate in nuclear import assays. As shown in Fig. 3 A, rice importin α1b, in conjunction with rice importin β1, efficiently accumulated T-GFP at the nuclear rim (Fig. 3 A, panel a). In contrast, rice importin β1 alone was not sufficient to direct the substrate to the nuclear rim (Fig. 3 A, panel c). Such accumulation did not occur when Tm-GFP was used as substrate (Fig.3 A, panel e). Upon addition of mouse Ran-GDP and energy-regenerating mixture, T-GFP was efficiently translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panel a). The translocation of the substrate was rice importin α1b-dependent (Fig. 3 B, panel c) and NLS-specific (Fig. 3 B, panel e). Omission of Ran-GDP or depletion of ATP by hexokinase from the transport solution abolished translocation of the substrate into the nucleus (data not shown). To investigate the expression of the three rice importin αs in different tissues and to examine the effect of light on their expression in green leaves, we performed quantitative analysis of RNA levels using the ABI PRISMSTM 7700 Seq"

A V349A substitution caused an 800-fold decrease in theVmax/Km for DHLA but less than a 2-fold change with AA; kinetic evidence indicates that C-13 of DHLA is improperly positioned with respect to Tyr-385 in the V349A mutant thereby preventing efficient hydrogen abstraction.

Reactions were initiated by adding ∼250 μg of microsomal protein in a volume of 20–50 μl to the assay chamber. The oxygenation of AA and DHLA by native and mutant oPGHSs-1 or hPGHSs-2 was in all cases completely inhibited by the addition of 0.2 mm flurbiprofen to the reaction mixture. All data were normalized to the relative levels of PGHS protein expression as determined by Western blotting and densitometry.

Membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, after which they were incubated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents and exposed to film for chemiluminescence. A general protocol for product analysis is as follows. Forty hours following transfection, COS-1 cells were collected, sonicated, and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the cell suspension (100–250 μg of protein) were incubated for 1–10 min at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm phenol and 6.8 μg of bovine hemoglobin in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were initiated by adding [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]DHLA (35 μm final concentration) and were performed with or without 200 μm flurbiprofen and stopped by adding 1.4 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1, v/v). Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 0.6 ml of CHCl3 and 0.32 ml of 0.88% formic acid were added to the resulting supernatant. The organic phase was collected, dried under N2, redissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3, and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate; the lipid products were chromatographed for 1 h in benzene:dioxane:formic acid:acetic acid (82:14:1:1, v/v). Products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Negative control values from samples incubated with 200 μm flurbiprofen were subtracted from the experimental values observed for each sample in the absence of flurbiprofen. Apo-oPGHS-1 was purified and reconstituted with Co3+-protoporphyrin IX as described previously (7Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M.

The crystals were harvested and transferred to stabilization buffer (0.9 msodium citrate, pH 6.5, 1.0 m LiCl, 0.15% (w/v)n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside), followed by a single step transfer to stabilization buffer with 24% (w/v) sucrose as a cryoprotectant. The crystals were immediately frozen in liquid propane at −165 °C. The Co3+-heme oPGHS-1/DHLA data set was assembled from two crystals.

In FDCER cell lines, which express endogenous c-Kit, the signaling capacities of such minimal Epo receptor forms (ER-HY343 and ER-HY343F) have been dissected to reveal: 1) that Epo-dependent mitogenesis, survival, and bcl-x gene expression via ER-HY343 depend upon the intactness of the Tyr-343 STAT5 binding site; 2) that ER-HY343-dependent bcl-xL gene transcription is enhanced markedly via c-Kit; 3) thatsocs-3, plfap, dpp-1, andcacy-bp gene transcription is induced via ER-HY343, whereasdpp-1 and cacy-bp gene expression is also supported by ER-HY343F; 4) that ectopically expressed SOCS-3 suppresses proliferative signaling by not only ER-HY343 but also c-Kit; and 5) that in FDCER and primary erythroid cells, c-Kit appears to provide the primary route to MAPK activation.

JAK2 then mediates the phosphorylation of eight cytoplasmic tyrosine sites within the Epo receptor, and via these sites, a complex set of Src homology 2 domain-encoding effectors (and associated cofactors) are engaged. These include STAT 5A and B; Grb2/mSOS/Raf/Ras; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase-γ1; and SHIP; Lyn, Syk, and Tec; SHPTP-1 and 2; the nucleotide exchange factors Vav and C3G (via Cbl); Cis and SOCS-3; and the adaptors Shc, Gab1, Gab2, CrkL, APS, and IRS-2 (reviewed by Wojchowski et al.

Although many of these are proto-oncogenic growth regulators, others are negative effectors whose action in terminating Epo-stimulated events is likewise crucial to regulated erythropoiesis. These include Cis, which appears to compete with STAT5 for binding at Tyr-343 (4Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Despite the complexity of this signaling network, studies of tyrosine-mutated and -truncated Epo receptors in cell lines (9Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I.

Blood. 1999; 94: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have established that signals necessary for Epo receptor-dependent erythroid development are supported by receptor forms retaining only a membrane-proximal box domain for JAK2 binding plus a single phosphotyrosine Tyr(P)-343 STAT5 binding site. Additionally, in JAK2−/− mice (14Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N.

Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar)), definitive erythropoiesis fails and lethal embryonic anemias are engendered. In at least certain systems, however, Epo receptor forms that lack all cytoplasmic Tyr(P) sites (yet activate JAK2) also have been reported to retain significant bioactivity (4Quelle F.W. Wang D. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W.E. Stravopodis D. Weinstein Y. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Together, these observations raise basic questions concerning how JAK2, and possibly STAT5 plus SOCS-3, integrate key Epo receptor-derived signals. As evidenced by severe anemias in mice sustaining mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit or its ligand (15Broudy V.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 1345-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SCF also is known to exert important effects on red cell production. Through colony-forming assays (11Wu H. Klingmuller U. Acurio A.

Nijhof W. Loeffler M. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), SCF has been shown to act in marked synergy with Epo on cotargeted progenitor cells. In fact, this has been proposed to involve the trans-phosphorylation of the Epo receptor by c-Kit (18Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, FDCW2-derived cell lines (which express endogenous functional c-Kit) (19Joneja B. Chen H.C. Seshasayee D. Wrentmore A.L. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been used to dissect signaling events that are relayed via Tyr(P)-343-retainingversus Tyr(P)-deficient Epo receptor forms and c-Kit. Data reveal roles for Tyr(P)-343 in mediating bcl-xL and socs-3 transcription, and in augmenting novel effects of c-Kit on Epo-stimulated bcl-xL andcis transcription. In addition, SOCS-3 is shown to inhibit not only Epo receptor but also c-Kit-dependent proliferation; several new ER-HY343 (and ER-HY343F) target genes are identified; and a primary role for SCF in MAPK activation is described. pMKwtER was prepared by the stepwise cloning of a wild type Epo receptor cDNA (20Quelle D.E.

Cells were selected in puromycin (0.4 μg/ml), cloned by dilution, and screened by Northern and/or Western blotting. Antisera used were to Pim-1 (see “Acknowledgments”) or Bcl-xL (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Erythroid progenitor cells were prepared from the spleens of mice treated with thiamphenicol as described (13Miller C.P. Liu Z.Y. Noguchi C.T. Wojchowski D.M.

Mapara M.Y. Zenke M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3658-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In assays of mitogenesis, exponentially growing cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and were cultured with cytokines in Opti-MEM I, 8% FBS at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml. At 48 h of culture, methyl [3H]thymidine incorporation was assayed (20Quelle D.E. Wojchowski D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4801-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In assays of apoptosis, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Opti-MEM I, 1% FBS in Epo and/or SCF. At the intervals indicated, cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml for 2 min) or with annexin-V detection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prior to flow cytometry. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Northern blotting was performed as described (26Seshasayee D. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. Mol. Cell.

RNase protection assays were performed using a RiboQuant multi-probe system according to the manufacturer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). cDNAs for PCR analysis were synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Superscript II RNase H(−) reverse transcriptase. ER-HY343 and HPRT were amplified using the following primer pairs: 5′-GAG CCG CCC CCT GGA CAC C-3′ and 5′-GAG GGG GTC CCT GGA GGC G-3′ for ER-HY343; 5′-CAC AGG ACT AGA ACA CCT GC-3′ and 5′-GCT GGT GAA AAG GAC CTC T-3′ for HPRT. In each reaction, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP was included. Products were electrophoresed in 5% acrylamide gels and were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Storm system, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Atlas cDNA expression arrays were performed according to the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). In assays of ERKs from FDCER cell lines, washed cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in OptiMEM I, 1% FBS for 12 h prior to cytokine stimulation. For erythroid splenocytes, cells were pre-cultured at 4 × 106 cells/ml for 8 h, while progenitor cells expanded from marrow were pre-cultured for 10 h at 2 × 106 cells/ml prior to a 5-min exposure to Epo (25 units/ml) and/or SCF (50 ng/ml). Cells then were adjusted to 0 °C, washed, and lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNaVO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml), aprotinin (3 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), and leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml). Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were adjusted to equivalence, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to phosphorylated forms of ERK-1 and -2 (catalog no. V803A, Promega, Madison, WI) or a pan-specific antibody to MAPKs (catalog no. 06182, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). In vitroassays of ERK activity were performed using myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Cells were washed, cultured for 8 h in Opti-MEM I, 1% FBS at 8 × 105 cells/ml, and exposed for 5 min to Epo (25 units/ml) and/or SCF (50 ng/ml). Cells then were adjusted to 0 °C, washed, and lysed in three volumes of 10 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors. Following a 20-min incubation, lysates were centrifuged (15 s at 8,000 × g) and resuspended in three volumes of 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, plus protease inhibitors. Samples then were incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged (10 min at 8,000 × g). Supernatants were assayed for protein (BCA assay, Pierce) and flash-frozen. EMSAs were performed using a GAS-like element from the β-casein promoter (TGCTTCTTGGAATT) as a probe (31Flores-Morales A. Pircher T.J. Silvennoinen O. Gustafsson J.A. Sanchez-Gomez M. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Wood T.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Extracts (25 μg/assay) were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C with the above 32P-labeled GAS element in 4% Ficoll, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 12 mm Hepes, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (plus 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)/20-μl assay) prior to electrophoresis in 0.25× TBE. For use in transduction experiments, FDCW2 cells were electrotransfected with pCDNA3.1-TVA950, selected in G418 (1 mg/ml), and cloned by limited dilution. Clones that efficiently supported transduction were identified by infection with an RCAS-GFP virus (32Holland E.C. Hively W.P. DePinho R.A. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry. Virus encoding STAT5A-1*6 (33Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) was prepared by constructing an RCAS-STAT5A-1*6 plasmid and transfecting chicken DF1 packaging cells (32Holland E.C. Hively W.P. DePinho R.A. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with this construct. Epo receptor (ER) forms used in the present investigation include the wtER, ER-HY343 in which a single cytoplasmic Tyr(P)-343 site is retained (and seven additional PY sites are deleted) within a minimal Epo receptor form truncated at Ala-375, and ER-HY343F in which this Tyr-343 site for STAT5 binding (within this truncated receptor form) is mutated (Fig. 1 A). For expression in factor-dependent FDCW2 cells, a dicistronic vector (pMK1059) was used to obviate the use of Epo as a selection agent. As assayed by Northern blotting, each of the above Epo receptor forms was expressed at highly comparable levels in stably transfected, G418-selected FDCW2 cells (Fig. 1 B).125I-Epo binding assays of FDCER-HY343, FDCER-HY343F and FDCER-wt cells also demonstrated Epo receptor densities to be uniformly on the order of 800–1000 receptors/cell. 2T. J. Pircher, J. N. Geiger, C. P. Miller, D. Zhang, P. Gaines, and D. M. Wojchowski, unpublished results. In addition (and as shown below), each of these Epo receptor forms proved to support c-Myc expression at comparable rates. In FDCER cells, the requirement for Tyr-343 in STAT5 activation has not been demonstrated previously and this therefore also was assayed in initial experiments. Mitogenic activities of the above Epo receptor forms in FDCER cells next were assessed. wtER and ER-HY343 receptor forms supported Epo-induced [3H]dT incorporation at comparable rates while ER-HY343F was essentially inactive (Fig. 1 C). These results were confirmed in repeated experiments using polyclonal lines from independent transfections (as well as in direct viable cell counting assays) and strongly suggest that in this strictly hematopoietic growth factor-dependent model, Tyr-343 (and STAT5) target proliferative effectors. Finally, EMSAs using a β-casein promoter-derived GAS element and extracts from FDCER-HY343versus ER-HY343F cells were performed and clearly confirmed an essential role for Tyr-343 in this response (Fig.1 D). The abilities of ER-HY343 and ER-HY343F receptor forms to transduce Epo-induction of several known immediate response genes was next studied. As shown in Fig. 2, c-Myc transcripts were induced via HY343 and HY343F receptor forms at comparable efficiencies, whereas in FDCER-HY343F cells, Epo induction of cis and pim-1 transcripts was blocked (as was predicted by the loss of STAT5 activation). More notably, Epo signaling of bcl-xL gene transcription in FDCER-HY343F cells was discovered to also be inhibited sharply (i.e.≥4-fold based on phosphorimaging). This result was confirmed in three independent experiments and is the first analysis to directly link Tyr-343 of the Epo receptor to endogenous bcl-xL gene transcription. Parallel effects were observed forbcl-2, but in FDC cell lines levels of bcl-2transcript expression (and induction by either Epo or IL-3) were ≤10% of bcl-x transcripts. Based on these results, whether exogenous Bcl-xL might rescue the Epo-dependent growth of FDCER-HY343F cells next was tested (Fig.3). Cells were transfected with pEFNeo-Bcl-xL, and clones stably expressing exogenous Bcl-xL were identified (Fig. 3, upper right panel). In FDCER-HY343F-Bcl-xLcells, however, ectopic expression of Bcl-xL at elevated levels failed to affect growth (Fig. 3, upper left panel). As a second proto-oncogene whose Epo-induced expression likewise depends upon Tyr-343 (see above),pim-1's ability to rescue FDCER-HY343F-Pim-1 cell growth also was tested (Fig. 3, lower panels). Effects, however, were limited to relatively high level expressing clones in which a modest increase in background rates of [3H]dT incorporation was observed. Each ectopically expressed factor, however, did protect FDCER-HY343F cells from apoptosis due to cytokine withdrawal by as much as 3-fold, respectively (data not shown). These results are consistent with those of related in vivo studies (34Chida D. Miura O. Yoshimura A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lacronique V. Varlet P. Mayeux P. Porteu A. Gisselbrecht S. Kahn A. Lacombe C. Blood. 1997; 90: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest the existence of important Tyr(P)-343-dependent effectors besides bcl-xL or pim-1.Figure 3Neither Bcl-xL nor Pim-1 rescue mitogenesis via ER-HY343F. Right panels, exogenous Bcl-xL or Pim-1 was expressed in FDCER-HY343F cells via stable transfection with pEFNeo vectors. In clones isolated by limiting dilution, Bcl-xL or Pim-1 expression was assayed by Northern blotting (and was confirmed by Western blotting, data not shown). Clones expressing bcl-xL were screened following 8 h of culture in the absence of hematopoietic growth factors. Left panels, illustrated are Epo-induced mitogenic response profiles (based on induced rates of [3H]dT incorporation) (mean values ± S.D.) for FDCER-HY343 and FDCER-HY343F cells, and for representative FDCER-HY343F clones stably expressing exogenous Bcl-xL (clones 19, and 23) or exogenous Pim-1 (clones 7 and 11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results led us to investigate whether the above minimal Epo receptor forms might support the induction of additional response genes. Specifically, FDCER-HY343 and FDCER-HY343F cells were exposed to Epo (±20 units/ml), [32P]cDNAs were prepared from poly(A)+-enriched RNA, and were hybridized to duplicate microarrays of known murine cDNAs. In independent hybridizations using [32P]cDNAs prepared from independent RNA samples, we identified four additional genes not previously known to be regulated via ER-HY343 or ER-HY343F, i.e. SOCS-3(22Starr R.

Although each was induced via ER-HY343, dpp-1 and cacy-bp transcript expression also was activated efficiently via Tyr-343-independent routes in FDCER-HY343F cells. With the exception of c-Myc, these latter two genes are the first in the Epo receptor system to be shown to lie downstream of JAK2 per se. How PLFAP, DPP-1, and Cacy-bp might function in proliferative signaling is under investigation, while effects of SOCS-3 on not only Epo- but also SCF-dependent growth are described below. For SOCS-3, the possible role of STAT5 in regulating its transcription also was tested functionally in the following way. To allow for analyses of short term effects, FDCW2 cells first were transfected stably with the avian leukosis virus receptor, TVA. Next, avian retroviruses encoding the constitutively active form of STAT5A (STAT5A1*6) (or GFP as a control) were prepared and transduced into FDCW2-TVA cells. In these STAT5A1*6-transduced cells, levels of SOCS-3 transcripts were elevated following the withdrawal of IL-3 as determined by Northern blot and phosphorimaging (Fig.5). Without correction for the estimated efficiency of transduction (∼20% of cells; Fig. 5, lower panel), this effect was severalfold. Although this result does not demonstrate direct transcriptional activation of SOCS-3 by STAT5, it does provide function evidence in situ for STAT5's involvement in this response pathway.Figure 5SOCS-3 transcript levels are increased due to ectopic expression of a constitutively active STAT5A-1*6. Upper panel, to treat possible effects of STAT5 onSOCS-3 gene expression, FDCW2-TVA cells were transducted with retroviruses encoding either STAT5A-1*6 or GFP as a negative control. In derived FDCW2-TVA-STAT5–1*6 cells, levels of SOCS-3 transcript were elevated severalfold upon the withdrawal of IL-3 (i.e. cytokine withdrawal). Assays were by Northern blotting and phosphorimaging at 0, 4, and 8 h of IL-3 withdrawal, and are normalized to levels of GAPDH. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments. No such effect on SOCS-3 transcript levels was observed in FDCW2-TVA-GFP cells (data not shown). Lower panel, to confirm transduction efficiency, FDCW2-TVA cells were infected in parallel with a GFP-encoding virus at approximately equivalent high titer and at 24 h after infection were analyzed for the frequency of infected cells. In this (and in three independent experiments), ∼20% of cells reproducibly were transduced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As mentioned in the Introduction, coactivation of the Epo receptor and c-Kit is essential for the expansion of progenitor cells at normal rates. Previously, we have shown that FDCW2 cells and derived sublines express endogenous, functional c-Kit (19Joneja B. Chen H.C. Seshasayee D. Wrentmore A.L. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined effects of Epo and SCF on FDCER cell responses therefore were investigated next (Fig. 6). With regard to proliferation, (and as predicted) (19Joneja B. Chen H.C. Seshasayee D. Wrentmore A.L. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1997; 90: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), c-Kit synergized with Epo receptor forms in FDCER-wt and FDCER-HY343 cells (Fig. 6). More interestingly, c-Kit also synergized with ER-HY43F, and this result defines at least a basal Epo receptor (phospho)tyrosine-independent mechanism of c-Kit cosignaling as compared with FDCER-HY343 cells. Maximal effects of Epo plus SCF on proliferation in FDCER-HY343F cells, however, were blunted somewhat as compared with FDCER-HY343 cells. Whether Epo and SCF might possibly cotarget bcl-xL or alternatebcl-2-related genes next was assessed. Initially, RNase protection assays were used to inve"
https://openalex.org/W1975806500,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is a 113-kDa nuclear enzyme that binds to both damaged DNA and to RNA associated with actively transcribed regions of chromatin. Binding of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to DNA lesions activates it, catalyzing the covalent addition of multiple ADP-ribose polymers to the enzyme (automodification). During apoptosis, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is cleaved by caspase-3, resulting in the formation of an N-terminal 24-kDa fragment, containing the DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal 89-kDa catalytic fragment. The functional relevance of this cleavage is not well understood. We therefore prepared a recombinant 24-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase fragment and investigated the role of this fragment in DNA repair and transcription. The 24-kDa fragment retained its binding affinity for both DNA breaks and RNA. In an in vitro cell-free DNA repair assay, this fragment inhibited rejoining of DNA breaks and suppressed ADP-ribose polymer formation by competing with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in binding to DNA breaks. With regard to transcription, it has recently been demonstrated that binding of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to transcribed RNA reduces the rate of transcript elongation and that automodification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase bound to DNA breaks results in up-regulation of transcription. We tested the 24-kDa fragment for its ability to suppress transcript elongation, and we found that it competed against the up-regulation of transcription mediated by full-length poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The ability of the 24-kDa fragment to inhibit DNA repair, ADP-ribose polymer formation, and damage-dependent up-regulation of transcription may contribute to the apoptotic shift from cell survival to cell death mode.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 is a highly abundant nuclear enzyme present at about 2 × 105 molecules per nucleus (1Ludwig A. Behnke B. Holtlund J. Hilz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6993-6999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is composed of an N-terminal DNA binding domain, containing two zinc finger motifs, a C-terminal NAD+ binding domain, catalyzing the synthesis of ADP-ribose polymers from its substrate, NAD+, and an automodification site, which unites the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (2de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP at the automodification site of the protein is initiated by the binding of the zinc fingers to DNA breaks (3Althaus F.R. Richter C. ADP-ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 3-113Google Scholar, 4Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this automodification, the binding affinity of PARP for DNA is reduced, resulting in dissociation of PARP from DNA breaks (5Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and thereby allowing the DNA repair machinery to access the sites of DNA damage (6Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In cells where DNA breaks are generated by DNA-damaging agents, PARP is activated and automodified (3Althaus F.R. Richter C. ADP-ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 3-113Google Scholar, 4Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that PARP is involved in the cellular response to genetic damage, particularly in the repair of damaged DNA (3Althaus F.R. Richter C. ADP-ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 3-113Google Scholar). However, PARP has been shown to lack DNA repair activity in itself (6Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 7Vodenicharov M.D. Sallmann F.R. Wang Z.-Q. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3887-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that PARP is involved in chromatin stabilization (8Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Haddad B.R. Rosenthal D.S. Weaver Z. Coleman A. Luo R. Young H.M. Wang Z.Q. Ried T. Smulson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13191-13196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in DNA replication (9Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although the roles played by PARP in these processes are not yet understood. In nuclear localization experiments, PARP is observed in clear foci, associated both with regions of chromatin actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II as well as with nucleoli where rRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase I (14Fakan S. Leduc Y. Lamarre D. Brunet G. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Dispersal of the foci upon treatment of cells with the transcription inhibitors actinomycin D or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole suggests an involvement of PARP in transcription (15Desnoyers S. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, such foci are also dispersed by treatment of isolated nuclei with RNase (16Kaufmann S.H. Brunet G. Talbot B. Lamarr D. Dumas C. Shaper J.H. Poirier G. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations thus suggest an interaction between PARP and transcribed RNA. Recently, we demonstrated that RNA-bound PARP reduces the rate of RNA elongation by RNA polymerase II and that automodification of PARP in response to DNA damage up-regulates transcription (17Vispé S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since DNA-damaging agents induce RNA damage as well, we proposed that this up-regulation allows cells to compensate for the loss of damaged RNA that occurs collaterally with DNA damage and that this pathway is required for cell survival following exposure to DNA-damaging agents (17Vispé S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to sufficiently high levels of DNA-damaging agents, they commit to cell death by inducing either apoptosis or necrosis. During apoptosis PARP is cleaved by the apoptosis-specific protease, caspase-3, resulting in the formation of an N-terminal 24-kDa fragment, containing the DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal 89-kDa catalytic domain, containing the automodification site (18Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 19Duriez P.J. Shah G.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Recently, Halappanavar et al. (21Halappanavar S.S. Rhun Y.L. Mounir S. Martins L.M. Huot J. Earnshaw W.C. Shah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37097-37104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Oliver et al. (22Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Murcia J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) reported that, in PARP knockout cells, expression of uncleavable PARP, lacking the caspase-3 recognition sequence, causes delayed induction of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. This observation suggests that cleavage of PARP has a role in damage-induced apoptosis. In addition, Herceg and Wang (23Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5124-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and Boulares et al. (24Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A.G. Ivanova V. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) suggested that cleavage of PARP is also required for tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death. However Herceg and Wang (23Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5124-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) found increased cell death by necrosis, whereas Boulares et al.(24Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A.G. Ivanova V. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) demonstrated a promotion of apoptotic, rather than necrotic, cell death by expressing uncleavable PARP in PARP knockout cells. Since the 24-kDa fragment contains the DNA binding domain, which is capable of binding to DNA breaks (25Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar), it has been speculated that the 24-kDa fragment possibly counteracts functions of PARP and promotes the process of apoptosis (19Duriez P.J. Shah G.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, biochemical characteristics of the 24-kDa fragment remain to be elucidated. Thus, we prepared the 24-kDa apoptotic fragment of PARP and asked whether the 24-kDa fragment competes against the functions of PARP in DNA repair, ADP-ribose polymer formation, and transcription. GMO1953A lymphoblastoid cells were obtained from NIGMS Human Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The C-II-10 antibody against the automodification domain of PARP and the F1–23 antibody against the DNA binding domain of PARP (zinc finger 2) (26Duriez P.J. Desnoyers S. Hoflack J.C. Shah G.M.

Full-length PARP cDNA (bases 1–3039) or the sequence corresponding to the 24-kDa DNA binding domain of PARP (bases 1–654), which is found in apoptotic cells (18Kaufmann S.H.

After overnight pre-culture, theEscherichia coli were propagated in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani medium in the presence of 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 3 h, and expression of PARP or the 24-kDa fragment was induced in the presence of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were then spun down at 3500 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and spun down. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer CB), and PARP or the 24-kDa fragment was extracted by sonication. After a 30-min centrifugation at 35,000 × g (at 4 °C), the supernatant was used for purification of PARP or the 24-kDa fragment. E. coli lysate (750 mg) was applied to a phosphocellulose column (10 mm diameter and 2-ml bed volume) equilibrated with Buffer CB. PARP was eluted using a linear gradient of Buffer CB containing 0.1–2.0 m NaCl. The fractions of interest were determined by silver stain analysis of samples run on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The fractions of interest were then pooled, diluted with Buffer CB to reduce the NaCl concentration below 0.2 m, and applied to a DNA cellulose column (5 mm diameter and 2-ml bed volume) equilibrated with Buffer CB. After washing the column with 20 ml of Buffer CB followed by 8 ml of Buffer CB containing 0.4 m NaCl, PARP was eluted with 8 ml of Buffer CB containing 1.0 m NaCl. The eluate was diluted with Buffer CB to reduce the NaCl concentration below 0.2 mand applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Hi-Trap, 5 ml) equilibrated with Buffer CB. PARP was eluted using a linear gradient of Buffer CB containing 0.1–2.0 m NaCl, and the final fractions were dialyzed against Buffer CB prior to analysis. Purification was carried out as for PARP except that the DNA cellulose chromatography was omitted. The final preparation was dialyzed against Buffer CB prior to analysis. The purified recombinant PARP and the 24-kDa fragment were quantified by direct ELISA. Briefly, PARP and the 24-kDa fragment were immobilized on a microtiter plate, treated with the antibody F1–23 (26Duriez P.J. Desnoyers S. Hoflack J.C. Shah G.M. Morelle B. Bourassa S. Poirier G.G. Talbot B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (5000-fold dilution) which recognizes the zinc finger 2 motif present in both PARP and the 24-kDa fragment, and then treated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Following addition of TMB substrate (Research Diagnostics Inc.), 0.18m H2SO4 was used to initiate the peroxidase reaction. PARP and the 24-kDa fragment were quantified based on absorbance at 490 nm. To prepare the DNA probe for the gel retardation assay, a single-stranded 50-base oligodeoxynucleotide (100 pmol) was 32P-labeled at 37 °C for 15 min using 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 25-μl reaction mixture using the buffer provided by the supplier. The labeled single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was annealed with its complementary single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (50 bases) in a 100-μl mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA by incubating for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 5 min at 50 °C, and then 20 min at 22 °C. The annealed double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was then precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate, and the resulting pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The binding reaction was carried out using 1 pmol of the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with varying amounts of PARP or the 24-kDa fragment in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 30 °C in a 15-μl reaction mixture. Samples were then fractionated by native 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography or used for quantitation by AlphaImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Gel retardation assays using an RNA probe were carried out as described previously (17Vispé S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly,32P-labeled stem-loop RNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase to transcribe the human immunodeficiency virus, type I TAR sequence. The 32P-labeled stem-loop RNA was then incubated with PARP or the 24-kDa fragment and fractionated by native 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After drying, the gel was either exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography or used for quantitation by AlphaImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Cell-free extracts were prepared from GMO1953A lymphoblastoid cells following the method of Manleyet al. (27Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The cell-free DNA repair assay was carried out using 50 μg of extract, 300 ng of γ-irradiated pBluescript II KS+ (pBS, 3 kilobase pairs) containing an average of one single-stranded DNA break per molecule (6Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), and varying amounts of the 24-kDa fragment in the presence or absence of 2 mmNAD+ under reaction conditions described previously (28Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification of the DNA, unrepaired pBS (open circular) and repaired pBS (closed circular) were resolved by ethidium bromide, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. To determine the amount of ADP-ribose polymers produced in the cell-free DNA repair assay, 1.3 μCi of [32P]NAD+ and 0.25 mmNAD+ were added to the reaction described above. Reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid, and insoluble32P activity retained on a GF/C filter was counted as described previously (28Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase elongation assays were carried out as described previously (17Vispé S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H.

Briefly, a pGf1 plasmid containing a G-less sequence was digested with PacI, creating a 90-base G-less sequence at one end of the DNA. A C-tail was added to allow loading of RNA polymerase II from DNA break ends. The DNA was then incubated with RNA polymerase II (1.0 units) (provided by Dr. H. Serizawa) (29Serizawa H. Makela T.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Weinberg R.A. Yung R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) in the presence of RNasin, ATP, UTP, CTP, and [α-32P]CTP at 37 °C for 30 min as described by Shilatifard et al. (30Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A chase was initiated by addition of GTP and excess CTP in the presence or absence of PARP or the 24-kDa fragment. After extraction and precipitation, RNA was fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. After drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. pCMV-Luc containing the cytomegalovirus promoter was linearized by ScaI restriction digestion and used in a run-off transcription assay with HeLa nuclear extracts (Promega). The expected size of the run-off product was 400 bases. Reactions were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C using 4 μg/ml linearized pCMV-Luc in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 400 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP, 400 μm ATP, 400 μm CTP, 400 μm UTP, 16 μmGTP, 10% glycerol, 1000 transcription units/ml of HeLa nuclear extract, and varying amounts of either PARP or the 24-kDa fragment. The reaction was terminated by addition of 7 volumes of 0.3 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 3 μg/ml tRNA. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, transcripts were precipitated with ethanol, fractionated by 3% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1− (Invitrogen) was used to clone the cDNA corresponding to the 24-kDa DNA binding domain of PARP (pcDNA 3.1−/AF24). Then 1.25 μg/ml pcDNA3.1-/AF24 was incubated with 3.75 μl/ml Tfx20™ reagent (Promega) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (serum-free DMEM) for 10 min at room temperature and used to treat HeLa S3 cells (attached to coverslips) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following cell treatment, DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (complete DMEM) was added; HeLa S3 cells were cultured for 24 h after which the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and the cells were exposed toN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (50 μm). After 20 min of treatment at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with complete DMEM, and cells were cultured for 2 h. TUNEL staining (fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then carried out after fixing the cells in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilizing them with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate according to the supplier's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TUNEL-positive cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To investigate the effect of the 24-kDa PARP fragment on DNA repair and transcription, we first prepared the recombinant 24-kDa fragment and full-length PARP. As shown in Fig. 1, the 24-kDa fragment, which migrated to an apparent molecular mass of about 30 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, was purified to over 99% homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods”. The purity of full-length recombinant PARP was about 95%, with several truncated products observed (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the 24-kDa fragment and PARP was carried out by direct ELISA using the F1–23 antibody (26Duriez P.J. Desnoyers S. Hoflack J.C. Shah G.M. Morelle B. Bourassa S. Poirier G.G. Talbot B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which recognizes the zinc finger 2 motif of PARP and the 24-kDa fragment. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (50 base pairs) was incubated with either the 24-kDa fragment or PARP. If the zinc finger motifs found in PARP and the 24-kDa fragment bind to DNA ends (2de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31D'Silva I. Pelletier J.D. Lagueux J. D'Amours D. Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Lees-Miller S.P. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the mobility of the32P-labeled DNA probe should be reduced on a native gel. As shown in Fig. 2, discrete retarded bands were in fact observed when the labeled probe was incubated with the 24-kDa fragment. Migration of the probe was similarly retarded when PARP was used instead of the 24-kDa fragment, with the probe migrating slightly more slowly than in the case of the 24-kDa fragment. In addition, the labeled probe was reproducibly found at the origin of the lane. Addition of excess unlabeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide inhibited retardation of the probe, confirming that formation of the retarded labeled material was due to binding of the 24-kDa fragment or PARP to the DNA probe (data not shown). The data in Fig. 2 reveal a linear relationship between 32P activity associated with the retarded fractions and the amount of the 24-kDa fragment or PARP and allow us to determine that the 24-kDa fragment has about 25% of the binding activity of full-length PARP. Thus, even after cleavage of PARP by caspase-3, the resulting 24-kDa fragment retains significant DNA binding activity. In the absence of PARP's substrate, NAD+, PARP binds to and persists on DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting DNA repair (6Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Thus, dissociation of PARP from DNA breaks by automodification is a prerequisite for DNA repair (6Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Since the 24-kDa fragment is capable of binding to DNA breaks (Fig. 2) but lacks the automodification site, these fragments should persist on DNA breaks and inhibit DNA repair even in the presence of NAD+. To test this hypothesis, a cell-free DNA repair assay was carried out using open circular pBS containing γ-ray-induced single-stranded DNA breaks, cell-free extracts, and varying amounts of the 24-kDa fragment in the presence or absence of NAD+. As shown in Fig.3, only 7% of DNA breaks were rejoined in the absence of NAD+ due to inhibition of DNA repair by bound PARP. By contrast, when poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and dissociation of PARP from DNA breaks was initiated by addition of NAD+, about 30% of DNA breaks were repaired. This NAD+-promoted DNA repair was significantly inhibited by addition of the 24-kDa fragment (Fig. 3, A and B). A 6.6-fold molar excess of the 24-kDa fragment relative to PARP was sufficient to inhibit NAD+-promoted DNA repair by 80% (Fig. 3,A and B, 15 pmol of PARP derived from extractversus 100 pmol of the 24-kDa fragment), consistent with the hypothesis that the 24-kDa fragment, unlike full-length PARP, binds to and persists on DNA breaks in the presence of NAD+. We then measured the amount of ADP-ribose polymers generated in the cell-free assay in the absence or presence of the recombinant 24-kDa fragment. As previously observed (28Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5480-5487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation of cell-free extracts with DNA breaks caused transient formation of ADP-ribose polymers (Fig.3 C). However, addition of the 24-kDa fragment significantly inhibited ADP-ribose polymer formation, suggesting that the 24-kDa fragment effectively competed with PARP in binding to DNA breaks and thereby reduced the overall level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the presence of NAD+. Since ADP-ribose polymers are synthesized from NAD+, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) formation should reduce the consumption of NAD+. To quantify the amount of NAD+ present in the reaction mixture following the cell-free DNA repair assay, [32P]NAD+ (32 nm) was added to the assay and the reaction mixtures were applied to a 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel (32Satoh M.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for quantification of labeled NAD+. Activation of PARP consumed 20% of the available NAD+, whereas addition of the 24-kDa fragment (200 pmol) resulted in only a negligible reduction in NAD+levels (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the 24-kDa fragment inhibits DNA repair and ADP-ribose formation by binding to and persisting on DNA breaks in competition with full-length PARP. In nuclei, PARP has been observed to associate with chromatin, particularly with actively transcribed regions; this association has been shown to occur by direct binding of PARP to transcribed RNA (14Fakan S. Leduc Y. Lamarre D. Brunet G. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Desnoyers S. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Exp.

Cell Res. 1991; 192: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that binding of PARP to RNA stem-loop structures reduces the rate of RNA elongation by RNA polymerase II and that formation of DNA breaks and subsequent automodification of PARP removes the transcriptionally inhibitory PARP molecules, thus up-regulating RNA synthesis (17Vispé S. Yung T.M.C. Ritchot J. Serizawa H. Satoh M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9886-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the 24-kDa fragment binds to RNA stem-loops, uniformly 32P-labeled synthetic stem-loop RNA was prepared by transcribing the TAR sequence from human immunodeficiency virus, type I (see “Materials and Methods”), and was mixed with either the 24-kDa fragment or PARP. As shown in Fig.4, PARP reduced the mobility of stem-loop RNA on a native polyacrylamide gel, generating a discrete band. The 24-kDa fragment also reduced the mobility of TAR stem-loop RNA (Fig.4), suggesting that the fragment, like full-leng"

It has been known that Egr-1 expression is down-regulated in many types of tumor tissues, including human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, and introduction of the Egr-1gene into HT1080 cells inhibits cell growth and tumorigenic potential. Trifluoperazine (TFP), a phenothiazine class calmodulin antagonist, is known to inhibit DNA synthesis and cell proliferation and potentially important in antitumor activities. To understand the regulatory mechanism of Egr-1, we investigated the effect of TFP on expression of Egr-1 in HT1080 cells. Herein, we report thatEgr-1 expression was increased by TFP in synergy with serum at the transcriptional level. Both the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN62 and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A enhanced TFP-dependent increase of Egr-1, suggesting that the Ca2+/calmodulindependent pathway plays a role in regulation of Egr-1 expression in HT1080 cells. The TFP-stimulated increase of the Egr-1 protein was preferentially inhibited by the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059. In addition, activation of human Egr-1 promoter and the transcriptional activation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 induced by TFP were inhibited both by pretreatment of PD98059 and by expression of the dominant-negative RasN17. These results indicate that the Ras/MEK/Erk/Elk-1 pathway is necessary for TFP-inducedEgr-1 expression. We propose that the calmodulin antagonist TFP stimulates Egr-1 gene expression by modulating Ras/MEK/Erk and activation of the Elk-1 pathway in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells.

Calmodulin is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that acts as a Ca2+mediator (1Cheung W.Y. Science. 1980; 207: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Ca2+-bound calmodulin regulates the activities of a large number of enzymes, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK)1 such as CaMK-II and CaMK-IV. Calmodulin is involved in the Ca2+-mediated regulation of gene expression and in the regulation of cellular proliferation process, including DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression (2Means A.R.

Pettett N.J. Dawson R.A. Owen R. Blackburn G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that calmodulin plays an important role in control of cell growth. It is now known that calmodulin antagonists are cytotoxic against tumor cells and can restore sensitivity to drug-resistant cells, thus addressing the possibility that calmodulin antagonists may be valuable chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of certain cancers (9Durham A.C. Walton J.M. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Hait W.N. Lazo J.S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1986; 4: 994-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, little information is available regarding the mechanisms responsible for regulation of cell growth by calmodulin antagonists. Trifluoperazine (TFP) is a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotic drug. TFP is a well known calmodulin antagonist that has been used for studying the function of calmodulin (11Weiss B. Levin R.M.

Previous reports have demonstrated that TFP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell proliferation and, thereby, is potentially an important antitumor agent, as well as having antipsychotic properties (13Naftalovich S.

Egr-1 preferentially binds to GC-rich regulatory elements with the consensus sequence of GCGGGGGCG or TCCTCCTCCTCC (16Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, stable expression ofEgr-1 inhibited cell proliferation and soft agar growth in NIH3T3 cells transformed with v-sis, indicating thatEgr-1 functions as a tumor suppressor (23Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TFP on expression of the tumor suppressorEgr-1 in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Our results revealed that treatment of cells with serum and TFP increased levels of both mRNA and the protein of Egr-1. The increment was associated with the increase of Egr-1 promoter activity through activation of the ternary complex factor (TCF) Elk-1. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, and LipofectAMINE 2000 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cyclosporin A, KN62, and ionomycin were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, and GF109203X were products of RBI (Natick, MA). Antibodies against Egr-1 and ERK were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Trans-activator plasmid pFA2-Elk1 (amino acids 307–427), which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147), and the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc, which contains five repeats of GAL4 binding elements and the luciferase gene, were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pCMV/β-gal plasmid and assay kits for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The cDNA probe for Egr-1 was provided by Dr. I. K. Lim of the Ajou University School of Medicine, South Korea. Cells were lysed in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (24Lee Y.H. Kim H.S. Pai J.-K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26842-26847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples (20 μg of each) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The blots were incubated with anti-Egr-1 antibodies and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK antibody for use as an internal control. In some experiments, the scanning densitometry was performed after exposure to x-ray film. The relative band intensities of Egr-1 and ERK1/2 in each lane were measured by quantitative scanning densitometer and image analysis software, Bio-1D version 97.04. Total RNA was isolated according to the methods described previously by Chomczymski and Sacchi (25Chomczymski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was separated on 1.2% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde in 0.02 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mmsodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, then transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the capillary method. Cross-linking was then performed by UV irradiation. The membrane was incubated overnight at 42 °C in Northern-Max hybridization solution (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) containing [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes. The probes used wereEgr-1 (the 1.4-kb-long EcoRI fragment purified from the pGEM/TIS8 plasmid) and GAPDH (the 0.5-kbXbaI-HindIII fragment from the pUC/GAPDH plasmid). The membranes were then washed with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature, 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min, and 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. For rehybridization, the probes were stripped from the membrane by boiling in 0.1× SSC/0.5% SDS. Human Egr-1promoter fragments (26Sakamoto K.M. Bardeleben C. Yates K.E. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar) spanning from nucleotides −668 to +1 and −454 to +1 were synthesized by PCR in a reaction containing 0.5 μg of human Egr-1 genomic clone TIS8 (obtained from ATCC) as a template with the following upstream primers: −668, 5′-CCCGCACTCCCggtaccCTCTCAC-3′, and −454, 5′-TCCCGGCTTggtaccAGGGAGGA-3′. A KpnI restriction site is indicated by lowercase letters. A single downstream primer (5′-CTCTCGaagcttCCCGGATCCGC-3′) containing a HindIII site, which is indicated by lowercase letters, was used in each PCR amplification. The PCR fragments were then digested with the restriction enzymes KpnI and HindIII. The fragments were extracted from the agarose gel and inserted into theKpnI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-basic luciferase-encoding reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid p-233egrLuc was constructed by digestion of p-688egrLuc with the restriction enzymes SacI and HindIII, followed by ligation into the pGL2 basic vector digested by SacI andHindIII. The resultant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HT1080 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For Egr-1 promoter analysis, HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. One day after seeding cells into 35-mm dishes (6 × 105 cells), the cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of 5′-deletion constructs of the Egr-1 promoter and 0.2 μg of pCMV/β-gal plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, mammalian expression vectors of dominant-active Ras61L, pZip/Ras61L, and dominant-negative RasN17, pMT/RasN17, (0.5 μg each) were included. For analysis of Elk-1 activity, pFA2-Elk1 (50 ng) and pFR-Luc (0.5 μg) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. Plasmid pCMV/β-gal was included to monitor the transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was maintained at 1–2 μg with an empty vector pCDNA3.0. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with TFP. Cells were harvested after 6–12 h of TFP treatment, and protein extracts were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing. 1–5 μg of protein was assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luminescence was measured using a luminometer model TD 2020 (Berthold, Tubingen, Germany). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by a ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity obtained from the same sample. It has been reported that stable expression of Egr-1 leads to decreased DNA synthesis and tumorigenesis in fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (23Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether inhibition of DNA synthesis by calmodulin antagonists is related to a gain in Egr-1 expression. Phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) was used as a positive control. When cells in the log phase were treated with TFP for 2 h, a slight increase in the amount of the Egr-1 protein was observed (Fig.1 A). Serum-starved cells showed a marginal increase in the Egr-1 protein level when the cells were treated with 20% serum. However, an increase was more evident in cells treated with 25 μm TFP. Costimulation with serum and TFP resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of Egr-1 expression. Another calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine (CPZ) also increased the level of the Egr-1 protein (Fig. 1 B). Reprobing the blots with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies revealed that similar amounts of proteins were present in all lanes. These results indicate that costimulation with serum and calmodulin antagonist has a synergistic effect on expression of Egr-1 in serum-starved HT1080 cells. To determine the effect of TFP on the increase in the Egr-1 expression level, HT1080 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, then treated with 20% serum in the presence of various concentrations of TFP. The Egr-1 protein was detected in cells treated with serum and 10 μm TFP. The protein level was markedly increased at a concentration of 50 μm TFP (Fig.2 A). When the effect of this concentration of TFP on cell viability was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay, the cell survival was about 50% of untreated control (data not shown). Time course studies showed that an increase in the Egr-1 protein level due to TFP was detected at 2 h with a continual increase through 3 h after addition of TFP (Fig. 2 B). Reprobing the blots with anti-ERK antibodies revealed that similar amounts of proteins were present in all lanes. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether the increase in the expression level of the Egr-1 protein due to TFP occurs at the mRNA level. The GAPDH mRNA level was used as an internal control. Expression of Egr-1 mRNA was markedly increased by treatment with 50 μm TFP (Fig.3 A). This result was consistent with results of Western blot analysis. Time course studies showed that the Egr-1 mRNA level was increased at 0.5 h after addition of serum and TFP with a maximum increase at 1 h, followed by a slow decline (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether TFP causes an increase in Egr-1 mRNA at the transcription level, we constructed a series of luciferase reporter plasmids containing serial deletions of 5′-flanking sequences and the TATA motif of the human Egr-1 promoter (26Sakamoto K.M. Bardeleben C. Yates K.E. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar). Each promoter-reporter construct was transfected with pCMV/β-gal for transfection efficiency into HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated without or with 50 μmTFP (Fig. 4). Results were expressed as -fold increases in luciferase activity normalized for β-galactosidase activity. The −668 and −454 constructs exhibited 20- and 14-fold increased luciferase activity, respectively, due to TFP treatment. A further deletion between −454 to −233 (p-233egrLuc), which removed the SRE cluster, displayed 4.2-fold increased promoter activity, suggesting that SRE cluster region is important for the promoter activity increment. These results indicate that TFP stimulatesEgr-1 gene expression at the transcription level. Calmodulin modulates the action of various calmodulin-binding proteins, including CaMK-II and calcineurin. Therefore, we investigated whether the Ca2+/CaM/CaMKII/calcineurin pathway is involved in TFP-dependent Egr-1 induction. HT1080 cells were treated in both the presence and absence of TFP with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and KN62, a selective inhibitor of CaMK-II. After exposure to x-ray film, the relative intensities of Egr-1 and ERK1/2 bands in each lane were determined by quantitative scanning densitometer. As shown in Fig.5 A, ionomycin alone had no effect on Egr-1 induction, whereas serum- and TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression was significantly attenuated by the addition of ionomycin. In addition, KN62 and cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor, enhanced TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression (Fig. 5,B and C). These results suggest that the Ca2+/CaM/CaMK-II pathway negatively regulates Egr-1 expression. It has been reported that calmodulin antagonists modulate protein kinase C (PKC) activity (27Kumar R. Holian O. Cook B. Roshani P. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and that the PKC activator PMA stimulates Egr-1 gene induction (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). We investigated the effect of PKC inhibitors on TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression. Serum-starved HT1080 cells were incubated with specific inhibitors of PKC (rottlerin and GF109203X) before addition of serum and TFP. Results showed that PKC inhibitors did not have any significant effect on TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression (Fig.6 A). To further determine the role of PKC, the effect of down-regulation of PKCs by prolonged treatment with high concentrations of PMA was examined (Fig.6 B). Down-regulation of PKCs was determined by Western blotting using anti-PKCα antibody. After prolonged treatment with 1 μm PMA, PKCα was no longer detected. Because Egr-1 was not efficiently induced by retreatment with 50 nm PMA, full suppression of PKC activity is indicated. Under these conditions, Egr-1 remained inducible by stimulation with serum and TFP (compared with control cells). These results demonstrate that PKCs are not involved in TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression. To determine the signal pathway involved in the TFP response, several kinase inhibitors were tested (Fig.7 A). Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), and PLC inhibitor (U73122) had no effect on Egr-1 expression due to serum and TFP. In contrast, PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, efficiently inhibited TFP-stimulated Egr-1 expression. For confirmation, the effect of PD98059 concentration dependence was examined (Fig. 7 B). Addition of increasing concentrations of PD98059 progressively lowered the level of Egr-1 expression due to serum and TFP, indicating that the MEK signaling cascade is required for TFP-dependent Egr-1 expression. To demonstrate that the Ras/MEK pathway responds to TFP-stimulated activation of theEgr-1 promoter, HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with a p-688egrLuc construct and either a dominant-negative mutant (pMT/RasN17) or a dominant-active mutant (pZip/Ras61L) of the Ha-Ras expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 7 C, TFP-stimulatedEgr-1 promoter activity was efficiently inhibited by dominant-negative RasN17 or by pretreatment with PD98059. However, the expression of dominant-active Ras61L continuously stimulatedEgr-1. These data indicate that the Ras/MEK pathway plays a role in TFP-dependent Egr-1 gene expression. To investigate whether TFP stimulates ERK, a downstream target of MEK, we first examined the kinetics of ERK activation in response to serum stimulation in HT1080 cells using antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. In a control experiment for ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation, quiescent 3Y1 fibroblasts treated with serum were included. HT1080 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, then treated with 20% serum for various times. Phosphorylation of ERK was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.8 A, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected after 30 min of serum stimulation in 3Y1 fibroblasts. In contrast, a relatively high level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in unstimulated HT1080 cells and a further increase of phosphorylation was not observed until 120 min after serum stimulation, demonstrating that ERK1/2 are continuously activated regardless of serum stimulation in HT1080 cells. These results are consistent with previous reports that HT1080 cells are classified as type III tumor cells with regard to the constitutive strong activation of 41- and 43-kDa MAPKs (28Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 B shows that serum and TFP had no effect on the increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by pretreatment with PD98059. Based on these observations we hypothesize that downstream of ERK1/2 is involved in activation of theEgr-1 promoter in response to TFP. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin negatively regulates the transcription activation of Elk-1 (29Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Serum-induced Egr-1 transcription is controlled through a serum response element (SRE), which binds a complex of the serum response factor and a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF). The TCF family includes Elk-1 (31Rao V.N. Huebner K. Isobe M. Ab-Rushidi A. Croce C.M. Reddy E.S.P. Science. 1989; 244: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Sap-1 (32Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and Sap-2/Net/Erp (33Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.-M. Sobieszcuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34Lopez M. Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Dendorfer U. Liberman T.A. Mol. Cell.

The classical Ras/MEK/ERK cascade is responsible for the phosphorylation of Elk-1, and Elk-1 phosphorylation by ERK correlates with increased transcription activation (36Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). To examine whether Elk-1 is involved in TFP-dependentEgr-1 expression, a pFA-Elk1 construct that encodes the fusion protein of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the activation domain of Elk-1 (amino acids 307–428) was transfected into HEK293T cells. pFR-Luc, which contains five repeats of the Gal4 binding element upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, was also transfected. This assay system allows direct assessment of Elk-1-mediated transcription activation in response to stimuli. When cells were treated with serum and TFP, activation of Elk-1 was observed, which was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig.9 A). In addition, TFP-stimulated Elk-1 activation was inhibited by expression of dominant-negative RasN17 (Fig. 9 B). Dominant-active Ras61L constitutively stimulated Elk-1 transactivation, which was partially inhibited by PD98059, confirming that MEK is necessary for TFP-stimulated Elk-1 activation. Together, these results support a model in which the calmodulin-dependent pathway stimulatesEgr-1 expression by modulating Ras/MEK/ERK/Elk-1 cascades. It is well known that Egr-1 is an immediate-early response transcription factor that is rapidly induced in many different cell types by a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and injurious stimuli (37Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although Egr-1 is rapidly expressed due to mitogenic signals, evidence is accumulating that suggests thatEgr-1 negatively regulates cell growth. Egr-1 is little or not expressed in a number of tumor cells, including breast carcinoma ZR-75-1, glioblastoma U251, osteosarcoma Saos-2, and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (23Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of antisenseEgr-1 mRNA in v-sis-transformed NIH3T3 cells leads to an enhanced transformed phenotype (38Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that loss of Egr-1 gene expression is important for tumorigenic potential. On the contrary, introduction of Egr-1 into HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells inhibits cell growth and tumorigenesis (21Levin W.J. Press M.F. Gaynor R.B. Sukhatme V.P. Boone T.C. Reissmann P.T. Figlin R.A. Holmes E.C. Souza L.M. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang R.-P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M.M. Mercola D. Adamson E. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar) by induction of transforming growth factor-β1, fibronectin, and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (20Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Liu C. Tao J. de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4400-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that Egr-1 does possess a growth suppressor activity. TFP is a calmodulin antagonist that binds to calmodulin and inhibits Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated enzyme activities. Calmodulin is a Ca2+-binding protein present in all eukaryotic cells that plays a role as a Ca2+ mediator (1Cheung W.Y. Science. 1980; 207: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that calmodulin is involved in regulation of cellular proliferation, and calmodulin antagonists offer the potential for new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of certain cancers. However, the mechanisms responsible for the antitumor activities of calmodulin antagonists remain to be determined. We found that the calmodulin antagonists TFP and CPZ stimulateEgr-1 gene expression in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Stimulation of Egr-1 expression by TFP was more evident in serum-starved HT1080 cells than in mid-log phase cells (Fig.1 A). We also found that costimulation with serum and TFP synergistically enhances Egr-1 expression by transcriptional events (Figs. 3 and 4). We hypothesize that serum-inducedEgr-1 transcription in HT1080 cells is suppressed by some unknown factors, and this repression can be reversed by treatment with calmodulin antagonists. To investigate whether the calmodulin-dependent pathway is involved in suppression of serum-induced Egr-1, we used the inhibitors KN62 (inhibitor of CaMKII) and cyclosporin A (inhibitor of calcineurin). In the presence of serum, TFP-mediated Egr-1 expression was decreased by treatment with calcium ionophore and ionomycin, whereas expression was enhanced by KN62 and cyclosporin A (Fig. 5). These data indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and calcineurin negatively regulate serum-stimulated Egr-1 expression in HT1080 cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have shown that expressions of Ca2+-inducedEgr-1 and c-fos are enhanced by inhibition of calcineurin with cyclosporin A in the PC12 and ELM-I-1 murine erythroleukemia cells types (40Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Fandrich A. Marquardt H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein phosphatase under the control of Ca2+/calmodulin (42Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is the main component of the calcium signaling pathway in T lymphocytes, regulating the translocation of transcription factor NF-AT by dephosphorylation (43Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). As it does in T cells, calcineurin may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in other cell types. It has been reported that activation of calcineurin inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced stimulation of the Ets family of transcription factor Elk-1 and plays a negative role in induction of c-fos transcription (30Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be established whether calmodulin/calcineurin constantly inhibits Elk-1 activity in HT1080 cells. It has been reported that expression of the Egr-1 gene in response to several mitogenic stimuli and the oncogene v-srcand v-raf is mediated primarily through the serum response elements (SREs) in the 5′-flanking region of the gene (44Qureshi S.A. Cao X.M. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10802-10806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Rim M. Qureshi S.A. Gius D. Nho J. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 1992; 10: 2065-2068Google Scholar, 46Rupprecht H.D. Sukhatme V.P. Lacy J. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F351-F360PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, the two transcription factors, serum response factor and ternary complex factor (TCF), form ternary complexes on the SRE and mediate transcription activation. Phosphorylation of TCF, including Elk-1, Sap-1, and Sap-2/Net/Erp, causes increased DNA binding and formation of ternary complexes and thereby plays a primary role in regulating early response gene expression, such as c-fos andEgr-1 (47Treisman R. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar, 48Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). It is well known that mitogens, including serum and growth factors, rapidly activate signal transduction pathways involving the Ras/MEk/ERK pathway. The classic Ras/MEK/ERK cascade is responsible for phosphorylation of Elk-1, which is a well characterized TCF. Elk-1 phosphorylation correlates well with increased transcription activation of c-fos and Egr-1 (36Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). We found that serum- and TFP-induced Egr-1 expression was inhibited efficiently by PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, but not by the PLC inhibitor U73122, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Fig. 7, A andB). We also found that TFP-dependent activation of the Egr-1 promoter was repressed by transient expression of the dominant-negative mutant of RasN17 and by pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig. 8 C). These findings indicate that the Ras/MEK cascades are necessary to activate Egr-1 expression due to serum and TFP. Elk-1 was activated by treatment with TFP, and TFP-stimulated Elk-1 trans-activation was inhibited by both PD98059 and the dominant-negative mutant RasN17 (Fig. 9). Because TFP did not directly activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 8 B), TFP probably acts downstream of ERK1/2, at least at the level of Elk-1. There is evidence that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin is a major phosphatase of Elk-1. Sugimoto et al. (29Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the Tian and Karin group (30Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that constitutive activated expression of calcineurin or activation of endogenous calcineurin by Ca2+ ionophore decreased epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of Elk-1 and that treatment with cyclosporin A prevented the effect of calcineurin on Elk-1 phosphorylation and Ca2+-induced c-fosinduction. These results are consistent with the idea that TFP acts upstream of calcineurin to participate in stimulation of Elk-1. Two other MAPKs, JNK and p38, are also reported to phosphorylate Elk-1 (26Sakamoto K.M. Bardeleben C. Yates K.E. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar,49Price M.A. Crualegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although the present data did not preclude the possible involvement of JNK and p38 pathways in TFP-mediated Elk-1 activation, the efficient inhibition of TFP-mediated Elk-1 activation by the dominant-negative RasN17 and PD98059 (Fig. 9) indicates that calcineurin is the major target of TFP, because it is known that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 does not directly inhibit JNK or p38 activity. We suggest that the calmodulin antagonist TFP stimulates Egr-1gene induction via modulation of the Ras/MEK/ERK/Elk-1 cascade. Thus, the convergence of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway and the MEK/ERK/Elk-1 cascades coordinates suppression of Egr-1 gene expression in HT1080 cells. It has been reported that mutation of the ras oncogene is commonly found in a variety of human tumors, and it is now clear that mutated ras expression plays a pivotal role in controlling neoplastic transformation. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the constitutive activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway in a mutated Ras-mediated malignant transformation (28Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 50Paterson H. Reeves B. Brown R. Hall A. Furth M. Bos J. Jones P. Marshall C. Cell. 1987; 51: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, a point mutation at codon 61 of N-Ras that converts Gln61 to Lys61 has been found, which may be needed to transform these cells to transformation states (51Brown R. Marshall C.J. Penne S.G. Hall A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). If loss of Egr-1 expression plays a role in the transformed state of HT1080 cells (23Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar) and the transformation states (51Brown R. Marshall C.J. Penne S.G. Hall A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). If loss of Egr-1expression plays a role in the transformed state of HT1080 cells (23Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar) and the classic Ras/MEK/ERK pathway mediates the transcription activation of Egr-1 via Elk-1, howEgr-1 is down-regulated in oncogenic Ras-expressed HT1080 cells is still unknown. One intriguing possibility is negative feedback regulation of Egr-1 expression by oncogenic Ras. In this regard, several studies have demonstrated that oncogenic Ras is involved in negative feedback suppression mechanisms as part of the regulation of redundant incoming signals (52Rake J.B. Quinones M.A. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5348-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Vaziri C. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6582-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that expression of activated Ras negatively regulates calcium-dependent c-fos andEgr-1 gene induction in lymphocytes. They also found that the negative effect of Ras on Egr-1 and c-fosgene induction by calcium is abolished by pretreatment with cyclosporin A, indicating involvement of calcineurin in oncogenic Ras-mediated negative feedback regulation. Recently, Sugimoto et al. (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that a kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) specifically blocks epidermal growth factor and Ras-induced transcription activation of all members of the TCF family, including Elk-1, Sap1a, and Sap2, without affecting the MAPK activity. Moreover, they found that the effect of KSR on the inhibition of Elk-1 transcription activation is mediated by accumulation of dephosphorylated Elk-1 via the action of calcineurin. Based on these reports, one can speculate that KSR plays a critical role in suppressing expression of tumor suppressor Egr-1, thereby promoting Ras-induced transformation in HT1080 cells. In future studies it will be of interest to examine the possible roles of KSR in the progression of Ras-induced transformation. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that Egr-1 transcription can be regulated by other proteins that are sensitive to oncogenic Ras expression. Our study demonstrates that TFP as a calmodulin antagonist synergistically stimulates induction of tumor suppressorEgr-1 gene expression in the presence of serum in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. TFP probably plays a role in modulating Ras/MEK/ERK/Elk-1 cascades, presumably through inhibition of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway. It will be of interest to determine whether TFP-mediated Elk-1 activation of transcription through SRE is the only pathway by which TFP induces expression of SRE-regulated genes. The use of calmodulin antagonists may provide a useful approach to suppression of neoplastic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2068953709,"(6R)-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4) is the rate-limiting cofactor in the production of catecholamine and indoleamine neurotransmitters and is also essential for the synthesis of nitric oxide by nitric-oxide synthase. We have previously reported that BH4 administration induces PC12 cell proliferation and that nerve growth factor- or epidermal growth factor-induced PC12 cell proliferation requires the elevation of intracellular BH4 levels. We show here that BH4accelerates apoptosis in undifferentiated PC12 cells deprived of serum and in differentiated neuron-like PC12 cells after nerve growth factor withdrawal. Increased production of catecholamines or nitric oxide cannot account for the enhancement of apoptosis by BH4. Furthermore, increased calcium influx by exogenous BH4administration is not involved in the BH4 proapoptotic effect. Our data also argue against the possibility that increased oxidative stress, due to BH4 autoxidation, is responsible for the observed BH4 effects. Instead, they are consistent with the hypothesis that BH4 induces apoptosis by increasing cell cycle progression. Elevation of intracellular BH4 during serum withdrawal increased c-Myc (and especially Myc S) expression earlier than serum withdrawal alone. Furthermore,N-acetylcysteine and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor olomoucine ameliorated the BH4proapoptotic effect. These data suggest that BH4 affects c-Myc expression and cell cycle-dependent events, possibly accounting for its effects on promoting cell cycle progression or apoptosis.

Science. 1997; 275: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), suggesting that lack of trophic support could contribute to the observed neurodegeneration in normal aging and in PD. Furthermore, morphological characteristics of apoptotic cell death have been reported in brain sections from PD patients (7Mochizuki H. Goto K. Mori H. Mizuno Y. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 137: 120-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 8Anglade P. Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar), but the involvement of apoptosis in PD is still controversial. PC12 cells have been extensively used as a model of catecholaminergic neurons in culture as well as for the study of neuronal apoptotic death. Naive (undifferentiated) PC12 cells grown in the presence of serum undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal (9Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PC12 cells that become neuronally differentiated and postmitotic following prolonged incubation with NGF undergo apoptosis upon NGF and serum withdrawal (9Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated PC12 cell death upon serum withdrawal has been linked to an inappropriate progression through the cell cycle, while apoptotic death of “neuronal” PC12 cells following NGF withdrawal was linked to illegitimate cell cycle reentry (12Rubin L.L. Gatchalian C.L. Rimon G. Brooks S.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Freeman R.S. Estus S. Johnson Jr., E.M.

This interpretation favors the hypothesis that during normal cell growth trophic factors are required for proper cell cycle progression, and in their absence cells die as they try to progress through the cell cycle. We have previously reported that (6R)-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4) enhances PC12 cell growth by inducing cell cycle progression rather than cell survival (16Anastasiadis P.Z. States J.C. Imerman B.A. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar, 17Anastasiadis P.Z. Bezin L. Imerman B. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BH4 is known for its role as an essential and rate-limiting cofactor in the synthesis of catecholamine and indoleamine neurotransmitters (18Brenneman A.R. Kaufman S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 17: 177-183Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Lovenberg W. Jequier E. Sjoerdsma A. Science. 1967; 155: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide (20Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the induction of PC12 cell proliferation by BH4 was not mediated by catecholamine or nitric oxide synthesis (16Anastasiadis P.Z. States J.C. Imerman B.A. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar, 21Anastasiadis P.Z. Imerman B. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Pteridines. 1995; 6: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In addition, the induction of PC12 cell proliferation after a 24-h exposure to epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor (NGF) required the elevation of intracellular BH4 and activation of its initial biosynthetic enzyme, GTP cyclohydrolase (17Anastasiadis P.Z. Bezin L. Imerman B. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since BH4 enhanced PC12 cell cycle progression and mediated the proliferative effect of NGF, we tested its effects on apoptotic death of naive and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells and the effects on NGF-mediated PC12 cell survival. Rat PC12 cells were maintained in tissue culture flasks as previously described (16Anastasiadis P.Z. States J.C. Imerman B.A. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing cells were harvested by mechanical dislodging, and after centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue (0.01%) exclusion, and cells were resuspended to the desired final density in the appropriate medium and replated. 24 h later, test conditions were added to the medium. Apoptosis was induced by serum withdrawal. 24 h following plating of nonsynchronized, logarithmically growing PC12 cells in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (7 × 106cells/flask), cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were also treated for 24 h with test conditions in serum-free medium. PC12 cells were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (1 × 106 cells/flask) and incubated for 8 days in reduced serum medium (DMEM (−); without fetal bovine serum and containing only 1% heat-inactivated horse serum) containing 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF. After 8 days, apoptotic death was induced by NGF withdrawal. Cells were washed twice with DMEM (−) (without NGF) and incubated for 24 h in DMEM (−) medium without NGF containing a 1:2000 dilution of anti-NGF antibody (Sigma catalog no. N5142). At this concentration, the antibody completely blocked neurite outgrowth following a 3-day NGF treatment. The effect of various treatments on apoptotic death was tested by incubating cells for 24 h in the presence of test compounds in DMEM (−) containing anti-NGF antibody. Cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks (7 × 106 cells/flask), equilibrated for 24 h, incubated in test conditions (10.36 × 106 cells/flask) for 24 h, and dislodged with trypsin. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium; cell number was determined by direct counting using a hemacytometer. In some cases, cell number was estimated by the use of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous cell proliferation assay by Promega. Control experiments verified that color formation was dependent on cell number and was not affected by intracellular BH4 or other treatments. In contrast, intracellular BH4 levels affected color formation when the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-based CellTiter 96-cell proliferation assay (Promega) was used. Results with the colorimetric assay were verified by direct cell counting. PC12 cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemacytometer as described earlier. Soluble, cytoplasmic DNA was extracted routinely from 4 × 106 cells or in certain cases (to better resolve DNA laddering) from 8 × 106 cells, run on agarose gels, and visualized as previously described (22Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Control experiments excluded the possibility that genomic DNA fragmentation occurred during cell counting. Similarly, trypsinization did not adversely affect laddering, since identical results were obtained when cytoplasmic DNA was directly extracted from plated cells and controlled later for total protein levels. PC12 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish), and 24 h later, cells were treated with test conditions for an additional 24 h. Tritiated methyl thymidine incorporation was measured as previously described (23Dicker P. Rozengurt E. Nature. 1980; 287: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 15 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and test conditions were added. Following a 24-h incubation, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in the medium as a measure of total dead, burst cells using a kit from Promega (Cytotox 96). The results represent extracellular LDH activity and were expressed as a percentage of the total LDH activity in the well. In some cases, cytotoxicity was also measured by the total amount of double-stranded DNA released in the culture medium during incubation with test conditions. PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used for double-stranded DNA quantitation as previously described (17Anastasiadis P.Z. Bezin L. Imerman B. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide generation was monitored both in vitro and in PC12 cell medium in the presence or absence of BH4 by dichlorofluorescin oxidation and subsequent spectrophotometric analysis according to Royall and Ischiropoulos (24Royall J. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured in test conditions for appropriate incubation times and harvested at indicated times (1.5–24 h) by trypsinization. After cell counting, lysates were obtained by sonication at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% aprotinin. Proteins (50 μl equivalent to 625,000 cells) were electrophoretically separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% separating, 4% stacking) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA 85; Schleicher & Schuell). Immunodetection was performed by blocking in TBST (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat dry milk, incubating with affinity-purified anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length murine c-Myc (provided by Dr. S. R. Hann) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Control experiments established that trypsinization did not adversely affect c-Myc protein levels or cleavage, since identical results were obtained when cell lysates were controlled for total protein content (without trypsinization) rather than cell number. We initially tested the effect of BH4 on serum withdrawal-induced PC12 apoptotic cell death. To selectively enhance intracellular BH4 levels and minimize degradation of BH4 in the culture medium, we routinely treated PC12 cells with sepiapterin. Sepiapterin enters the cells readily and is converted to BH4 intracellularly through the sequential actions of sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate reductase (salvage BH4 biosynthetic pathway) (16Anastasiadis P.Z. States J.C. Imerman B.A. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nichol C.A. Lee C.L. Edelstein M.P. Chao J.Y. Duch D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Incubation of PC12 cells for 24 h in the absence of serum induces DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1) as reported previously (9Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular BH4 levels with sepiapterin enhances DNA fragmentation (soluble DNA was extracted from an equal number of cells in all cases), resulting in characteristic DNA laddering, one of the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death (Fig.1 A). A range of sepiapterin concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 μm) were then tested for their effect on DNA fragmentation, and, as depicted in Fig. 1 B, increasing concentrations of sepiapterin resulted in proportional increases in DNA fragmentation. We next tested whether inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis could block fragmentation following serum withdrawal. Diaminohydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase (26Gal E.M. Nelson J.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Tsubokura S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. Brain Res. 1988; 446: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the first enzyme in de novo BH4biosynthetic pathway (25Nichol C.A. Lee C.L. Edelstein M.P. Chao J.Y. Duch D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Enzyme. 1987; 38: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), did not alter the serum withdrawal effect on DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained with N-acetylserotonin (NAS) (28Milstien S. Kaufman S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase, which is the last enzyme in de novoBH4 biosynthesis (25Nichol C.A. Lee C.L. Edelstein M.P. Chao J.Y. Duch D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Milstien S. Kaufman S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To explain why inhibitors of BH4 synthesis did not alter DNA fragmentation following serum withdrawal, we considered the possibility that inhibition of endogenous BH4 prevents the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by nitric-oxide synthase, which can protect PC12 cells from apoptosis (30Farinelli S.E. Park D.S. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2325-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Teng K.K. Esposito D.K. Schwartz G.D. Landers H.M. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37315-37320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Kim S.S. Han J.A. Yoo Y.M. Kim K.M. Lee G.H. Yun H.Y. Green A. Li J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6740-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed an increase in DNA fragmentation by inhibiting NO synthesis (discussed in detail below). In preliminary studies, the minimum dose of sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor) able to protect against apoptotic DNA fragmentation following serum withdrawal was reduced 10-fold from 100 to 10 μm in the presence of 1 mm DAHP. These data suggest that inhibition of endogenous BH4 affects PC12 cell survival by at least two pathways; it inhibits the proapoptotic BH4 effects but at the same time blocks the antiapoptotic effects of NO. Thus, it is possible that the lack of an effect on DNA fragmentation with BH4 biosynthetic inhibitors is due to the concomitant inhibition of NO synthesis. We then tested whether BH4 enhances serum withdrawal-induced cell death via a caspase-dependent pathway. Previous studies have established a role for cysteine proteases (caspases) in the apoptotic death of PC12 cells (32Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Kim S.S. Han J.A. Yoo Y.M. Kim K.M. Lee G.H. Yun H.Y. Green A.

Fig. 1 D shows that the sepiapterin-induced enhancement of DNA fragmentation is completely blocked by zVAD-fmk, a caspase inhibitor, which is thought to inhibit apoptotic cell death induced by either withdrawal of trophic support or oxidative stress in PC12 cells (36Park D.S. Morris E.J. Stefanis L. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trophic factors also reverse the BH4 effect, since NGF (50 ng/ml) treatment eliminated DNA fragmentation induced by serum withdrawal in the presence or absence of sepiapterin (Fig. 1,C and D). Incubation of PC12 cells for 24 h in serum-free medium caused a reduction of cell number to ∼50% of control (Fig.2 A). Sepiapterin did not significantly affect cell counts compared with serum-deprived medium alone, whereas NGF treatment partially reversed the effect of serum withdrawal. Both NAS and DAHP, inhibitors of de novo BH4 biosynthesis (26Gal E.M. Nelson J.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki S. Watanabe Y. Tsubokura S. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. Brain Res. 1988; 446: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Milstien S. Kaufman S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), also increased PC12 cell survival after 24 h of serum withdrawal in an apparent contradiction with prior DNA fragmentation results (Fig.1 C). Finally, N-ω-nitroarginine, an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (37Gross S.S. Jaffe E.A. Levi R. Kilbourn R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), did not affect death by serum withdrawal at a concentration that totally blocks NO production and NGF-induced neurite formation (38Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These results suggest that inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis can protect from or delay apoptotic death but fail to demonstrate an elevation in cell death following sepiapterin treatment. Since enhancement of DNA fragmentation is likely to be an irreversible effect and has been shown to be a relatively late event in the progression of apoptotic PC12 cell death (10Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we expected that elevation of intracellular BH4 would also increase cell death. To further explore this possibility, we tested the activity of extracellular LDH as a measure of total cell death during the 24-h incubation period. Extracellular LDH activity was expressed as percentage of total activity (both in the medium and in living cells), which represents the death of cells that have released LDH following loss of membrane integrity. In control experiments, the presence of serum (but not NGF or other treatments) altered LDH activity, and for this reason the effects of test compounds on extracellular LDH accumulation were controlled against the NGF protective effect in the absence of serum. At 24 h, extracellular LDH activity was increased to 28% following serum withdrawal as compared with 17% of control (50 ng/ml NGF in serum-free medium; Fig. 2 B). LDH activity was further increased to 56% by sepiapterin treatment, indicating that increased intracellular BH4 indeed enhances PC12 cell death. Incubation with NAS protected PC12 cells from the serum withdrawal effects on cell death, while in combination with NGF, NAS further potentiated the NGF protective effect. These results were verified by measuring total DNA in the medium as another indication of cytotoxicity (data not shown) and are in agreement with the previous results on DNA fragmentation. The fact that sepiapterin significantly increased cell death (LDH results) without decreasing the number of intact cells when compared with serum deprivation alone (Fig. 2 A) indicates that total cell number (intact and burst) increased upon BH4treatment, suggesting that BH4 can induce cell proliferation in the absence of serum. To test whether BH4increases the number of dying PC12 cells following serum withdrawal or accelerates the death of already committed or sensitive cells, we tested LDH accumulation following 48 h in test conditions (Fig.2 B). Sepiapterin treatment of serum-deprived PC12 cells for 48 h did not alter extracellular LDH activity when compared with serum deprivation alone, suggesting that BH4 accelerates the death of cells that are already predisposed to death under conditions of serum withdrawal. NAS still protected cells from death and potentiated the NGF trophic effect at 48 h. Incubation of PC12 cells for 3 days in serum-free medium results in the selection of growth-arrested, apoptosis-resistant PC12 cells (40Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subsequent treatment of these cells with sepiapterin for an additional 24 h caused a dose-dependent increase in cell number evidenced by the use of a colorimetric cell proliferation/cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 2 C). This result strongly suggests that BH4 can induce cell proliferation in the absence of serum. PC12 cells that have acquired a neuron-like phenotype and are postmitotic following a prolonged treatment with NGF undergo apoptotic cell death following NGF withdrawal (9Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, DNA fragmentation is enhanced 24 h after NGF withdrawal, and this effect is markedly enhanced by elevation of intracellular BH4 with sepiapterin. In addition, inhibition of the intracellular conversion of sepiapterin to BH4 by NAS blocked the sepiapterin effect, while DAHP, which inhibits onlyde novo BH4 synthesis and does not block conversion of sepiapterin to BH4, had no effect on sepiapterin's proapoptotic effect. DAHP and, to a lesser extent, NAS protected neuronal PC12 cells from DNA fragmentation following NGF withdrawal and further potentiated the NGF protective effect. The effect of sepiapterin on DNA fragmentation was blocked by continued NGF treatment. Fig. 3 also shows the effects of actinomycin D (which inhibits DNA transcription) on neuron-like PC12 cell DNA fragmentation. Actinomycin D protected neuron-like PC12 cells both from NGF withdrawal-induced and sepiapterin-potentiated DNA fragmentation, indicating that active DNA transcription is required for the sepiapterin effect on neuron-like PC12 cell death. Similar experiments under serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis failed to show a protective effect and rather resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity both for control (as reported previously) (41Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for sepiapterin treated cells 2P. Z. Anastasiadis, H. Jiang, L. Bezin, D. M. Kuhn, and R. A. Levine, unpublished results. in the presence of actinomycin D. Total cell counts following NGF withdrawal-induced apoptotic death were also tested. After 24 h of NGF withdrawal, the PC12 cell number dropped to 60% of control (NGF-treated cells), whereas the addition of sepiapterin, in the absence of NGF, only produced a decrease to 80% of control (not shown). Despite the increased cell number in sepiapterin-treated cells when compared with cells subjected to NGF withdrawal alone, extracellular soluble DNA accumulation during the 24-h incubation was significantly elevated in sepiapterin-treated cells (data not shown). These data are also consistent with an increase in cellular proliferation following sepiapterin treatment (16Anastasiadis P.Z. States J.C. Imerman B.A. Louie M.C. Kuhn D.M. Levine R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 149-155PubMed Google Scholar), accompanied by an acceleration of apoptotic cell death in sensitive cells. Finally, both cell counts and total DNA levels verified that NAS and DAHP fully protect neuron-like PC12 cells from NGF withdrawal-induced apoptotic death. Since toxic effects resulting from NO production and catecholamine accumulation have been reported (42Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci.

https://openalex.org/W1965573041,"The clinical manifestations of type 1 glycogen storage disease (GSD-1) in patients deficient in the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) system (e.g. growth retardation, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and renal dysfunction) are shared by Hnf1α−/− mice deficient of a transcriptional activator, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α). However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. The G6Pase system, essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, is comprised of glucose 6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) and G6Pase. G6PT translocates G6P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where it is metabolized by G6Pase to glucose and phosphate. Deficiencies in G6Pase and G6PT cause GSD-1a and GSD-1b, respectively.Hnf1α−/− mice also develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus caused by defective insulin secretion. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is a molecular link between HNF1α deficiency and function of the G6Pase system. Transactivation studies revealed that HNF1α is required for transcription of the G6PT gene. Hepatic G6PT mRNA levels and microsomal G6P transport activity are also markedly reduced in Hnf1α−/− mice as compared withHnf1α+/+ andHnf1α+/− littermates. On the other hand, hepatic G6Pase mRNA expression and activity are up-regulated inHnf1α−/− mice, consistent with observations that G6Pase expression is increased in diabetic animals. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that metabolic abnormalities in HNF1α-null mice are caused in part by G6PT deficiency and by perturbations of the G6Pase system. The clinical manifestations of type 1 glycogen storage disease (GSD-1) in patients deficient in the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) system (e.g. growth retardation, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and renal dysfunction) are shared by Hnf1α−/− mice deficient of a transcriptional activator, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α). However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. The G6Pase system, essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, is comprised of glucose 6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) and G6Pase. G6PT translocates G6P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where it is metabolized by G6Pase to glucose and phosphate. Deficiencies in G6Pase and G6PT cause GSD-1a and GSD-1b, respectively.Hnf1α−/− mice also develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus caused by defective insulin secretion.

We show that HNF1α binds to the G6PT promoter and is required for activation of G6PT gene transcription. Further, we show that hepatic G6PT mRNA expression in Hnf1α−/−mice is markedly reduced, resulting in a near abolishment of microsomal G6P transport activity. These data indicate thatHnf1α−/− mice, similar to GSD-1b patients, are deficient in the G6PT. Hnf1α−/− mice also develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (6Lee Y.-H Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) caused by defective insulin secretion and β-cell glycolytic signaling (15Pontoglio M. Sreenan S. Roe M.

In animal models of diabetes, G6Pase mRNA expression and enzymatic activity are increased, resulting in an elevation in hepatic glucose production (21Liu Z. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,22Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, rats overexpressing the G6Pase gene exhibit several metabolic abnormalities associated with NIDDM, including glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia (23Trinh E.Y. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Insulin has been shown to inhibit G6Pase gene transcription, and this effect is mediated through a cluster of insulin-response elements in theG6Pase promoter (24Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S.

Further, HNF1α is required for maximal repression of G6Pase gene transcription by insulin (25Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, our data indicate that metabolic abnormalities inHnf1α−/− mice are caused in part by perturbation of the G6Pase system. The G6PT promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene constructs were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using the G6PT gene (26Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as the template. The 3′ primer for the G6PT 5′ deletion mutants consisted of nucleotides −21 to −1, and the 5′ primers consisted of nucleotides −609 to −589, −200 to −180, and −152 to −132. Each primer contained an additional HindIII or XbaI site at the 5′-end. After digestion with HindIII andXbaI, the amplified fragments were inserted upstream of the bacterial CAT gene of a modified promoter- and enhancer-less pCAT-Basic-N plasmid (27Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 46: 14096-14106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The G6PT(−200/−1M)CAT construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a pair of primers (nucleotides −172 to −149) that contain TAA→GGG mutations at nucleotides −163/−161. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The pSVCAT, which contains both the SV40 enhancer and promoter and pCAT-Basic-N plasmids were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Additionally, we constructed G6PTpromoter-CAT constructs in the reverse orientation, G6PT(−1/−609)CAT, and showed that it directed no CAT expression (data not shown). HepG2 human hepatoma cells were grown at 37 °C in α-modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with theG6PT promoter-CAT constructs by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate method as previously described (27Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 46: 14096-14106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was assayed by incubating total cellular protein in a buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 4 mm acetyl coenzyme A, and 0.1 μCi [14C]chloramphenicol (56 μCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The acetylated compounds were separated from chloramphenicol by thin-layer chromatography (95% chloroform, 5% methanol; v/v) on silica gel IB2 (Gilman Sciences). Spots were quantitated on an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System (San Diego, CA). HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (28Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). End-labeled oligonucleotide probes (2 ng; 0.2–0.5 × 106 cpm) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in binding reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.4–1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 3 μg of nuclear extracts. Following binding, the mixture was electrophoresed through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. For competition experiments, competitor DNA was incubated in the mixture prior to the addition of probe. For gel supershift assays, specific antisera were preincubated with HepG2 extracts at 4 °C for 20 min before the addition of probe. Hnf1α−/−mice were generated byCre-loxP-mediated deletion to remove exon 1 of theHnf1α gene (6Lee Y.-H Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All animal studies were conducted under an animal protocol approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method, fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to a Nytran membrane by electroblotting. The membranes were hybridized to cDNA probes for G6Pase, G6PT, or β-actin. Phosphohydrolase assays were performed as previously described (4Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact microsomes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by preincubating microsomal preparations at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C, a condition that inactivates the thermally labile G6Pase. G6P uptake measurements were performed as previously described (26Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate, which abolished G6P uptake, were used as negative controls. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the GraphPad Prism Program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To determine whether HNF1α regulatesG6PT gene expression, we analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the gene and identified a HNF1 motif at nucleotides −165 to −153 followed by a TATA-box at nucleotides −141 to −136 upstream of the translation start site at +1 (Fig.1 A). To determine whether HNF1α activates transcription of the G6PT gene, we examined expression of the CAT gene directed by theG6PT promoter. Whereas both G6PT(−609/−1)CAT and G6PT(−200/−1)CAT constructs directed significant levels of CAT expression, CAT activity was found to be barely detectable with the G6PT(−152/−1)CAT construct (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that nucleotides −200 to −1 constitute a minimal G6PTpromoter, which contains an activating element at nucleotides −200 to −153 encompassing the HNF1 motif (−165/−153). To demonstrate whether HNF1α is the protein factor that binds to this activating element, electromobility shift assays were performed using HepG2 nuclear extracts. A protein-DNA complex, C1, was formed between the G6PT(−173/−145) oligo and HepG2 extracts (Fig.2 A, lane 2). The formation of complex C1 was efficiently blocked by the addition of an excess of unlabeled target DNA (lanes 3–5) and by an oligonucleotide containing the HNF1 motif (lanes 6–8), but not by an unrelated HNF4 (lane 21) and C/EBP oligonucleotide (lane 22). An HNF1-M1 oligonucleotide containing a mutated HNF1 site (TAA→GGG) had markedly reduced ability to block complex C1 formation (lanes 9–13) and an HNF1-M2 oligonucleotide that disrupts the entire DNA binding motif (TAA→GGG and TAA→GGG conversions) was completely incapable of blocking complex C1 formation (lanes 14–18). Further, an antiserum to HNF1α (lane 19), but not HNF1β (lane 20), caused a shift in the mobility of complex C1, demonstrating that a protein factor in this complex is HNF1α. To determine whether binding of HNF1α to the G6PT promoter activates gene transcription, we examined CAT expression after cotransfecting G6PT promoter-CAT fusion genes with pBJ5 or pBJ5-HNF1α. HNF1α elicited a 9.2-fold increase in CAT expression directed by the G6PT(−200/−1)CAT construct (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, HNF1α elicited only a 3.8-fold increase in CAT activity directed by G6PT(−200/−1M)CAT, which contains a mutated HNF1 site (TAA→GGG conversion at nucleotides −163 to −161). Moreover, CAT expression directed by G6PT(−200/−1M)CAT was also markedly reduced when compared with G6PT(−200/−1)CAT in the absence of a cotransfected HNF1α (Fig. 2 B). Thus, our data indicate that HNF1α binds to its cognate site within the promoter and activatesG6PT gene transcription. Sequence analysis also predicts the presence of a binding site for HNF3 at nucleotides −62 to −56 and a C/EBP motif at nucleotides −50 to −42 of the G6PT promoter (Fig. 1 A). HNF3 belongs to the forkhead or winged helix family of transcription factors (29Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,30Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that HNF3γ is required for transcription of the G6Pase gene (27Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 46: 14096-14106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The C/EBP family belongs to the bZIP class of transcription factors that contain a basic DNA-binding region adjacent to a leucine zipper dimerization domain (31Johnson P.F. Mcknight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 32Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The roles of HNF3 and C/EBP in G6PT gene transcription are currently under investigation. The vital role of HNF1α in transactivation of theG6PT gene and the clinical features common to both GSD-1 patients and Hnf1α−/− mice suggest that the expression of the G6PT gene is likely to be perturbed in these mice. We therefore examined G6PT mRNA expression in the liver of Hnf1α−/− mice by Northern blot analysis. The results show that the levels of hepatic G6PT mRNA were markedly reduced in Hnf1α−/− mice as compared with their wild-type and heterozygous littermates (Fig.3). Additionally, whereas hepatic microsomes isolated from Hnf1α+/+ orHnf1α+/− mice actively transported G6P, G6P uptake activities in intact hepatic microsomes fromHnf1α−/− animals were markedly reduced (Fig.4), confirming that G6P transport function of G6PT is impaired in Hnf1α−/−mice.Figure 4Uptake of [U-14C] G6P into liver microsomes ofHnf1α+/+,Hnf1α+/− andHnf1α−/− mice.

In this study, we show that levels of hepatic G6Pase mRNA were increased by 2- to 6-fold in Hnf1α−/−mice (Fig. 3), resulting in an increase in G6Pase enzymatic activity in deoxycholate-disrupted microsomes where the G6PT function is not required (Table I). The results suggest that HNF1α is not required for transcription of the G6Pasegene in vivo. On the other hand, the results are consistent with observations that G6Pase expression is increased in diabetic animals (21Liu Z. Barrett E.J. Dalkin A.C. Zwart A.D. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemically, G6Pase activity in intact hepatic microsomes of GSD-1b patients, deficient in G6PT, is low or nondetectable, consistent with a functional G6Pase deficiency manifested by these patients. On the other hand, high levels of G6Pase activity were detected in disrupted hepatic microsomes of GSD-1b patients where G6PT function was abolished. The difference in G6Pase enzymatic activity in intact versus disrupted microsomes is best evaluated by measuring the G6Pase latency value, defined as the portion of enzymatic activity that is not expressed unless the microsomes are disrupted (33Nordlie R.C.

Chem. 1980; 255: 8381-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent G6PT deficiency manifested by Hnf1α−/− mice prompted us to characterize the G6Pase system in these mice. As expected, G6Pase activity in intact hepatic microsomes ofHnf1α−/− mice was only 53% of that found inHnf1α+/+ or Hnf1α+/−mice (Table I). Moreover, hepatic G6Pase latency value was 87.9% inHnf1α−/− mice, which was markedly higher than the value of 41.7% found inHnf1α+/+/Hnf1α+/−mice (Table I). Taken together, these results indicate thatHnf1α−/− mice, like GSD-1b patients, are deficient in the G6PT. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms of phenotypic similarities between GSD-1 patients deficient in the G6Pase system (1Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L.

We demonstrate thatHnf1α−/− mice, like GSD-1b patients, are deficient in G6PT, an ER-associated membrane protein that translocates G6P from cytoplasm to the lumen of ER and a member of the G6Pse system required for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis (1Chen Y.-T.

Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results establish for the first time a molecular link between the common phenotypes of GSD-1 and Hnf1α−/− mice. Further, we show that the expression of the G6Pase gene is also perturbed in Hnf1α−/− mice. G6PT, encoded by a single copy gene located on human chromosome 11q23 (35Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Mansfield B.C. Lei K.-J. Ubagai T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Moses S.W. Parvari R. Hershkovitz E. Mandel H. Frydman M. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 400-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), is expressed in nearly all tissues examined, including liver, kidney, pancreas, and digestive tract (36Lin B. Hiraiwa H. Annabi B. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that nucleotides −200 to −1 upstream of the translation start site constitute a minimal G6PT promoter and HNF1α is required for transcription of the G6PT gene. The minimalG6PT promoter contains an activating element at nucleotides −200 to −153 encompassing the HNF1 motif at nucleotides −165 to −153. We show that HNF1α activates transcription of theG6PT gene following binding to its cognate site. Consistent with this, hepatic G6PT mRNA expression was inhibited and microsomal G6P transport function in the liver was impaired inHnf1α−/− mice. In GSD-1b patients, deficiency in G6PT results in an increase in hepatic G6Pase latency values (34Lange A.J. Arion W.J. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8381-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, G6Pase latency values inHnf1α−/− mice are also markedly increased. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the G6PT function inHnf1α−/− mice is impaired, resulting in a phenotype that closely resembles that of GSD-1b. In addition to functional G6Pase deficiency, GSD-1b patients suffer additional infectious complications because of heritable neutropenia and functional deficiencies of neutrophils and monocytes (37Beaudet A.L. Anderson D.C. Michels V.V. Arion W.J. Lange A.J. J. Pediatr. 1980; 97: 906-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), clinical features not associated with Hnf1α−/− mice. The results of a recent study showed that GSD-1b patients carrying either a homozygous splicing (794G→A) mutation or heterozygous G339D and R415X mutations suffer no impairment in their polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions (38Kure S. Hou D.-C. Suzuki Y. Yamagishi A. Hiratsuka M. Fukuda T. Sugie H. Kondo N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. J. Pediat. 2000; 137: 253-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 794G→A mutation was shown to be leaky because the mutated G6PT gene of the patient directed the expression of both mature and truncated G6PT transcripts (38Kure S. Hou D.-C. Suzuki Y. Yamagishi A. Hiratsuka M. Fukuda T. Sugie H. Kondo N. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. J. Pediat. 2000; 137: 253-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Likewise, the R415X mutation was shown to only partially inactive the transporter (39Chen L.-Y. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Hiraiwa H. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34280-34286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that neutropenia as well as neutrophil and monocyte dysfunctions occur only in patients that harbor null G6PTmutations. Therefore, Hnf1α−/− mice, which express a low level of the G6PT gene, do not manifest neutropenia or polymorphonuclear leukocyte dysfunction. It is noteworthy that overexpression of G6Pase in primary hepatocytes creates the metabolic profile of liver cells derived from NIDDM patients (40Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, rats overexpressing the G6Pase gene manifest glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia (23Trinh E.Y. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Transient expression studies have shown that HNF1α is required for transcription of the G6Pase gene (27Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 46: 14096-14106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, HNF1α is also required for the maximal repression of G6Pase gene transcription by insulin (24Streeper R.S.

The increase in G6Paseexpression in Hnf1α−/− mice strongly suggests that the in vivo role of HNF1α is to act as an accessory factor to enhance the inhibitory action of insulin onG6Pase gene transcription (25Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in diabetic rats, prolonged hyperglycemia increases G6Pase gene expression independent of insulin (22Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and that the glucose-stimulated increase in G6Pase mRNA depending upon the presence of glucokinase (41Argaud D. Kirby T.L. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It appears that HNF1α deficiency compounded with impaired insulin secretion and hyperglycemia contributes to G6Pase overexpression in Hnf1α−/− mice. Whether perturbations in G6Pase expression contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM in these mice remains to be elucidated. Glucose 6-phosphate, the substrate of the G6Pase system, plays a pivotal role in metabolism. It is at the branch point of lipid biosynthesis and glycogen biosynthesis as well as facilitating energy homeostasis through glucose. Kinetic studies have suggested that G6P uptake is the rate-limiting step in G6Pase catalysis (3Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This notion is further supported by functional G6Pase deficiency manifested by GSD-1b patients carrying inactivating mutations in the G6PTgene (26Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Hnf1α−/− mice, G6P generated by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis could not be efficiently translocated to the lumen of the ER, resulting in an increase in hepatic glycogen deposition and stimulation of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates, for the first time that metabolic abnormalities inHnf1α−/− mice are caused in part by G6PT deficiency and disruption in the balance of the G6Pase system.

In response to agonists (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide), the kinase homology domain-mediated guanylate cyclase repression is removed, which allows the production of cyclic GMP. Previous work from our laboratory strongly indicated that agonists are exerting their effects through the induction of a juxtamembrane dimeric contact. However, a direct demonstration of this mechanism remains to be provided. As a tool, we are now using the properties of a new mutation, D435C. It introduces a cysteine at a position in NPR-A corresponding to a supplementary cysteine found in NPR-C6, another receptor of this family (a disulfide-linked dimer). Although this D435C mutation only leads to trace levels of NPR-A disulfide-linked dimer at basal state, covalent dimerization can be induced by a treatment with rat ANP or with other agonists. The NPR-AD435C mutant has not been subjected to significant structural alterations, since it shares with the wild type receptor a similar dose-response pattern of cellular guanylyl cyclase activation. However, a persistent activation accompanies NPR-AD435C dimer formation after the removal of the inducer agonist. On the other hand, a construction where the intracellular domain of NPR-AD435C has been truncated (ΔKCD435C) displays a spontaneous and complete covalent dimerization. In addition, the elimination of the intracellular domain in wild type ΔKC and ΔKCD435C is associated with an increase of agonist binding affinity, this effect being more pronounced with the weak agonist pBNP. Also, a D435C secreted extracellular domain remains unlinked even after incubation with rat ANP. In summary, these results demonstrate, in a dynamic fashion, the agonistic induction of a dimeric contact in the juxtamembrane domain of NPR-A.

Methods. 1999; 19: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three different NPRs have been identified, and two of these, NPR-A and NPR-B, respond to agonists by the activation of their guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain. The production of intracellular cGMP mediates their effects on diuresis, vasorelaxation, and the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (2Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A third receptor, called NPR-C or the clearance receptor, displays only 37 amino acids in its intracellular domain and is devoid of guanylyl cyclase activity. NPR-C is a disulfide-bridged dimer that internalizes through a fast intracellular cycle process (3Cohen D. Young G.Koh Nikonova L.N. Gordon P. orter J. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and might be involved in signal transduction (4Anand-Shrivastava M.B. Sehl P.D. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19324-19329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NPR-A is stimulated by two peptides, ANP and BNP, whereas CNP is the only known agonist of NPR-B (2Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Shin-ichi S. Imura H. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). NPR-C has nearly equal binding affinity for all of these natriuretic peptides (6Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Teizo I. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Suga S. Nakao K. Hosada K. Mukoyama M. Ogawa Y. Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NPR-A is an ∼130-kDa protein that contains four structural domains: an extracellular domain (ECD) with a ligand binding site, a transmembrane domain (TM), a kinase homology domain (KHD), and a guanylyl cyclase domain (GC) (2Chinkers M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that this receptor is spontaneously preassociated in noncovalent dimers or oligomers (8Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies have indicated that both extracellular and intracellular domains are involved in NPR-A dimerization. According to the current model of agonist activation, NPR-A signal transduction includes these five sequential steps (11Jewett J.R.S. Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Lowe D.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 1) The binding of the natriuretic peptide to the ectodomain induces a conformational change. 2) This modification corresponds to a signal that migrates through the TM domain. 3) The KHD responds to this signal by adopting a conformation that allows ATP binding. 4) ATP binding has two major effects in derepressing the guanylyl cyclase activity and increasing the off-rate of ANP from the receptor (12Larose L. McNicoll N. Ong H. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8991-8996Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 5) Subsequent desensitization results from reduction in phosphorylation state of the KHD (13Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Potter L.R. Hunter T. Methods. 1999; 19: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously brought out the remarkable conservation of spacing between the cysteine residues found in the extracellular domain of nearly all of the guanylyl cyclases (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More precisely, we took as a basic observation the presence two invariant cysteines, spaced by 6–8 residues, which are present in nearly all of the juxtamembrane domains of NPRs (Fig. 1). These two cysteines have been shown to be linked through an intrachain disulfide bond in rat NPR-A (16Miyagi M. Misono K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we also pointed out a noticeable exception found in the NPR-C5 receptor, where the first juxtamembrane cysteine is absent (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Consequently, the only juxtamembrane cysteine (Cys469) in NPR-C5 is free to form an interchain disulfide bridge. Hence, this receptor is found as a covalent homodimer (6Itakura M. Iwashina M. Mizuno T. Teizo I. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8314-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to the cysteine distribution of NPR-C5, we previously designed the mutation C423S in NPR-A, which eliminates its first juxtamembrane cysteine (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expectation was that, in the absence of this cysteine (equivalent to Cys423 in NPR-A), it would permit interchain linkage of the second cysteine (Cys432 in NPR-A, equivalent to Cys469 of NPR-C5). Indeed, this mutation led to a spontaneously disulfide-bridged NPR-AC423S dimer. This NPR-AC423S mutant was also found to be constitutively activated, and it displayed an important increase in the binding affinity of pBNP, a weak agonist (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using these observations, we proposed a model where agonists are inducing a dimeric “tightening” in the juxtamembrane region of NPR-A, hence allowing catalytic activation of the guanylyl cyclase. However, we indicated at the time that we could not exclude the contribution of a conformational change induced by the mutation independently of the interchain disulfide linkage (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For instance, it was not known if the disruption of the Cys432–Cys423 bond might by itself take part in the constitutive activation of NPR-AC423S. In the current study, our objective is to definitively demonstrate that a juxtamembrane dimerization event is associated with NPR-A activation. To limit eventual structural alterations, we chose to avoid the disruption of the Cys423–Cys432 internal bond. For this, we referred to a minor splicing isoform of NPR-C (NPR-C6) that displays a supplementary juxtamembrane cysteine also forming an accessory interchain disulfide bridge (17Mizuno T. Iwashina M. Itakura M. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5162-5167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the juxtamembrane regions of NPR-C6 and NPR-A, this supplementary cysteine in NPR-C6 aligns with the aspartate 435 in NPR-A (Fig. 1). We thought that the addition of a cysteine at position 435 might lead again to a covalently dimerized NPR-A. We thus verified if NPR-AD435Cforms a disulfide-linked dimer. We found that although this mutant displays only trace levels of spontaneous covalent dimerization, agonists can induce such a dimeric linkage. This characteristic allowed us to define important constraints involved in receptor activation. rNPR-A mutants were engineered in the expression vector PBK-Neo (Stratagene). The construction of the His-tagged HT-ECD has already been described (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This construct includes all of the extracellular domain up to Leu440 followed by Arg-Ser-His6. HT-ECDD435C was obtained by mutating the Asp435 in Cys with the mutagenic primer 5′-CCTGCAACCAATGCCACTTTTCGAC-3′ using the Transformer mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH. NPR-AD435C was obtained by mutating Asp435 in Cys using the mutagenic primer 5′-CCTGCAACCAATGCCACTTTTCCAC-3′. A deletion mutant of the entire intracellular domain of NPR-A (ΔKC) was obtained by PCR usingTaq polymerase. The amplification was realized using a sense primer 5′-ATGCCTTCAGGAATCTGATGC-3′ and two antisense primers. The first antisense primer (5-AGAGCCTCTTTCACCCTTCCTGTATATGAAGAAAGA-3′) was limiting (1 pmol), and the other (5′-TTTTGGTACCTTAACCTCTGGTAGAAGAGCCTCTTTCACCCTT-3′) was in excess (100 pmol). The amplified fragment included codons 217–464, followed by the epitope GERGSSTRG, a stop codon, and finally a KpnI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was codigested withEcoRV–KpnI. This fragment (codons 416 to Stop) was inserted in PBK-NPR-A, which had been previously codigested with the same enzymes. The resulting construction included the whole ectodomain, the transmembrane-spanning domain, and the two first intracellular residues (Arg463-Lys464), followed by the epitope and a stop codon. The ΔKCD435Cwas obtained by following the same strategy but using NPR-AD435C as an initial polymerase chain reaction template. The constructions and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing on the two strands using the Sequenase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For the cyclic GMP stimulation experiments, cells of the NPR-A and NPR-AD435C clones were seeded at 105cells/well onto 24-well cluster plates. Experiments were performed when the cells reached subconfluence. Transient expression of ΔKC, ΔKCD435C, HT-ECD, and HT-ECDD435C was obtained by the transfection of constructs in PBK-Neo using the CaHPO4 precipitation as described elsewhere (18Lia F. Rajotte D. Clark S.C. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28287-28293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For HT-ECD and HT-ECDD435C, 20 μg of DNA/10-cm plate was transfected. For the truncated receptors (ΔKCs), the quantity of transfected PBK-ΔKC had to be reduced to obtain a level of expression comparable with the full-length receptor. This level was obtained by transfecting 2.5 μg of PBK-ΔKC or PBK-ΔKCD435C mixed with 17.5 μg of the PBK-Neo vector. For the stable expression of the rNPR-A and rNPR-AD435C, the cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA/10-cm plate, and clones were selected in 600 μg/ml G-418 (Geneticin; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in culture medium. Stable clones expressing wild type NPR-A and NPR-AD435C were plated in 10-cm plates and were allowed to grow to subconfluence. After the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM, 6 ml of the same medium (37 °C) containing 0.5% BSA and varying concentrations (10−12 to 10−6m) of rANP were added to individual plates. The induction was allowed to proceed for 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C), and all liquid was removed. The plates were put directly in a freezer at −80 °C until further used. For membrane preparation, the frozen plates were put on ice, and 4 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA containing 10−6m aprotinin, 10−6m pepstatin, 10−6m leupeptin, 10−5m pefabloc) was immediately added. The cells were scraped, collected in centrifugation tubes, homogenized twice for 20 s with a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged once for 30 min at 35,000 × g. The pellets were immediately resuspended in ice-cold freezing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and the protease inhibitors) and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The induction of receptor dimerization was assessed by Western blotting after the separation of membrane proteins (25 μg) on a 5% SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer. Membranes used for the binding studies and the in vitro induction of NPR-AD435Cdimerization were prepared as follows. 72 h post-transfection for ΔKC and ΔKCD435C, or at subconfluence for the stable clones expressing NPR-A and NPR-AD435C, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors). The cells were scraped, collected in centrifuge tubes, homogenized twice for 20 s with a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended and washed twice in the same buffer. Finally, membranes were resuspended in ice-cold freezing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and the protease inhibitors), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. HT-ECD and HT-ECDD435C were purified from cell culture medium collected 72 h post-transfection. Supernatants were dialyzed three times against 90 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl. After adding 16% glycerol, the dialysate was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C. The His-tagged ectodomains were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel (Qiagen) as described elsewhere (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ectodomains were eluted from the gel with 500 mm imidazole. The eluates were finally dialyzed in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (molecular weight cut-off of 10,000; Pierce). 25 μg of membrane proteins obtained from stable clones expressing NPR-A or NPR-AD435C were added to 500 μl of cold incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% BSA, and the protease inhibitors) containing 1 μm agonist. For the specificity study, rANP, pBNP, atriopeptin I (API), CNP, or C-ANF were included in the incubation mixture. The agonist induction of disulfide linkage was allowed to proceed for 22 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the samples were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The pellets were carefully resuspended in ice-cold deionized water, and 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol) was immediately added. The samples were immediately boiled for 5 min. The covalent dimerization was assessed by Western blotting after the separation of membrane proteins on a 5% SDS-PAGE. The induction of HT-ECDD435C was tested at 4 °C or at 22 °C, with 1 μm rANP, for 22 h in 0.1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% lysozyme). The presence of covalent dimer was assessed by Western blotting after the separation of proteins (nonreducing conditions) on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. 125I-rANP was prepared using the lactoperoxidase method as described elsewhere (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding to membranes was performed at 4 °C for 22 h in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.5% BSA). Competition experiments were done by incubation of 3–5 μg of HEK 293 membrane expressing rNPR-A, rNPR-AD435C, ΔKC, or ΔKCD435C with 10 fmol of 125I-rANP and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive peptides. Bound125I-rANP was separated from free ligand by filtration on GF/C filters precoated with 1% polyethyleneimine. Cells stably expressing rNPR-A and rNPR-AD435C were allowed to grow to subconfluence on 24-well cluster plates. The wells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and were incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of the same medium containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.5% BSA, and varying concentrations (10−12 to 10−7m) of rANP. After 1 h of incubation, the medium was collected, and extracellular cyclic GMP was determined by radioimmunoassay as described elsewhere (19Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De, Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar). After the assay, 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (95 °C) was added to several wells. The wild type and mutant receptor levels were estimated by Western blotting, which was used to normalize their relative cGMP production. Stable clones expressing NPR-A and NPR-AD435C were allowed to grow to subconfluence on 10-cm plates. After having washed the cells with serum-free DMEM, 6 ml of DMEM (37 °C) containing 0.5% BSA and 10−7m rANP was added to the plates. The incubation was allowed to proceed for 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were then carefully washed twice with DMEM, 0.5% BSA (37 °C) and incubated for another 30 min. After this postincubation, the cells were washed again twice with phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C). Membrane preparation was done as described above except that homogenization, washings (three times), and freezing were realized in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.1m NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and the protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined, and these membranes were used for guanylyl cyclase assays as described in other studies (13Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 5 μg of membrane proteins were incubated during 10 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 10 mm theophylline, 2 mm IBMX, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units of creatine kinase, 1 mm GTP, and 4 mm MgCl2. Different conditions were tested using GTP alone (basal) or by adding 1 μm rANP, 1 mm ATP, rANP and ATP together or adding 1% Triton X-100 with 4 mm MnCl2instead of MgCl2. Cyclic GMP was separated from GTP by chromatography on alumina and evaluated by radioimmunoassay as previously reported (19Fethiere J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De, Lean A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using the liquid Mini Tans-Blot System (Bio-Rad). Detection of NPR-A and ΔKC was achieved using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the sequence YGERGSSTRG and purified by affinity chromatography. This sequence corresponds to human NPR-A carboxyl terminus preceded by a tyrosine for radioiodination purposes. The rat NPR-A differs from this epitope at a single position; however, both receptors are recognized. Specific signal was probed with an HRP-coupled anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody according to the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the His-tagged HT-ECD and HT-ECDD435C, purified aliquots were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE without β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer. In this case, 6m urea was included in the sample buffer and in the gel, since it was found to improve the immunodetection. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above, and the ectodomains were detected using a commercial mouse anti-tetrahistidine antibody (Qiagen) according to the technique provided by the manufacturer. Specific signal was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse polyclonal antibody using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System. Dose-response curves were analyzed with the program AllFit for Windows based on the four-parameter logistic equation (21De Léan A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). Radioligand binding data were analyzed with the same program on a model for the law of mass action (22De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For simplicity, the same binding data were also analyzed as dose-response curves, and ED50 values are mentioned in the discussion instead ofK d values. We considered the possibility that the introduction of a cysteine at position 435 could cause a covalent dimerization of rNPR-A subunits. This site was chosen because of its linear alignment with an accessory cysteine involved in the linkage of NPRC-C6 dimers (Fig. 1). Initial studies with rNPR-AD435C expressed in HEK293 showed, however, only low levels of spontaneous dimerization. At this point, we proceeded to further testing and explored the possibility that some dimeric linkage might be induced by rANP, the main agonist of NPR-A. This hypothesis turned out to be right, since dimers of rNPR-AD435C could be detected after a cellular incubation with 1 μm rANP (30 min, 37 °C). We further detailed this induction through a dose-effect study using a clone stably expressing NPR-AD435C (Fig.2). A clear signal of ∼260 kDa corresponding to NPR-AD435C dimers is detected on nonreducing SDS-PAGE. It is noteworthy that such an induction is not seen in cells expressing wild type NPR-A. A densitometric analysis of the dimeric induction gave an approximate ED50 of ∼900 pm, which is higher than the ED50 obtained in cellular guanylyl cyclase stimulation (87 pm). The exact explanation for this difference is not known. However, the reaction between cysteines leading to disulfide formation could be a limiting element of the process and might affect the apparent dose-effect curve. Therefore, considering this supplementary element, an ED50of ∼900 pm constitutes an acceptable value. These results are showing that ANP induces a particular dimeric contact in the juxtamembrane domain of NPR-AD435C. This conclusion is in accordance with our previous hypothesis based on the observation of constitutively dimerized NPR-AC423S mutant (15Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the ANP-inducible dimerization properties of NPR-AD435C directly proves this mechanism. Furthermore, the near absence of NPR-AD435C covalent dimerization at basal state reveals the existence of a constraint that represses this contact in absence of ANP. To assess if the D435C mutation altered the NPR-A function, we studied cellular guanylyl cyclase activation by rANP. As shown in Fig. 3, the ED50 obtained for the wild type (71 ± 12.8 pm) and the mutant (87 ± 4.6 pm) are essentially comparable, and their maximal levels of stimulation are similar. It should be noted that we reproducibly observed a very slight increase in the basal activity of NPR-AD435C as compared with that of NPR-AWT (Fig. 3). This almost negligible increase might indicate that the D435C mutation has very slightly modified the interactions in the juxtamembrane region. Alternatively, it may be attributed to a trace level of NPR-AD435C dimer sometimes detectable on Western blot through signal overexposure (not shown). From this result, it can be reasonably concluded that NPR-AD435C displays a response to rANP that is very close to that for wild type NPR-A. Therefore, the conclusions based on the results obtained with this mutant are likely to be applicable to the wild type receptor. We investigated if the induction of NPR-AD435C covalent dimerization goes along with persistent activation. Guanylate cyclase activity was tested in vitrowith membrane preparations obtained from ANP-treated cells. Stable clones expressing NPR-AWT and NPR-AD435C were treated for 30 min (37 °C) with 10−7m ANP. Removal of the ligand was realized through extensive washing of cells, followed by postincubation without ligand and washings during membrane preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The membranes were submitted to several conditions using GTP alone (basal) or together with ATP, ANP, ATP plus ANP, and Triton/Mn2+. The results were expressed as a percentage of the activation obtained with Triton/Mn2+. This condition stimulates NPR-A to its maximal catalytic level and is commonly used as an internal reference of enzyme activity. Several observations can be made from the results. First, the level of costimulation with ATP plus ANP tends to diminish in membranes obtained from ANP-treated cells (NPR-A: nontreated 38.9 ± 4.5%, treated 29.8 ± 5.9%; NPR-AD435C: nontreated 39.8 ± 6.9%, treated 29.6 ± 2.6%).

In the current study, we show that the final activation of the leuABCD operon is through a transcriptional derepression mechanism. TheleuABCD operon is transcriptionally repressed by the presence of a 318-base pair AT-rich upstream element. LeuO is required for derepressing the repressed leuABCD operon. Deletion analysis of the repressive effect of the 318-bp element has led to the identification of a 72-bp AT-rich (78% A+T) DNA sequence element, AT4, which is capable of silencing a number of unrelated promoters in addition to the leuABCD promoter. AT4-mediated gene silencing is orientation-independent and occurs within a distance of 300 base pairs. Furthermore, an increased gene-silencing effect was observed with a tandemly repeated AT4 dimer.

Margolin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 140-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the mutant promoter is DNA supercoiling-dependent (2Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the leu-500 promoter (pleu-500) is activated in the topA mutants is intriguing (3Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Wu H.-Y.

Previous studies using a plasmid system have demonstrated that activation of plasmid-borne pleu-500 in topA mutants requires an upstream transcriptional activity transcribing away from pleu-500 (8Chen D.

Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This notion has been confirmed in a recent study using the chromosomal setting (12El Hanafl D. Bossi L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the ilvIH promoter (pilvIH) located 1.9 kilobases upstream of pleu-500 was shown to be responsible for pleu-500 activation (5Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transcription-driven DNA supercoiling (13Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar) has been suggested to play a role in this long-range promoter-promoter interaction. The intervening promoter that relays the distant interaction between pilvIH and pleu-500 is the leuOpromoter (pleuO). In addition to transcriptional activity from pleuO, the leuO gene product, LeuO, is also required to provide a trans-acting function for activation of pleu-500 (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the functional pleuO (or other replaced promoter) and LeuO are coupled in activating pleu-500. The molecular basis for pleu-500 activation by the combined action of pleuO and LeuO is still a mystery. There is a stretch of 434 base pairs (bp)1 that is AT-rich DNA flanked by the divergently arrayed leuO andleuABCD (14Haughn G.W. Wessler S.R. Gemmill R.M. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the promoter sequences of the flanking genes, the function of the remaining 318-bp AT-rich (69% A+T) DNA is unknown (illustrated in Fig. 1). By monitoring pleu-500 activation, we found that the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA appears to repress the short-range interaction (11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the two flanking promoters. Interestingly, LeuO relieves the repression. The repressive effect of the AT-rich intervening DNA on the short-range promoter-promoter interaction (pleuO and pleu-500) could potentially be due to anchoring of the AT-rich DNA to a large mass, which restricts DNA rotation and thereby abolishes short-range promoter-promoter interaction via DNA supercoiling. However, detailed analysis to search for DNA rotation blockage has ruled out this anchorage possibility. The repressive activity of the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA has been narrowed down to a 72-bp AT-rich (78% A+T) DNA, referred to as AT4 in this work. AT4 is located at the pleuO end of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA. AT4 can repress promoter activity within a 300-bp distance. This repression is independent of the orientation of AT4. AT4-mediated repression of the promoter activity appears to be promoter nonspecific, because all promoters tested are repressed by AT4. These results support a role for AT4 as a gene silencer in bacteria. pWU802T, pEV101, pSO1000, pAO, pJW270, and pBR322 have been previously described (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Stuber D. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To construct pWU812T, a 320-bp promoterless non-AT-rich (47% A+T) DNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the coding region of human cathepsin B gene (19Cao L. Taggart T. Berquin I.M. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene. 1994; 139: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with the primers introducing HincII andBstXI sites at the ends. The digestedHincII-BstXI fragment was then used to replace the 318-bp HincII-BstXI segment containing the native AT-rich sequence (69% A+T) between the divergently transcribing ptac and pleu-500 in pWU802T. The native 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA was also PCR-amplified with primers containingAatII restriction sites. The AatII-digested AT DNA fragment was inserted into the unique AatII site on pAO to yield pAO-AT and pAO-ATR. The plasmid carrying an AT DNA insert, with the leuO end of the DNA orientated proximal to pbla, was designated pAO-AT. The plasmid carrying the DNA insert in the opposite orientation was designated as pAO-ATR. Similarly, the 72-bp DNA located near the pleuO end of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA was PCR-amplified with primers so that the 72-bp AT4 DNA was flanked by AatII restriction sites on both ends. TheAatII-digested AT4 DNA was inserted at the uniqueAatII site on pAO to yield pAO-AT4 (the leuO end of the DNA insert was proximal to pbla) and pAO-AT4R (the opposite orientation). The AT4 DNA sequence was 5′-CACAATCATACACCAAGTGAATGATCATTTAAGTTTCAATTAAATGTTTATATTATTAATAGCTAAAAAGTT-3′. The nucleotide sequence of the rest of the intervening DNA between the divergently arrayed leuO and leuABCD genes can be obtained from the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF106956). Other testing plasmids were all derived from the above-described plasmids and were individually described in the experiments. The following 72-bp DNA sequence from the lacZ coding region was used to replace the AT4 DNA on pWU802T as described in Fig. 6. 5′-AACCATCGAAGTGACCAGCGAATACCTGTTCCGTCATAGCGATAACGAGCTCCTGCACTGGATGGTGGTACC-3′. The following four synthetic DNA oligomers, consisting of nucleotide sequences of the lacZ coding region, were used to sequentially extend the distance between the AT4 insert and pbla in pAO-AT4 as described in Fig. 8: 5′-GCGATCTTCCTGAGGCCGATACTGTCGTCGTCCCCTCAAACTGGCGGATCCAA-3′; 5′-GATCCACGGTTACGATGCGCCCATCTACACCAACGTAACCTATCCCATGAATTC-3′; 5′-AATTCAATCCGCCGTTTGTTCCCACGGAGAATCCGACGGGTTGTTACTGGTACC-3′; and 5′-CATTTAATGTTGATGAAAGCTGGCTACAGGAAGGCCAGACGCGAAAGCTTGTAC-3′. CH601(topA +) and CH582(topA −), an isogenic pair of S. typhimurium strains, were described previously (3Richardson S.M.H. Higgins C.F. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and provided by Dr. David Lilley. AS19, an Escherichia coli B strain that is permeable to drugs such as novobiocin (20Sekiguchi M. Iida S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Wu H.-Y. Shy S.-H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). TheleuO − strain, MF1, was derived from MC4100, anE. coli K-12 strain (22Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). TO2 is aΔleuO strain due to the replacement of theBstXI-ApaI fragment of the leuO coding region with a DNA fragment carrying the cam(cmr) gene (23Ueguchi C. Ohta T. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MF1 was prepared by introducing theleuO::cam mutation into MC4100 (recipient strain) by P1 transduction using TO2 as a donor strain. Disruption of theleuO in the chromosome in MF1 was confirmed by the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern and the size of the DNA product of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with aeration. 50 μg/ml ampicillin or 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline was added as needed. Primer extension was carried out as previously described (11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several DNA oligomers were used as primers in the study. 5′-TCTGGGTGAGACAAAACAGGAAGGC-3′ was used for detecting pbla-mediated transcripts; 5′-AGAATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCG-3′ was used for detecting pleu-500-mediated transcripts; 5′-CCTATAAAAATAGGCGTATCACGAGGCCCT-3′ was used for detecting ptac-mediated transcript; 5′-CTACAGCATCCAGGGTGACGGTGCC-3′ was used for detecting ptetA-mediated transcripts. All primers hybridize only with plasmid DNA sequences so that no transcripts from the chromosomal genes would interfere with the primer extension results. With the exception of Figs. 1 and 6 (see below), an individual primer was mixed with 100 μg of total RNA in the primer extension reactions. Two primers were mixed in the primer extension reactions for simultaneous detection of the bla andleu-500 transcripts in Fig. 1 and the leu-500 andtac transcripts in Fig. 6. The initiation sites of RNA transcripts were verified based on the specific sizes of the primer extension DNA products that run off the 5′-end of RNA transcripts. A DNA sequence ladder was prepared using each individual primer for verifying the initiation site at a DNA sequence level. The radioactivity of primer extension DNA product was visualized and quantified using a Storm imaging system (model 840, Molecular Dynamics). The reported quantification is the average of at least two experiments. The signals were normalized based on the total plasmid DNA content in the harvested cells. 1.5-ml aliquots of bacterial culture were saved at the harvest and used to prepare total plasmid DNA. The total plasmid DNA in the 1.5-ml sample was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blotting using a32p-labeled probe that specifically hybridizes with plasmid DNA. DNA samples were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the first dimension in 1× Tris-phosphate-EDTA (TPE) buffer (containing 80 mm Tris phosphate and 8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), the 20- × 20-cm gel was then soaked in 4 μm chloroquine (Sigma) for 2 h. The soaked gel was turned 90° and electrophoresed in the second dimension in 1× TPE buffer containing 4 μm chloroquine. The two-dimensional gels were subjected to in situ Southern hybridization (described in Ref. 21Wu H.-Y. Shy S.-H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) using pAO-specific 32p-labeled probe so that the coexisting pEV101 was not visualized. A LeuO-specific antiserum was raised by injecting the purified overexpressed S. typhimuriumHis-tagged LeuO into a rabbit. The affinity-purified IgG (1.4 mg/ml) from the antiserum was used at a dilution factor of 1:5000 as the primary antibody to detect the cellular LeuO protein. The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The blot was developed by ECL in a modification of a previous procedure (24Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using an ECF Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chemifluorescence signal was detected and quantified by the Storm 840 imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). The 318-bp AT-rich DNA is located between the two divergently arrayed promoters, pleuO and pleuABCD. Previous studies have demonstrated that this region is involved in the promoter relay mechanism for pleu-500 activation (5Wu H.-Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA on the interaction between pleuO and pleuABCD, we have constructed two plasmids, pWU802T and pWU812T (Fig. 1). pWU802T was constructed from a plasmid that contains the entire region of pleuO, 318-bp AT-rich DNA, and pleuABCD in their corresponding chromosomal context, by replacing pleuO with an IPTG-inducible tac promoter, ptac (25De Boer H.A. Comstock L.J. Vasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Theleu-500 mutant was included so that a nearly on-off pleu-500 activity change (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could be used as indication of the short-range ptac-pleu-500 interaction (11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pWU812T was constructed from pWU802T by replacing the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA with a 320-bp promoterless and non-AT-rich DNA sequence from human cathepsin B cDNA (19Cao L. Taggart T. Berquin I.M. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene. 1994; 139: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The leuO coding region in both plasmids was truncated so that no functional LeuO was generated in cis. Upon IPTG induction, LeuO was produced intrans from a coexisting expression vector, pEV101 (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA in pWU812T resulted in an IPTG-inducible pleu-500 activation in S. typhimurium CH582 (topA −), regardless of the presence or absence of LeuO (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and8). In contrast, with the 318-bp native AT-rich intervening DNA in place, pleu-500 failed to be activated in pWU802T in the absence of LeuO (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and4). Consistent with the previous results (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IPTG induction resulted in activation of pleu-500 on pWU802T when LeuO was provided in trans (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and2). These results demonstrate a repressive effect of the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA on the short-range pleuO(ptac)-pleu-500 interaction. The trans-acting LeuO relieves the repression. The short-range interaction between the two divergently arrayed promoters, ptac and pleu-500, is almost certainly due to transcription-driven DNA supercoiling (11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The repressive effect of the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA on the short-range promoter-promoter interaction is intriguing. One possible explanation is that the AT-rich intervening DNA may be organized into a large structure (e.g. anchored to a large mass) so that DNA rotation along its helical axis is restricted (schematically illustrated in Fig. 2). To test this possibility, a DNA supercoiling assay based on previously established methodology (15Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used. For these experiments, the 318-bp AT-rich DNA was inserted at the unique AatII site in pAO so that the major transcription unit, β-lactamase gene (bla), is transcribing away from the AT-rich DNA insert (illustrated in Fig. 2). The resultant plasmid, pAO-AT, and the parental plasmid, pAO, were used in the assay. This assay was designed based on the theory that if an anchor was formed at the inserted AT-rich DNA, the accumulation of transcription-driven supercoiling would be intensified due to the lack of a diffusional pathway to dissipate DNA supercoils (15Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under such a condition, inhibition of DNA gyrase would result in a relatively more rapid increase in the DNA linking number (positive DNA supercoiling) in both monomeric and dimeric plasmid DNAs as previously demonstrated using lac operator as a model system (15Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When such an experiment was performed in cells harboring pAO-AT, which contained the 318-bp AT-rich DNA instead of the lac operator, no accumulation of the positively supercoiled DNA topoisomers was observed (Fig. 2 C). In fact, the topoisomer distribution of pAO was almost identical to that of pAO-AT (Fig. 2, compare A andC), suggesting that the 318-bp AT-rich DNA insert did not significantly restrict DNA helix rotation and therefore could not block DNA supercoils generated by transcription of the bla gene. In addition, IPTG induction (the production of LeuO protein from pEV101) did not affect the topoisomer distribution of either pAO or PAO-AT (Fig. 2, B and D). These results suggest that the 318-bp AT-rich DNA-mediated repression is unlikely to be due to restriction of DNA helix rotation. The 318-bp AT-rich DNA could repress transcription from one of the flanking promoters (either ptac or pleu-500) and thereby abolishes short-range promoter-promoter interaction. To test this possibility, we examined the transcription activity of ptac in pWU802T and pWU812T. Primer extension results indicated that the ptac activity (Fig. 3) strikingly correlated with the pleu-500 activity (Fig. 1). The ptac functioned normally if the 318-bp AT-rich DNA was replaced with a neutral DNA sequence of similar size as in pWU812T (lanes 6 and8 in Fig. 3). In the presence of the native 318-bp AT-rich DNA, the ptac activity on pWU802T was severely impaired (Fig. 3, lane 4). On the same plasmid, the ptacactivity was partially restored if LeuO was provided in trans (Fig. 3, lane 2). This result strongly supports the notion that the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA is a negative regulatory element for transcription. To test whether or not the repressive effect of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA element on transcription can be observed with other promoters, the 318-bp DNA was inserted at the unique AatII site located 99 bp upstream of the bla promoter (pbla) in pAO. In either orientation (pAO-AT and pAO-ATR), the 318-bp AT-rich DNA insert caused an ∼45% reduction of the pbla activity (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 2and 3 with lane 1). Deletion analysis using pAO-AT had located a predominant gene-silencing effect (more than 80% reduction on pbla activity) in AT4, a 72-bp AT-rich DNA located near the pleuO end of the 318-bp DNA (lane 6 in Fig. 4 A). Those DNA inserts containing the 72-bp AT4 plus all or part of the rest of 318-bp AT-rich DNA (AT, ATR, and AT2) exerted lesser gene-silencing effects (lanes 2,3, and 4 in Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the AT1 DNA segment, which represents the 146-bp pleu-500 end of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA, enhanced the pbla activity (lane 5 in Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that, although the 72-bp AT4 exhibits a clear gene-silencing effect, a complex transcriptional effect is present in the rest of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA. The stronger silencing effect that is associated with AT4 may be due to elimination of other complex and opposing effects within the 318-bp AT-rich intervening DNA. Inversion of the AT4 DNA insert did not significantly affect gene silencing (compare lanes 8 and 10 in Fig. 4 A). The reduction of pbla activity was ∼80% with either orientation. Furthermore, the gene-silencing effect was additive. In either orientation, an ∼95% reduction was achieved when the AT4 DNA insert was tandemly repeated (lanes 9 and 11 in Fig.4 A). Thus far, characterization of the 72-bp gene silencer had been carried out in the S. typhimurium topA − strain, CH582, where pleu-500activation was originally studied. The topA −genetic background has been shown to enhance short-range promoter-promoter interaction such as activation of a plasmid-borne pleu-500 (11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether AT4-mediated gene-silencing effect was dependent on thetopA − genetic background, pAO-AT4 was tested in an S. typhimurium topA +strain, CH601, which is the parental strain of CH582. The same degree of gene silencing (∼80% reduction of the pblaactivity) was observed in both the topA + and thetopA − strains (Fig. 4 B). The trans-acting LeuO protein was shown to relieve 318-bp AT-rich DNA-mediated repression of the short-range pleuO(ptac)-pleu-500 interaction in pWU802T (Fig. 1). To test whether or not LeuO can also suppress AT4-mediated gene silencing, the effect of LeuO on AT4-mediated silencing of pbla was examined in an E. coli leuO − strain, MF1 (Fig.5). A slightly stronger gene-silencing effect (∼88% reduction of the pbla activity) was found in the LeuO-free strain (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1and 2). When LeuO was provided in trans in MF1 from a coexisting expression vector, pEV101, AT4-mediated gene silencing was nearly abolished even without IPTG induction (Fig.5 A, lane 3). This was probably due to the leakage of LeuO from the expression vector, pEV101. Such a leakage was evidenced from immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 5 C, lane 2; 8.6 ng of LeuO was detected in the 100 μg of total protein loaded). Upon further increase of cellular LeuO due to IPTG induction (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3–6), AT4-mediated gene silencing was completely eliminated (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–7). The pbla activity was fully restored with 50 μm IPTG treatment (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 5and 1). In a control experiment using the parental plasmid pAO, the pbla activity was unaffected by IPTG treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that LeuO negates AT4-mediated gene silencing. However, the effect of LeuO on transcription could be nonspecific. To test whether or not the effect of LeuO is specific for AT4, a 72-bp DNA consisting of a DNA sequence from the lacZ coding region was synthesized and used to replace the 72-bp AT4 DNA in pWU802T (illustrated in Fig. 6). In the absence of LeuO (i.e. the absence of pEV101), this replacement resulted in a LeuO-independent pleu-500 activation on the mutant plasmid (Fig.6 B, lane 2). A significant ptac-mediated transcription activity was also detectable in the mutant plasmid (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). With the native 72-bp AT4 in place, a significantly reduced ptacactivity was detected in pWU802T (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). Apparently, the reduced ptac activity was too weak to activate pleu-500 at this distance (Fig. 6 B,lane 1). Our study, thus far, has clearly indicated that LeuO relieves 318-bp intervening DNA-mediated repression (Fig. 1) by specifically negating AT4-mediated gene silencing. The 72-bp gene silencer, AT4, is located at the 5′-ends of the divergently arrayed leuO andleuABCD genes. Such a chromosomal organization may not be a coincidence, because transcription-generated negative DNA supercoiling is known to accumulate in such a topological domain (13Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 21Wu H.-Y. Shy S.-H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To test whether or not AT4 functions most effectively when placed between divergently arrayed promoters, we inserted AT4 at the uniqueAatII site in pBR322 DNA so that AT4 was flanked by the divergently arrayed bla and tetA genes (illustrated in Fig. 7). As expected, AT4 caused reductions in both pbla and ptetAactivities (Fig. 7, A and B). However, the gene-silencing effect of AT4 in pBR322 (Fig. 7 A, lanes 2) was lower than that in pAO-AT4 (Fig. 4). The anti-tet transcription activity (16Stuber D. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) that read through the AT4 insert in pBR322 could be the reason for this reduction. Despite the reduced effect, AT4-mediated gene silencing on pBR322 was still additive in the presence of a tandemly repeated AT4 dimer (Fig. 7, A andB, lanes 3). Due to the simultaneous gene-silencing effects on both flanking promoters, it remained unclear whether or not the bacterial gene silencer was affected by an adjacent transcription activity. To test the effect of adjacent transcription on AT4-mediated gene silencing, pJW270-based plasmid constructs were used. pJW270-based plasmids are essentially the same as pBR322, except that thetetA promoter is replaced by an IPTG-induciblelacUV5 promoter and that an iqpromoter-controlled laci gene was inserted at the 5′-end of the lacUV5 promoter (Refs. 17Giaever G.N. Schneider L. Wang J.C. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 29: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 21Wu H.-Y. Shy S.-H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, and plasmid maps in Fig. 7). The opposite orientation of the lacigene in pJW270 and pJW270II was designed to test the effect of an adjacent transcription activity on AT4-mediated gene silencing. As expected, AT4-mediated gene silencing on pbla was observed in pJW270II-AT4 and pJW270II-AT4R when laci was transcribing away from the AT4 DNA inserts (Fig. 7 C, lanes 4–6). Strikingly, the gene-silencing effect was abolished whenlaci was inverted in pJW270-AT4 and pJW270-AT4R (Fig.7 C, lanes 1–3). With a location at the 3′-end of an adjacent transcription unit, AT4 not only exerted no gene-silencing effect on the pbla, but the transcription activity of pbla was actually increased (Fig. 7 C, lanes 2 and 3). This result demonstrates that a parallel (convergently) arrayed adjacent transcription unit abolished AT4-mediated gene silencing. Transcription-driven positive DNA supercoiling at the 3′-end of a transcription unit could be the reason why AT4 function was abolished at such a location. Another interpretation is that AT4 is functional only when it is located at the 5′-end of a transcription unit. For maximum gene-silencing activity, adjacent transcription activities should be transcribing away from the gene silencer. Read-through transcription activity and a 3′-end location of a transcription unit will either weaken or impair AT4-mediated gene silencing. The chromosomal location of AT4 was centered at the −83 position of leuO and at the −351 position of the divergently arrayed leuABCD. In pBR322-AT4, AT4 was located at the −135 position of bla and the −159 position oftetA. Thus it was unclear whether or not AT4 could directly silence pleuABCD at its more distal location (351 bp). If AT4-mediated gene silencing reaches a distance of 351 bp, LeuO may cause pleu-500 activation directly rather than indirectly via a subsequent short-range pleuO(ptac)-pleu-500 interaction. To address this issue, four promoterless DNAs consisting of DNA sequences from the coding region of lacZ were used to sequentially extend the distance between AT4 DNA insert and pbla in pAO-AT4 (illustrated in Fig. 8). The location of AT4 in pAO-AT4 was at the −135 position of bla. The four insertions resulted in plasmids with AT4 located at positions −188, −242, −296, and −350 of bla, respectively. Primer extension results indicated that AT4-mediated gene silencing was slightly reduced but remained effective up to a distance of 296 bp (Fig. 8, lanes 3–5). The gene-silencing effect was completely abolished at the distance of 350 bp (Fig. 8, lane 6). pleu-500 activation has been suggested to be regulated in a complex manner involving sequential promoter activation in theilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. Lilley and Higgins (26Lilley D.M.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have suggested that the transcriptional activity of leuO may be responsible for pleu-500 activation. The present study has experimentally demonstrated the importance of the leuOgene in pleu-500 activation. We have shown that both pleuO and the leuO gene product are required for pleu-500 activation. The function of LeuO is to reverse silencing mediated by the AT4 DNA sequence element, and the function of transcription from pleuO is to provide short-range promoter-promoter interaction for activation of pleu-500(11Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AT-rich DNA that is flanked by the divergently arrayedleuO and leuABCD is found in both S. typhimurium (GenBank™ accession number AF106956) and E. coli (GenBank™ accession number AF 106955). These noncoding, AT-rich DNAs appear to be the regulatory regions for sequential gene activation of the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster (24Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.-J. Wu H.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, these AT-rich intervening DNAs show little DNA sequence homology (14Haughn G.W. Wessler S.R. Gemmill R.M. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AT richness appears to be the only similarity between these DNAs. Previous studies have demonstrated that both the AT-rich DNA as well as the leuO gene are important for pleu-500 activation (6Fang M. Wu H.-Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role(s) of the AT-rich DNA had been unclear. The present study has identified a 72-bp AT4 bacterial gene silencer in the AT-rich DNA. How does a 72-bp A/T-rich DNA sequence element cause the transcriptional repression? AT4 is unlikely affecting transcription activity via a currently known regulatory mechanism, because bacterial transcription-negative regulation is usually functional at a short distance (e.g. within 100 bp). In fact, the binding site of the bacterial regulator often maps directly in the promoter region. For example, the lac repressor binding site (lacoperator) overlaps with the −10 sequence of lac promoter (27Miller J.H. Miller J.H. Reznikoff W.S. The Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 31-88Google Scholar). Hence, the bacterial repressor is usually gene-specific. Acting at a distance (e.g. 1000 bp) is possible via an intervening DNA looping mechanism. Two examples of this include DNA looping-mediated transcriptional activation in nitrogen (ntr) regulation (28Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA looping-mediated transcriptional repression of the araBAD promoter (29Lobell R.B. Schleif R.F. Science. 1990; 250: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, if DNA looping due to protein-protein interaction is important for AT4-mediated gene silencing, the optimum distance for gene silencing should be about 500 bp (30Mossing M.C. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1986; 233: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Using the lacoperator as a model system, it has been experimentally demonstrated that, starting from a distance of ∼150 bp, DNA looping mediated by repressor binding to the operator increased dramatically when the size of the intervening DNA increased. This effect peaked at a distance of 500 bp (30Mossing M.C. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1986; 233: 889-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, AT4 retained its transcriptional repressive effect up to a distance of 300 bp. The repressive effect was abolished at a distance longer than 350 bp (Fig. 8). Starting from a distance of 188 bp up to the 300-bp limit, the repressive effect was slightly reduced rather than dramatically enhanced as one might expect for the above-discussed protein-protein interaction at a distance scenario. This clear difference argues against the possibility that AT4 functions as a binding site for a repressor “acting at a distance,” which represses transcription via a direct contact with the RNA polymerase complex at a distance. What is the mechanism whereby AT4 silences an adjacent transcription activity at a distance of 300 bp? LeuO-mediated reversal effect (Fig.5) has provided a possible clue. Overexpression or underexpression of LeuO has been linked to a number ofhns −-associated phenotypes (23Ueguchi C. Ohta T. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shi X. Bennett G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Klauck E. Böhringer J. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mizuno's group has shown that LeuO relieves bgl silencing in E. coli (23Ueguchi C. Ohta T. Seto C. Suzuki T. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both H-NS and AT-rich DNA flanking thebgl promoter have been shown to be responsible forbgl silencing (33Schnetz K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Schnetz K. Wang J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2422-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Mukerji M. Mahadevan S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, using the pleu-500 activity as a reporter, we have shown genetically that H-NS plays a repressive role in the transcriptional regulation. 2M. Fang and H.Y. Wu, unpublished data. Together, these results suggest a possible involvement of H-NS in AT4-mediated gene silencing. H-NS has been known to bind preferentially to curved DNA (36Yamada H. Yoshida T. Tanaka K. Sasakawa C. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37Owen-Hughes T. Pavitt G.D. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton C.S. Hinton J.C. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Once H-NS is recruited to the local site (the AT-rich DNA sequence element, AT4), the binding cooperativity of H-NS may cause a cis-spreading (oligomerization) of H-NS to the promoter region. The H-NS oligomer may physically block RNA polymerase complex from accessing the promoter (−35 and −10 sequences). The binding cooperativity of H-NS may determine the size of the H-NS oligomer and hence the 300-bp distance limit of the AT4-mediated gene-silencing effect. The proposed mechanism is similar but distinct from the nucleoprotein filament model for the bacterial centromere site-mediated transcriptional silencing, which affects genes within several kilobases (38Rodionov O. Lobocka M. Yarmolinsky M. Science. 1999; 283: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our model is also different from the DNA sequestration-mediated gene silencing model (39Kim S.-K. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8557-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar direct transcriptional repressor role of H-NS was proposed by Ueguchi and Mizuno (40Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). They have shown in vitro that H-NS inhibits proV (proU)-mediated transcription by directly binding to the promoter region. The repressive H-NS complex is strikingly local and highly specific to the DNA sequence in theproV promoter, because H-NS does not affect transcription from ptac on the same DNA molecule (40Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). One or more cis-elements in the proV promoter must be responsible for H-NS recruitment to the local site. The 72-bp AT4 DNA may contain one or more similar elements that trigger H-NS localization in theproV promoter. Because DNA structure rather than the specific DNA sequence is known to be important for H-NS localization (36, 37 and reviewed in Ref. 41Pettijohn D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology, volume 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC.1996: 158-166Google Scholar), no DNA sequence homology is expected between the promoters that utilize such a mechanism in their transcriptional silencing. The idea that DNA structural elements could serve as signals for the formation of a transcriptional repressive nucleoprotein structure may also be applicable to explain the well known eukaryotic heterochromatic gene-silencing mechanism, because high A+T composition and repetitiveness are the two common features for DNA structural elements involved in heterochromatin formation.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of MLCK has provided a number of important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CaM-dependent kinase activation. All isoforms of MLCK include a conserved protein kinase catalytic core (2Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) that is followed immediately by a regulatory segment consisting of autoinhibitory and CaM-binding sequences. The catalytic core is believed to have the distinctive bilobal structure characterized first by the crystal structure of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). A cleft between the lobes defines the catalytic site for substrate phosphorylation. In its inhibited state, the regulatory segment of MLCK maintains numerous contacts with the larger lobe of the catalytic core, including a few sites of contact in the catalytic cleft itself, thus preventing myosin light chain binding and catalysis (4Krueger J.K.

More recently, we showed that substrate binding induces a closure of the catalytic cleft and a reorientation of CaM that allows for more extensive surface contact between the catalytic core and the N-terminal sequence of CaM (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CaM has two globular Ca2+-binding lobes connected by a central helix (9Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) that functions as a “flexible tether” (10Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol.

The concept of the flexible tether function obtained its strongest support from structural studies of CaM complexed with isolated peptides containing the core CaM-binding sequences from kinases that show CaM undergoes a dramatic conformational collapse (11Meador W.E.

A similar conformational collapse of CaM was observed in scattering studies of its complex with a catalytically competent skMLCK (7Krueger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The known structures of all the CaM·peptide complexes show little or no interaction between the N-terminal leader sequence of CaM (residues 1–8, ADQLTEEQ) and the bound peptides. Nevertheless, deletion of residues 2–8 results in a CaM mutant (ΔNCaM) that binds with high affinity but completely fails to activate skMLCK (16Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mutant protein also has a reduced capacity to activate the smooth muscle form of the kinase but can fully activate neuronal nitric-oxide synthase activity, suggesting that the N-terminal leader sequence plays a specialized role in a subset of CaM-target complexes. We present here the results of scattering experiments on ΔNCaM and native CaM in their respective complexes with a catalytically competent skMLCK (17Gao Z.-H. Zhim G. Herring B.P. Moomaw C. Deogny L. Slaughter C.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10125-10135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that reveal the dramatic structural basis for the inability of ΔNCaM to activate skMLCK catalysis. The ΔNCaM was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described in (16Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CaM, skMLCK, and the complexes were prepared as described in (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All samples contained excess Ca2+ so that the CaMs were Ca2+ saturated. Buffer conditions were 25 mmMOPS, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5% glycerol. Scattering data were acquired using the x-ray instruments at Los Alamos (18Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A. Zhao J. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and reduced toI(Q) versus Q as described in (18Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Q is (4πsinθ)/λ where θ is half the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the scattered radiation. Structural information is derived by calculating the inverse Fourier transform ofI(Q), which yields P(r), the probable frequency distribution of interatomic vectors, r, within the scattering molecule (calculated using the program GNOM (20Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar)). P(r) goes to zero at the maximum linear dimension, d max, of the scattering particle and its zeroth and second moments give forward scatter, I 0 and radius of gyration,R g, respectively. The forward scatter,I 0, is directly proportional to the product of the protein concentration, c, (in mg/ml) and the molecular weight of the scattering molecule, M. I 0 is thus very sensitive to changes in the size of the scattering particle because of complex formation or aggregation. Model I(Q) andP(r) profiles for the two ellipsoid models were calculated using SASMODEL (21Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which uses a rapid Monte Carlo integration routine to generate model P(r) functions (18Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The P(r) and I(Q) profiles based on models using crystal structure coordinates were calculated using PRPDB (19Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A. Zhao J. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both SASMODEL and PRPDB calculate I(Q) as the Fourier transformation ofP(r). P(r) and I(Q) functions are then compared with the experimental data by calculating χ2 for the experimental and model I(Q) profiles, χ2=(1/N)∑(Iobs−Icalc)2/ς2Equation 1 where the summation is over N, the number of Q values for which I(Q) is measured, I obs is the observed intensity at each Q value, ς is the S.D. for each I obs, and I calc is the calculated intensity at each Q value for the model being tested. A value of 1.0 is a perfect fit with the observed data within the errors. The scattering data (Fig.1 A) for free ΔNCaM indicate it has a slightly more compact structure than native CaM (TableI). Fig. 1 C compares the vector length distribution functions, P(r), for the two proteins. Based on calculations of model P(r) functions using the crystal structure for CaM (not shown), this difference can be accounted for solely by the deletion of the N-terminal residues in the mutant protein. The scattering data thus indicate that ΔNCaM has a two lobed structure, similar to native CaM. In contrast, the solution structures of the ΔNCaM and CaM complexes with skMLCK differ dramatically. The experiments on the complexes were performed with and without substrates; a peptide containing the phosphorylation sequence from myosin regulatory light chain (pRLC, sequence KKRAARATSNVFS) and a nonhydrolyzable analog of adenosine-triphosphate (AMPPNP). The same differences were observed between the native CaM and ΔNCaM complexes in the presence or absence of substrates. We used data collected in the presence of the substrates for our analyses, because the native CaM·skMLCK complex is less prone to aggregation under these conditions. The I 0 values indicate that the protein solutions contain monodisperse particles with the molecular weights expected for 1:1 complexes (Table I). As we have reported previously (7Krueger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the P(r) function andR g value for the CaM·skMLCK complex (Fig.1 D) indicates an elongated structure (Table I). In contrast, data for the ΔNCaM·skMLCK complex indicate a more symmetrical structure, evident in its significantly smallerd max and R g values (TableI).Table IStructural parameters for ΔNCaM, CaM, and their respective complexes with skMLCK in the presence of substrates (AMPPNP and myosin light chain peptide)ProteinR gd maxI 0cI 0/c/M 1-aM is the molecular weight of scattering particle, c is the protein concentration.

Open table in a new tab To gain further insights to the relative sizes and dispositions of CaM or ΔNCaM and skMLCK, we simulated x-ray scattering data using SASMODEL (see “Materials and Methods”). Each complex was modeled as two uniform density ellipsoids, representing CaM or ΔNCaM and skMLCK. During this procedure the ellipsoids were required to be in contact, and their dimensions were loosely constrained to be in a range consistent with the dimensions for CaM and skMLCK determined in previous scattering studies (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specifically, the ellipsoid semi-axis lengths were constrained to be in the ranges 38–48 Å, 23–35 Å, and 16–22 Å for skMLCK and 22–28 Å, 18–24 Å, and 14–19 Å for CaM. For the ΔNCaM complex, we also allowed the bound ΔNCaM to assume the more elongated shape associated with its uncomplexed state, to test the possibility that the ΔNCaM might not collapse upon binding. In each calculation, ∼104different models were tested, with randomly chosen ellipsoid dimensions, relative orientations, and contact points. The best-fit models are depicted in Fig. 2(green crosses), and their respective fits (χ2) and structural parameters are given in TableII. As expected, the model for the native CaM·skMLCK complex is similar to the one proposed previously based on neutron contrast variation data for the complex with deuterated CaM (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Contrast variation allows us to readily distinguish CaM and skMLCK in the complex, and we therefore were able to unequivocally assign the smaller ellipsoid to the CaM. The model for the ΔNCaM·skMLCK complex indicates individual ellipsoid dimensions similar to those for the native CaM·skMLCK complex. We therefore conclude that, like native CaM, ΔNCaM collapses about the core CaM-binding sequence of the kinase in this complex. A most significant difference between the complexes is that bound ΔNCaM is more centrally located with respect to the long axis of the kinase than the bound native protein.Table IIParameters for the best-fit models to the data and dimensions of the ellipsoids for CaM·skMLCK and ΔNCaM·skMLCKTwo ellipsoid modelsχ2R g values (Å)Ellipsoid semi-axis dimensions2-aThe dimensions obtained in these calculations compare well with the values obtained for CaM·skMLCK, with bound substrates, using neutron contrast variation and deuterated CaM; CaM (26.4, 22.4, 16.5) and skMLCK (41.3, 24.0, 16.4) (8).

Open table in a new tab To evaluate how sensitive the scattering data are to the position of CaM or ΔNCaM relative to the catalytic cleft in the kinase, we performed additional calculations using higher resolution structural models. We modeled the catalytic core of skMLCK using the crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cPKA (Ref. 3Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, PDB accession number 2cpk) and SwissModel, an automated homology modeling package (22Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The cPKA and skMLCK catalytic cores have 29.4% amino acid sequence identity and 61% sequence similarity, making cPKA a good template for homology modeling. For sequences with 30–40% sequence identity, homology modeling can yield structures that give backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) values from experimentally derived structures as low as 1.5 Å (23Sanchez R. Sali A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To model bound CaM or ΔNCaM, we used the NMR structure for CaM complexed with a peptide based on the core CaM binding sequence in skMLCK (MLCK-I, Ref. 14Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, PDB accession number 2bbm), deleting residues 2–8 for the complex with ΔNCaM. The skMLCK model does not account for 32 N-terminal residues and 52 C-terminal residues in the kinase, as they have no corresponding sequences in cPKA. However, of the C-terminal residues, 23 are accounted for by the core CaM-binding sequence. Thus, the structural models for the complexes account for ∼90% of the skMLCK sequence. Simulated scattering data for the ΔNCaM or CaM complexes with skMLCK were generated by positioning the modeled components relative to each other and calculating the expected scattering profiles using PRPDB (see “Materials and Methods”). Two approaches were used. The first was to randomly orient and position the components with respect to each other while loosely constraining the distance between their centers of mass to be no more than 60 Å (22,400 models tested). Using this approach, ideal χ2 values (χ2 = 1.00) were obtained for both complexes. In the second approach, the two components were placed in the same arbitrary relative positions, and the CaM·MLCK-I component was systematically moved through every position on a 5 Å grid extending ± 50 Å in each of the x, y, and z directions (9,261 possible x, y, z coordinates tested). The best-fit model identified from the 5 Å grid search was further refined by performing a finer grid search (1Å resolution, ±5 Å in each direction, 1,331 possible x, y, z coordinates tested). In a final refinement step, the two components were randomly rotated about their origins in all directions (125,000 different orientations tested). Using this approach we also were able to obtain χ2 values of 1.00 for both the CaM·skMLCK and ΔNCaM·skMLCK complexes. The relative positions of skMLCK and CaM based on the random search and the systematic grid search were equivalent, giving RMSD main chain deviations between the differently derived models of 0.22 and 0.26 Å for the CaM·skMLCK and ΔNCaM·skMLCK complexes, respectively. Fig.2 shows the backbone traces of the best-fit higher resolution model for each complex, overlaid with its corresponding best-fit ellipsoid model. For both complexes, there is excellent agreement in the positions of each component determined using the two modeling approaches. Similar to our previous analysis based on neutron scattering data, the higher resolution model for the skMLCK component does not completely fill the ellipsoid dimensions calculated using the x-ray scattering data, which is to be expected given the N- and C-terminal sequence segments omitted from the homology model. The best-fits to the scattering data obtained using the higher resolution structural models predict a specific orientation of the kinase catalytic cleft with respect to bound CaM or ΔNCaM (see Fig.2). To evaluate the sensitivity of the scattering data to the relative orientations of the CaM and kinase components, we performed additional calculations in which they were rotated about the three perpendicular axes defined by their associated best-fit ellipsoids. The rotations allowed us to test different orientations of the kinase and CaM structures while leaving the ellipsoid envelopes unperturbed. At each rotation angle (sampled in 30° steps) a translation search of ± 5 Å in the x, y, and z directions with a 1 Å step size was performed to optimize the translation for each rotation angle. The best-fit obtained after this translational search was considered the best one for that rotation angle. Fig. 3 presents a plot of the best χ2 values obtained for the calculated scattering profiles and the experimental data at each rotation angle. All rotations of the kinase or CaM components away from their positions in the starting best-fit models result in significantly poorer fits for both complexes. The sensitivity to rotation angle is greatest for the kinase component, which shows the narrowest and deepest minimum with respect to this parameter, presumably because of its more irregular shape. In contrast, fits for the CaM and ΔNCaM structures go through shallower and broader minima in χ2 as a function of rotation angle. In the best-fit models for both complexes, the CaM-binding peptide of MLCK is positioned with its N terminus pointing toward the kinase, which allows it to be connected with this sequence. In addition, the N-terminal helix of CaM in the native complex is in contact with the kinase, as was observed for the model derived from the neutron contrast variation data (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The I(Q) functions derived from the best-fit models for each complex are compared with the experimental I(Q) and P(r) data in Fig. 1,B and D, respectively. Because of the potential importance of the changes in CaM residues 1–8 in the activation mechanism (16Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), three peptides were synthesized for competitive binding studies; the native sequence, the native sequence with Glu residues substituted for Ala, and a scrambled native sequence. None of these peptides affected the catalysis or CaM activation properties at 1 mm (data not shown). This result suggests that the N-terminal sequence is not simply functioning as a latch to hold bound CaM in the requisite position away from the catalytic site. Our results indicate that removal of the N-terminal leader sequence from CaM results in a complex with skMLCK in which the mutant protein blocks the catalytic cleft. This result is in stark contrast with the complex with native CaM, in which bound CaM appears to translocate so that the catalytic cleft is exposed, and the N-terminal helix of CaM interacts with the C-terminal portion of the catalytic core. The higher resolution modeling of the native CaM·skMLCK complex also resolves the ambiguity that remained in the interpretation of the original two ellipsoid modeling of the neutron data regarding which side of the kinase, with respect to the catalytic cleft, is the CaM-binding site (8Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13997-14004Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In both native and mutant complexes CaM adopts a collapsed structure in which both lobes likely interact with the core CaM-binding sequence in the kinase. These results are consistent with the fact that although native CaM and ΔNCaM bind skMLCK with equal affinities only the native protein is capable of activating the kinase catalytic function (16Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The inability of ΔNCaM to activate the kinase would appear to be due at least in part to its blocking of the catalytic cleft. In this position, it may also fail to disrupt autoinhibitory interactions with the catalytic core. In contrast, a translocation of bound native CaM exposes the catalytic cleft and likely also disrupts interactions between the catalytic core and the autoinhibitory sequence, thus allowing catalysis to proceed. The precise role of the N-terminal leader sequence in facilitating translocation of bound CaM is not fully resolved. The simplest interpretation is that CaM residues 2–8 facilitate displacement of an autoinhibitory region flanking the core CaM-binding sequence in the kinase, allowing translocation of bound CaM to a position at the end of the C-terminal lobe of the enzyme, thereby allowing substrate binding to the exposed catalytic cleft."
https://openalex.org/W2110902093,"Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on several areas of MutH based on the similarity of MutH andPvuII structural models. The aims were to identify DNA-binding residues; to determine whether MutH has the same mechanism for DNA binding and catalysis as PvuII; and to localize the residues responsible for MutH stimulation by MutL. No DNA-binding residues were identified in the two flexible loop regions of MutH, although similar loops in PvuII are involved in DNA binding. Two histidines in MutH are in a similar position as two histidines (His-84 and His-85) in PvuII that signal for DNA binding and catalysis. These MutH histidines (His-112 and His-115) were changed to alanines, but the mutant proteins had wild-type activity both in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that the MutH signal for DNA binding and catalysis remains unknown. Instead, a lysine residue (Lys-48) was found in the first flexible loop that functions in catalysis together with the three presumed catalytic amino acids (Asp-70, Glu-77, and Lys-79). Two deletion mutations (MutHΔ224 and MutHΔ214) in the C-terminal end of the protein, localized the MutL stimulation region to five amino acids (Ala-220, Leu-221, Leu-222, Ala-223, and Arg-224).

MutH is the endonuclease in the methyl-directed mismatch repair system (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), which, along with MutS and MutL (and bound ATP), initiates the repair process (2Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MutS binds specifically to mismatched bases or deletion/insertion loops of one to four nucleotides (3Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 4Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MutL appears to be a helper protein; it interacts with other proteins to increase their DNA binding or converts them to the active form (6Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MutL appears to activate MutH for DNA binding and cutting the unmethylated strand of hemimethylated DNA based on endonuclease assays (7Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, mismatch repair takes place shortly after replication before the DNA becomes fully methylated (the newly synthesized daughter strand is unmethylated). MutH in the ternary complex binds to a hemimethylated d(GATC) site, recognizes the asymmetry of the unmethylated N6 position of the d(A) (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Pukkila P.J. Peterson J. Herman G. Modrich P. Meselson M. Genetics. 1983; 104: 571-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cleaves 5′ to the d(G) in the unmethylated strand leaving ligatable ends. If both strands are unmethylated, MutH is able to cleave both sites independently (dissociating after the first d(GATC) cut, with a second binding and cleavage event) leaving a four-base overhang (2Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although MutS is thought to bind heteroduplex DNA first, followed by MutL and MutH, it is unclear what the binding order is for these proteins. It is also unclear in the ternary complex whether MutH acts as a monomer or (like restriction endonucleases) as a dimer. The purified protein with a calculated molecular mass of 25.5 kDa is a monomer in solution. Recently, the structure of the MutH protein was solved (11Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It was described as resembling a clamp with a large cleft dividing the protein into two subdomains. From the three structures analyzed, it was shown that the two subdomains adopt multiple conformations that correlate with movement in the C-terminal end of the protein. This suggests that the C-terminal-exposed helix is a possible site through which MutL stimulation occurs. It was postulated that DNA lies in the bottom of the cleft in close proximity to residues Asp-70, Glu-77, and Lys-79, which would constitute the active site for catalysis. The catalytic sequence of D(X)6–30(E/D)XK was proposed for MutH based on the close resemblance to the structure of the restriction endonuclease PvuII (with a root mean square deviation of 2.3 over 83 pairs of Cα atoms) (11Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both enzymes share a common core motif with a number of other restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRV, and EcoRI) (12Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). These restriction enzymes are grouped according to their similarity in structure as well as function (PvuII and EcoRV are in one group and BamHI and EcoRI are in another). It was surprising that MutH is closer in structure toPvuII than BamHI, because PvuII approaches DNA from the minor groove and makes contacts in the major groove by reaching around the DNA with flexible loops to produce blunt ends. BamHI, however, approaches DNA from the major groove where the base-specific contacts are made to produce cuts with a four-base overhang. In addition, BamHI has a recognition site with d(GATC) as the central bases and cuts 5′ to the d(G). There is no structure available of MutH complexed with its cognate DNA, so it is not known from which direction MutH approaches the DNA and whether it acts as a monomer or dimer in the repair complex. Given the close similarity in structure between MutH and PvuII, we altered amino acids in MutH based on the corresponding functional regions ofPvuII. KM54 (ΔmutH461::Cam) was constructed by electroporation of strain KM22 (Δ (recC ptr recB recD)::Plac red Kan) (20Murphy K.C. J.

GM7586 was generated by P1 transduction of GM4244 (CC106 (15Horst J.P. Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) with a lysate grown on KM54 and selecting for chloram phenicol resistance. Isogenic strains GM4244 and GM7586 (GM4244 ΔmutH461::Cam) were used for the in vivo screen. Strain GM3856 (hsdR17 endA1 thi-1 spoT1 rfbO1 supE44 mutH471::Tn5) was also used for the overexpression of wild-type MutH and the mutant proteins. Strain GM5862 (16Aronshtam A. Marinus M.G.

Belin D. Carson M. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) derivative containing themutH gene with an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence from the plasmid TX417 (18Feng G. Winkler M.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar). The ∼1-kb mutH fragment was obtained by digestion of pTX417 with the restriction enzymes XbaI andHindIII. The fragment also contains several hundred base pairs of chromosomal DNA distal to the mutH gene. pTX417 was kindly provided by M. Winkler (University of Texas Medical School, Houston TX). Plasmid pMQ393 contains the wild-type His-taggedmutL gene in a pACYC184 backbone (6Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was made with 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, and 1 ml of 1m sodium hydroxide per liter of water. The YT medium and TAE buffer were made according to Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin (Amp), chloramphenicol (Cam), and rifampicin (Rif) were added to media at 100, 30, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Two-stage PCR-mediated mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described by Murphy (14Murphy K.C. Campellone K.G. Poteete A.R. Gene. 2000; 246: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). After each PCR reaction, the products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The full-length product was cut with BglII andHindIII for 1 h at 37 °C and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and purified before ligation to the similarly cut pMQ402 backbone. The ligation was carried out overnight at 14 °C, and the mixture was transformed into CC106 (14Murphy K.C. Campellone K.G. Poteete A.R. Gene. 2000; 246: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) for recovery. Transformant colonies were streaked out several times, and a single colony was inoculated in L ampicillin broth for overnight growth. Plasmid DNA was isolated using QIAprep Spin Miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced to identify the mutations. When secondary mutations were present, the sequence containing the correct mutation was removed by restriction enzyme digestion and religated to a similarly cut pMQ402 backbone. The mutH gene of the resulting plasmid was then sequenced to confirm the mutational change. The two outside flanking primers for PCR and sequencing were MM247 (5′-CATCACAGCAGCGGCCTGG-3′) (Operon Technologies) for the forward reactions and MM248 (5′-CAGACCGCTTCTGCG-3′) (Operon Technologies) for the reverse reactions. Amber stop codons were placed into the mutH sequence at codons 215 and 225 using the Sculpture mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition, the plasmid containing the 215 mutation also incorporated an A to C change within codon 213, changing the amino acid at this position from leucine to valine. The MutHΔ224 mutant has the last 5 amino acids of the C terminus removed (HFLIQ) and the MutHΔ214 mutant has the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus removed (KNFTSALLARHFLIQ). All DNA sequencing was carried out by the DNA Sequencing Facility at Iowa State University. Both strands of wild-type MutH and the promoter region were sequenced. We used themutH sequence in GenBank™, accession number U16361. The site-directed PCR mutants were identified by sequencing with the outside flanking primers used in the PCR reactions. Both strands and the promoter region of all mutant plasmids were sequenced. The wild-type and all mutant proteins were purified in the same manner. For each strain, a 20-ml LB-Amp culture was grown overnight from a single colony. One liter of LB-Amp medium was inoculated with the 20-ml overnight culture and allowed to grow with shaking at 37 °C to anA 600 of 1.0. Arabinose (Difco) was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the culture was induced for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 5000 rpm, washed with water, and stored frozen (−80 °C). The pellet was thawed and resuspended with 4 ml of reconstitution buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed using a French pressure cell. The extract was then sonicated (20 pulses from a Tekmar sonicator) and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to a 4-ml Fast Flow Chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column charged with 100 mm NiCl2 and equilibrated with the reconstitution buffer. Step fractions of 100, 150, 250, and 400 mm imidazole (10 ml each) were used to elute the MutH protein. The 250 mm fraction contained the MutH protein and was dialyzed against two changes of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The MutH concentration was determined by measuring theA 280 (1 A = 0.67 mg/ml). MutH was at least 95% pure as determined by a SDS-PAGE Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel. The His-tagged MutL protein was purified as described previously (6Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), except that the transformation mixture of GM5862 with pMQ393 was incubated for 90 min after heat shock and then added to 50 ml of YT-Cam medium for overnight incubation at 37 °C. The step fractions used for elution from the Sepharose column were one 100 mm, two 150 mm, and one 400 mm Imidazole (10 ml each). The 400 mm fraction contained the MutL protein, which was dialyzed against two changes of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The concentration of MutL was determined by measuring the A 280 (1A = 1.24 mg/ml). The protein was at least 90% pure as determined by a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Native MutL was graciously provided by Dr. Paul Modrich and Dr. Claudia Spampinato (Duke University). The in vivo screen is based on the mutator phenotype, which occurs when the cells lack one or more of the Mut proteins (21Wu T.-H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria accumulate mutations at a greater frequency than wild-type, and this can be monitored by selection on plates with rifampicin. The vector plasmid (pBAD18) and the wild-type MutH plasmid (pMQ402) were transformed into strains GM4244 and GM7586 and used as controls. The mutant plasmids were transformed into GM7586 for complementation testing and GM4244 for dominant-negative screening. A single colony was inoculated into 1 ml of L-Amp broth, grown overnight at 37 °C, diluted 10−6, and 50 μl was spread on L plates with and without ampicillin. The rifampicin plates were spread with 200 μl of undiluted wild-type culture (GM4244), 100 μl of undiluted mutant culture (GM7586) and 50 μl of undilutedmutH plasmid mutant cultures. Two cultures (from two separate colonies) were grown for each test and each culture was plated twice. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and colonies were counted the next day. The L plates were used to monitor loss of plasmids due to high cellular amounts of MutH. No arabinose was included in the plates, because this leads to loss of viability. The plasmid produces enough MutH protein to compliment the mutHstrain without adding arabinose to the plates. Bacteriophage MR1 is a derivative of phage f1R229 that contains only one d(GATC) site (22Lahue R.S. Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The covalently closed replicative form (RF) of this phage was purified as previously described from chloramphenicol-treated infected GM2807 (dam-16::Kan) cells (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The MR1 phage was provided by Dr. R. Lahue (University of Nebraska). Enzyme activity (amounts are indicated in the figures) was tested at 37 °C in a 10-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.7), 5 mm MgCl2, and 25 fmol of MR1 for 1 h. MutL and ATP were added at 71 pmol and 1.25 mm, respectively, in the MutH endonuclease stimulation assays. The assays were carried out with native MutL or His-tagged MutL. The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of a 50% glycerol solution containing 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% Xylene Cyanol. The reactions were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel at 5 V/cm for 3 h. The gels were stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h with shaking. The gels were then scanned on a PhosphorImager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics), and the amount of nicking was quantitated using the ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics) software. Any nicked substrate detected in the negative control was subtracted from the amount seen with the proteins added. A 36-base pair (bp) DNA oligonucleotide, MM40, 5′-GCATACGGAAGTTAAAGTGCGGATCATCTCTAGCCA-3′ (Operon Technologies) containing a single, centrally located d(GATC) site, was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (New England BioLabs). A concentration, 2 μm, of the oligonucleotide was used in a 12-μl reaction with 1.2 μl of PNK buffer, 1 μl of PNK enzyme, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and water to a final concentration of 0.5 μm oligonucleotide. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then 10 min at 75 °C. 2 μm cold complementary oligonucleotide (containing the N6-methyl adenine in the d(GATC) site) was added with water to a final volume of 100 μl. This was incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, 30 min at 37 °C, and 30 min at room temperature. The unincorporated and single-strand DNA were removed using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the labeled homoduplex DNA resuspended in a final volume of 100 μl of water. A 5× reaction mixture with 50 μl of the labeled homoduplex and 50 μl of 10× AR buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) was made for the band shift assay. MutH binding to DNA was assayed using the labeled homoduplex prepared as described previously (4Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a 5-μl reaction volume, there was 22.5 fmol of the labeled homoduplex (1 μl of the 5× reaction mixture) and MutH, which was added in varying concentrations (water makes up the remainder of the reaction volume). MutL and ATP were added at 9 pmol and 1.25 mm, respectively, in the stimulation assays. The mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1.6 μl of a 50% sucrose solution and loaded on a prerun (10 min) 6% native polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (pH 7.5) and electrophoresed at 50 mA for 2.5 h. The gel was then laid on a PhosphorImager screen overnight for scanning on the Storm Imager (Molecular Dynamics). The free DNA and shifted band intensities were quantitated to determine binding ability using ImageQuaNT software. Apparent dissociation constants (K d) were determined by fitting the quantitated experimental data to the equation 1/r = 1 +K d/[C]total(f = 1-r, where f is the degree of dissociation) with the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The degree of binding or association is r and [C]total is the protein concentration in the reaction. After a comparison of the MutH and PvuII structural models, areas in MutH were found that resembled functional areas of PvuII (Fig.1). There were three areas targeted for mutagenesis in MutH. The first area was the flexible loop between the second and third α helices (loop BC). The second was the C1 loop between the third α helix and the first β sheet (where the catalytic residues start). These areas target flexible loops ofPvuII that make contact with DNA backbone phosphates and recognition bases (23Horton N.C. Nastri H.G. Riggs P.D. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Nastri H.G. Evans P.D. Walker I.H. Riggs P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25761-25767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MutH could make the same contacts if it approaches DNA from the minor groove. Loop BC residues Pro-41 to Gly-49 and loop C1 residues Leu-59 to Gln-69 (except for Ala-61 and Ala-63) in MutH were changed to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The third area of PvuII contains conserved histidines (His-84 and His-85) that signal binding of the DNA to allow catalysis to take place and serve as protein-protein contacts (25Horton N.C. Bonventre J. Cheng X. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These histidines are also present in MutH (His-112 and His-115) and may serve as the same signal for MutH. Histidine112 and histidine 115 were also changed to alanines to test this possibility. Based on the MutH crystal structure, it was suggested that the C-terminal tail region is contacted by MutL to stimulate the MutH endonuclease activity (7Hall M.C. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1306-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, two deletion mutants were made with the creation of amber stop codons. MutH Δ214 and MutH Δ224 (the number of the last residue present in the protein) were made to narrow down the area where MutL might stimulate MutH activity. After checking that there were no secondary mutations in each of the mutant MutH plasmids, they were transformed into strains GM4244 (wild-type) and GM7586 (ΔmutH::Cam). The null mutation inmutH was constructed, because the commonly usedmutH471::Tn5 mutation is not completely defective in our assays. 2T. Loh, K. C. Murphy, and M. G. Marinus, unpublished data.. The mutant MutH plasmids in GM4244 were tested for a dominant-negative phenotype (mutator phenotype in a wild-type strain) by the same method as the in vivo screen described under “Experimental Procedures.” None of the mutant plasmids gave a dominant-negative phenotype (data not shown). For the complementation testing in strain GM7586, the controls (GM7586versus pMQ402 in GM7586) show that the wild-type MutH protein causes a 200-fold reduction in the frequency to rifampicin resistance, indicating efficient complementation of the chromosomal ΔmutH::Cam allele (TableI). The vector plasmid (pBAD18) causes a small reduction in the mutation frequency and doesn't interfere with the complementation testing. No alterations in mutation frequency were seen in GM4244 with the control plasmids (pBAD18 and pMQ402). Very few of the MutH site-directed mutants showed a mutator phenotype. Plasmid Δ214-containing cells show a strong mutator phenotype along with mutants K48A and G49A. These three were chosen for further biochemical studies. A few others were also chosen to validate the screen and for the following specific reasons. The D47A mutant was used because of the Asp-34 analogous position in the PvuII structure that recognizes the d(A) in the recognition sequence for PvuII (23Horton N.C. Nastri H.G. Riggs P.D. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The H115A and H112A mutants were used because of the signaling properties of the PvuII histidines (His-84 and His-85) described earlier.

Open table in a new tab The steady-state level of MutH produced by wild-type and mutant constructs was determined by Western blotting (New England BioLabs). All of the mutant plasmids produced comparable amounts of MutH to the wild-type plasmid in strain GM3856 (data not shown). This assay tests for the endonuclease function of the MutH protein. The product of the reaction is a nick in the MR1 covalently closed circular molecule, which has only one d(GATC) site. In the absence of MutL, increasing amounts of the wild-type MutH protein were added to the duplex until complete nicking was achieved (Fig. 2 A and Fig.3 A). The addition of 2.5–3.0 pmol of wild-type protein resulted in complete nicking of the substrate. The results of the endonuclease assay for the remaining three mutants (K48A, G49A, and Δ214) are shown below the wild-type in Fig. 2 A. K48A has no detectable endonuclease activity and G49A activity is decreased ∼30-fold (Fig. 3 A). D47A, H112A, H115A, and Δ224 MutH proteins gave the same result as wild-type and were not tested further (data not shown). These results were in agreement with the in vivo screen, because the mutation frequencies in cells with these proteins (D47A, H112A, and H115A) were similar to the mutation frequency of the wild-type MutH protein in strain GM7586 (ΔmutH::Cam). A circular dichroism experiment was performed on the K48A mutant protein because of the lack of activity without MutL present in the endonuclease assay. The results showed that the K48A mutant protein was folded similarly to the wild-type MutH protein (data not shown). A circular dichroism experiment was also performed on the Δ214 mutant protein, because the entire last helix had been removed and may have resulted in large structural changes for the protein. The results showed that the Δ214 mutant protein was folded similarly to the wild-type MutH protein with the curve exhibiting more of the expected β sheet-like properties due to the loss of the large α helix in the protein (data not shown).Figure 3Comparison of wild-type and mutant MutH endonuclease activity.

To elucidate its role, we purified the protein to near homogeneity and analyzed its interactions with different nucleic acids using gel retardation assays and footprinting experiments. We show that RepE is monomeric in solution and binds specifically, rapidly, and durably to the origin at a unique double-stranded binding site immediately upstream from the initiation site of DNA replication. The binding induces only a weak bend (31°). Unexpectedly, RepE also binds nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA with a 2–4-fold greater affinity than for double-stranded origin. On a supercoiled plasmid, RepE binding to the double-stranded origin leads to the denaturation of the AT-rich sequence immediately downstream from the binding site to form an open complex. This open complex is atypical since (i) its formation requires neither multiple RepE binding sites on the double-stranded origin nor strong bending of the origin, (ii) it occurs in the absence of any cofactors (only RepE and supercoiling are required), and (iii) its melted region serves as a substrate for RepE binding. These original properties together with the fact that pAMβ1 replication depends on a transcription step through the origin on DNA polymerase I to initiate replication and on a primosome to load the replisome suggest that the main function of RepE is to assist primer generation at the origin.

These original properties together with the fact that pAMβ1 replication depends on a transcription step through the origin on DNA polymerase I to initiate replication and on a primosome to load the replisome suggest that the main function of RepE is to assist primer generation at the origin. DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a multiprotein complex able to carry on strand separation, primer synthesis, and a rapid, accurate, and concerted synthesis of the continuous and discontinuous strands. At the onset of replication, replisome assembly is generally orchestrated by a protein or a multiprotein complex called initiator. The initiator recognizes and binds specific or preferential sites in DNA molecules (the origin), melts these regions by causing a structural distortion of the DNA, and initiates the loading of the replisome through protein-protein interactions.The most thoroughly characterized initiator is the Escherichia coli DnaA protein, which possesses conserved homologues in all known bacteria (see for review Ref. 1Kaguni J.M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 145-157Google Scholar). Various properties have been attributed to DnaA, such as sequence-specific DNA binding, oligomerization, protein-protein interactions, membrane binding, ATP and ADP binding, and ATPase activity (1Kaguni J.M.

At the onset of chromosome replication, the ATP-bound form of DnaA binds as a monomer to the chromosomal origin at five 9-bp 1bp, base pair(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBD, chitin binding domain; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide(s); OP-Cu, 1,10-orthophenanthroline-copper;ori, replication origin; Pol I, DNA polymerase I; RNA pol, RNA polymerase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Bicine,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; ORC, origin recognition complex.1bp, base pair(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; CBD, chitin binding domain; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide(s); OP-Cu, 1,10-orthophenanthroline-copper;ori, replication origin; Pol I, DNA polymerase I; RNA pol, RNA polymerase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Bicine,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; ORC, origin recognition complex. repeated sequences called DnaA boxes. It then oligomerizes to form a large nucleoprotein structure containing 20–40 DnaA molecules. The structure confers single-stranded character to a flanking AT-rich region (13-mer), forming an intermediate termed the open complex (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The process requires negative supercoiling, either IHF or HU, and is activated by transcription and possibly by a direct interaction between DnaA and the AT-rich region (4Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). DnaA, with the help of DnaC, then recruits the host DNA helicase DnaB to the exposed single-stranded region. DnaB enlarges the unwound region and subsequently loads alone or together with DnaA the primase DnaG and the DNA polymerase III (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 45-85Google Scholar). Open complex formation occurs via specific binding of the initiator to repeated sequences (the iterons), oligomerization of the initiator, and eventually local DNA distortions such as bending, untwisting, or wrapping. However, this formation generally also requires DnaA and the help of cofactors including structural proteins (IHF, Fis, HU, SSB) or structural DNA determinants (intrinsically bent DNAs, AT-rich regions, sequences of natural instability such as DNA unwinding elements, or supercoiling of the DNA; reviewed in Refs. 11Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

Aside from the apparent consensual role of the initiators in origin binding and denaturation, variations occur in their ability to participate in steps after open complex formation. Some initiators (but not all) act similarly to DnaA, as a “landing pad” for replisome assembly. For instance, the UL9 initiator of herpes simplex virus-1 interacts with the cellular DNA polymerase-α primase, the helicase-primase complex, and the processivity polymerase factor (13Challberg M. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 721-750Google Scholar). Likewise, the plasmid initiators π of R6K and RepA of pSC101 are known or supposed to interact with DnaA, the replicative helicase DnaB, the primase DnaG, and the τ subunit of DNA polymerase III (14Ratnakar P.V.

Initiators can also be helicases (T-antigen of simian virus 40 (17Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6000-6014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), whereas others are primases (Rep of ColE2 (20Takechi S. Matsui H. Itoh T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5141-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) or seem to have no extra activities apart from origin binding, bending, and melting (TrfA of RK2 (21Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)).θ replicons that do not code for any initiator protein are a noticeable exception to this general scheme. They still initiate DNA replication at preferential sites, but these origins do not carry the relevant features usually found in the initiator-dependent replicons (see above). The initiation mechanism of these systems, such as the E. coli plasmid ColE1, phages T4, or T7 and the mitochondrial DNA of metazoans, mainly relies on the RNA polymerase (RNA pol), which provides the initial primer for DNA synthesis (22Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1992Google Scholar). In phage T7, RNA pol stops at the origin by an unknown mechanism, and the arrested transcript serves as a primer to initiate DNA synthesis. In ColE1, phage T4, and mitochondrial DNA replication, although RNA pol transcribes the origin, an R-loop is formed. The RNA strand of the R-loop is then processed by a RNaseH activity into the primer used to initiate leading strand synthesis. In ColE1, the primer is extended by Pol I, which unwinds the downstream region, leading to formation of D-loop structures, allowing, successively, recruitment of PriA or DnaABC primosomes and of full replisome (23Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Seufert W. Messer W. Cell. 1987; 48: 73-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Another exception to the general scheme of initiation is plasmids of the pAMβ1 family from Gram-positive bacteria. Although they encode an initiator protein, they require for replication a small unstructured origin and a transcription step through the origin by the host RNA pol (25Bruand C. Le Chatelier E. Ehrlich S.D. Jannière L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11668-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are dependent on Pol I and independent of DnaA (25Bruand C. Le Chatelier E. Ehrlich S.D. Jannière L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11668-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Ceglowski P. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. FEMS Microbiol.

The Horizontal Gene Pool: Bacterial Plasmids and Gene Spread. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, NL2000: 1-47Google Scholar). The small origin (44 bp) does not possess some of the features found in other initiator-dependent plasmids, such as iterons, to allow binding of more than one monomer. However, it contains a 16-bp-long AT-rich region (88β AT against 68β for the whole origin). This AT-rich region is located immediately downstream from the initiation site of replication, itself located in the middle of the origin (29Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Jannière L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2171-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The functions of both the transcription step and the initiator are unknown. The initiator, RepE, is a basic protein of 496 amino acids with no homologues in the data bases and no specific recognizable features (such as ATPase or helicase motives) other than a DNA binding motif (71β probability for a helix-turn-helix motif, according to the Dodd and Egan algorithm (30Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar)) in the C-terminal region. The initial phase of pAMβ1 replication has been characterized to a certain extent. First, DNA replication is unidirectional. Second, mRNA originating upstream from the origin and synthesized codirectionally to DNA replication terminates at the initiation site of DNA replication, forming possible primers for leading strand synthesis (26Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Third, the leading strand primer is used by Pol I to generate D-loop structures (∼200 bp long) that are used as a signal for entry of the host PriA-dependent primosome (31Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D.

Polard and C. Bruand, personal communication.2P. Polard and C. Bruand, personal communication. It is thought that the primosome directs replisome assembly through the general mechanism of replication fork rescue (34Marians K.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations provide some indirect information on RepE functions as follows. (i) RepE might recognize the origin and play a role in mRNA maturation, since mRNA ending at the initiation site requires the intact origin and an active RepE and (ii) RepE is an unlikely landing pad for replisome assembly, as this task seems to be ensured by the PriA-dependent primosome.As a first step in unraveling how RepE functions, we purified it to near homogeneity and analyzed its interactions with different nucleic acids. Results show that RepE binding to ori-containing supercoiled molecules leads to formation of an open complex in which the 20–30 nt encompassing the initiation site of DNA replication and downstream sequences are melted. An unexpected strong and nonspecific ssDNA binding activity allows RepE to bind to the melted region of the open complex. These results, which describe for the first time an open complex at the origin of a θ-replicating plasmid from a Gram-positive bacterium, are discussed in terms of possible mode of action of RepE in pAMβ1 initiation mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe initiation mechanism of pAMβ1 replication is original because it requires a small unstructured origin, an initiator protein (RepE), a transcription fork passing through the origin codirectional to DNA synthesis and Pol I but not DnaA. To better understand this process, we have characterized the RepE/ori interaction. Our observations show that RepE possesses some of the features expected for an initiator together with some unexpected properties. Indeed, RepE binds, bends, and melts the origin in a supercoiling-dependent way to form an open complex. However, the double-stranded origin contains a single RepE binding site (there is no iterons), the bend is weak, and RepE binds nonspecific ssDNA more efficiently than dsDNA. Very importantly, the melted DNA in the open structure is a substrate for further RepE binding. We thus speculate that in open complex formation, the ssDNA binding activity compensates for the weak bend and for the lack of RepE oligomerization on the double-stranded origin.RepE Interaction with the Double-stranded OriginUsing gel retardation assays and in vitro footprint experiments, specific and efficient binding was observed between RepE and the double-stranded origin (Kd ∼ 20 nm). The binding site was mapped to the 25-bp sequence located upstream from the initiation site. Careful examination of this sequence did not reveal any repeated sequence longer than 2 bp, which suggests that pAMβ1 differs from the previously described initiator-encoding replicons by having a unique binding site for the initiator protein in the double-stranded origin (see Ref. 8del Solar G. Giraldo R. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Espinosa M. Diaz-Orejas R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). Even replicons such as R1, reported as lacking iterons, possess more than one binding site (with a 5-bp common core sequence) for the initiator protein (50Giraldo R. Diaz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, whatever the replicon, multimers of the initiator protein are involved in origin binding and initiation of replication. In contrast, a single RepE molecule appears to bind to the pAMβ1 double-stranded origin since (i) a unique complex is detected by gel shift analysis, and (ii) RepE is a monomer in solution. However, when the plasmid is supercoiled, several monomers of RepE bind to the origin as discussed below.Comparison of the footprints obtained at RepE double-stranded binding site with various reagents (DNaseI, OP-Cu, DMS) reveals some interesting features (see Fig. 10 for a summary). Efficient protection (70–95β) against reagents that act in the minor groove of the DNA (DNaseI or OP-Cu) was observed, whereas the protection against reagents that act in the major groove (DMS) was much weaker (40–60β). Taken together, these results suggest that RepE binds primarily in the minor groove of the 5′ end of the origin. Binding in the minor groove has been demonstrated for protein p6 from B. subtilis phage Φ29 (a nonspecific dsDNA-binding protein that activates the initiation of Φ29 DNA replication (51Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)) and for many architectural factors that introduce large bends in the DNA (such as the prokaryotic IHF and HU proteins and the eukaryotic HMG proteins (52Yang J. Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 452-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 53Rice P.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). However, the initiators DnaA from E. coli and RepA from pPS10 were shown to interact with both major and minor grooves (54Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,55Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Open Complex Formation and Binding of Additional RepE on the Melted DNAA number of studies in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes sustain the idea that the origin must be strongly bent for duplex opening, allowing subsequent entry of the replicative helicase (4Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 56Kowalski D. Eddy M.J.

Sharp bending of the origin occurs consequent to the binding of multimers of the initiator (58Mukherjee S. Patel I. Bastia D. Cell. 1985; 43: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 59Zahn K. Blattner F.R. Science. 1987; 236: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 60Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and may be helped by an intrinsic curve in the DNA (61Snyder M. Buchman A.R. Davis R.W. Nature. 1986; 324: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 62Eckdahl T.T. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlike these replicons, pAMβ1 origin does not possess any intrinsic bending and only a very weak bend (31°) is induced by RepE binding on linear fragments containing the origin (Fig.6). This raises the question about the existence of other factors that could enhance this bend and about its function in pAMβ1 initiation. Several convergent data suggest that, on supercoiled substrates, RepE binding promotes the denaturation of the downstream AT-rich region.In vitro, KMnO4 footprints show that RepE binding highly distorts the AT-rich region of the origin (Fig. 10). This distortion is strictly dependent on RepE, the presence of the AT-rich sequence, and the supercoiling of the ori-containing substrates. DMS footprint experiments revealed a significant increase in the methylation of the A and C residues of the AT-rich region upon RepE binding at the origin (Fig. 10). This indicates that the AT-rich region is melted. Interestingly, DNaseI and OP-Cu footprints performed on supercoiled templates revealed protections extending from the RepE binding site to more than 30 nt downstream, covering the AT-rich region. These extended footprints together with the fact that RepE binds with a high affinity to dsDNA fragments containing single-stranded bubbles at least 15 nt-long (Fig. 3) suggest that RepE binds the melted region of the origin, protecting it from DNaseI or OP-Cu cleavage. RepE binding in the melted region could explain both the weak accessibility of DMS to the ssDNA and the lack of P1 sensitivity on supercoiled ori-containing plasmid in the presence of RepE. Such a resistance of an origin melted region to P1 nuclease has been described in other systems such as simian virus 40 (47). The fact that the extended footprints observed either with OP-Cu or DNaseI did not reveal 100β protection upon RepE binding might be explain by several hypotheses. First, RepE might not bind to all the supercoiled molecules. Second, some cleavage of ssDNA might occur even in the presence of RepE. Third, binding of RepE might be dynamic, leading to sliding of the protein along ssDNA. Finally, although RepE dissociates from ssDNA very slowly, re-annealing of the melted region could displace the protein from its ssDNA-binding site.Possible Role for the Strong ssDNA Binding Activity of RepEAs shown by gel retardation assays, RepE does not bind nonspecific dsDNA but binds efficiently ori-containing dsDNA and even more efficiently any ssDNA. Other initiators have been found to possess some ssDNA binding activity. Preferential binding of DnaA to the upper strand of the open complex at oriC was suggested because of the poor cleavage of this strand by P1 nuclease compared with that of the lower strand (4Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, although bacteriophage λ O initiator protein has been shown to bind short (43 nt) oligonucleotides (although weakly and nonspecifically (63Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), no oligonucleotide binding was detected for DnaA protein in the same system or in others (54Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Intrinsic but low and nonspecific ssDNA binding activities have been described for simian virus 40 T-antigen (64Auborn K.J. Markowitz R.B. Wang E., Yu, Y.T. Prives C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2204-2208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and minute virus of mice NS1 (65Mouw M. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1998; 251: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which are helicases and, thus, require for this function some affinity for ssDNA. An exception among initiators, for which an affinity similar for ori-containing dsDNA and nonspecific ssDNA has been described, is the origin recognition complex (ORC) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(66Lee D.G. Makhov A.M. Klemm R.D. Griffith J.D. Bell S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similar to what we found for RepE, the strength of the ORC-ssDNA interaction is correlated to the ssDNA length. Binding of ORC to ssDNA alters ORC conformation and stimulates ORC ATPase, thus regulating ORC function and initiation of replication (ORC-ADP is inactive for binding to the double-stranded origin). We may thus wonder about the function of the high affinity for ssDNA observed with RepE. No ATP binding motifs are present in RepE sequence, and no ATPase activity was detected (data not shown). We propose that RepE binding to ssDNA shifts the equilibrium from a closed to an open complex. The shift requires appropriate superhelicity and the AT-richness of the 3′-end of the origin. The lack of multiple RepE binding sites on double-stranded origin and of a strong RepE-mediated bending may be compensated by its high ssDNA binding activity.An interplay between RepE and Transcription at the Initiation StepIn initiator-dependent replicons, open complex formation is required for loading the replicative helicase and polymerase. In pAMβ1, this function is fulfilled by the PriA-dependent primosome loaded on nascent D-loop replication intermediates generated by Pol I (31Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Jannière L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2642-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Jannière L. Bidnenko V. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Petit M.A. Mol.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).2Thus, all the data obtained in this work and that previously published lead us to ask the following questions. What is the role of the RepE-mediated open complex formation (Pol I loading is not known to require such opening)? What is the function of the transcription through the origin, which is essential for replication?The most attractive hypothesis is that (i) transcription through the origin provides a primer for Pol I (since transcripts ending at the initiation site and 10 nt upstream were shown to be generated in vivo in a RepE- and ori-dependent way (26Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), and (ii) the maturation of the transcript requires formation of the RepE-mediated open complex. The model for initiation of pAMβ1 replication is thus the following (Fig.11). After formation of the open complex (steps 1–2), a collision between a transcription fork and RepE takes place (step 3). To allow transcription to proceed at least until the initiation site, it is supposed that this collision is followed by displacement of RepE from its dsDNA-binding site and possibly from its bottom strand ssDNA-binding site (step 4). We propose that two pathways may then be followed. In the first one (step 5a), the RNA pol continues transcription for ∼20 nt past the initiation site until it reaches putative transcription terminator. RepE protein bound to the top strand might prevent DNA pairing behind the transcription fork, causing R-loop formation. This accounts for the data obtained in the KMnO4 footprint experiment in vivo showing that the bottom strand of the open complex was not modified to the same extent as it was in vitro, indicating base pairing of this strand with a nucleic acid (Fig. 7 A and10). The RNA strand of the R-loop could then be cleaved at the initiation site and about 10 nt upstream by an RNaseH activity provided either by RepE or by a host-encoded enzyme (step 6a). The primer thus generated is then extended by Pol I (step 7). In a second pathway (step 5b), alternative to R-loop formation, RNA pol stops at the initiation site, and the halted polymerase cleaves the mRNA at position −10, thus producing a 10-nt-long primer for Pol I. It is known that some proteins bound to DNA are able to arrest RNA pol (RTP/ter (67Mohanty B.K. Sahoo T. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); DnaA/dnaA box (68Konopa G. Szalewska-Palasz A. Schmidt A. Srutkowska S. Messer W. Wegrzyn G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 25-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Moreover, pausing of RNA pol has been observed in several systems to activate an RNA pol-linked RNase activity that cleaves the nascent RNA molecule about 10 nt upstream of the pausing site (69Eick D. Wedel A. Heumann H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 292-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this hypothesis, RNA pol arrest would be mediated in an uncharacterized way by RepE bound to the ssDNA region of the open complex. To account for the protection of the bottom strand against KMnO4 oxidation observed in vivo (Fig. 7 A), we suggest that a limited DNA synthesis (∼20 nt long) must occur in these intermediates (step 6b). However, this prote"

Ser729 may be rephosphorylated later, suggesting cycling between PKCε87 and PKCε95. Here we show that the dephosphorylation at Ser729 is insensitive to okadaic acid, calyculin, ascomycin C, and cyclosporin A, suggesting that dephosphorylation at this site is not mediated through protein phosphatases 1, 2A or 2B. We demonstrate that this dephosphorylation at Ser729 requires serum and cell readhesion and is sensitive to rapamycin, PD98059, chelerythrine, and Ro-31–8220. These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Ser729 in the hydrophobic domain at Ser729is regulated independently of the phosphorylation status of other sites in PKCε, by a mTOR-sensitive phosphatase.

To date 11 PKC isoforms have been identified: the conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are regulated by calcium and diacylglycerol, the novel PKCs (δ, ε, and θ), which are calcium independent but dependent upon diacylglycerol, and the atypical PKCs (λ, ι, and ζ), which are both diacylglycerol- and calcium-independent.

Two further phosphorylation sites have been identified in the C-terminal region of the enzyme at the turn and hydrophobic motifs (4Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation at the turn motif (Ser703 in PKCε) is believed to be mediated through autophosphorylation (5Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is some debate as to whether the hydrophobic site (Ser729 in PKCε) becomes phosphorylated as a result of autophosphorylation or by a separate kinase. Phosphorylation at this hydrophobic site may be modulated by PKCζ and appears to be sensitive to rapamycin (10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J.

Although phosphorylation at these two C-terminal sites is not essential for the catalytic activity of PKC, they seem to regulate the stability of the enzyme (12Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W.

PKCε from fibroblasts migrates on SDS-PAGE as two distinct forms, with molecular sizes of 95 and 87 kDa (PKCε 95 and PKCε 87) that differ in their intracellular localization. In quiescent cells the PKCε95 form predominates, whereas after passage PKCε87 becomes the major species. We have recently reported that these forms differ in their phosphorylation status at Ser729 (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). Thr566 and Ser703 are phosphorylated in both these forms of PKCε, and the protein has complete N and C termini (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). The formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage is not due to new protein synthesis. We have therefore suggested that a phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser729 is activated upon cell passage. Removal of the Ser729 phosphate from the hydrophobic domain may reduce the stability of the enzyme, rendering it more accessible to phosphatase attack and potentially to degradation (27Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chem S.-J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the change in localization of PKCε on passage may make it accessible to a Ser729 phosphatase. Therefore regulation of phosphorylation at Ser729 may prove to be yet another level of control for PKC. The regulation of how PKC becomes dephosphorylated has not been well studied. Most work has been carried out using TPA to induce activation that leads to dephosphorylation and degradation. Our system involving cell passage allows us to examine the control of the putative Ser729-specific phosphatase rather than to look at the complete dephosphorylation of the protein. Our results suggest that dephosphorylation of PKCε is a two-stage process. A specific phosphatase removes the phosphate at Ser729 followed by either the removal of other phosphate groups or rephosphorylation at Ser729 and recycling of the enzyme to the 95-kDa form. In this study we have examined how the dephosphorylation of PKCε at Ser729 in 3T3 and 3T6 fibroblasts is regulated. We present evidence that the dephosphorylation of Ser729 is not mediated by protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B but is dependent upon serum and cell readhesion, and that MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target ofrapamycin) pathways are involved. PKC is also important in regulating the phosphorylation status of Ser729.

Dried milk powder was Marvel (Premier Beverages, Stafford, UK). BCA reagents were from Pierce. The polyclonal PKCε and PKCδ antibodies used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitations were generated to the C-terminal peptide sequence by Professor N. Groome (Oxford Brookes University, UK) as previously described (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma. 3T3 and 3T6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 as described previously (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). Cells were passaged by rinsing with Tris saline, followed by release with Tris trypsin. Cells were resuspended in fresh medium as above, plated into fresh tissue culture flasks, and allowed to settle for 15 min before harvesting unless otherwise stated. Cells were treated with inhibitors at concentrations described in the text. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO unless otherwise stated and effects compared with Me2SO control treated cells. Solvent concentrations were never greater than 0.01%. Quiescent cells were treated for 30 min before passage, and fresh inhibitor was added after passage. PKCε and PKCδ translocation inhibitor and activator peptides coupled to anttenepaedia carrier protein were generously supplied by Professor D. Mochly-Rosen (Stanford, CA). Hemagglutinin-tagged pCH3δ RD was generously donated by Professor S. Jaken (University of Vermont). 3T3 and 3T6 cells were transiently transfected with Superfect (Qiagen) and were analyzed after 48 h, were quiescent, or were passaged. Transfection was monitored by Western blotting for the hemagglutinin tag. PKCδ antisense was created through cloning the full-length PKCδ into the pZeo SV vector (Invitrogen). Stable transfections were selected using Zeocin (Invitrogen), and individual colonies were expanded and analyzed by Western blotting. In all cases results were compared with mock transfected cells. Cells were scraped from flasks into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm[4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Laemmli loading buffer was added, and equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for PKCε as described previously (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.2 mm[4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotary stirrer. Equal amounts of cell protein were incubated with anti-PKCε antibody overnight (1:250), and this was recovered with protein A-Sepharose. After washing with immunoprecipitation buffer, the pellet was resuspended in 10% SDS and Laemmli loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. 3.7 Mbq of [35S]Met/Cys (Promix; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added for 2 h. Cells were then passaged into fresh medium and flasks, and 3.7 Mbq [35S]Met/Cys was retained in the medium. Cells were harvested at different time points, and PKCε were immunoprecipitated as described above. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed in isopropanol/acetic acid/H20 (25/20/65, v/v) for 1 h and then incubated for 15 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before drying and exposing to x-ray film. All data shown are typical of at least three independent experiments. In quiescent cells PKCε95 predominates, whereas 15 min after passage into serum with readhesion PKCε87 becomes the major form (Fig.1 A). We have recently shown that PKCε95 and PKCε87 differ in their phosphorylation at Ser729 and that the formation of PKCε87 is most probably the result of dephosphorylation of PKCε95 at Ser729 (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). It is likely that the apparent increase in total PKCε protein (Fig. 1 A) is the result of increased immunoreactivity of our antibody with PKCε87 compared with PKCε95 since the polyclonal PKCε antibody used in these studies is raised against the C-terminal region of PKCε (-NQEEFKGFSYFGEDLMP), which includes Ser729. This observation applies to other Western blots. This is confirmed by [35S]Met/Cys incorporation studies that reveal that no new PKCε synthesis occurs within 15 min of passage although synthesis is detected 48–72 h after passage (Fig.1 B). Western blots show that PKCε95 reappears and becomes the predominant PKC form within 1 h after cell passage (Fig. 1 A). Because there is no synthesis of PKCε over this time period (Fig. 1 B), this suggests that PKCε95 detected within 1 h of passage is derived through the rephosphorylation of PKCε87. When quiescent cells are passaged into serum-free medium and allowed to adhere for 15 min, no formation of PKCε 87 is observed (data not shown). However, when cells are passaged into increasing concentrations of serum, PKCε87 is formed in increasing amounts (Fig.2 A). This result shows that some factor(s) in serum is/are necessary for the formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage. Fibroblasts at 70% confluency contain both PKCε95 and PKCε87 (Fig.2 B). When these cells are serum-starved for 24 h, to promote entry into G0 (28Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), PKCε95 becomes the predominant form (Fig. 2 B), as is observed in cells grown to confluency and quiescence (Fig. 2 A). Readdition of serum to serum-starved cells in G0 does not promote the formation of PKCε87, although passage of these cells does (Fig. 2 B). This is also the case if fresh serum is added to quiescent fibroblasts (results not shown). These findings suggest that serum is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage. Readhesion is also necessary for the formation of PKCε87upon passage. This is shown by the finding that when quiescent fibroblasts are passaged in serum containing medium onto poly-HEME-coated plastic, or shaken to prevent adhesion, no formation of PKCε87 is observed (Fig. 2 C). These results emphasize the need for both serum factors and readhesion in PKCε87 formation. We have confirmed through 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis that 3T3 and 3T6 fibroblasts require both serum and readhesion to exit G0 and proliferate (data not shown). It should be noted that trypsinization of fibroblasts does not stimulate PKCε87 formation (data not shown). Because re-entry into the cell cycle from G0 is necessary but not sufficient for PKCε 87 formation (Fig.2 D), it is clear that other factors are also important in regulating the dephosphorylation of Ser729. One such factor may be the disruption of cell-substratum interactions and resulting changes in the cytoskeleton that occur upon cell passage and readhesion. Indeed, if the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted through cytochalasin D treatment of quiescent cells, PKCε87 is formed (Fig. 2 D). The microtubule disrupting drug nocodazole does not produce the same effect (Fig. 2 D). Treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin (PP1 and PP2A inhibitors (29Hardie D.G. Hardie G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 109-119Google Scholar)) or cyclosporin A and ascomycin (inhibitors of PP2B (29Hardie D.G. Hardie G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 109-119Google Scholar)) did not inhibit the formation of PKCε87 upon passage (Fig.3) (ascomycin C data not shown). This suggests that these protein phosphatases are not involved in catalyzing the removal of the Ser729 phosphate and that an OA-insensitive phosphatase is mediating this dephosphorylation. We observed that OA increased PKCε87 formation upon cell passage. It is possible then that inhibition of PP1 and/or PP2A increases the activity of the Ser729 phosphatase. Alternatively, the inhibitors may be preventing further dephosphorylation of PKCε87 at Ser703 and Thr566, thus preserving PKCε87. In fact we occasionally detect a faster migrating PKCε band (PKCε84); formation of PKCε84 is inhibited by OA, supporting the latter idea. Hansra et al. (30Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R.

These workers have also described the importance of vesicle transport in the dephosphorylation of PKCα, showing that incubation at 18 °C inhibited dephosphorylation (31Hansra G. Garcia-Paramio P. Prevostel C. Whelan R.D.H. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We find that incubation at 18 °C to inhibit vesicle transport had no effect on the production of PKCε87 (Fig. 3). In fact, similarly to OA, it increased the formation of PKCε87. Treatment of fibroblasts with the calpain and proteasome inhibitor ALLN (32Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) increased the level of PKCε87 produced upon cell passage (Fig. 4 A). This may implicate calpain in the activation of a putative Ser729 phosphatase, or, probably more likely, this reflects an inhibition of the degradation of PKCε87. Treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (Refs. 33Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hiu K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

Vlahos C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar; wortmannin data not shown) also caused an increase in formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage (Fig. 4 B). PI 3-kinase has already been demonstrated to play a role in PKC phosphorylation through its activation of phospholipid-dependent kinase 1 (7Garcia-Paramio P. Cabrerizo Y. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Le Good J.A. Ziegeler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Our findings also implicate PI 3-kinase in the control of PKCε dephosphorylation and degradation. Transfection of fibroblasts with full-length PKCδ antisense reduced PKCδ expression and increased PKCε 87 formation upon cell passage (Fig. 4 C). Expression of the regulatory domain of PKCδ has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of PKCδ (35Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Goodnough M. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3230-3238PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Duddy S.K. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Oncogene. 1999; 18 (.)): 6748-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts transfected with a construct containing this domain showed increased formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage (Fig.4 D). PKCδ translocation inhibitor and activator peptides were also used to modulate PKCδ in fibroblasts (37Csukai M. Mochly-Rosen D. Pharmacol. Res. 1999; 37: 253-259Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 38Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A PKCδ translocation inhibitor peptide increased PKCε87formation upon passage, whereas control and activator peptides had no effect (Fig. 4 E). Peptide modulators of PKCε had no effect on the formation of PKCε 87 upon cell passage. Conformation of the specificity and activity of these peptides was confirmed through analysis of PKC isoform localization to membrane and cytosol fractions (data not shown). The production of PKCε87 upon passage is inhibited passaging cells in the presence of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor (Ref. 39Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar and Fig.5 A), rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (Ref. 40DuMont F.J. Staruch M.J. Melino M.R. Sigal N.H.

Such findings suggest a role for the MAPK pathway, mTOR, and PKC in the control of PKCε87 formation on cell passage. Inhibitors of protein kinase A, p38, and tyrosine kinases had no effect on PKCε87 formation upon passage, suggesting that these pathways are not important in this process.

Whelan R.D.H. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When quiescent fibroblasts are treated with 250 nm TPA for 15 min, formation of PKCε 87 is detected, although this is at a reduced level compared with cell passage (Fig. 5 C). This TPA effect can be blocked with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine and does not occur with the inactive 4α-phorbol (Fig. 5 C). As with PKCε87formation upon cell passage, this effect can be inhibited by preincubation with rapamycin and PD98059 (data not shown), suggesting that the MAPK and mTOR pathways are also important here. We have previously shown that when fibroblasts are passaged there is a change in the phosphorylation status of PKCε and that this is associated with a change in the intracellular localization of the protein. PKCε95, predominant in quiescent cells, has a perinuclear localization and is phosphorylated at Thr566, Ser703, and Ser729. PKCε87 has a cytosolic distribution and is phosphorylated at Thr566 and Ser703 (26England K. Rumsby M. Biochem. J. 2000; 35: 219-226Google Scholar). We have suggested that on cell passage a PKCε Ser729 phosphatase may be activated. The hydrophobic (Ser729 in PKCε) site is conserved in most PKCs and in the ACG group of kinases (10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It is therefore essential to understand how phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the hydrophobic domain is controlled. Here we have examined some factors that are important in the control of Ser729 phosphorylation status. We have shown that the removal of the phosphate group at Ser729 from PKCε95 requires both serum and adhesion. Fibroblasts do not proliferate in the absence of serum or when prevented from adhering (28Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), and it is therefore likely that PKCε87 formation is dependent upon re-entry of quiescent or serum-starved cells into the cell cycle. However, we have shown that re-entry into the cell cycle alone is not sufficient for this process because if cells are serum-starved and then restimulated with serum there is no formation of PKCε87. It is possible then that PKCε87 formation is mediated through both disruption of cell-substratum interactions and readhesion of the cells to the substratum in the presence of serum. Our finding that cytochalasin D, the microfilament-disrupting drug, stimulates the formation of PKCε87 in quiescent cells supports this view. Readherence of cells after passage involves reorganization of the cytoskeleton. PKCε has an actin-binding domain (21Prekeris R. Mayhew M.W. Cooper J.B. Terrain D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Prekeris R. Hernandez R.M. Mayhew M.W. White M.K. Terrain D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26790-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and we therefore speculate that PKCε bound to actin may be activated by microfilament disruption, thereby either stimulating phosphatase activity or allowing access to a putative Ser729 phosphatase. Alternatively, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton through passage or cytochalasin D treatment could alter the localization of PKCε, making it susceptible to attack by a Ser729 phosphatase. Our inhibitor studies clearly show that the formation of PKCε87 upon passage is not dependent upon the more well defined protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2A, and PP2C. However, we find that the formation of PKCε87 upon cell passage is inhibited by rapamycin, indicating involvement of mTOR. mTOR has recently been implicated in the control of phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site in PKCε and PKCδ (10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These authors speculate that this is mediated through the activation via mTOR of a phosphatase specific for the hydrophobic site rather than through regulation of a kinase. Our data presented here support this view and also suggest that this mTOR-controlled phosphatase is not PP1, PP2A, or PP2B. Interestingly, OA treatment and also treatment with the calpain and proteasome inhibitor ALLN, increased the level of PKCε87 detected upon cell passage. The most likely explanation for these findings is that these inhibitors are blocking further dephosphorylation and degradation of PKCε87, thereby increasing PKCε 87 levels. It seems that PKCε95 dephosphorylation occurs in two stages; firstly the removal of the phosphate at Ser729 by a specific phosphatase, followed by dephosphorylation at Thr566 and Ser703 by an OA-sensitive phosphatase. It has been shown that dephosphorylated forms of PKC are more susceptible to subsequent proteolytic degradation (13Gysin S. Imber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr.

J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase inhibitors also increased PKCε87 formation upon passage. This may be through inhibition of a kinase that rephosphorylates PKCε Ser729, possibly a complex including PKCζ (9Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.L. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C.

Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our time course results show that PKCε95 becomes the predominant form of PKCε within 1 h of passage. This reappearance of PKCε95 may be mediated through rephosphorylation at Ser729 of PKCε87, the predominant form at earlier time points after passage. Our [35S]methionine-labeling experiments have shown that there is no new synthesis of PKCε over this early time period, suggesting that PKCε95 must be derived from the recycling of PKCε87. Rephosphorylation of Ser729 could potentially be mediated through autophosphorylation (4Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) or through the activity of another kinase (10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of PKCδ activity and translocation also increased PKCε87 detected upon passage suggesting that PKCδ either inhibits PKCε dephosphorylation or promotes PKCε87 dephosphorylation and degradation. Inhibition of PKCε95 dephosphorylation may be mediated through inhibiting a Ser729 phosphatase or through inhibiting the activation of PKCε, hence its accessibility to phosphatase attack. There is evidence in the literature of a yin-yang relationship between PKCε and PKCδ. For example, PKCε is growth promotory, whereas PKCδ inhibits cell growth (17Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCε acts to prevent cells from cardiac ischemia, whereas PKCδ mediates cell death (44Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Mochly-Rosen D. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1937-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 45Dorn G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.-H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2798-12803Google Scholar). The role of PKCδ in the regulation of PKCε dephosphorylation in fibroblasts needs to be further investigated. PKCε87 formation upon passage is inhibited by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. This implicates the MAPK pathway in the control of PKCε Ser729 dephosphorylation. Because serum is required for this process, it is likely that the MAPK pathway is downstream of any extracellular signals in the medium that lead to cell proliferation. As already stated, it seems that signals that stimulate cell proliferation are essential for PKCε87 formation upon cell passage. PKCε phosphorylation at Ser729 is PKC-sensitive because we have demonstrated that PKCε87 production upon passage can be inhibited by the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine and Ro 31–8220. Also, PKCε87 production can be stimulated in quiescent cells through the addition of 250 nm TPA for 15 min. This suggests a role for another isoform of PKC in the regulation of PKCε dephosphorylation. Alternatively, PKCε may regulate the activity of a Ser729 phosphatase. PKC inhibitors would therefore inhibit this phosphatase activity through inhibition of PKCε. Our working model for PKCε regulation on passage is summarized in Fig. 6. We have observed similar results in 3T6 fibroblasts and C6 glioma cells suggesting that our findings are not cell type-specific. Our data suggest that at least a two-stage process is involved in regulating dephosphorylation of PKCε95. Passage of cells or TPA treatment of quiescent cells causes dephosphorylation at Ser729. It is probable that PKCε is activated upon passage and readhesion. PKCε has been shown to be important in the spreading of HeLa and other cells (46Kim J.-Y. Lee Y.-S. Park J. Chun J.-S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 594-598Google Scholar, 47Chun J. Auer K.A. Jacobson B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) where PKCε is activated upon cell matrix contact and is required for actin polymerization. The loss of a phosphate at Ser729 is sensitive to re-entry into the cell cycle from G0 and readhesion of cells; it is also dependent upon the MAPK pathway. It has been reported that, once in an activated conformation, PKC becomes susceptible to phosphatase attack (27Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chem S.-J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that loss of the C-terminal phosphorylations may regulate translocation of the kinase to the cytoplasm after activation (48Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The loss of a phosphate at Ser729 is not mediated through PP1, PP2A, or PP2B. PKCε87 could then be rephosphorylated at Ser729 and recycled back to PKCε95. This may involve a membrane-associated kinase complex including PKCζ. (43Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D.H. Kelly J.J. Frech M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) Alternatively PKCε87 may be further dephosphorylated at sites Ser703 and Thr566, perhaps mediated by an OA-sensitive phosphatase. Complete dephosphorylation increases the instability of PKC and targets the protein for degradation (13Gysin S. Imber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr.

J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that once fully dephosphorylated PKCε is sensitive to degradation via calpain and the proteasome.

Its principal feasibility has been demonstrated in retroviral model systems but not yet for a medically relevant virus outside the retrovirus family.

Chronic infections affect more than 350 million people worldwide, they have potentially severe consequences such a liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Blumberg B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The sustained response rate of the approved high-dose interferon-α therapy is about 30%. Nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine markedly reduce viral load but suffer, inter alia, from the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants (5Locarnini S. Birch C. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 536-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This situation has spurred interest in alternative approaches to interfere with HBV replication (6Nassal M. Arch. Virol. 1997; 142: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Whereas only primary human, or chimpanzee, hepatocytes are susceptible to HBV infection in cell culture, a few human hepatoma cell lines like Huh7 and HepG2 support virus production upon transfection with cloned viral DNA. The late steps of the infectious cycle (Fig. 1 A) are hence understood in some detail (7Nassal M. Intervirology. 1999; 42: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Nassal M. Cann A.J. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: DNA Virus Replication. 26. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-40Google Scholar), and they present novel targets for intervention. After infection, the nucleocapsid transports the partially double-stranded circular 3.2-kb DNA genome to the nucleus (9Kann M. Sodeik B. Vlachou A. Gerlich W.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) for conversion into covalently closed circular DNA; this molecule is the transcriptional template for several subgenomic and genomic RNAs that all act as mRNAs. Of these, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is first used to translate both the capsid, or core, protein and the reverse transcriptase, P protein. Then P protein, together with cellular chaperones (10Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), binds to a stem-loop structure, ε, close to the 5′-end of the pgRNA (11Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J.

Complex formation mediates assembly of immature RNA-containing nucleocapsids (13Bartenschlager R. Schaller H.

DNA synthesis occurs inside the nucleocapsid and involves several template switches that lead to the characteristic relaxed circular (RC) DNA genome containing a complete (−)-strand and variously extended (+)-strands. Mature DNA-containing nucleocapsids can re-escort the genome to nucleus, or be exported as enveloped virions by budding into a post-endoplasmic reticulum/pre-Golgi compartment. Both events apparently require that at least the (−)-DNA strand be completed (1Summers J. Mason W.S.

A conceptually more powerful approach is capsid-targeted viral inactivation (CTVI) or, generally, virion-targeted viral inactivation, which exploits a viral capsid protein or other virion-associated protein as carrier to target a degradative enzyme specifically into virus particles (25Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Boeke J.D. Hahn B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 421-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); alternatively, nucleic acid-based effectors such as ribozymes may be fused to viral packaging signals and thus be used against viruses that, like retroviruses but unlike HBV, encapsidate more than one genome, or genome segment (27Giordano V. Jin D.Y. Rekosh D. Jeang K.T. Virology. 2000; 267: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Sullenger B.A. Cech T.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1566-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For the protein based approach, the nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SN) is considered particularly useful because it requires Ca2+ for activity (29Tucker P.W. Hazen Jr., E.E. Cotton F.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1979; 23: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ levels are usually below 1 μm, providing a safeguard against attacks on cellular nucleic acids. Serum levels of Ca2+, by contrast, are in the millimolar range; hence SN incorporated into a virus particle is thought to be activated upon release from the cell.The principal feasibility of the approach, pioneered using the yeast retrotransposon Ty1 (25Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), has been well documented for the model of Moloney murine leukemia virus, a simple C-type retrovirus (30VanBrocklin M.

Adapting the approach to human immunodeficiency virus has been hampered by the poor expression and inefficient incorporation into particles of human immunodeficiency virus Gag fusion proteins (35Okui N. Sakuma R. Kobayashi N. Yoshikura H. Kitamura T. Chiba J. Kitamura Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Effectors fused to the accessory Vpr and Vpx proteins, although efficiently incorporated, can be subject to inactivation by the retroviral protease (36Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Kim J. Seshaiah P. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Hahn B.H. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Vpr carrier may induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (35Okui N. Sakuma R. Kobayashi N. Yoshikura H. Kitamura T. Chiba J. Kitamura Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using expression in E. coli we have recently shown that a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal 155 aa of the HBV core protein followed by the complete SN protein, coreSN, coassembles with wild-type core protein to particles with internal SN domains (37Beterams G. Böttcher B. Nassal M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we investigated if, and how, this fusion protein is able to interfere with HBV replication. We show that low levels of coreSN drastically reduce the titers of replication-competent HB virons in supernatants from transfected Huh7 cells, and we present evidence for an intracellular but virus-specific nuclease activation that may make HBV particularly vulnerable to the CTVI approach.DISCUSSIONIn this report we show the successful application of CTVI to an important nonretroviral human pathogen, HBV. A chimera of the HBV capsid protein with the S. aureus nuclease, coreSN, drastically reduced the titers of DNA-containing enveloped HB virions in supernatants from cells co-transfected with an efficient HBV expression plasmid. The antiviral mechanism depends on nuclease activity because only minor effects were observed with the enzymatically inactive chimera coreSNmut; likewise, the presence of the core protein domain is essential as no significant effects were observed with nonfused SN. CoreSN prevents proper reverse transcription of the encapsidated RNA, or leads to rapid degradation of the genomic DNA. This “destruction from within” (26Boeke J.D. Hahn B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 421-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) is the hallmark of CTVI; unexpectedly, it appears to proceed, to a significant extent, intracellularly.Antiviral Mechanism of CoreSNCoreSN protein, when recombinantly expressed in E. coli, fulfilled two fundamental criteria for CTVI: it cointegrates into wild-type capsids, and the nuclease domains are internally localized (37Beterams G. Böttcher B. Nassal M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); all data in the present study fully confirm this notion for a eukaryotic setting. However, it was not a priori clear whether this would translate into a detectable antiviral effect against HBV. In particular, the Ca2+ dependence of SN should require the particles to reach a Ca2+-rich milieu. If this was exclusively the extracellular space it would, in addition, require that the HBV envelope be permeable to Ca2+ ions, a factor for which no information exists.Despite these concerns, coreSN, at 5% to at most 10% the concentration of wild-type core protein, led to an at least 20-fold, and probably higher, reduction in the titers of extracellular DNA containing enveloped particles. By contrast, coreSNmut exerted only minor effects, proving the dependence on nuclease activity of the antiviral mechanism. The apparent lack of full-length DNA forms as well as the failure of nonfused SN to show an antiviral effect corroborated a direct action of coreSN on the packaged genomes. Therefore, the particles had been in contact with sufficient concentrations of Ca2+ for nuclease activation, either after release from the cells, or during export, or inside the cells. Attempts to obtain evidence for extracellular activation by keeping the cells in medium with fetal calf serum as the only Ca2+ source (final concentration about 0.3 mm), or by deliberate addition of Ca2+ to the supernatants gave no conclusive answer because the results were essentially identical in all cases (data not shown). This suggested the nuclease had acted before we analyzed the particles. We therefore also investigated intracellular cores. Whereas their concentration was neither influenced by coreSN nor by coreSNmut protein, selectively the cores produced in the presence of coreSN contained about 70 to 90% less DNA. This reduction was not due to interference with encapsidation of the RNA template, hence coreSN either inhibited reverse transcription, or it led to a preferential degradation of viral DNA. To further minimize degradation after cell lysis, we performed controls with lysis buffers containing 10 mm, or even 100 mm EDTA to chelate the Ca2+ ions released from intracellular Ca2+stores during work-up (data not shown), again with no significant impact. While post-lysis degradation remains formally possible, the data are fully consistent with an intracellular activation of the nuclease. Direct evidence against a post-lysis artifact is our ability to isolate RNA containing cores in similar amounts in the absence and presence of coreSN although SN degrades both RNA and DNA. Second, even a very low level activation, resulting in a single cut anywhere within the pgRNA, or the (−)-strand DNA, would prevent formation of mature double-stranded DNA. The failure to efficiently extend by an exogenously added polymerase the replicative intermediates produced in the presence of coreSN, but not of coreSNmut, supports this view.A 70–90% reduction in the DNA content of intracellular cores, and a greater than 95% reduction in extracellular enveloped particles was reproduced in several independent experiments with coreSN, and also with the assembly-competent variant coreA80K-SN. We therefore propose the following stepwise interference model (compare Fig. 1 A): in the cytoplasm, coreSN is cointegrated into core particles; the nuclease is activated to a low but sufficient extent to damage the encapsidated viral nucleic acid, resulting in fewer mature nucleocapsids. A second important component is the hepadnavirus-specific coupling of genome maturation and envelopment: of the fewer DNA containing nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm, even fewer harbor genomes mature enough for export. Passive steric hindrance probably contributes to both factors because the most pronounced of the generally modest effects of coreSNmut were seen with enveloped virions. Finally, the genomes present in secreted virions may be subject to further nuclease attack such that, in sum, genome damage plus secretion inhibition amount to the observed greater than 20-fold overall inhibition.While an intracellular nuclease activation seemingly contradicts previous reports (25Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Natsoulis G. Seshaiah P. Federspiel M.J. Rein A. Hughes S.H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including safety aspects, the two viewpoints may be reconciled considering the intracellular assembly mechanism of HBV, and the very low level activation required, namely a single hit in any of the strands used as template. Like for Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag-SN fusions (32Schumann G. Qin L. Rein A. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we found no evidence that coreSN is cytotoxic; similarly, nonfused SN had neither a significant negative influence on cell viability, nor on GFP or HBV expression, suggesting SN itself had no, or only a marginal intracellular activity. A low level activity cannot be excluded because it would not be directed against one specific but against many different targets, and therefore remain undetectable. By contrast, coreSN integrated into the intracellularly assembled HBV core particles is kept in close spatial proximity to its specific nucleic acid substrate for extended time periods; this situation differs from Moloney murine leukemia virus for which, as a typical C-type retrovirus, nucleocapsid assembly and budding occur simultaneously at the plasma membrane. In addition, many signaling pathways involve the intermittent release of Ca2+into the cytoplasm and, given the inner volume of the HBV capsid (48Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Leslie A.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 771-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), about 6 Ca2+ ions per particle suffice to make up for a local 1 mm concentration. Hence all of the data are consistent with the specific action of coreSN on the encapsidated genome but not on cellular, and total viral RNAs and/or protein products. It should be borne in mind that in the transfection system, in contrast to the commonly used retroviral model infection systems (see below), HBV expression relies solely on the transfected plasmid. Because the cells cannot be reinfected, this synthesis route would not measurably be affected even by the complete interruption of infectious HBV progeny formation.Antiviral Efficacy of HBV coreSN ProteinIn our co-transfection system, we measured a nominal reduction to about 2.5% in the DNA content of virions by coreSN. Because the residual signals were weak and broadly distributed, this number may be slightly higher but could be substantially lower. In addition, the lack of a feasible infection system precluded determination of infectious HBV particles; given the incompleteness of most of the remaining DNA genomes, their number could lag far behind that of physical particles. Assuming a 20-fold reduction caused by coreSN is therefore a conservative estimate. In the retroviral model systems infectious particle titers can be directly measured. In prophylactic assays, cells are intracellularly pre-immunized (49Trono D. Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 113-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with an effector gene, and then are challenged with replication-competent virus at a low multiplicity of infection. In this setting, from 30 to up to a few thousand-fold reductions compared with untreated cells have been reported (30VanBrocklin M. Ferris A.L. Hughes S.H. Federspiel M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schumann G. Qin L. Rein A. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Natsoulis G. Seshaiah P. Federspiel M.J. Rein A. Hughes S.H. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, because the challenge virus can replicate, the difference between treated and untreated cells is amplified during each growth cycle (32Schumann G. Qin L. Rein A. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In therapeutic assays, the effector gene is transduced into persistently infected cells. Except for a recently reported (31VanBrocklin M. Federspiel M.J. Virology. 2000; 267: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) 1000-fold inhibition, mostly reductions in the range of 10–60-fold have been observed in this format (30VanBrocklin M. Ferris A.L. Hughes S.H. Federspiel M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schumann G. Qin L. Rein A. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schumann G. Cannon K. Ma W.P. Crouch R.J. Boeke J.D. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), comparable to our results. In one case, the Gag-nuclease protein was determined to account for about 25% of the total particulate Gag protein (32Schumann G. Qin L. Rein A. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4329-4337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That coreSN exerted a similar inhibition at a severalfold lower ratio to the wild-type protein indicates that its antiviral potency against HBV is as high as that of the Gag-nuclease proteins against Moloney murine leukemia virus.CoreSN also appears to be at least as effective as other gene-based anti-HBV inhibitors. Most nucleic acid-based approaches led to a lesser reduction of HBV production (19Wands J.R. Geissler M. Putlitz J.Z. Blum H. Weizsäcker F.V. Mohr L. Yoon S.K. Melegari M. Scaglioni P.P. J. Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1997; 12: S354-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Relatively high inhibition rates were described for dominant-negative core protein derivatives (21Scaglioni P.P. Melegari M. Wands J.R. Virology. 1994; 205: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23von Weizsäcker F. Wieland S. Blum H.E. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 294-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in particular, a core protein fusion to part of the envelope protein was reported to reduce viral replication by more than 95% at an effector to target ratio of 1:15 (22Scaglioni P. Melegari M. Takahashi M. Chowdhury J.R. Wands J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major antiviral mechanisms appear to be inhibition of capsid shell formation (22Scaglioni P. Melegari M. Takahashi M. Chowdhury J.R. Wands J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and passive interference with RNA packaging and/or reverse transcription (24von Weizsäcker F. Köck J. Wieland S. Offensperger W.B. Blum H.E. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Considering the active mechanism of coreSN it should be even more detrimental to HBV infectivity.Application of CTVI to HBV may be a valuable new tool to combat this important viral infection. However, several important problems, in addition to delivery efficiency, need to be solved before any therapeutic application can be thought of. An essential intermediate step is to prove the concept in an in vivo setting. Toward this end, we are currently generating adenoviruses carrying thecoreSN gene for tests in HBV-transgenic mice and other surrogate systems (8Nassal M. Cann A.J. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: DNA Virus Replication. 26. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-40Google Scholar). Even more important will be experiments in naturally hepatitis B virus-infected woodchucks. They should also clarify whether induction of cytotoxic T cells against the transduced coreSN protein would soon abolish its antiviral efficacy or, by contrast, would further contribute to virus elimination by concomitantly inducing a response against wild-type core protein in the infected cells. Hepatitis B virus (HBV),1 an enveloped DNA containing virus that replicates via reverse transcription (1Summers J. Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), is the causative agent of B type hepatitis in humans. Chronic infections affect more than 350 million people worldwide, they have potentially severe consequences such a liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Blumberg B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7121-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and current treatments are of limited efficacy (3Hoofnagle J.H. Digestion. 1998; 59: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Lok A.S. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sustained response rate of the approved high-dose interferon-α therapy is about 30%. Nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine markedly reduce viral load but suffer, inter alia, from the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants (5Locarnini S. Birch C. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 536-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This situation has spurred interest in alternative approaches to interfere with HBV replication (6Nassal M. Arch. Virol. 1997; 142: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whereas only primary human, or chimpanzee, hepatocytes are susceptible to HBV infection in cell culture, a few human hepatoma cell lines like Huh7 and HepG2 support virus production upon transfection with cloned viral DNA. The late steps of the infectious cycle (Fig. 1 A) are hence understood in some detail (7Nassal M. Intervirology. 1999; 42: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Nassal M. Cann A.J. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: DNA Virus Replication. 26. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-40Google Scholar), and they present novel targets for intervention. After infection, the nucleocapsid transports the partially double-stranded circular 3.2-kb DNA genome to the nucleus (9Kann M. Sodeik B. Vlachou A. Gerlich W.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) for conversion into covalently closed circular DNA; this molecule is the transcriptional template for several subgenomic and genomic RNAs that all act as mRNAs. Of these, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is first used to translate both the capsid, or core, protein and the reverse transcriptase, P protein. Then P protein, together with cellular chaperones (10Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), binds to a stem-loop structure, ε, close to the 5′-end of the pgRNA (11Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Knaus T. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Complex formation mediates assembly of immature RNA-containing nucleocapsids (13Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and initiation of reverse transcription (14Beck J. Nassal M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Nassal M. Rieger A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tavis J.E. Perri S. Ganem D. J.

DNA synthesis occurs inside the nucleocapsid and involves several template switches that lead to the characteristic relaxed circular (RC) DNA genome containing a complete (−)-strand and variously extended (+)-strands. Mature DNA-containing nucleocapsids can re-escort the genome to nucleus, or be exported as enveloped virions by budding into a post-endoplasmic reticulum/pre-Golgi compartment. Both events apparently require that at least the (−)-DNA strand be completed (1Summers J. Mason W.S.

Up-regulation of α2 subunit expression is associated with increased intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine, the major methyl group donor and a key compound in cell metabolism and polyamine synthesis. Previous studies have shown that expression of the α2 subunit is differentially regulated in normal and malignant cells. To delineate the molecular basis for the differential regulation of α2 subunit expression, we cloned and characterized the humanMAT2A gene and its promoter and defined regions that contain enhancer and repressor elements. Detailed functional characterization of the proximal promoter of the MAT2A gene revealed the formation of three major protein-DNA complexes with probes containing three Sp1 sites (Sp1-1 at −14, Sp1-2 at −47, and Sp1-3 at −69). Competition with a probe copying sequence between −76 and −54, which contains the Sp1-3 site only, or mutation of this site, abolished complex formation. Furthermore, mutation of the Sp1-3 site, but not the Sp1-1 or Sp1-2 sites, inhibited the in vivopromoter activity by ∼85%. Supershift assays showed that the transcription factors Sp2 and Sp3 are part of the complexes formed at the Sp1-3 site, and that Sp1 does not appear to be directly involved. The data indicate that complex formation is initiated at site Sp1-3, which appears to be essential for promoter activity.

Methylation is essential for the synthesis and modification of proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA. It is well established that DNA methylation can control the expression of certain genes (reviewed in Ref. 3Jones P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Moreover, AdoMet is essential for polyamine biosynthesis and regulates essential metabolic pathways (4Pegg A. McCann P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C212-C221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tabor C.

Inasmuch as the levels of AdoMet vary in different tissues and at different stages of differentiation, it is believed that the regulation of AdoMet synthesis and utilization is important for normal cell development and function (6Finkelstein J.D.

Delineating the mechanism by which the MAT enzymes are regulated will, therefore, be a key to understanding the control of AdoMet level and its contribution to cell growth and differentiation. The catalytic subunit of MAT, designated α, is highly conserved among species. In mammals, the two major MAT isozymes are designated MAT I/III and MAT II, and their catalytic subunits are designated α1 and α2, respectively (12Kotb M. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Geller A.M. Kredich N.M. Chou J.Y. Cantoni G.L. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

Despite the high degree of homology (84% identity at the amino acid level), the mammalian MAT isozymes differ considerably in their physical and kinetic properties as well as in their tissue distribution (12Kotb M.

Expression of α1 is confined to liver, whereas α2 is expressed in all tissues, including liver. In addition to the normal differences in the tissue distribution of the α1 and α2 subunits, expression of these proteins is altered in liver cancer. In hepatic tumors, α1 is markedly down-regulated while α2 expression is increased (18Abe T. Tsukada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Cai J.

Molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of MAT α1 and α2 subunits in normal and malignant tissues are not well defined. In 1985, a human 185-kDa MAT II enzyme was purified to homogeneity from leukemic T cells (22Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated to consist of two related 53- and 51-kDa α2 and α2′ subunits, complexed with a structurally unrelated 38-kDa protein, which was designated the β subunit (22Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ensuing studies showed that the regulation of the MAT II α2 and β subunits expression differs among normal resting, activated, and malignant T cells (23De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M.

Physiological activation of normal human T cells induces the up-regulation of α2/α2′ and the down-regulation of the β subunit; by contrast, expression of both α2/α2′ and β is constitutively high in leukemic B and T cells (23De La Rosa J.

The present study reports functional analysis of 2.4 kbp of theMAT2A promoter, which identified regions with positive and negative regulatory activities that were not reported in previous studies investigating the rat MAT2A genes and a segment of the human MAT2A promoter (26Hiroki T. Horikawa S. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Mao Z. Liu S. Cai J. Huang Z. Lu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Detailed functional analysis of the proximal promoter of the human MAT2A gene, reported here, reveal a region that acts as a nucleation site for formation of protein-DNA complexes and that appears to be essential for promoter activity in vivo. We believe that this information may lead to a better understanding of the differential regulation of MAT II expression and AdoMet levels in different cell types as well as in normal and leukemic human T lymphocytes. Forward and reverse primers based on the sequence of the previously reported MAT II α2 subunit cDNA (28De La Rosa J. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. Kotb M. LeGros Jr., H.L. Valentine M.

The presence of introns was indicated by PCR products larger than predicted from coding sequence, and these products were cloned and sequenced. Intron-exon boundaries of the MAT2A gene were determined by aligning the cDNA sequence of MAT2A cDNA with the genomic sequence. Probes of 80–150 bp spanning exon/intron junctions were used to screen a human P1 genomic library (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO), and clone 2007 was selected for further characterization. Sequence and PCR analyses of the human MAT2A locus identified the location and sizes of the exons and introns. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 500 ml of human blood by the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega) and used for primer extension analysis. Two primers, PE-1 and PE-2, complementary to nucleotides 5′(+10)-GTCCGTTCATGTTGGTG-3′ and nucleotides 5′(−1)-GTTGGTGTCGGTGTGCGGAAGT-3′ of the human MAT II α2 cDNA were synthesized and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Free ATP was removed by the nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen), and labeled primers (500,000 cpm) were hybridized to 2–4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. Extension was performed in the presence of 15 units/μg avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Excess labeled primer was removed using a QIAquick PCR purification system (Qiagen). The eluted cDNA was concentrated and dissolved in 3 μl of loading buffer containing 80% formamide, 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate with 2 mm EDTA), xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide 7 m urea sequencing gels. An M13mp18 sequencing ladder was used as a size marker. We cloned and sequenced ∼2.4 kbp of the 5′-flanking DNA of the humanMAT2A gene. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region +102/−2374 (see Table I) in the presence of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), and the product was cloned into the pGEM-TEasy vector (Promega). The primers introduced aNheI site at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end of the cloned promoter. MAT2A promoter sequence was confirmed by sequencing from both directions with overlapping segments by the fmol sequencing system (Promega).Table ISequence of primers used to generate promoter deletion constructs and probes for EMSAName 1-aPrimers denoted WP and CD were used for promoter constructs.

Open table in a new tab A 2.4-kbp NheI/XhoI-digested fragment of the MAT2A gene containing the 5′-flanking region starting at position −19 from the translation start site was cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene in the pGL3 Enhancer vector (Promega). Insertion orientation was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing from both ends. The pGL3-MAT2A plasmid was treated with T4 DNA ligase (Promega) to repair any nicks. The 5′-deletions were generated by exonuclease III treatment using KpnI/NheI-digested pGL3-MAT2A and the Erase-a-base kit (Promega). Briefly, the vector was digested with NheI to provide 5′-overhangs for digestion with exonuclease III and with KpnI to provide a protected 3′-overhang. The exonuclease III reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and at specific time points aliquots were removed and added to tubes containing S1 nuclease to digest single-stranded DNA. Resultant deletion constructs were blunt-ended with Klenow and ligated to the pGL3 Enhancer vector with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Further deletion constructs were generated by taking advantage of theSacII, ApaI, PstI, and StuI restriction sites within the promoter sequence, or were generated by amplification using specific primers (Table I). All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Functional expression of deletion constructs of the MAT2A promoter was analyzed in Cos-1 and Jurkat T cells. Transient transfection of Cos-1 cells was performed by the TransFast method (Promega) according to manufacturer instructions. Cos-1 cells (1 × 105) were cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum until roughly 70% confluency was reached and transfected with the LUC reporter pGL3-MAT2Apromoter deletion constructs along with cytomegalovirusRenilla luciferase vector (Promega) pRL-CMV DNA (40:1 ratio) as an internal control. Briefly, 400 μl of transfection media (DMEM without fetal bovine serum) containing 600 ng of LUC reporter plasmid were added to the semi-confluent Cos-1 cells along with 15 ng of the pRL-CMV DNA and 4 μl of TransFast. The plates were incubated for 2 h, then 2 ml of DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum was added and incubated for another 48 h at which time the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was assayed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). After normalization to the Renillaluciferase control, the activity of each MAT2A promoter construct was calculated and expressed as relative light units (RLU). All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and experiments were performed at least four times. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. of RLU of at least four different experiments as well as percent RLU relative to the activity of the largest construct used, pGL3-MAT2A(−2374)-LUC, which was set at 100%. Initial attempts to transfect human Jurkat T cells by electroporation yielded low levels of transfection efficiency. However, an almost 300-fold increase in efficiency of transfection of Jurkat cells with the pGL3-MAT2A plasmid was achieved by the method of Kelleret al. (29Keller H. Yunxu C. Marit G. Pla M. Reiffers J. Theze J. Froussard P. Gene. Ther. 1999; 6: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Briefly, 2.5 × 105 Jurkat cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates that had been coated with an adherent monolayer of Cos-1 cells at ∼70% confluency. The cells were co-cultured overnight to allow the Jurkat cells to adhere to the Cos-1 cell monolayer. The next day, the wells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then the pGL3-MAT2A promoter deletion constructs (1.25 μg) were added to the adherent cells along with the controlRenilla luciferase vector pRL-CMV DNA (31.25 ng;i.e. a 40:1 ratio) in a final volume of 400 μl of serum-free DMEM:RPMI medium (1:1) containing 7.7 μl of TransFast (Promega). After incubation at 37 °C for 4–5 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and the cells were further incubated for 36 h in DMEM:RPMI medium (1:1) plus 10% fetal calf serum. The adherent cells were washed with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution and then recovered by trypsinization for 5 min followed by the addition of serum-containing medium to inhibit trypsin activity. The cell mixture was incubated for 2 h in plastic tissue culture plates to separate the adherent Cos-1 cells from the nonadherent Jurkat cells. The Cos-1 cells adhered readily, and the nonadherent Jurkat cells were recovered by gentle pipetting. Jurkat cells isolated in this fashion were subjected to two additional cycles of plastic adherence to remove any residual Cos-1 cells. The purity of the recovered Jurkat cells was >93.0% as analyzed by flow cytometry using a PerCP-Cy5.5-labeled monoclonal anti-human CD3 antibody (Becton and Dickinson, clone SK7). The adherent Cos-1 cells were also recovered, the presence of Jurkat T cells was tested for by flow cytometry using the anti-CD3 mAb, and the population was shown to be 100% pure. Luciferase activity was assayed in extracts of the recovered Jurkat and Cos-1 cells as described above. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by PCR amplification with 32P-end-labeled primers. The amplified DNA representing specific regions of the proximal promoter of the MAT2A gene were generated using the primers listed in Table I. Cos-1 and Jurkat cell nuclear extracts were prepared by washing cell pellets in 1× Hanks' phosphate-buffered saline and resuspending them in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT). After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm, the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, then homogenized. Nuclei were harvested by spinning for 15 min at 4000 rpm, resuspended in hypotonic buffer, and homogenized. An equal volume of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mmDTT) was added, and the extracted nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,500 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were dialyzed for 1 h against 2 liters of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT). Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl final volume by incubating 60 fmol (≈50,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled probe with 5 μg of crude nuclear extracts from Cos-1 or Jurkat cells in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 6 μg of bovine serum albumin for 40 min on ice. The reactions were conducted in the absence or presence of specific or nonspecific competitors, both added at a 100-fold molar excess. Specific competitors were cold probes; nonspecific competitors were unlabeled PCR amplification products of an unrelated DNA sequence, free of sites of interest, and similar in size to specific competitor. An Sp1-specific competitor was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA (catalogue no. SC2502). The DNA-protein complexes formed were analyzed by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were prerun for 1 h at 100 V, and electrophoresis was done at 30 mA of constant current. Supershift assays were performed using antibodies (Abs) to specific factors that have corresponding recognition elements within theMAT2A promoter region analyzed. Binding reactions were carried out as described above in the absence or in the presence of 2 μg of Ab specific to one of the transcription factors of interest. The Ab was premixed with the nuclear extract, incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition of radiolabeled probe, or added after the binding reaction was completed and incubated for 30 min on ice. The following Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used in supershift analyses: mouse anti-Sp1 mAb (catalogue no. sc420X), anti-Sp2 (catalogue no. sc-643X), anti-Sp3 (catalogue no. sc-644X), anti-Sp4 (catalogue no. sc-645X), anti-PEA3 mAb (catalogue no. sc113X), rabbit polyclonal anti-AP-2 (catalogue no. sc184X), anti-c-Myb (catalogue no. sc7874X) Abs, and goat polyclonal anti-GATA1 (catalogue no. sc1233X). 32P-Labeled probe G representing sequences between −76 and −54 was incubated with nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells and separated on native 4% acrylamide gels as described above. The region containing the radiolabeled protein-DNA complexes formed was excised from the gel and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, followed by immunoblotting as described previously (30Halim A.-B. LeGros H.L. Geller A. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29720-29725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using antibodies to members of the Sp1 family of transcription factors that were used in the supershift analysis. Sp1 site mutations of clone pGL3-MAT2A (110)-LUC were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (23De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following mutagenic oligos: 5′mSp1-1F, CCT CCCGCT GCT TCG TTC; 3′mSp1-1R, CAG CGA ACG AAG CAG CGG GAG GTG CG; 5′mSp1-2F, TCG CGG GCG CTG CTC TA; 3′mSp1-2R, TTA TAG AGC AGC GCC CGC GAG C; 5′mSP1–3F, AGG TGC GTG GCC CGA GC; and 3′mSp1-3R, GCT CGG GCC ACG CAC CT. Primers 5′CD3 and 3′WP, which flank the 3 Sp1 sites, were used to amplify the whole region (see Table I). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). The resultant mutagenized fragments were confirmed by sequence analysis, excised using KpnI andXhoI, and individually cloned into the pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega). The in vitro and in vivo activity of each of the three Sp1 mutants was determined as described above. EMSA probes were generated using the mutated pGEM-T-Easy clones as templates and outside primers 5′CD3 and 3′WGS (TableI). Paired t tests were used to test for significant differences between the in vivoactivity of the MAT2A promoter constructs. All constructs were analyzed in triplicate, and experiments were performed at least four times. Human P1 genomic clone 2007, encompassing the entire MAT2A gene, was used to characterize the gene and its promoter. The human MAT2A gene consisted of nine exons separated by eight introns, contained within ∼6 kbp of genomic DNA (31Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar) (Table II). The exons ranged from 78 (exon 2) to 1639 bp (exon 9) in size (Fig.1). Exon 1 contained 91 bp of coding sequence and 120 bp of 5′-untranslated region, and exon 9 contained 100 bp of coding sequence and 1539 bp of 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The overall organization of the human MAT2A gene was very similar to the rat MAT2A (26Hiroki T. Horikawa S. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the human MAT1Agenes (32Ubagai T. Lei K.J. Huang S. Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Chou J.Y. J. Clin.

Open table in a new tab Identification of the transcription start site was determined by primer extension as detailed under “Materials and Methods” using poly(A)+ RNA from normal human lymphocytes and primers PE-1 and PE-2 complementary to nucleotides starting at positions +10 and −1, respectively, relative to the translation start site. As shown in Fig. 2, transcription begins at position −120 relative to the translation start site. These data are in conflict with data by Mao et al. (27Mao Z. Liu S. Cai J. Huang Z. Lu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) who reported that the transcription of the human MAT2A gene start site is located at −132 upstream of the translation start site, but are in close agreement with Hiroki et al. (26Hiroki T. Horikawa S. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the transcription initiation site for the ratMAT2A gene is located 123 bp upstream of the translation start codon. The sequence of 2.4 kbp of the 5′-flanking region of theMAT2A promoter is shown in Fig.3. Sequence analysis identified the presence of recognition sequences for a large number of transcription factors. They include the canonical TATA box at −32 and an inverted CAT box at −88, and three Sp1 sites, which we designated Sp1-1 (−14/−9), Sp1-2 (−47/−39), and Sp1-3 (−69/−63). The Sp1-3 site is also the GC box. Putative binding sites for several transcription factors were found, and they included an AP-2 site at −104, two PEA3 sites at −119 and −273, a GATA1 site at −212, and an NF-1 site at −446 relative to the transcription start site. A series of deletion constructs were used to test the functionality of the various sites, as discussed below. A series of 5′-MAT2A promoter deletion constructs coupled to a firefly luciferase reporter gene in a pGL3 Enhancer vector were generated as described under “Materials and Methods” and used to analyze functional expression in Cos-1 and Jurkat human leukemic T cells. The pattern of the MAT2A promoter activity was very similar in both cell types (Fig. 4). Promoter sequences contained between −87 and −58 from the transcription start site harbor most of the necessary elements required to drive transcription of the MAT2A gene (Fig. 4); however, sequences between −325 and −128 significantly contributed to enhanced promoter activity. Sequential deletions gradually reduced promoter activity with a significant (p < 0.05) drop in activity when sequences between −128 and −110 were deleted (Fig. 4), suggesting that this region contains elements that enhance promoter activity. The inclusion of the region from −1281 to −423 significantly reduced promoter activity (p < 0.001), suggesting the presence of repressor elements particularly in the region from −423 to −325. This region contains recognition sites for a c-Myb motif at −359 (−), an AP-2 site at −396 (−), and an Sp1 site at −406. Interestingly, a marked and highly significant enhancement of promoter activity was observed when sequences between −1881 and −1281 were included (p < 0.001). This enhancement, which was seen in five different experiments, was significantly suppressed by the inclusion of 5′-flanking sequences from −2374 to −1881 (p < 0.001). The latter region contains the following putative transcription factors recognition sites: an AP-2 site at −1886, an NF-Y site at −2025, a c-Myb site at −2309 and two GR sites at −2281 and −2347, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2020795256,"Rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) has two highly conserved motifs (HXKX4D), denoted HKD, located in the N- and C-terminal halves, which are required for phospholipase D activity. The two halves of rPLD1 can associatein vivo, and the association is essential for catalytic activity and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme. In this study, we found that this association is also required for palmitoylation of rPLD1, which occurs on cysteines 240 and 241. In addition, palmitoylation of rPLD1 requires the N-terminal sequence but not the conserved C-terminal sequence, since rPLD1 that lacks the first 168 amino acids is not palmitoylated in vivo, while the inactive C-terminal deletion mutant is. Palmitoylation of rPLD1 is not necessary for catalytic activity, since N-terminal truncation mutants lacking the first 168 or 319 amino acids exhibit high basal activity although they cannot be stimulated by protein kinase C (PKC). The lack of response to PKC is not due to the lack of palmitoylation, since mutation of both Cys240 and Cys241 to alanine in full-length rPLD1 abolishes palmitoylation, but the mutant still retains basal activity and responds to PKC. Palmitoylation-deficient rPLD1 can associate with crude membranes; however, the association is weakened. Wild type rPLD1 remains membrane-associated when extracted with 1 m NaCl or Na2CO3 (pH 11), while rPLD1 mutants that lack palmitoylation are partially released. In addition, we found that palmitoylation-deficient mutants are much less modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation compared with wild type rPLD1. Characterization of the other cysteine mutations of rPLD1 showed that mutation of cysteine 310 or 612 to alanine increased basal phospholipase D activity 2- and 4-fold, respectively. In summary, palmitoylation of rPLD1 requires interdomain association and the presence of the N-terminal 168 amino acids. Mutations of cysteines 240 and 241 to alanine abolish the extensive Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme and weaken its association with membranes. Rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) has two highly conserved motifs (HXKX4D), denoted HKD, located in the N- and C-terminal halves, which are required for phospholipase D activity. The two halves of rPLD1 can associatein vivo, and the association is essential for catalytic activity and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme. In this study, we found that this association is also required for palmitoylation of rPLD1, which occurs on cysteines 240 and 241.

Wild type rPLD1 remains membrane-associated when extracted with 1 m NaCl or Na2CO3 (pH 11), while rPLD1 mutants that lack palmitoylation are partially released. In addition, we found that palmitoylation-deficient mutants are much less modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation compared with wild type rPLD1. Characterization of the other cysteine mutations of rPLD1 showed that mutation of cysteine 310 or 612 to alanine increased basal phospholipase D activity 2- and 4-fold, respectively. In summary, palmitoylation of rPLD1 requires interdomain association and the presence of the N-terminal 168 amino acids. Mutations of cysteines 240 and 241 to alanine abolish the extensive Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme and weaken its association with membranes. phospholipase D rat PLD protein kinase C polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylcholine phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate Phospholipase D (PLD)1is a ubiquitous enzyme found in bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid and choline. Phosphatidic acid is generally recognized as the signaling product of PLD and functions as an effector in different physiological processes. It can also be converted to diacylglycerol or to lysophosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol is a well characterized activator for protein kinase C (PKC), while lysophosphatidic acid is a major extracellular signal that acts on specific cell surface receptors. PLD also catalyzes a phosphatidyl transfer reaction using primary alcohols as nucleophilic acceptors to produce phosphatidylalcohols. This reaction is used as a specific measure of PLD activity. PLD activity has been found to be highly regulated (2Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Different factors, including protein-tyrosine kinases, PKC, heterotrimeric and small G proteins, and intracellular Ca2+ regulate PLD activity directly or indirectly (2Exton J.H. Physiol.

Based on the wide involvement of PLD in signaling pathways and the actions of its products, multiple functions of PLD have been proposed (2Exton J.H. Physiol.

Two isoforms of mammalian PLD (PLD1 and PLD2) have been cloned. These isoforms share about 50% amino acid similarity but exhibit quite different regulatory properties.

The enzymes within the family exhibit diverse functions and include phospholipid synthases, poxvirus envelope proteins, aYersinia murine toxin, and the Nuc endonuclease. Despite the distinct substrate specificities of the superfamily members, the consensus HKD motif appears to be essential for their enzymatic activity. PLD contains two copies of the HKD motif located in the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule, respectively. Mutation of either HKD motif inactivates human PLD1 and mouse PLD2 (12Sung T.C.

Biochemical and structural studies of the Nuc endonuclease and Yersiniatoxin suggest that the histidine residue in the conserved motif is directly involved in the catalytic reaction by forming a phosphoenzyme intermediate (26Rudolph A.E.

Our studies on the rat PLD1 (rPLD1) isoform showed that the enzyme could be split into two halves and that PLD activity could be restored when the two fragments were coexpressed in COS7 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the N- and C-terminal fragments could physically associate (11Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that the association brought the two HKD domains together to form a catalytic center. Further studies showed that conserved amino acids in the HKD domains were important for the interdomain association and that the association was essential for the catalysis of the enzyme (29Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that rPLD1 can be modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation, and this modification is also required for the association of the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1. We also found that the phosphorylated rPLD1 localizes exclusively in the membrane fraction (29Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the interdomain association was also required for the palmitoylation of rPLD1. We investigated the role of this lipid modification and of cysteine amino acids in the catalysis and properties of rPLD1. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, bovine serum albumin, Triton X-100, and microcystin were from Sigma.

Anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Vector Laboratories. The AmplifyTM and Hyperfilm-MP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The N-terminal Xpress-tagged full-length or truncated rPLD1 or the N- or C-terminal fragments of rPLD1 with coding regions corresponding to amino acids 1–584 and 585–1036, respectively, were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloned (11Xie Z.

The deletion or site-directed mutations of rPLD1 were generated as described in the QuickChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis instruction manual from Stratagene. All of the constructs were sequenced to verify the coding regions of rPLD1. The oligonucleotide pairs from 5′ to 3′ for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: rPLD1(C79A), GATCTACCTCTCTGGCGCTCCTGTAAAAGCAC and GTGCTTTTACAGGAGCGCCAGAGAGGTAGATC; rPLD1(C240A), GATACCAGGTGTGAATGCCTGTGGCCATGGAAGA and TCTTCCATGGCCACAGGCATTCACACCTGGTATC; rPLD1(C241A), CCAGGTGTGAATTGCGCTGGCCATGGAAGAGCC and GGCTCTTCCATGGCCAGCGCAATTCACACCTGG; rPLD1(C240A,C241A), GATACCAGGTGTGAATGCCGCTGGCCATGGAAGAGC and GCTCTTCCATGGCCAGCGGCATTCACACCTGGTATC; rPLD1(C310A), GACACTGATTTTAAAAGCTAACAGCTACAGACA and TGCATGTCTGTAGCTGTTAGCTTTTAAAATCAGTGTC; rPLD1(C403A), CGCTGGAGGCTGGACGCCATCCTCAAACGGAA and TTCCGTTTGAGGATGGCGTCCAGCCTCCAGCG; rPLD1(C612A), CATGGGAAGGATTACGCCAACTTTGTCTTCAAG and CTTGAAGACAAAGTTGGCGTAATCCTTCCCATG. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in humidified 10% CO2. Six-well plates were seeded with 2 × 105 COS7 cells/well, and 10-cm dishes were seeded with 6 × 105 cells and transfected with FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 6-h transfection with FuGENE6, COS7 cells in six-well plates were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid. After overnight starvation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 50 min. PLD activity was then assayed as described (30Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in 0.3% 1-butanol for 25 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and stopped with methanol. Lipids were extracted, and the phosphatidylbutanol product was resolved by thin layer chromatography. Bands comigrating with a phosphatidylbutanol standard were quantitated by scintillation counting. COS7 cells in 100-mm plates were harvested after transfection with wild type or mutant rPLD1 constructs and starved overnight as described above. For each rPLD1 construct, we transfected six 100-mm plates of COS7 cells, and the cells were combined and washed and harvested with ice-cold PBS buffer. They were then centrifuged and resuspended in 750 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture containing leupeptin, aprotinin, and pefabloc). The cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle seven times, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 120,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. The particulate fraction was washed twice with the lysis buffer and resuspended in 450 μl of this buffer by passing through a 27-gauge needle until the pellet was resuspended. The suspension (150 μg of protein) was then split into three parts and supplemented with 100 μl of lysis buffer containing the appropriate concentration of either NaCl, Na2CO3 (pH 11), or Triton X-100 to make the final concentration of these reagents in the buffer 1 m NaCl, 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 11), or 1% Triton X-100, respectively. The mixtures were further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the supernatant and pellet fraction. The pellet fraction was rinsed with 750 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer two times and then resuspended with 250 μl of lysis buffer. Equal volumes of the cytosolic and membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. The intensity of the bands corresponding to rPLD1 in the cytosol or membrane fractions was quantitated by densitometry. The amounts of the indicated rPLD1 constructs in the cytosol or membrane fractions were calculated as percentage of the total enzyme in both. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 8% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). The blots were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (1 mg/ml) (1:5000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. COS7 cells cultured on 6-well plates were transfected and starved as described above. The cells (3 μg of protein) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 50 mm KC1, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 μmmicrocystin, and two tablets of protease mixture. The cell suspension was then passed through a 27-gauge needle five times, and the resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the unbroken cells. The supernatant was then precleared by mixing it with 1 μg of affinity-purified mouse IgG and 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 2 μl of Xpress mouse antibody (1 mg/ml) and 20 μl of protein A beads overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. After 24 h of transfection, COS7 cells cultured on six-well plate's were preincubated for 1 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 0.2 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid for 4 h in the preincubation medium. [3H]palmitic acid was dried under N2 and resuspended in ethanol, and the final volume of ethanol was 1% of that of the incubation medium. After the radiolabeling, cells were washed twice with cold PBS buffer and then scraped with the immunoprecipitation buffer and immunoprecipitated followed by washes as described above. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. For fluorography, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then incubated in fixing solution containing isopropyl alcohol/H2O/acetic acid (25:65:10) for 30 min. The gel was then treated with AmplifyTM for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP at −80 °C. For hydroxylamine treatment, duplicate gels were treated with either 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) or 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) overnight at room temperature and then subjected to fluorography as described above. Our study of the palmitoylation of rPLD1 was initiated when we tried to examine the role of the conserved amino acids at the C-terminal end in PLD catalysis. Mutagenesis studies showed that an intact C-terminal end and the hydrophobicity of the last four amino acids, EVWT, were essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (31Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We investigated whether this hydrophobicity was required for a potential palmitoylation of rPLD1, since human PLD1 had been shown to be palmitoylated, and lack of this lipid modification was reported to destroy the catalytic activity of the enzyme (32Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We first transfected COS7 cells with either wild type rPLD1 or an inactive C-terminal deletion mutant rPLD1-(1–1032) and radiolabeled the cells with [3H]palmitic acid. All of the rPLD1 constructs used in the studies were tagged with Xpress epitope if not specified. The exogenously transfected rPLD1 constructs were then immunoprecipitated by anti-Xpress antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.1 A) and fluorography (Fig.1 B) for the expression and the palmitoylation of the constructs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 B, tritium incorporation was observed in a 120-kDa band that corresponded to the size of both wild type and the C-terminal deleted rPLD1. The reduced tritium incorporation observed in the rPLD1-(1–1032) is attributable to the reduced level of this mutant in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A). Thus, both wild type rPLD1 and the C-terminal deletion mutant of the enzyme were palmitoylated in COS7 cells. The incorporation of tritium was analyzed further by treating gels containing tritium-labeled rPLD1 constructs with 1 mTris-HCl (pH 7.0) or 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0). Only the hydroxylamine treatment released the tritium incorporated into wild type rPLD1 and its C-terminal deletion mutant, confirming that the palmitoylation of the enzyme is through a thioester linkage (data not shown). Alanine mutagenesis of cysteine residues of rPLD1 showed that the palmitoylation of rPLD1 occurs on Cys240 and Cys241. As shown in Fig. 2, wild type PLD1 was expressed (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) and palmitoylated (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) in COS7 cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. However, no tritium incorporation was observed in the double cysteine mutant, rPLD1(C240A,C241A) (Fig. 2 B,lane 2), although the constructs were expressed and immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). Mutation of the other cysteine residues did not affect the palmitoylation of rPLD1 (see Fig. 4 or data not shown). The finding that rPLD1 was palmitoylated on Cys240and Cys241 was consistent with studies of human PLD1 (32Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Figure 4Palmitoylation of rPLD1 is required for extensive Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the enzyme. Wild type rPLD1 or the indicated cysteine mutants were transfected into COS7 cells. After 24 h of expression, the cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antiphospho-Thr antibodies (A) or anti-Xpress antibodies (C). D, after Western blotting and enhanced chemiluminescence detection, the blot from Cwas rinsed with PBS, air-dried, and exposed to Tritium Screen at room temperature for 10 days and scanned by the StormTM 860 detection system from Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of the palmitoylation-deficient human PLD1 had shown that the lipid modification was required for efficient action of the enzyme, since mutation of both of the palmitoylation sites abolished most of the catalytic activity of the enzyme (32Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This was surprising, since our previous studies of N-terminal deletion mutants of rPLD1 showed that the basal catalytic activity of rPLD1-(320–1036) was not decreased but was enhanced (10Park S.-K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this discrepancy was that alternative cysteines were used for palmitoylation in this N-terminal deletion mutation. We therefore investigated the palmitoylation of this mutant along with that of two other rPLD1 mutants that lacked either the first 50 or the first 168 amino acids. COS7 cells transiently transfected with the N-terminal deletion mutants were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, and the expressed rPLD1 constructs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A) and fluorography (Fig. 2, B and C). As shown in Fig.2 B, rPLD1-(51–1036) was palmitoylated in COS7 cells, but no apparent tritium incorporation was observed into rPLD1-(320–1036), which lacks Cys240 and Cys241. Surprisingly, rPLD1-(169–1036), which still retains Cys240 and Cys241, also lacked detectable tritium incorporation. This indicates that palmitoylation of rPLD1 requires the presence of the N-terminal 168 amino acids. More importantly, the fact that the N-terminal deletion mutants, rPLD1-(169–1036) and rPLD1-(320–1036), that lacked palmitoylation still exhibited high basal activity (10Park S.-K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) indicates that palmitoylation of rPLD1 is not necessary for its catalytic activity. The same protein samples shown in Fig.2 A were also reanalyzed in Fig. 2 A*, with the difference that different amounts were loaded so that a comparable ECL signal of the protein samples could be obtained by Western blotting. Our previous studies showed that rPLD1 could be split into two halves and that the N- and C-terminal halves associated in vivo. This interdomain association was important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme and the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the rPLD1 (11Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34679-34682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of the interdomain association on the palmitoylation of rPLD1. COS7 cells were cotransfected with wild type or mutated N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1 as indicated in Fig.3. The N-terminal fragments were tagged with V5 epitope, while the C-terminal fragment was tagged with Xpress epitope. After 24 h of expression followed by 4 h of labeling with [3H]palmitic acid, COS7 cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with both anti-Xpress and anti-V5 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.3 A) with both anti-V5 and anti-Xpress antibodies to probe the expression of the N- and C-terminal halves of rPLD1. The palmitoylation was analyzed by fluorography to detect tritium incorporation (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 B(lane 4), tritium incorporation was detected in the ∼66-kDa band, which corresponds to the size of the N-terminal half of rPLD1 when COS7 cells were cotransfected with the wild type N- and C-terminal halves. Mutation of Ile470 in the N-terminal half or of Ile870 in the C-terminal half of rPLD1 has been shown to disrupt the interdomain association (29Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The interdomain interaction was almost abolished when the Ser873 in the C-terminal half was mutated to alanine (Fig. 3, C andD). When COS7 cells were transfected with the N- and C-terminal fragments carrying these mutations, no apparent tritium incorporation was detected in the N-ter"
https://openalex.org/W2004595886,"The <i>ets</i> transcription factor PU.1 is an important regulator of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene intronic enhancer, or μ enhancer. However, PU.1 is only one component of the large multiprotein complex required for B cell-specific enhancer activation. The transcriptional coactivator HMG-I(Y), a protein demonstrated to physically interact with PU.1, increases PU.1 affinity for the μ enhancer μB element, indicating that HMG-I(Y) may play a role in the transcriptionally active μ enhanceosome. Increased PU.1 affinity is not mediated by HMG-I(Y)-induced changes in DNA structure. Investigation of alternative mechanisms to explain the HMG-I(Y)-mediated increase in PU.1/μ enhancer binding demonstrated, by trypsin and chymotrypsin mapping, that interaction between PU.1 and HMG-I(Y) in solution induces a structural change in PU.1. In the presence of HMG-I(Y) and wild-type μ enhancer DNA, PU.1 becomes more chymotrypsin resistant, suggesting an additional change in PU.1 structure upon HMG-I(Y)-induced PU.1/DNA binding. From these results, we suggest that increased DNA affinity under limiting PU.1 concentrations is mediated by an HMG-I(Y)-induced structural change in PU.1. In functional assays, HMG-I(Y) further augments transcriptional synergy between PU.1 and another member of the <i>ets</i> family, Ets-1, indicating that HMG-I(Y) is a functional component of the active enhancer complex. These studies suggest a new mechanism for HMG-I(Y)-mediated coactivation; HMG-I(Y) forms protein-protein interactions with a transcription factor, which alters the three-dimensional structure of the factor, resulting in enhanced DNA binding and transcriptional activation. This mechanism may be important for transcriptional activation under conditions of limiting transcription factor concentration, such as at the low levels of PU.1 expressed in B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008274524,"Twenty-one conserved positively charged and aromatic amino acids between residues 331 and 462 of sigma 54 were changed to alanine, and the mutant proteins were studied by transcription, band shift analysis, and footprinting in vitro. A small segment corresponding to the rpoN box was found to be most important for binding duplex DNA. Two amino acids, 52 residues apart, were found to be critical for maintaining transcriptional silencing in the absence of activator. These two activator bypass mutants and several other mutants failed to bind the type of fork junction DNA thought to be required to maintain silencing. The two bypass mutants showed a binding pattern to DNA probes that was unique, both in comparison to other C-terminal mutants and to previously known N-terminal bypass mutants. On this basis, a model is proposed for the role of the C terminus and the N terminus of sigma 54 in enhancer-dependent transcription.

On this basis, a model is proposed for the role of the C terminus and the N terminus of sigma 54 in enhancer-dependent transcription. nitrogen regulator protein C nitrogen fixation H Sigma 54 is unique among bacterial sigma factors with regard to both amino acid sequence and transcription mechanism. It is not a member of the sigma 70 family of proteins and is uniquely required to transcribe from enhancer-dependent promoters. As with most sigmas, promoter recognition involves two DNA sequence elements separated by a defined number of base pairs. Initially the holoenzyme binds the two sigma 54-specific promoter elements, termed −24 and −12 in reference to locations that include conserved nucleotides (1Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme typically remains tightly bound until signal transduction leads to activation by a protein bound to a remote enhancer element (2Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. 1986; 45: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3Morett E. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Sasse-Dwight S.

Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme is initially inactive, because it cannot open the DNA and engage the transcription start site; the enhancer protein overcomes this block, thus allowing the DNA to open and transcription to begin (reviewed in Ref. 6Gralla J.D. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The use of enhancers and the common regulation at the DNA melting step differentiates this class of holoenzymes from all others in bacteria (reviewed in Ref. 7Buck M. Gallegos M. Studholme D. Guo Y. Gralla J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). All sigma factors use the common core enzyme so these differences are solely attributed to the nature of the sigma factor. In addition to binding duplex DNA, sigma factors bind single-stranded DNA and structures with single strand and duplex DNA juxtaposed (fork junction structures, Ref. 8Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the case of sigma 54, these latter interactions are central to control by the holoenzyme (6Gralla J.D. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3746-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Guo Y. Lew C.

Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Within the inactive closed complex containing sigma 54 holoenzyme, a single base pair adjacent to the −12 recognition element is transiently melted (12Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This provides a transient double-strand/ single-strand fork junction structure. Interaction at this fork is repressive in the sense that the conformation of sigma bound to it helps keep the holoenzyme silent by blocking its ability to melt DNA. Activators can overcome this silencing by triggering conformational changes in both sigma and holoenzyme (6Gralla J.D. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Guo Y. Lew C. Gralla J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both the silent state and the active state rely on a complex network of interactions that centrally involve the promoter −12 element (9Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3746-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9538-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Wang L. Gralla J.D. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5626-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang L. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7558-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions with the −24 elements are simpler and are the dominant factor in directing general DNA binding (16Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Wong C. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The motifs on sigma 54 that direct these various DNA interactions are not well established but appear to involve primarily N-terminal and C-terminal sequences. A short N-terminal region is required for regulation; numerous deregulated bypass forms of sigma have been identified with changes in the first 50 amino acids (19Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Syed A. Gralla J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Kelly M.T. Hoover T.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3351-3357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Holoenzymes containing these mutant forms of sigma can transcribein vitro in the absence of activator. These holoenzymes have also lost the capacity to bind the fork junction structure associated with the silent state of the closed complex. They have also gained an ability to interact with downstream single-stranded DNA (9Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3746-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutations in the C-terminal region can destroy general DNA binding and this property is not shared by N-terminal mutants (16Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Wong C. Tintut Y. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the −24 interaction is dominant for DNA binding, it is presumed that the C terminus recognizes this element. The C-terminal region also contains determinants that are needed for activation of the holoenzyme (21Kelly M.T. Hoover T.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3351-3357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and both ends of the protein have been proposed to participate in recognition of the −12 promoter element (17Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Merrick M. Chambers S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a deregulated, bypass point mutation has been identified within the C-terminal region (23Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is obvious that the C-terminal region of sigma 54 has a particularly complex array of functions. Subregions of potential importance within the C terminus have been identified. Among these are the following: a block of 10 almost completely conserved amino acids termed the rpoN box (25van Slooten J.C. Broughton W.J. Wong C.H. Stanley J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5563-5574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a segment originally suggested to have the potential to form a helix-turn-helix (HTH, Ref. 26Coppard J.R. Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and a segment that can be cross-linked to DNA (27Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Collectively, these segments and others that have proposed functions (28Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cover a region of ∼150 amino acids. This extensive region may contain activities that contribute to recognition of duplex DNA, fork junction DNA, and single strand DNA. In studies of sigma 54 and sigma 70, the most prominent residues involved in DNA recognition are positively charged and aromatic amino acids (24Merrick M. Chambers S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fenton M. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D.

The C terminus of sigma 54 contains many such residues, and these have a tendency to cluster within the motifs suggested to be important. To learn the role of these residues and to identify the array of functions within the C terminus we have mutated each of these residues individually, purified the mutant proteins, and characterized them using biochemical assays. The collection displays a rich array of properties, which allows the role of the C terminus in both regulation and DNA binding to be understood to a much greater extent. The plasmid pAS54, derived from expression plasmid pJF5401, carries theEscherichia coli sigma 54 gene (33Syed A. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5619-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis at the desired positions with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of the correct mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The strain E. coli YMC109 lacking a wild-type chromosomal copy of the sigma 54 gene was used as the host. Sigma 54 and its derivatives were partially purified by modified methods based on those described (13Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9538-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 ml of Luria-Bertani medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with YMC109 cells transformed with expression vector that carries the appropriate sigma 54 mutant. The cell culture was grown to 1 OD at 30 °C with vigorous aeration. The culture was shifted to 43 °C and grown for another 3–4 h to induce expression. Cells were collected and suspended in 300 μl of buffer S (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation of the cell lysate, the pellet containing the inclusion body was dissolved in 150 μl of buffer S plus 4 m guanidine-HCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (nonionic detergent). Sonication was used to help dissolve the pellet, which was then dialyzed, first against buffer S with 1 mguanidium-HCl, then against buffer S, and finally against buffer S with 40% glycerol. After each dialysis, the undissolved material was discarded. The protein concentration was estimated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel against known protein markers. Standard one-round in vitro transcription was used as described previously (13Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9538-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activated transcription reaction mixture contained 100 nm NtrC,1 45 nm sigma 54 holoenzyme (core RNA polymerase is from Epicentre Technology), 5 nm supercoiled DNA template pTH8, 10 mm carbamyl phosphate, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.05 mm CTP, 4 μCi of [32P]UTP, 50 μm unlabeled UTP, and 3 mm ATP in transcription buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng of bovine serum albumin, and 3.5% polyethylene glycol), in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. When NtrC is present, the reaction mixture was preincubated without GTP, UTP, and CTP for 20 min at 37 °C. When NtrC is absent, the reaction mixture is preincubated with GTP and CTP for 20 min at 37 °C. ATP was always present at the concentration of 3 mm. After preincubation, the missing nucleotides and heparin (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of urea-saturated formamide dye, and the mixtures were loaded on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. The data were analyzed with a phosphorimager. The band shift analysis was done as described (9Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3746-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the probes were prepared by annealing two complementary DNA strands. The lengths of bottom strand and top strand are specifically described in the legends. The annealing mixture contained 4 pmol of labeled bottom-strand DNA and 6 pmol of top strand in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl. The mixture was boiled for 2 min and gradually cooled to room temperature. Annealing was monitored by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 10 μl of band shift assay mixture contained 1 nm DNA, 15 nm RNA polymerase, and 6.0 ng of poly(dI-dC) per μl in 1× HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.8% polyethylene glycol 8000). To detect the induced interaction by NtrC, 625 nm NtrC was added into the mixture to act from solution. The mixtures were incubated at 37 or 15 °C for 10 min and subjected to 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was run at 350 V in ice. After electrophoresis, the radioactive bands were visualized and analyzed with a phosphorimager. The nifH promoter fragment from −59 to +29 was synthesized by Operon technology. The bottom strand DNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with the complementary top strand. The 10-μl reaction mixture contained 0.8 nm DNA, 45 nm holoenzyme, and 6.0 ng of dI-dC per μl in 1× HEPES buffer (as described above) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then 0.8 μl of DNase I solution (1 mg/ml in 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mmCaCl2) was added into the mixture and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of stop solution (20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2 m NaCl). The DNA was precipitated and dissolved in 5 μl of urea-saturated formamide dye and loaded on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. The data were analyzed with a phosphorimager. We identified 21 highly conserved positively charged and aromatic amino acids within the 150 amino acid region from residue 319 to 469. Each of these was conserved in at least 18 of the 21 sigma 54 sequences available at the start of this study. They were changed individually to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmids carrying mutated sigma 54 genes were transferred individually to a strain lacking endogenous sigma 54. The 21 mutants and the wild-type sigma protein were partially purified in 2 batches of 11 proteins each. In general the proteins were judged to be 50–80% pure. The single exception was R383A, which was poorly induced, possibly because of a folding defect, and thus was much less pure. As a comparison for this form of sigma a mock purification was done from a strain lacking plasmid and thus containing only contaminating proteins. The 22 forms of sigma were used in equal amounts for biochemical experiments, as judged from staining of the protein gels. The holoenzymes were formed using a 4:1 ratio of sigma to core. Although the N terminus is the primary locus of in vitro deregulated bypass mutants, a recent in vitro study found this property to be associated with a C-terminal change (23Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This mutant, R336A, is within the collection just described. To determine whether R336 is unique or belongs to a family that determines the requirement for activator, all altered sigma 54 holoenzymes were tested with a protocol for activator-independent transcription in vitro. The activator-independent bypass transcription assay was done using plasmid pTH8 that carries the glnAP2 promoter as a template (19Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme, template DNA and ATP, GTP, and CTP were preincubated to allow the potential for initiation without activator. Then, heparin was added to destroy any residual closed complex. [32P]UTP was added to initiate a round of transcription. No activator was included, and in control experiments one round of activated transcription with wild-type holoenzyme was used for comparison. The template contains a downstream terminator, permitting a discrete RNA to be assayed. In this assay, wild-type and 19 of the 21 mutant proteins showed very low levels of activator-independent transcription, less than 5% of the amount produced by activated wild-type holoenzyme (Fig.1). Two of the mutant sigmas give high transcription levels. R336A gives a 90% signal in this assay, consistent with expectations from the prior report (23Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition K388A gives a high signal, at approximately the 50% level. We note that these residues are not close to each other. One is within the region that can cross-link to DNA, and the other is within or directly adjacent to the putative HTH motif. We also note that residues that are very close to each of these bypass mutants, such as Lys-331 and Arg-342 that surround Arg-336, and Arg-383, Tyr-389, and Arg-394 that surround Lys-388, do not show this property when mutated. These properties and others to be assayed below are collected in TableI. We infer that silencing in the absence of activator is conferred by widely separated amino acids within the C terminus. In contrast to bypass mutants in the N terminus, the silencing determinants do not involve extensive adjacent stretches of amino acids.Table IMutant propertiesSigma 54bypass trxn1-atrxn, transcription.Activated trxnDNA bindingT12 bindingT9 bindingsupershift37 °C15 °CDNaseIgel shiftWT−+++++++++++++++++K331A−+++++/++++++++R336A+++++++−+++/++R342A−+++++++++++++F355A−+++/−+++/−+K363A−++++++++++++++R383A−+/−+/−−+/−+/−+/−+/−K388A++++/++++/−−++Y389A−+++++++++++++++++R394A−+++++++++++++/++++F397A−+++++++++++++++++K400A−+++++/−−−+Y401A−++++++++++++/−++R402A−+++++++++++++++F403A−+/+++/−+/−+/−−−+/−R421A−+++++−−+K425A−+++/+++/+++/+++/−+/−+/++R455A−+/−−+/−+/−−−−R456A−−−−−−−−K460A−+++++−−+Y461A−+/−−−−−−−R462A−−−+/−−−−−1-a trxn, transcription. Open table in a new tab Next, the 22 proteins were assayed for transcription using a protocol that strictly depends on activator. In this protocol heparin is added after activator but prior to addition of initiating nucleotides. The experiment is done under optimal conditions for in vitro transcription, including 37 °C and high concentrations of all proteins. Under these conditions transcription depends strictly on activator with very little bypass transcription. This stringency was shown in prior experiments using strong N-terminal bypass mutants (19Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and is also true for the C-terminal bypass mutants just described (not shown). Fig.2 shows the results of this activated transcription assay using the mutant holoenzymes. The data from several experiments is compiled in Fig. 2 B, where the transcription level is normalized to that of the wild-type holoenzyme. Under these conditions, 15 of the 21 mutant holoenzymes behave normally, giving a level of activated transcription not significantly different from wild-type. Of the six defective mutants, four are in the rpoN box region, K455A, R456A, Y461A, and R462A. A fifth mutant is R383A, which because of its low purity cannot be firmly assigned as being defective in activated transcription. The remaining mutant, F355A is the least defective of the group (see also Ref. 30Oguiza J.A. Gallegos M.-T. Chaney M.K. Cannon W.V. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 873-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We infer that residues within the rpoN box region are particularly important for obtaining a signal in the activated transcription experiment. Other segments of the C terminus seem to be less important in this assay. We note that the two mutants that gave bypass transcription in Fig. 1 are not in the rpoN box, suggesting that the determinants for silencing and those required to lead to activated transcription are at least partially separable. In the next experiment, the efficiency of the activated transcription assay was lowered to see if secondary defects would turn up in residues outside the rpoN box region. This simply involved lowering the temperature from 37 to 15 °C. Under these conditions, several other mutants showed partial defects (Fig. 3). Now only 8 of the 21 mutants retained a transcription level of greater than 80% of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 B). The four mutants in the rpoN box that showed defects under optimal conditions were now even more defective. R383A and F355A were not much affected by the change in temperature. Seven mutants showed defects only in this assay, and they were not clustered in any region, being scattered between amino acids 336 and 460. It appears that residues throughout the C-terminal region play some role in activated transcription. These include Arg-336 and Lys-388, which play a primary role in silencing and now are seen to have their activated transcription levels reduced to half of the wild-type level under these suboptimal conditions. We note that the data makes no clear distinction between positively charged and aromatic residues; both types are among the six residues that are most defective and among the eight residues that show no defect in either assay. These data indicate that the rpoN box residues play a primary role in transcription. A secondary role is played by residues scattered throughout the C-terminal 150 amino acids. As closed complex formation is a prerequisite for transcription we next assayed duplex DNA binding using the 21 mutant holoenzymes. The stability of closed complexes is generally less than that of open complexes and so two different assays were used, DNase footprinting and a band shift analysis. A fragment of the nifH promoter, which contains the central consensus sequence of the −24 and −12 elements, was used in both assays. Closed complex footprints are known to cover these two elements but yield incomplete protection; the interaction does not extend very far beyond the elements, in particular leaving the transcription start site unprotected (34Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our experiment, the overall promoter occupancy with wild-type holoenzyme in closed complexes was 50–70% for the best protected positions in optimal experiments. As seen in Fig. 4, the footprints gave partial protection over the −12 and −24 elements (compare the two leftmost lanes in Fig. 4 A) and no protection further downstream. We used three of the strongest bands to analyze the quantitative extent of protection using phosphorimager technology. Fig. 4 A shows that position −1 is of equal intensity in the two leftmost lanes, without and with wild-type holoenzyme. This band is used to normalize the signal to ensure that binding by the 21 mutants is not improperly analyzed because of altered loading or extent of digestion. The degree of protection was judged by comparing the signals of mutants with wild type at the −21 and −10 band positions. That is, after normalizing the signal from each lane to equalize the −1 band intensity, the protection using bands at −21 or −10 was taken as the extent of binding in the closed complex. The data were not significantly different using the two bands, and the results using −10 are quantified in Fig. 4 B. In this display, wild type is taken as 1.0 so the extent of protection by each mutant can be compared directly to wild type. The most dramatic result is that each of four mutations in the rpoN box lead to by far the lowest extent of protection (R455A, R456A, Y461A, and R462A in Fig. 4 B). R455A and R456A have been shown elsewhere to bind core polymerase and form holoenzymes, so this is not the source of the defect in DNA binding (31Taylor M. Butler R. Chambers S. Casimiro M. Badii F. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These four mutants are the same ones that showed the greatest defect in transcription so the cause of this is very likely to be an inability to bind duplex DNA to form a closed complex. The fifth change in the rpoN box, K460A, is partially down in DNA binding, mimicking its partial loss of transcription under suboptimal conditions (compare Figs. 4 Band 3 B). Other mutations, scattered about the C-terminal region, show partial reductions in closed complex formation using this assay. These partially defective mutants range over a nearly 150-amino acid region. This is roughly the same collection of mutants that showed partial defects in transcription under suboptimal conditions. Moreover, approximately one-third of the mutants show little evidence of defects, being at or near the levels of wild-type holoenzyme in both this assay and the suboptimal transcription assay. It appears that both binding and transcription have similar amino acid requirements. Because protection within closed complexes is fairly weak, we sought to confirm these results using a band shift assay. At very high concentrations of holoenzyme most mutants bound DNA well (not shown), and so the concentration was lowered to 15 nm to reveal significant differences (Fig. 5). Two shifted bands could be seen, a lower one that was not very sensitive to protein concentration or to mutation and an upper one with an intensity that varied with the protein type and its concentration (Fig.5 A). The upper band was used in the quantitative analysis (see Fig. 5 B). For the most part, the result of the band shift analysis was consistent with that of the footprint analysis. There were only three exceptions; F355A, F402A, and R383A, which bound better in the band shift analysis than in the footprint analysis. These three mutants were partially defective in both assays, and the higher extent of binding seen in band shifts was better correlated with the extent of transcription under suboptimal conditions. To learn if the level of binding by R383A was specific, we compared it to a mock-purified protein preparation obtained from nontransformed cells (Fig. 5 A,host). No upper band was present in the mock control, indicating that the R383A signal likely comes from the cloned sigma 54. However, because of the low purity of this protein and the uncertainty that misfolding is the cause of its low induction, we cannot be certain of the cause of the lowering of its binding to DNA. These experiments were repeated at lower temperature (15 °C, not shown), but the results were not different. Four of five rpoN box mutants showed very little binding in both footprint and band shift assays. Several other mutants (K388A, K400A, F403A, R421A, and K460A), showed reduced binding in both assays. It appears that the rpoN box region is the most critical for DNA binding, but other residues throughout the C terminus make an important quantitative contribution to affinity. In many cases, the lowering of occupancy within closed complexes likely accounts for the lowering of activated transcription under suboptimal conditions. After init"
