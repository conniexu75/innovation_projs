https://openalex.org/W3119321472,"The United Kingdom's COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world's largest and was unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. We determined the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country's first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantified the size, spatiotemporal origins, and persistence of genetically distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown tended to be larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, whereas lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control."

It is increasingly appreciated that DTPs are important drivers of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We combined cellular barcoding and mathematical modeling in patient-derived colorectal cancer models to identify and characterize DTPs in response to chemotherapy. Barcode analysis revealed no loss of clonal complexity of tumors that entered the DTP state and recurred following treatment cessation. Our data fit a mathematical model where all cancer cells, and not a small subpopulation, possess an equipotent capacity to become DTPs. Mechanistically, we determined that DTPs display remarkable transcriptional and functional similarities to diapause, a reversible state of suspended embryonic development triggered by unfavorable environmental conditions. Our study provides insight into how cancer cells use a developmentally conserved mechanism to drive the DTP state, pointing to novel therapeutic opportunities to target DTPs."

As a torrent of new molecular-glue probes and medicines are fueling interest in this field, I explore the arc of this story. 2021 marks the 30th anniversary of the revelation that cyclosporin A and FK506 act in a way previously not seen—as “molecular glues” that induce neo-protein–protein associations. As a torrent of new molecular-glue probes and medicines are fueling interest in this field, I explore the arc of this story. Long before anyone knew that cyclosporin A (CsA; sandimmune) was a molecular glue, or that by 2018 it would be prescribed over 2 million times per year, a biologist working for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz picked up a soil sample while vacationing with his wife in Norway in 1971. It was routine for employees to take such collections as part of a screening program aimed at finding microorganisms harboring antifungal antibiotics, but it was the immunosuppressive activity of CsA that captured the attention of Sandoz. By 1979, CsA was being used in patients to prevent organ transplant rejections and was approved by the FDA in 1983. Meanwhile in 1983, the Japanese pharmaceutical company Fujisawa was busy developing a discovery program that actually was looking for immunosuppressants by screening for novel bioactive microbial products. This was how, in 1987, they discovered the storied FK506 (tacrolimus), a novel 23-membered macrolide that had similar activity to CsA but was more potent and appeared to provide better prognostic outcomes in organ-transplant patients (Schreiber and Crabtree, 1992Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. The mechanism of action of cyclosporin A and FK506.Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). What followed was a 4-year race to uncover the molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506’s activities in hopes of creating even better analogs, and it culminated in a new field of molecular glues. But how did we get to this point? And how have the past 30 years delivered on the promise of molecular glues? Molecular glues are the proverbial water coolers of biology. It was the mid-80s at Yale, and because I was waiting for Bill Prusoff, I bumped into Bob Handschumacher. Bob told me about CsA targeting cyclophilin for immunosuppression. From his work, we had learned that cyclophilin was a small (18 kD) and abundant protein with an odd enzymatic activity—it catalyzes the interconversion of cis- and trans-rotamers of proline residues in proteins. As it turned out, CsA inhibits this “peptidyl–prolyl isomerase” activity. But there was no obvious connection between cyclophilin and immunosuppression. Prolyl isomerization is facile, occurring on the time frame of milliseconds to seconds, so from a chemist’s perspective it was hard to imagine that catalyzing or inhibiting this process would have cellular significance. So, how could we connect the dots from this seemingly inconsequential function to the inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling by CsA? My curiosity was piqued. I wondered whether there might be other compounds with similar properties. It was my custom then to search for natural products in newly reported patent applications, which led to the recognition of FK506 in 1986 as an intriguing candidate. The pharmaceutical company Fujisawa, now named Astellas, had discovered FK506 by searching for natural products that could interfere with TCR signaling. Since my insight preceded the publication of the compound, I was hopeful that I might have a jump on what I imagined would quickly become a competitive field. But the unusual structure of the macrocyclic polyketide FK506 also jogged my memory. Sure enough, I hit the jackpot searching through my index cards—the pre-Internet method scientists used to keep track of the scientific literature. In 1980 in the Canadian Journal of Chemistry, scientists at Ayerst had reported on a different but structurally related macrocyclic polyketide named rapamycin, which had been discovered as an antifungal agent. I imagined it had been discarded, since no reports were obvious to me in the interim. Now I was even more excited—maybe rapamycin, like FK506, would also have CsA-like activity. The value system of organic chemists in the 1980s placed an emphasis on being the first to synthesize newly reported natural products, especially ones with complex and novel structural features. My discussions with Handschumacher left me determined to place greater emphasis on discovering targets and uncovering mechanisms of action of FK506 and rapamycin. But instead, I succumbed to my fear of not winning the traditional race and invested considerable lab time and resources on the eventually successful “total syntheses” of both FK506 and rapamycin. But a move from Yale to Harvard in 1988 catalyzed a return to my gut instincts, and efforts on target identification were underway within the first 2 weeks of arrival at Harvard. The targets of FK506 and rapamycin were quickly discovered using affinity chromatography. Although the first target, FKBP12, had subnanomolar interactions with both compounds, other targets showed differential binding—FKBP25 showing selective binding to rapamycin. Remarkably, each of these FKBPs, like cyclophilin earlier, displayed drug-sensitive peptidyl–prolyl isomerase activity. The pendulum tilted back ever so slightly in terms of the potential relevance of this activity—now, three immunosuppressive agents target proteins having this same, odd enzymatic activity. The cyclophilins and FKBPs were christened “immunophilins” as a hedge (Schreiber, 1991Schreiber S.L. Chemistry and biology of the immunophilins and their immunosuppressive ligands.Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Having been schooled in the mountain-climbing ethos of natural-product synthesis, the euphoria of discovering FKBPs was a striking contrast. It unleashed a flurry of determined activity to exploit the compounds as probes of the biology they modulate. This was reinforced when I spoke to immunology colleagues who described intracellular signal transduction as a “black box” and noted that their most powerful probes—antibodies to cell-surface receptors—fail to penetrate cellular membranes, which small molecules do reliably. My organic chemistry lab expanded into molecular and cell biology, accelerated through early collaborations with immunologists Barbara Bierer and Steven Burakoff. Together in 1990, we found the next surprise: structurally related FK506 and rapamycin disrupt two distinct pathways. FK506 disrupts TCR signaling, while rapamycin disrupts IL2-receptor signaling. To make this even more puzzling, the cyclophilin–CsA complex behaved analogously to the FK506 complex, even though it did not engage FKBP12. This strange result suggested a novel possibility: the FKBP12–FK506 and FKBP12–rapamycin complexes had distinct properties that targeted the two different pathways. If this were true, then simply binding FKBP12 would be insufficient to achieve these variable responses, but competitively binding FKBP12 should block the actions of these compounds. To test this hypothesis, the complex non-natural macrocycle 506BD (FKBP12-binding domain of FK506 and rapamycin) was designed and its multi-step synthesis was achieved. 506BD was able to eliminate potently the cellular activities of FK506 and rapamycin (but not CsA, which doesn’t bind FKBP12) (Bierer et al., 1990Bierer B.E. Somers P.K. Wandless T.J. Burakoff S.J. Schreiber S.L. Probing immunosuppressant action with a nonnatural immunophilin ligand.Science. 1990; 250: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Merging synthetic chemistry with cell biology pointed to a “gain-of-function” model (Schreiber, 1991Schreiber S.L. Chemistry and biology of the immunophilins and their immunosuppressive ligands.Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) (and put an end in my lab to synthesizing natural products for the sake of winning races). “Are these modular natural products functioning as molecular glues?” could now be overheard at my lab meetings. We thought FKBP12 might be serving as something akin to a command module with the immunosuppressants acting as the docking assembly, but we hadn’t found the lunar module yet. To find it, or them, then-postdoc Jun Liu extended our affinity-chromatography studies, this time using cyclophilin–CsA, FKBP12–FK506, and FKBP12–rapamycin as baits. Cyclophilin–CsA and FKBP12–FK506 (but not FKBP12–rapamycin, a mystery for a later day) bound the protein phosphatase calcineurin (Figure 1). CsA and FK506 are molecular glues! (Liu et al., 1991Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Calcineurin is a common target of cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes.Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3499) Google Scholar) The term made its way into publication the following year, drawing attention to the analogy of antigenic peptides selectively gluing specific MHC and TCR proteins as a means of mounting an immune response (Schreiber, 1992Schreiber S.L. Immunophilin-sensitive protein phosphatase action in cell signaling pathways.Cell. 1992; 70: 365-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This novel mechanism also led chemists like me initially to suffer “natural-product envy” due to a belief that the simultaneous emergence of these exquisite docking assemblies was beyond the realm of our ability to design and could only result from a billion years of natural selection. In spite of this belief, or maybe because of the challenge it posed to inquisitive chemists, this alluring mechanism was expanded far beyond the natural ones, as we will see below. Mike Hall and George Levi, whose groups showed in yeast that recessive mutations of FKBP12 conferred resistance to rapamycin, supplied reassuring support for the gain-of-function model and for the notion that rapamycin would join the small club of molecular glues. We just needed to identify the lunar module. Evidence of a novel candidate gene came from the identification, by both labs, of dominant drug-resistance alleles of genes named DRR (dominant rapamycin resistant) and TOR (target of rapamycin). After using CsA and FK506 to illuminate the calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway with Jerry Crabtree (Crabtree and Schreiber, 2009Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. SnapShot: Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT signaling.Cell. 2009; 138 (210.e1): 210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we returned in 1994 to unfinished business with rapamycin. David Sabatini in Sol Snyder’s lab and Eric Brown in my lab again used FKBP12–rapamycin-based affinity chromatography and purified and characterized the target of FKBP12–rapamycin as the then-unknown protein kinase mTOR, confirming that rapamycin, like CsA and FK506 before it, was also functioning as a molecular glue. David Sabatini has continued over the following 25 years to transform our knowledge of nutrient sensing via distinct mTOR complexes (mTORCs) through brilliant and illuminating experimentation (Sabatini, 2017Sabatini D.M. Twenty-five years of mTOR: Uncovering the link from nutrients to growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 11818-11825Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and structural investigations by Jon Clardy, Hengming Ke, and Nikola Pavletich revealed atomic-resolution insights into the mechanisms used by the three natural molecular glues to induce neo-associations (Figure 1). In the 1980s, intracellular signal transduction, protein phosphatases, and protein kinases were considered undruggable targets. The first two were revealed to be myths with the discovery that the existing drug, CsA, blocks intracellular signal transduction by inhibiting a protein phosphatase. 3 years later, the protein kinases would be lifted from the undruggable list with the approval of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus/rapamycin. More recently, proteins lacking small-molecule-binding pockets had been deemed undruggable. In 2020, our knowledge of nature’s use of FKBP12 as a command module and the polyketide biosynthetic pathway as a source of molecular glues was expanded with the discovery of the macrolide WDB002. FKBP12-WDB002 binds the virtually featureless, coiled-coil surface of the centromeric protein CEP250 (Figure 1), leaving us to wonder whether there is anything left to call undruggable. In the early 1990s, with this small but powerful set of molecular glues in our toolbox, we set out to answer questions about the role of proximity in processes such as signal transduction. The discovery of both protein scaffolds and small-molecule glues made clear the ubiquity of nature’s use of proximity to drive biology (Figure 2A). Our first inspiration came from Jerry Crabtree recognizing the concept of the immunological synapse “squeezing out everything but the TCR.” Inspired by this notion, we created the first synthetic “bifunctional” molecular glues targeting genetic fusions, which in principle enable the induction of proximity of any two proteins that can be genetically appended to FKBP12 or other small-molecule-binding modules. A “chemical inducer of proximity” (CIP) was advanced by a one-step olefin metathesis reaction marrying two FK506 molecules via a linking element in FK1012 (Figure 2Bi). From this innovation grew FK-CsA, which opened the door to using any combination of different genetic fusions. From simple molecular glues came more complex ones—bifunctional but bearing linkers (Figure 1) (Stanton et al., 2018Stanton B.Z. Chory E.J. Crabtree G.R. Chemically induced proximity in biology and medicine.Science. 2018; 359: eaao5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CIPs such as FK1012 showed that simply inducing the proximity of intracellular portions of signaling receptors such as the TCR and many others is sufficient to unleash a chain of events with cellular consequences (Figures 2Bi and 2Bii). Rimiducid (Bellicum Pharmaceuticals) was the first purposefully synthesized molecular glue to be tested in humans and was shown to eliminate graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant patients by inducing dimerization of its death-receptor fusion target, resulting in targeted cell ablation (Di Stasi et al., 2011Di Stasi A. Tey S.-K. Dotti G. Fujita Y. Kennedy-Nasser A. Martinez C. Straathof K. Liu E. Durett A.G. Grilley B. et al.Inducible apoptosis as a safety switch for adoptive cell therapy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Gene expression and repression, chromatin methylation and remodeling, organelle and membrane localization, and protein degradation can now be controlled remotely using molecular glues to induce proximal protein associations (Figures 2B–2D). In the latter case, the ingenious dTag system developed by Jay Bradner requires only a single gene fusion for targeted protein degradation of FKBP12-tagged proteins since the glue is able to recruit a native E3 ligase (Figure 2Ci.). But native proteins were next to fall prey to molecular glues coming from synthetic chemistry (Gerry and Schreiber, 2020Gerry C.J. Schreiber S.L. Unifying principles of bifunctional, proximity-inducing small molecules.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In 1996, graduate student Deb Hung and others discovered that a complex natural product, discodermolide, stabilizes the association of alpha and beta tubulin monomers in a manner similar to natural products such as taxol and epothilone (Figure 1). Rather than inducing neo-associations, these compounds function to stabilize the dynamic equilibrium of normally associating proteins with profound cellular consequences—here, to stabilize microtubules. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of these “molecular clamps” are related to compounds inducing neo-associations. It was the discovery in 2000 that a simple synthetic compound could also induce associations of native proteins that invigorated a new direction for this field (Figures 1 and 2Div). Up to this point, we had only come across molecular glues in the form of a rapidly growing list of natural-product glues or their derivatives. They had been linked together as CIPs, mixed and matched, but the building blocks were always bestowed by nature (Figure 2B). Small-molecule screens uncovered that an “off-the-shelf” synthetic compound we named synstab-A (for synthetic stabilizer) promoted microtubule formation in vitro and in cells analogously to discodermolide and taxol (Figures 1 and 2Div) (Haggarty et al., 2000Haggarty S.J. Mayer T.U. Miyamoto D.T. Fathi R. King R.W. Mitchison T.J. Schreiber S.L. Dissecting cellular processes using small molecules: identification of colchicine-like, taxol-like and other small molecules that perturb mitosis.Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, even simple, non-natural compounds could induce protein associations. During the years following this discovery, there has been an explosion in the discovery of molecular glues and clamps targeting native proteins. Notable examples include Jun Liu’s synthetic FKBP12-binding glues derived from a synthetic library of 506BD-like macrocyclic rapafucins that glue FKBP12 to a plethora of proteins. FKBP12–rapadocin has been identified as a lead for cancer therapeutics by targeting the adenosine transporter SLC29A1 (Figure 2Cii). It shouldn’t be a surprise that simple small molecules can act as molecular glues when you consider that post-translational modifications as small as a methyl group can induce protein–protein associations, just as a missense mutation installing a different amino acid may completely change the landscape of a protein surface and thus its interactome. Molecular glues are just a non-covalent extension of these natural modules; for example, a novel small-molecule “molecular prosthetic” was discovered that compensates for and complements a mutated tryptophan in MALT1 (Quancard et al., 2019Quancard J. Klein T. Fung S.-Y. Renatus M. Hughes N. Israël L. Priatel J.J. Kang S. Blank M.A. Viner R.I. et al.An allosteric MALT1 inhibitor is a molecular corrector rescuing function in an immunodeficient patient.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another catalytic step in this turn toward synthetic molecular glues resulted from mechanism-of-action (MoA) studies of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide (Figure 2Di) and an anticancer drug indisulam (Figure 1). These small-molecule glues induce neo-associations between distinct E3 ligase enzymes, their adaptors, and target proteins. Thalidomide and lenalidomide induce the ubiquitination of the transcription factor Ikaros via the CUL4-DDB1-RBX1-CRBN E3 ligase complex, whereas indisulam induces the ubiquitination of the splicing factor RBM39 via the CUL4-DDB1-DDA1-DCAF15 E3 ligase complex. In 2020, computational searches for molecular-glue degraders using “co-essentiality” added novel probes (Chamberlain and Cathers, 2019Chamberlain P.P. Cathers B.E. Cereblon modulators: Low molecular weight inducers of protein degradation.Drug Discov. Today. Technol. 2019; 31: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here again, the small-molecule drugs bind simultaneously two distinct proteins to induce a multimeric physical complex that generates a new degradation output (Deshaies, 2015Deshaies R.J. Protein degradation: Prime time for PROTACs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More generally, cellular pull-down experiments of protein targets with and without compounds show changes in their targets’ interactomes with surprisingly high frequency. Far from being the exclusive domain of natural selection, synthetic compounds often function as molecular glues (Figures 2C and 2D) (Gerry and Schreiber, 2020Gerry C.J. Schreiber S.L. Unifying principles of bifunctional, proximity-inducing small molecules.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Every year since Ray Deshaies’ 2015 statement that “the gold rush is on,” we have seen an approximate doubling in publications on molecular glues (Figure 1). Among many others, David Spiegel is modulating the immune system in novel ways; Tom Wandless is making wrecking balls; Kevan Shokat is rethinking medicinal chemistry; Michelle Arkin is exploiting novel command modules; Angela Koehler is targeting transcription factors, and Pei Zhou is targeting DNA polymerases by altering subunit compositions of protein complexes; Derek Taylor and Goutham Narla are redirecting substrates of serine/threonine phosphatases, and Jidong Zhu is correcting disease-causing mutations of tyrosine phosphatases by using intramolecular molecular glues; and many labs are inducing associations between enzymes and (neo)-substrates—E3 ligases (PROTACs) (Figure 2Dii), protein kinases (PHICS), and protein phosphatases (PhoRCs). Most notably, Bradner, Craig Crews, Ray Deshaies, and now many others are advancing PROTACs, bifunctional molecular glues with linkers between individual binding cassettes, into the clinic. Like the prior FK506-to-FK1012 conversion, from simple molecular glues (thalidomide) come more complex ones with programmable activities, albeit with elaborated linkers (PROTACs) (Figure 2F). (Gerry and Schreiber, 2020Gerry C.J. Schreiber S.L. Unifying principles of bifunctional, proximity-inducing small molecules.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Deshaies, 2015Deshaies R.J. Protein degradation: Prime time for PROTACs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) Imposing our will with small molecules to orchestrate proximity by remote control is a powerful capability. There is promise for medicines based on the concept of inducing protein associations, analogous to the dominant means of information transfer in biology in cytoplasmic signal transduction and nuclear chromatin signaling (Figure 2A). When small molecules bind proteins, they commonly change their interactomes. Assuming that proteins may have multiple binding partners in a crowded cell, small molecules have the power to change the landscape of a protein surface in ways that change the equilibrium and favor binding of a different protein. Consequences include increasing (stabilizers) or decreasing (degraders) lifetimes of their targets, changing their localizations (correctors), or activating signaling or gene expression by inducing proximity. The cooperative interactions of both protein and small-molecule elements enable drugging a wider range of targets. These features underlie the promise of molecular glues and point to a “discover a binder first, determine the consequence later” approach to precision medicine (Schreiber, 2019Schreiber S.L. A Chemical Biology View of Bioactive Small Molecules and a Binder-Based Approach to Connect Biology to Precision Medicines.Isr. J. Chem. 2019; 59: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We’ve learned that molecular glues are effective drugs (among others sandimmune, tacrolimus, sirolimus, thalidomide, lenalidomide, taxotere), show promise as agents to control activity of small-molecule-sensitive alleles in a form of gene therapy in humans with acute leukemia (Di Stasi et al., 2011Di Stasi A. Tey S.-K. Dotti G. Fujita Y. Kennedy-Nasser A. Martinez C. Straathof K. Liu E. Durett A.G. Grilley B. et al.Inducible apoptosis as a safety switch for adoptive cell therapy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and are among the most striking probes of cell circuitry, including that underlying senescence and aging. Novel approaches to degrading therapeutic targets using molecular-glue degraders and PROTACs are emerging in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the drug-discovery process is being reshaped to overcome what was previously labeled as undruggable through the actions of molecular glues. New genetic tools are leading synthetic biologists to imagine the rewiring of cell circuitry by, for example, genome editing. But molecular glues allow us to imagine a future where cellular circuitry can be rewired at the level of proteins. In addition to using molecular glues for inducing neo-protein interactions and modulating challenging drug targets, novel molecular clamps can stabilize otherwise dynamic protein associations. Chemical biology is providing the means to discover molecular glues that pull proteins out of complexes and guide them to others. This offers a new modality for perturbing and understanding cell circuitry and for translating the insights gained into completely new types of therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W3120295425,"Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing followed by imputation has been proposed as a cost-effective genotyping approach for disease and population genetics studies. However, its competitiveness against SNP arrays is undermined because current imputation methods are computationally expensive and unable to leverage large reference panels. Here, we describe a method, GLIMPSE, for phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing datasets from modern reference panels. We demonstrate its remarkable performance across different coverages and human populations. GLIMPSE achieves imputation of a genome for less than US$1 in computational cost, considerably outperforming other methods and improving imputation accuracy over the full allele frequency range. As a proof of concept, we show that 1× coverage enables effective gene expression association studies and outperforms dense SNP arrays in rare variant burden tests. Overall, this study illustrates the promising potential of low-coverage imputation and suggests a paradigm shift in the design of future genomic studies."

It has been proposed that the mouse host affects tumor evolution during PDX engraftment and propagation, affecting the accuracy of PDX modeling of human cancer. Here, we exhaustively analyze copy number alterations (CNAs) in 1,451 PDX and matched patient tumor (PT) samples from 509 PDX models. CNA inferences based on DNA sequencing and microarray data displayed substantially higher resolution and dynamic range than gene expression-based inferences, and they also showed strong CNA conservation from PTs through late-passage PDXs. CNA recurrence analysis of 130 colorectal and breast PT/PDX-early/PDX-late trios confirmed high-resolution CNA retention. We observed no significant enrichment of cancer-related genes in PDX-specific CNAs across models. Moreover, CNA differences between patient and PDX tumors were comparable to variations in multiregion samples within patients. Our study demonstrates the lack of systematic copy number evolution driven by the PDX mouse host."
https://openalex.org/W3118751020,"Little is known about the genetic architecture of traits affecting educational attainment other than cognitive ability. We used genomic structural equation modeling and prior genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of educational attainment (n = 1,131,881) and cognitive test performance (n = 257,841) to estimate SNP associations with educational attainment variation that is independent of cognitive ability. We identified 157 genome-wide-significant loci and a polygenic architecture accounting for 57% of genetic variance in educational attainment. Noncognitive genetics were enriched in the same brain tissues and cell types as cognitive performance, but showed different associations with gray-matter brain volumes. Noncognitive genetics were further distinguished by associations with personality traits, less risky behavior and increased risk for certain psychiatric disorders. For socioeconomic success and longevity, noncognitive and cognitive-performance genetics demonstrated associations of similar magnitude. By conducting a GWAS of a phenotype that was not directly measured, we offer a view of genetic architecture of noncognitive skills influencing educational success. Genomic structural equation modeling of genome-wide association data for educational attainment and cognitive test performance is used to estimate the genetic component of variation in educational attainment that is independent of cognitive ability. The study finds that noncognitive skills account for 57% of genetic variation in educational attainment."

Infants with craniosynostosis have skull dysmorphology, increased intracranial pressure, and complications such as neurocognitive impairment that compromise quality of life. Animal models recapitulating these phenotypes are lacking, hampering development of urgently needed innovative therapies. Here, we show that Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis have increased intracranial pressure and neurocognitive behavioral abnormalities, recapitulating features of human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Using a biodegradable material combined with MSCs, we successfully regenerated a functional cranial suture that corrects skull deformity, normalizes intracranial pressure, and rescues neurocognitive behavior deficits. The regenerated suture creates a niche into which endogenous MSCs migrated, sustaining calvarial bone homeostasis and repair. MSC-based cranial suture regeneration offers a paradigm shift in treatment to reverse skull and neurocognitive abnormalities in this devastating disease. Craniosynostosis results from premature fusion of the cranial suture(s), which contain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are crucial for calvarial expansion in coordination with brain growth. Infants with craniosynostosis have skull dysmorphology, increased intracranial pressure, and complications such as neurocognitive impairment that compromise quality of life. Animal models recapitulating these phenotypes are lacking, hampering development of urgently needed innovative therapies. Here, we show that Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis have increased intracranial pressure and neurocognitive behavioral abnormalities, recapitulating features of human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Using a biodegradable material combined with MSCs, we successfully regenerated a functional cranial suture that corrects skull deformity, normalizes intracranial pressure, and rescues neurocognitive behavior deficits. The regenerated suture creates a niche into which endogenous MSCs migrated, sustaining calvarial bone homeostasis and repair. MSC-based cranial suture regeneration offers a paradigm shift in treatment to reverse skull and neurocognitive abnormalities in this devastating disease. Craniosynostosis is a common disorder in which one or more calvarial sutures, the fibrous joints that separate the skull bones, fuse prematurely in infancy. This causes abnormal skull growth, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), delayed brain development, and often impaired cognitive functions (Morriss-Kay and Wilkie, 2005Morriss-Kay G.M. Wilkie A.O.

Calvarial suture patency is crucial for allowing the skull to compress during childbirth and accommodating its extensive postnatal growth in concert with the developing brain, which continues into adulthood. Currently, the only treatment for craniosynostosis is complex surgery to correct the skull deformity and prevent its sequelae (Wolfswinkel et al., 2017Wolfswinkel E.M. Howell L.K. Fahradyan A. Azadgoli B. McComb J.G. Urata M.M. Is Postoperative Intensive Care Unit Care Necessary following Cranial Vault Remodeling for Sagittal Synostosis?.Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2017; 140: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In many cases, the bones resynostose, necessitating re-operation. There is an immense need for better treatment of craniosynostosis and prevention of resynostosis. Individuals with craniosynostosis often exhibit neurocognitive dysfunctions and intellectual disabilities (Gripp et al., 2000Gripp K.W. Zackai E.H. Stolle C.A. Mutations in the human TWIST gene.Hum.

Large deletions including the TWIST1 locus have been associated with learning disabilities and neurocognitive impairment (Gripp et al., 2000Gripp K.W. Zackai E.H. Stolle C.A. Mutations in the human TWIST gene.Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zechi-Ceide et al., 2012Zechi-Ceide R.M. Rodrigues M.G. Jehee F.S. Kokitsu-Nakata N.M. Passos-Bueno M.R.

Wilkes D. Rutland P. Pulleyn L.J. Malcolm S. Dean J.C. Evans R.D. Jones B.M. Hayward R.

Although neurocognitive deficits are more commonly associated with syndromic craniosynostosis, some patients with nonsyndromic single-suture craniosynostosis may develop intellectual disability and developmental delays that vary in severity (Speltz et al., 2015Speltz M.L.

Attention and executive function in children with and without single-suture craniosynostosis.Child Neuropsychol. 2017; 23: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the heterogeneity of these deficits and provide evidence that craniosynostosis alone may cause neurocognitive dysfunction. Overall, premature suture fusion can adversely affect neurocognition, likely because of increased ICP and neuroanatomical changes (Morriss-Kay and Wilkie, 2005Morriss-Kay G.M. Wilkie A.O. Growth of the normal skull vault and its alteration in craniosynostosis: insights from human genetics and experimental studies.J. Anat. 2005; 207: 637-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, ICP and neurocognition have not been investigated in animal models of craniosynostosis, resulting in a gap in our understanding of this devastating disease. It therefore also remains unknown whether restoring suture patency can improve neurocognitive function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into an array of different cell types for tissue regeneration (Chan et al., 2018Chan C.K.F. Gulati G.S. Sinha R. Tompkins J.V. Lopez M.

Stem cells of the suture mesenchyme in craniofacial bone development, repair and regeneration.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Gli1+ cells are an indispensable MSC source within cranial sutures (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao H. Feng J. Ho T.V. Grimes W. Urata M. Chai Y. The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). They support craniofacial bone turnover, repair, and regeneration in adult mice (Guo et al., 2018Guo Y. Yuan Y. Wu L. Ho T.V. Jing J. Sugii H. Li J. Han X. Feng J. Guo C. Chai Y.

Importantly, we have demonstrated that there is premature loss of Gli1+ cells prior to coronal suture fusion in Twist1+/− mice (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao H. Feng J. Ho T.V. Grimes W. Urata M. Chai Y. The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that restoring MSCs is a potential therapeutic approach for cranial suture regeneration in craniosynostosis. However, this approach presents substantial technical challenges. Previous studies have shown that the method of MSC delivery and the biomaterial(s) used in the defect area are crucial (Zhao and Chai, 2015Zhao H. Chai Y. Stem Cells in Teeth and Craniofacial Bones.J. Dent. Res. 2015; 94: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is not well understood how MSCs may participate in the cranial suture regeneration process or what the ideal biomaterials are to support them. In this study, we show that premature fusion of the coronal suture led to increased ICP and neurocognitive abnormalities in Twist1+/− mice, recapitulating symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in humans. Using this clinically highly relevant mouse model, we demonstrated that Gli1+ MSCs combined with modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) can support coronal suture regeneration. Endogenous MSCs migrated to the regenerated suture area to sustain its function in calvarial tissue homeostasis and repair. Significantly, suture regeneration reduced ICP, partially alleviated calvarial deformity, and improved neurocognitive function. Because TWIST1 haploinsufficiency is associated with craniosynostosis in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, our discovery is highly relevant for clinical translation and offers a unique approach for improving the quality of life for individuals with craniosynostosis. To investigate whether craniosynostosis can lead to intracranial hypertension and neurocognitive behavioral abnormalities in Twist1+/− mice, as reported in humans (Millichap, 2015Millichap J.G. Cognitive Development of Children with Craniosynostosis.Pediatr. Neurol. Briefs. 2015; 29: 47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first measured the ICP in Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis (referred to as MUT) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls (Figure 1A) at 2 months of age. Twist1+/− mice had significantly increased ICP compared with the WT (Figures 1B and 1C). Then we conducted a battery of cognitive behavioral tests. Data from male and female mice were combined for the statistical analyses because no sex-biased preference was observed (Figures S1B–S1G). In open field and elevated plus maze tests, Twist1+/− mice spent comparable times in the center area of the open field arena (Figure S1I) and similar times and entries in the open arms of the elevated plus maze as their WT littermates (Figures S5E–S5G), which indicated that Twist1+/− mice did not have unusual levels of anxiety.Figure S1Analyses of Twist1 Expression and Cognitive and Motor Learning-Related Behavior in Adult Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full captionTwist1 is expressed in the cranial suture mesenchyme but is absent from the brain in adult mice.

In the novel object test (Figure 1F), the preference for a novel object was impaired significantly in Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis compared with WT controls (Figures 1G and 1H), suggesting a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficit. To assess social cognition, a three-chamber test was performed (Figure 1I). The preferences for investigating the mouse versus empty cage and novel versus familiar mouse were decreased significantly in Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis (Figures 1J and 1K), indicating impaired sociability and social novelty. To exclude the possibility that the impaired cognitive functions in Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis may be caused by olfactory dysfunction, we performed an odor discrimination/habituation test (Figure S5H) and found that Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis could distinguish among and habituate to nonsocial and social odors to the same degree as their WT littermates, which suggested that they had normal olfaction (Figure S5I). We examined motor learning ability using a rotarod test (Figure 1D). WT control mice exhibited an increased latency to falling off the accelerating rotarod (4–40 rpm in 5 min) over four consecutive days, indicating active learning (Figure 1E). In contrast, Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis did not exhibit obvious improvement, suggesting a significant motor learning deficit. We next measured motor functions and did not find an obvious difference in grip strength (Figure S5D) or total distance traveled in the open field arena (Figure S1H), which suggested normal motor strength of Twist1+/− mice with suture fusion. These results suggest that Twist1+/− mice have neurocognitive dysfunction. We suspected that these deficits were mediated by their elevated ICP because Twist1 expression is not detected in the brain in adult mice, so its haploinsufficiency is unlikely to have a direct effect on neurocognition (Figure S1A). To optimize formulation of a scaffold for Gli1+ cells to support regeneration of a new coronal suture in Twist1+/− mice with craniosynostosis, we compared several different biomaterials. We tested different formulations of GelMA modified with Matrigel and collagen I (COL-I). GelMA has excellent biocompatibility and is easy to use in a surgical setting because it conforms to defects and can be light-cured in seconds (Noshadi et al., 2017Noshadi I. Hong S. Sullivan K.E. Shirzaei Sani E. Portillo-Lara R. Tamayol A. Shin S.R. Gao A.E. Stoppel W.L. Black III, L.D. et al.In vitro and in vivo analysis of visible light crosslinkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels.Biomater. Sci. 2017; 5: 2093-2105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of Matrigel promotes the spread of cells in the scaffold, whereas COL-I helps form a suitable suture space, as shown below. Before settling on the final formulation, we tested some variations: (1) pure GelMA, (2) GelMA:Matrigel at a ratio of 5:1, (3) GelMA:Matrigel at 2:1, (4) GelMA:Matrigel at 1:1, (5) GelMA:Matrigel at 1:2, and (6) pure Matrigel. Pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) had a higher compressive modulus than the other materials (Figure S2A), which would better maintain the space between bones after surgery for suture regeneration. The tensile strength was also tested, and there was no significant difference between pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1), whereas the remaining four groups were too soft to be measured. After being soaked/rinsed for 3 weeks, the remaining mass of pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) remained higher than that of other groups (i.e., they had the lowest degradation rate), which would also help prevent suture refusion after surgery (Figure S2B). Diffusional permeability testing showed that pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) had the lowest diffusional ability, which may help to block intrusion of cytokines, such as angiogenesis factors that could promote bone formation and suture refusion (Figure S2C). Using pure Matrigel, which had the highest diffusional permeability, suture refusion occurred in as soon as 1 month (Figure S3J). The swelling ratio showed results similar to the diffusional permeability testing, which suggested that a solution like blood could more easily get into the pure Matrigel and promote bone formation, whereas there was no significant difference between the other five groups (Figure S2D). Taking all these properties into account, we concluded that pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel at a 5:1 ratio have the most favorable properties for suture regeneration. It is important to note that Matrigel, a mouse tumor matrix preparation, may be limited in its application for human use.Figure S3Schematic of Suture Regeneration, Related to Figure 2Show full captionGli1+ cells and M-GM are required for long-term suture patency.

We compared GelMA:Matrigel:COL-I at a ratio of 10:2:1 (M-GM) to pure GelMA (GM) and GelMA:Matrigel at a ratio of 5:1 (GM-Ma). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure S2F) and cellular viability staining (Figure S2G) showed that cells could spread more easily in GM-Ma and M-GM in three-dimensional culture. After six months, M-GM with MSCs formed a regenerated suture more similar to a natural one (Figures S2H–S2L), which suggested that COL-I could attract osteo-related cells in later stages to form a suitable space (Figures S2J and S2L). None of the crucial material properties were changed significantly by adding COL-I to GM-Ma (Figures S2M–S2P). Ultimately, these results suggest that M-GM provides a suitable environment for MSC-mediated suture regeneration. To investigate whether Gli1+ MSCs retained their stemness after 10 days of culture in vitro, a colony-forming assay was performed. Gli1+ MSCs formed colonies (Figure S2E) and could differentiate toward osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao H. Feng J. Ho T.V. Grimes W. Urata M. Chai Y. The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), confirming their stemness. To test whether Gli1+ MSCs combined with M-GM can support coronal suture regeneration in Twist1+/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion (Figures 2A and 2C ), we generated a rectangular defect 0.3–0.4 mm wide over each of the fused coronal sutures (Figures 2B and 2D). Gli1+ cells with M-GM (M-GM+stem cells (SCs) were implanted into the defect on the right side (Figures 2E and 2F). The defect on the opposite side was (1) left empty or filled with (2) pure M-GM, (3) suture mesenchymal cells from Gli1-CreERT2;ROSA26LoxP-STOP-LoxP-DTA GFP mice mixed with M-GM (M-GM+diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) cells), (4) heat-inactivated Gli1+ cells (H-SCs) mixed with M-GM (M-GM+H-SCs), or (5) Gli1+ cells mixed with Matrigel (Ma+SCs). One month after surgery, there was already new bone formation in the blank controls (Figures 2G and 2G1), whereas spaces were found between the two bones filled with M-GM alone or with M-GM+SCs (Figures 2H, 2H1, and 2H2). The bone matured in the blank controls 3 months post-surgery (Figures 2I and 2I1), and the lateral bony edges of defects began to meet in the M-GM group (Figures 2J and 2J1). In contrast, the bone edges remained separated in the M-GM+SC group (Figures 2J and 2J2). Six months post-surgery, when the defect was left empty or filled only with M-GM, the suture sites had re-fused (Figures 2K1 and 2L1). At the same time point, the bones were still separated in defects filled with M-GM+SCs (Figures 2K and 2L). Even after 1 year, this regenerated suture remained patent (Figure S3G). All of the other groups experienced resynostosis, including those filled with M-GM+DTA cells (Figure S3H), heat-inactivated M-GM+H-SCs (Figure S3I), and Ma+SCs (Figure S3J), clearly indicating the crucial roles played by live Gli1+ MSCs and M-GM in s"

We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The epidemic control measures taken by the Chinese government, especially the city closure measures, reduced the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3120036594,"Perineural invasion (PNI), a pathologic feature defined as cancer cell invasion in, around, and through nerves, is an indicator of poor prognosis and survival in prostate cancer (PC). Despite widespread recognition of the clinical significance of PNI, the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a clinically and functionally important mediator of PNI in PC. MAOA promotes PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor innervation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Mechanistically, MAOA activates SEMA3C in a Twist1-dependent transcriptional manner, which in turn stimulates cMET to facilitate PNI via autocrine or paracrine interaction with coactivated PlexinA2 and NRP1. Furthermore, MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively reduces PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor-infiltrating nerve fiber density along with suppressed xenograft tumor growth and progression in mice. Collectively, these findings characterize the contribution of MAOA to the pathogenesis of PNI and provide a rationale for using MAOA inhibitors as a targeted treatment for PNI in PC."
https://openalex.org/W3118832386,"Background The COVID-19 virus impacts human health and the world economy, causing in Peru, more than 800 thousand infected and a strong recession expressed in a drop of -12% in its economic growth rate for 2020. In this context, the objective of the study is to analyze the dynamics of the short-term behavior of economic activity, as well as to explain the causal relationships in a Pandemic context based on the basic number of spread (R e ) of COVID-19 per day. Methods An Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) model was used. Results A negative and statistically significant impact of the COVID-19 shock was found on the level of economic activity and a long-term Cointegration relationship with an error correction model (CEM), with the expected sign and statistically significant at 1%. Conclusion The Pandemic has behaved as a systemic shock of supply and aggregate demand at the macroeconomic level, which together have an impact on the recession or level of economic activity. The authors propose changing public health policy from an indiscriminate suppression strategy to a targeted, effective and intelligent mitigation strategy that minimizes the risk of human life costs and socioeconomic costs, in a context of uncertainty about the end of the Pandemic and complemented by economic, fiscal and monetary policies that mitigate the economic recession, considering the underlying structural characteristics of the Peruvian economy."
https://openalex.org/W3119331783,"Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit attrition of their self-renewal capacity when cultured ex vivo, a process that is partially reversed upon treatment with epigenetic modifiers, most notably inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) or lysine-specific demethylase LSD1. A recent study showed that the human HSC self-renewal agonist UM171 modulates the CoREST complex, leading to LSD1 degradation, whose inhibition mimics the activity of UM171. The mechanism underlying the UM171-mediated loss of CoREST function remains undetermined. We now report that UM171 potentiates the activity of a CULLIN3-E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex whose target specificity is dictated by the poorly characterized Kelch/BTB domain protein KBTBD4. CRL3KBTBD4 targets components of the LSD1/RCOR1 corepressor complex for proteasomal degradation, hence re-establishing H3K4me2 and H3K27ac epigenetic marks, which are rapidly decreased upon ex vivo culture of human HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3118420218,"Hardwired circuits encoding innate responses have emerged as an essential feature of the mammalian brain. Sweet and bitter evoke opposing predetermined behaviors. Sweet drives appetitive responses and consumption of energy-rich food sources, whereas bitter prevents ingestion of toxic chemicals. Here we identified and characterized the neurons in the brainstem that transmit sweet and bitter signals from the tongue to the cortex. Next we examined how the brain modulates this hardwired circuit to control taste behaviors. We dissect the basis for bitter-evoked suppression of sweet taste and show that the taste cortex and amygdala exert strong positive and negative feedback onto incoming bitter and sweet signals in the brainstem. Finally we demonstrate that blocking the feedback markedly alters responses to ethologically relevant taste stimuli. These results illustrate how hardwired circuits can be finely regulated by top-down control and reveal the neural basis of an indispensable behavioral response for all animals."
https://openalex.org/W3118597376,"Introduction It is expected that in unforeseen situations, nurses will provide appropriate medical interventions, using their expertise and skills to reduce the risks associated with the consequences of disasters. Consequently, it is crucial that they are properly prepared to respond to such difficult circumstances. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the basic competences of nurses in disasters. Materials and methods The survey was directed to 468 nurses from all medical centres in Lublin. IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 was used for statistical analyses, frequency analysis, basic descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. The classical statistical significance level was adopted as α = 0.05. Results Based on the logistic regression analysis, it was found that work experience, workplace preparedness, as well as training and experience in disaster response are important predictors of preparedness. Conclusions These findings indicate that the nurses' core competencies for these incidents can be improved through education and training programmes which increase their preparedness for disasters. Nurses are among the most important groups of healthcare professionals facing a disaster and should be involved in all phases of disaster management, such as risk assessment and pre-disaster planning, response during crisis situations and risks’ mitigation throughout the reconstruction period."
https://openalex.org/W3118514931,"Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is a recent metaheuristics algorithm that mimics the behavior of butterflies in mating and foraging. In this paper, three improved versions of BOA have been developed to prevent the original algorithm from getting trapped in local optima and have a good balance between exploration and exploitation abilities. In the first version, Opposition-Based Strategy has been embedded in BOA while in the second Chaotic Local Search has been embedded. Both strategies: Opposition-based &amp; Chaotic Local Search have been integrated to get the most optimal/near-optimal results. The proposed versions are compared against original Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Moth-flame Optimization (MFO), Particle warm Optimization (PSO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) using CEC 2014 benchmark functions and 4 different real-world engineering problems namely: welded beam engineering design, tension/compression spring, pressure vessel design, and Speed reducer design problem. Furthermore, the proposed approches have been applied to feature selection problem using 5 UCI datasets. The results show the superiority of the third version (CLSOBBOA) in achieving the best results in terms of speed and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3119114335,"Epilepsy is a common brain disorder, repeated seizures of epilepsy may lead to a series of brain pathological changes such as neuronal or glial damage. However, whether circular RNAs are involved in neuronal injury during epilepsy is not fully understood. Here, we screened circIgf1r in the status epilepticus model through circRNA sequencing, and found that it was upregulated after the status epilepticus model through QPCR analysis. Astrocytes polarizing toward neurotoxic A1 phenotype and neurons loss were observed after status epilepticus. Through injecting circIgf1r siRNA into the lateral ventricle, it was found that knocking down circIgf1r in vivo would induce the polarization of astrocytes to phenotype A2 and reduce neuronal loss. The results in vitro further confirmed that inhibiting the expression of circIgf1r in astrocytes could protect neurons by converting reactive astrocytes from A1 to the protective A2. In addition, knocking down circIgf1r in astrocytes could functionally promote astrocyte autophagy and relieve the destruction of 4-AP-induced autophagy flux. In terms of mechanism, circIgf1r promoted the polarization of astrocytes to phenotype A1 by inhibiting autophagy. Taken together, our results reveal circIgf1r may serve as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of neuron damage after epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W3120595226,"Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has infected more than ten million persons worldwide. Therefore, researchers are trying to address various aspects that may help in diagnosis this pneumonia. Image segmentation is a necessary pr-processing step that implemented in image analysis and classification applications. Therefore, in this study, our goal is to present an efficient image segmentation method for COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed image segmentation method depends on improving the density peaks clustering (DPC) using generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The DPC is faster than other clustering methods, and it provides more stable results. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of clustering centers automatically without visualization. So, GEV is used to determine the suitable threshold value to find the optimal number of clustering centers that lead to improving the segmentation process. The proposed model is applied for a set of twelve COVID-19 CT images. Also, it was compared with traditional k-means and DPC algorithms, and it has better performance using several measures, such as PSNR, SSIM, and Entropy."
https://openalex.org/W3119569909,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Altered glycosylation contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance in many cancers. C1GALT1 is the key enzyme controlling the elongation of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation. Here we showed that C1GALT1 was overexpressed in 85% (107/126) of PDAC tumors compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. High expression of C1GALT1 was associated with poor disease-free and overall survival (n = 99). C1GALT1 knockdown using siRNA suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion as well as increased gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC cells. In contrast, C1GALT1 overexpression enhanced cell migration and invasion. In subcutaneous and pancreatic orthotopic injection models, C1GALT1 knockdown decreased tumor growth and metastasis of PDAC cells in NOD/SCID mice. Mechanistically, C1GALT1 knockdown dramatically suppressed cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation of FAK at Y397/Y925 and changes in O-glycans on integrins including the β1, αv, and α5 subunits. Using functional blocking antibodies, we identified integrin αv as a critical factor in C1GALT1-mediated invasiveness of PDAC cells. In conclusion, this study not only reveals that C1GALT1 could be a potential therapeutic target for PDAC but also provides novel insights into the role of O-glycosylation in the α subunits of integrins."
https://openalex.org/W3119654727,"Preterm birth occurs at excessively high and disparate rates in the United States. In 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program to investigate the influence of early life exposures on child health. Extant data from the ECHO cohorts provides the opportunity to examine racial and geographic variation in effects of individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status (SES) on gestational age at birth. The objective of this study was to examine the association between individual-level (maternal education) and neighborhood-level markers of SES and gestational age at birth, stratifying by maternal race/ethnicity, and whether any such associations are modified by US geographic region. Twenty-six ECHO cohorts representing 25,526 mother-infant pairs contributed to this disseminated meta-analysis that investigated the effect of maternal prenatal level of education (high school diploma, GED, or less; some college, associate's degree, vocational or technical training [reference category]; bachelor's degree, graduate school, or professional degree) and neighborhood-level markers of SES (census tract [CT] urbanicity, percentage of black population in CT, percentage of population below the federal poverty level in CT) on gestational age at birth (categorized as preterm, early term, full term [the reference category], late, and post term) according to maternal race/ethnicity and US region. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cohort-specific results were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. For women overall, a bachelor's degree or above, compared with some college, was associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth (aOR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61-0.86), whereas a high school education or less was associated with an increased odds of early term birth (aOR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00-1.21). When stratifying by maternal race/ethnicity, there were no significant associations between maternal education and gestational age at birth among women of racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic white. Among non-Hispanic white women, a bachelor's degree or above was likewise associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth (aOR 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.94) as well as a decreased odds of early term birth (aOR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.95). The association between maternal education and gestational age at birth varied according to US region, with higher levels of maternal education associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth in the Midwest and South but not in the Northeast and West. Non-Hispanic white women residing in rural compared to urban CTs had an increased odds of preterm birth; the ability to detect associations between neighborhood-level measures of SES and gestational age for other race/ethnic groups was limited due to small sample sizes within select strata. Interventions that promote higher educational attainment among women of reproductive age could contribute to a reduction in preterm birth, particularly in the US South and Midwest. Further individual-level analyses engaging a diverse set of cohorts are needed to disentangle the complex interrelationships among maternal education, neighborhood-level factors, exposures across the life course, and gestational age at birth outcomes by maternal race/ethnicity and US geography."
https://openalex.org/W3119953954,"Myeloma cells produce excessive levels of dickkopf-1 (DKK1), which mediates the inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, leading to multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying DKK1 overexpression in myeloma remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide evidence that hypoxia promotes DKK1 expression in myeloma cells. Under hypoxic conditions, p38 kinase phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and drove its nuclear import to activate DKK1 transcription. In addition, high levels of DKK1 were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions in patients with t(4;14) MM, overexpressing the histone methyltransferase MMSET, which was identified as a downstream target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Furthermore, we found that CREB could recruit MMSET, leading to the stabilization of HIF-1α protein and the increased dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 on the DKK1 promoter. Knockdown of CREB in myeloma cells alleviated the suppression of osteoblastogenesis by myeloma-secreted DKK1 in vitro. Combined treatment with a CREB inhibitor and the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 (evofosfamide) significantly reduced MM-induced bone destruction in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal that hypoxia and a cytogenetic abnormality regulate DKK1 expression in myeloma cells, and provide an additional rationale for the development of therapeutic strategies that interrupt DKK1 to cure MM."
https://openalex.org/W3120680427,"Drug repurposing for COVID-19 has several potential benefits including shorter development time, reduced costs and regulatory support for faster time to market for treatment that can alleviate the current pandemic. The current study used molecular docking, molecular dynamics and protein-protein interaction simulations to predict drugs from the Drug Bank that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacting surface on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The study predicted a number of peptide-based drugs, including Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P and BV2, that might bind sufficiently to the hACE2 receptor to modulate the protein-protein interaction required for infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such drugs could be validated in vitro or in vivo as potential inhibitors of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in the airway. Exploration of the proposed and current pharmacological indications of the peptide drugs predicted as potential inhibitors of the interaction between the spike protein and hACE2 receptor revealed that some of the predicted peptide drugs have been investigated for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), viral infection, inflammation and angioedema, and to stimulate the immune system, and potentiate antiviral agents against influenza virus. Furthermore, these predicted drug hits may be used as a basis to design new peptide or peptidomimetic drugs with better affinity and specificity for the hACE2 receptor that may prevent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 that is prerequisite to the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus."

Psychological hardiness is proposed as a buffer for workplace bullying and psychological stress on workplace accidents and injuries. This study adopted the Affective Events Theory and Conservation of Resources Theory to develop and test a moderated mediated model in two field studies. Study 1 (N = 286, Australian nurses) found support for the direct negative effect of workplace bullying on workplace accidents and injuries with psychological stress acting as the mediator. The mediation findings from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2 (N = 201, New Zealand nurses). In addition, Study 2 supplemented Study 1 by providing empirical support for using psychological hardiness as the buffer for the association between psychological stress and workplace accidents and injuries. This study offers theoretical and empirical insights into the research and practice on psychological hardiness for improving the psychological well-being of employees who faced workplace mistreatments."
https://openalex.org/W3119569803,"TAS4464, a potent, selective small molecule NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, leads to inactivation of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and consequent accumulations of its substrate proteins. Here, we investigated the antitumor properties and action mechanism of TAS4464 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TAS4464 induced apoptotic cell death in various AML cell lines. TAS4464 treatments resulted in the activation of both the caspase-9-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-8-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in AML cells; combined treatment with inhibitors of these caspases markedly diminished TAS4464-induced apoptosis. In each apoptotic pathway, TAS4464 induced the mRNA transcription of the intrinsic proapoptotic factor NOXA and decreased that of the extrinsic antiapoptotic factor c-FLIP. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the signaling pathway of the CRL substrate c-Myc was enriched after TAS4464 treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that TAS4464-induced c-Myc bound to the PMAIP1 (encoding NOXA) and CFLAR (encoding c-FLIP) promoter regions, and siRNA-mediated c-Myc knockdown neutralized both TAS4464-mediated NOXA induction and c-FLIP downregulation. TAS4464 activated both caspase-8 and caspase-9 along with an increase in NOXA and a decrease in c-FLIP, resulting in complete tumor remission in a human AML xenograft model. These findings suggest that NAE inhibition leads to anti-AML activity via a novel c-Myc-dependent apoptosis induction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3119824243,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer and exhibits dismal prognosis due to chemoresistance. Moreover, only few effective therapeutic options exist for patients with recurrent OCCC, and an understanding of its molecular characteristics is essential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In the present study, we investigated unique MicroRNAs (miRNA) profiles in recurrent/metastatic OCCC and the role of miRNAs in cisplatin resistance. Comprehensive miRNA sequencing revealed that expression of several miRNAs, including miR-508-3p, miR-509-3p, miR-509-3-5p, and miR-514a-3p was remarkably less in recurrent cancer tissues when compared with that in paired primary cancer tissues. These miRNAs are located in the chrXq27.3 region on the genome. Moreover, its expression was negative in omental metastases in two patients with advanced OCCC. In vitro analyses revealed that overexpression of miR-509-3p and miR-509-3-5p reversed cisplatin resistance and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) was partially responsible for the resistance. Immunohistochemistry revealed that YAP1 expression was inversely correlated with the chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster expression. In conclusion, these findings suggest that alteration of the chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster could play a critical role in chemoresistance and miRNAs in the cluster and their target genes can be potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3118598211,"Distant metastasis is the leading cause of treatment failure in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (LZTS2) is downregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LZTS2 associates with p85 to inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and impairs HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identify LZTS2 as a bona fide substrate of the E3 ligase β-Trcp and protein kinase CK1δ, which are responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of LZTS2. Importantly, we show that the β-Trcp and CK1δ-mediated degradation of LZTS2 promotes HCC progression and metastasis by activating PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, our study not only illustrates the roles of LZTS2 in regulating HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis but also reveals a novel posttranslational modification of LZTS2 by β-Trcp and CK1δ, indicating that the β-Trcp/CK1δ/LZTS2/PI3K axis may be a novel oncogenic driver involved in HCC progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3118817300,"Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone in humans, plays a pivotal role in the control of water and salt reabsorption via activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Alterations in MR signaling pathway lead to renal dysfunction, including chronic kidney disease and renal fibrosis, that can be prevented or treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). Here, we used RNA-Sequencing to analyze effects of two MRAs, spironolactone and finerenone, on the aldosterone-induced transcriptome of a human renal cell line stably expressing the MR. Bioinformatics analysis of the data set reveals the identity of hundreds of genes induced or repressed by aldosterone. Their regulation is modulated in a time-dependent manner and, for the induced genes, depends on the aldosterone-driven direct binding of the MR onto its genomic targets that we have previously characterized. Although both MRAs block aldosterone-induced as well as aldosterone-repressed genes qualitatively similarly, finerenone has a quantitatively more efficient antagonism on some aldosterone-induced genes. Our data provide the first complete transcriptome for aldosterone on a human renal cell line and identifies pro-inflammatory markers (IL6, IL11, CCL7, and CXCL8) as aldosterone-repressed genes."

Using harmonized data (N = 5,063) from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly (PINE) and the Study of Older Korean Americans (SOKA), we tested direct and indirect effect models. In both groups, chronic diseases and functional disability were closely associated with negative ratings of health and symptoms of depression. Analyses with the PROCESS macro showed that the effect of chronic diseases and functional disability on depressive symptoms was mediated by self-rated health in both groups; the indirect effect was greater in the Korean American sample than in the Chinese American sample. These findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological mechanisms that underlie the mind-body connection and highlight the potential importance of subjective health assessment as a useful tool for health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3119019157,"Honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) queens have a remarkable organ, the spermatheca, which successfully stores sperm for years after a virgin queen mates. This study uniquely characterized and quantified the transcriptomes of the spermathecae from mated and virgin honey bee queens via RNA sequencing to identify differences in mRNA levels based on a queen’s mating status. The transcriptome of drone semen was analyzed for comparison. Samples from three individual bees were independently analyzed for mated queen spermathecae and virgin queen spermathecae, and three pools of semen from ten drones each were collected from three separate colonies. In total, the expression of 11,233 genes was identified in mated queen spermathecae, 10,521 in virgin queen spermathecae, and 10,407 in drone semen. Using a cutoff log 2 fold-change value of 2.0, we identified 212 differentially expressed genes between mated and virgin spermathecal queen tissues: 129 (1.4% of total) were up-regulated and 83 (0.9% of total) were down-regulated in mated queen spermathecae. Three genes in mated queen spermathecae, three genes in virgin queen spermathecae and four genes in drone semen that were more highly expressed in those tissues from the RNA sequencing data were further validated by real time quantitative PCR. Among others, expression of Kielin/chordin-like and Trehalase mRNAs was highest in the spermathecae of mated queens compared to virgin queen spermathecae and drone semen. Expression of the mRNA encoding Alpha glucosidase 2 was higher in the spermathecae of virgin queens. Finally, expression of Facilitated trehalose transporter 1 mRNA was greatest in drone semen. This is the first characterization of gene expression in the spermathecae of honey bee queens revealing the alterations in mRNA levels within them after mating. Future studies will extend to other reproductive tissues with the purpose of relating levels of specific mRNAs to the functional competence of honey bee queens and the colonies they head."

Repetitive DNA sequences play an important role in genome structuring and evolution, so understanding the chromosomal organization and distribution of these sequences in Avena species could provide valuable information concerning genome evolution in this genus. In this study, the chromosomal organizations and distributions of six repetitive DNA sequences (including three SSR motifs (TTC, AAC, CAG), one 5S rRNA gene fragment, and two oat A and C genome specific repeats) were investigated using non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) in the three tetraploid species mentioned above and in two hexaploid oat species. Preferential distribution of the SSRs in centromeric regions was seen in the A and D genomes, whereas few signals were detected in the C genomes. Some intergenomic translocations were observed in the tetraploids; such translocations were also detected between the C and D genomes in the hexaploids. These results provide robust evidence for the presence of the D genome in all three tetraploids, strongly suggesting that the genomic constitution of these species is DC and not AC, as had been thought previously."

In this study, phage UPM2146 was isolated from a polluted lake which can lyse its host K . pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146. Observation from TEM shows that UPM2146 belongs to Caudoviriales (Order) based on morphological appearance. Whole genome analysis of UPM2146 showed that its genome comprises 160,795 bp encoding for 214 putative open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the phage belongs to Ackermannviridae (Family) under the Caudoviriales . UPM2146 produces clear plaques with high titers of 10 10 PFU/ml. The phage has an adsorption period of 4 min, latent period of 20 min, rise period of 5 min, and releases approximately 20 PFU/ bacteria at Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 0.001. UPM2146 has a narrow host-range and can lyse 5 out of 22 K . pneumoniae isolates (22.72%) based on spot test and efficiency of plating (EOP). The zebrafish larvae model was used to test the efficacy of UPM2146 in lysing its host. Based on colony forming unit counts, UPM2146 was able to completely lyse its host at 10 hours onwards.

https://openalex.org/W3118887224,"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence is highlighted in management of patients living with human immunodeficiency virus. In South Korea, ART medication research has rarely been conducted due to the low economic burden associated with government-funded treatment. This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the pill burden impact between ART regimen compliance and HIV-RNA viral load suppression. Data were collected from 2008 to 2016 at a general hospital in South Korea. A total of 210 HIV/AIDS treatment-naïve patients were grouped as follows: single-tablet regimen (STR, one tablet/day), mild pill burden (two-four tablets/day), and heavy pill burden (≥ five tablets/day). Patients were analyzed according to gender, age at index date, medical insurance type, comorbidities, depression, HIV/AIDS disease burden as indicated by HIV-RNA viral load and CD4, and laboratory variables. In a multivariate logistic regression model, the STR group demonstrated adherence 5.10 times more often than the heavy pill burden group. Females and patients with an initial viral load of 500,000 or more were 0.090- and 0.040-fold less adherent to the ART regimen. Among these patients, 95% or more of the MPR group were 7.38 times more likely to have a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of viral load suppression. The highest initial viral load group was 0.090-fold less likely to have an LLOD than the reference group. These results suggest that a single-tablet regimen could improve medication adherence and the clinical virologic outcome. Therefore, general population research on ART adherence and polypharmacy is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3119126414,"Machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly widespread and are now present in most areas of research. Their recent surge can be explained in part due to our ability to generate and store enormous amounts of data with which to train these models. The requirement for large training sets is also responsible for limiting further potential applications of machine learning, particularly in fields where data tend to be scarce such as developmental biology. However, recent research seems to indicate that machine learning and Big Data can sometimes be decoupled to train models with modest amounts of data. In this work we set out to train a CNN-based classifier to stage zebrafish tail buds at four different stages of development using small information-rich data sets. Our results show that two and three dimensional convolutional neural networks can be trained to stage developing zebrafish tail buds based on both morphological and gene expression confocal microscopy images, achieving in each case up to 100% test accuracy scores. Importantly, we show that high accuracy can be achieved with data set sizes of under 100 images, much smaller than the typical training set size for a convolutional neural net. Furthermore, our classifier shows that it is possible to stage isolated embryonic structures without the need to refer to classic developmental landmarks in the whole embryo, which will be particularly useful to stage 3D culture in vitro systems such as organoids. We hope that this work will provide a proof of principle that will help dispel the myth that large data set sizes are always required to train CNNs, and encourage researchers in fields where data are scarce to also apply ML approaches."

Methods Systemically healthy controls (C group, n = 62), T2DM patients not taking statins (D group, n = 57) and T2DM patients taking statins (S group, n = 24) were recruited. In each group, subjects (40–85 years) were subclassified into the h (periodontal health)group, the g (gingivitis)group or the p (periodontitis) group according to different periodontal conditions. 17 cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva samples of each subject were measured utilizing the Luminex technology kit. Further, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin), FPG (fasting plasma glucose), PD (probing depth), CAL (clinical attachment level), BOP (bleeding on probing), GI (gingival index) and PI (periodontal index) were recorded. Data distribution was tested through the Shapiro-Wilk test, upon which the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied followed by Mann-Whitney U test and Bonferroni’s correction. Results Levels of IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 in the saliva of the Dh group were significantly lower than those in the Ch group, while factor IL-4 was higher (p&lt;0.05). Levels of MIP-3α, IL-7 and IL-2 in GCF of the Dh group were considerably higher than those in the Ch group (p&lt;0.05), while that of IL-23 was considerably lower. Compared with the Cg group, levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 were significantly lower in the saliva of the Dg group (p&lt;0.05). Lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-5 and IL-10 were detected in the Sg group than those in the Cg group (p&lt;0.05). At the same time, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21 and MIP-3α in the gingival crevicular fluid of the Sg group were lower in comparison with the Dg group. In addition, lower levels of IL-4 and higher levels of IL-7 in GCF were identified in the Dg group than those in the Cg group, while in the Sg group, lower levels of IL-4, MIP-1αand MIP-3αwere observed than those in the Cg group (p&lt;0.05). Lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and I-TAC were found in the Sp group compared with those in the Cp group. The IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were lower in the Dp group than those in the Cp group (p&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, in the Sp group, lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-21 and TNF-α, in addition to higher levels of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-5 in gingival crevicular fluid, were identified than those in the Dp group. Higher levels of IFN-γ,IL-1β,IL-2,IL-7,IL-21 and TNF-α and a lower level of IL-5 in the Dp group were identified than those in the Cp group (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, statins were able to substantially reduce PD in T2DM patients with periodontitis, indicating an obvious influence on the levels of cytokines secreted by Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells, as revealed by PCA (principal component analysis). Conclusion Statins are associated with reduced PD and cytokines levels in the GCF and saliva of T2DM patients with periodontitis."

The most important cause of maternal mortality is post-partum haemorrhage (PPH). Oxytocin injections and misoprostol tablets are medicines of first choice for the management of PPH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, both substances are chemically unstable, and previous studies have revealed serious quality problems of these medicines in LMICs. The present study is the first report on their quality in Rwanda. From 40 randomly selected health facilities (hospitals, health centers, retail pharmacies and private clinics) in different parts of Rwanda, as well as from six wholesalers and government stores, oxytocin injections and misoprostol tablets were collected. Oxytocin storage temperatures in the health facilities were monitored for six months using temperature data loggers, and found to correctly follow the storage requirements stated by the manufacturers (2–8°C, or room temperature) with few minor deviations. Oxytocin injections (57 samples, representing seven batches of four brands) were tested for their oxytocin content and pH value according to the United States Pharmacopeia. Twenty-four samples from three European manufacturers passed all tests. However, all nine samples of one batch of a Chinese manufacturer showed an excessive content of oxytocin (range 117.2–121.5% of the declared amount). Another batch of the same manufacturer showed extreme variations of the concentration of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Misoprostol tablets (25 samples, representing ten batches of six brands) were tested for content and dissolution according to the International Pharmacopoeia. Fifteen samples passed, but all 10 samples of two brands from India failed with extreme deviations, containing only 42.5–48.7% of the stated amount of misoprostol. In conclusion, oxytocin quality in Rwanda was better than reported from other African countries. However, two extremely substandard brands of misoprostol tablets were found. The Rwandan authorities reacted quickly and efficiently, and recalled these substandard medicines from the market. For oxytocin and misoprostol, with their well-known problems of quality and stability, procurement should possibly be restricted to medicines which are WHO-prequalified or which have been manufactured in countries with stringent regulatory authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3120437303,"Multidrug resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is an efflux transporter known to transport several xenobiotics and endogenous molecules. We recently identified that the lack of Mrp4 increases adipose tissue and body weights in mice. However, the role of Mrp4 in adipose tissue physiology are unknown. The current study aimed at characterizing these specific roles of Mrp4 using wild-type (WT) and knockout (Mrp4-/- ) mice. Our studies determined that Mrp4 is expressed in mouse adipose tissue and that the lack of Mrp4 expression is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, the lack of Mrp4 increased blood glucose and leptin levels, and impaired glucose tolerance. Additionally, in 3T3-L1 cells and human pre-adipocytes, pharmacological inhibition of Mrp4 increased adipogenesis and altered expression of adipogenic genes. Lack of Mrp4 activity in both of our in vivo and in vitro models leads to increased activation of adipose tissue cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) and decreased plasma prostaglandin E (PGE) metabolite levels. These changes in Creb activation, coupled with decreased PGE levels, together promoted the observed metabolic phenotype in Mrp4-/- mice. In conclusion, our results indicate that Mrp4 as a novel genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3120943872,"Auditory masking occurs when one sound is perceptually altered by the presence of another sound. Auditory masking in the frequency domain is known as simultaneous masking and in the time domain is known as temporal masking or non-simultaneous masking. This works presents a sound coding strategy that incorporates a temporal masking model to select the most relevant channels for stimulation in a cochlear implant (CI). A previous version of the strategy, termed psychoacoustic advanced combination encoder (PACE), only used a simultaneous masking model for the same purpose, for this reason the new strategy has been termed temporal-PACE (TPACE). We hypothesized that a sound coding strategy that focuses on stimulating the auditory nerve with pulses that are as masked as possible can improve speech intelligibility for CI users. The temporal masking model used within TPACE attenuates the simultaneous masking thresholds estimated by PACE over time. The attenuation is designed to fall exponentially with a strength determined by a single parameter, the temporal masking half-life T ½ . This parameter gives the time interval at which the simultaneous masking threshold is halved. The study group consisted of 24 postlingually deaf subjects with a minimum of six months experience after CI activation. A crossover design was used to compare four variants of the new temporal masking strategy TPACE ( T ½ ranging between 0.4 and 1.1 ms) with respect to the clinical MP3000 strategy, a commercial implementation of the PACE strategy, in two prospective, within-subject, repeated-measure experiments. The outcome measure was speech intelligibility in noise at 15 to 5 dB SNR. In two consecutive experiments, the TPACE with T ½ of 0.5 ms obtained a speech performance increase of 11% and 10% with respect to the MP3000 ( T ½ = 0 ms), respectively. The improved speech test scores correlated with the clinical performance of the subjects: CI users with above-average outcome in their routine speech tests showed higher benefit with TPACE. It seems that the consideration of short-acting temporal masking can improve speech intelligibility in CI users. The half-live with the highest average speech perception benefit (0.5 ms) corresponds to time scales that are typical for neuronal refractory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3121090628,"An internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis can potentially decrease the perfusion pressure to the brain. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to study if there was a hemispheric pressure laterality between the contra- and ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) in patients with a symptomatic ICA stenosis. We further investigated if this MCA pressure laterality (ΔP MCA ) was related to the hemispheric flow laterality (ΔQ) in the anterior circulation, i.e., ICA, proximal MCA and the proximal anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Twenty-eight patients (73±6 years, range 59–80 years, 21 men) with symptomatic ICA stenosis were included. Flow rates were measured using 4D flow MRI data (PC-VIPR) and vessel geometries were obtained from computed tomography angiography. The ΔP MCA was calculated from CFD, where patient-specific flow rates were applied at all input- and output boundaries. The ΔP MCA between the contra- and ipsilateral side was 6.4±8.3 mmHg (p&lt;0.001) (median 3.9 mmHg, range -1.3 to 31.9 mmHg). There was a linear correlation between the ΔP MCA and ΔQ ICA (r = 0.85, p&lt;0.001) and ΔQ ACA (r = 0.71, p&lt;0.001), respectively. The correlation to ΔQ MCA was weaker (r = 0.47, p = 0.011). In conclusion, the MCA pressure laterality obtained with CFD, is a promising physiological biomarker that can grade the hemodynamic disturbance in patients with a symptomatic ICA stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W3118265583,"Background Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous, hematological neoplasm that accounts 2% of all cancers. Although, autologous stem cell transplantation and chemotherapy are currently the most effective therapy, it carries a notable hazards, in addition for being non curative. Recently, the Clustered Regular Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR-cas9) has been successfully tried at the experimental level, for the treatment of several hematological malignancies. Objectives We aimed to investigate the in-vitro effect of CRISPR-cas9-mediated knock-out of V-set pre B-cell surrogate light chain 1” VPREB1 ” gene on the malignant proliferation of primary cultured myeloma cells. Methods Bioinformatics’ analysis was performed to explore the gene expression profile of MM, and the VPREB1 gene was selected as a target gene for this study. We knocked-out the VPREB1 gene in primary cultured myeloma cells using CRISPR-cas9, the VPREB1 gene editing efficacy was verified by determining VPREB1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and immunofluorescence, respectively. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect on primary myeloma cells proliferation was evaluated using cytotoxicity assay. Results There was a statistically significant reduction of both VPREB1 mRNA and protein expression levels (p&lt;0.01). knock-out of VPREB1 gene in myeloma cell line resulted in a statistically significant reduction of myeloma cell proliferation. Conclusion CRISPR-cas9-mediated knock-out of VPREB1 gene is effective for inhibiting the proliferation of primary myeloma cells. This would provide a basis for a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W3119132058,"Enhanced laboratory-based surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Italy was only assessed indirectly by numerically comparing surveillance data cases with hospital discharge records (HDR). In this study, we evaluated the completeness, timeliness and sensitivity of the IMD surveillance in Italy from 2015 to 2018. Completeness and timeliness were described at the national and subnational level. A capture-recapture analysis was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) using HDR as the external source with a combination of deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The characteristics of the unmatched vs. matched cases were compared using multivariable Poisson modeling. Overall, the completeness of data improved, except for specific variables. Timeliness of notifications also improved to a median of 4 days from onset to reporting. For the years 2015–2017, the sensitivity of the surveillance was estimated at 71.4% and the PPV at 77.5%, changing to 80.6% and 66.9% respectively after removing cases with a secondary meningitis diagnosis. We noted substantial sub-national differences. In 2018 sensitivity was 66.5% (135/203) and the PPV was 79.4% (135/170). The adjusted relative risk of being unmatched in 2015–2017 was higher in cases that were ≥60 years, had missing information or symptom onset in December. The IMD surveillance system overall performs well with completeness and timeliness improving in time. Specific challenges identified for individual variables should guide further improvement. Notwithstanding limitations posed by the comparison database, sensitivity and PPV are promising. The study highlights that promoting etiological ascertainment in people ≥60 years and addressing sub-national challenges are the main current challenges to address."
https://openalex.org/W3118770761,"The prevalence of hypertension is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, however statistics are generally derived from cross sectional surveys that utilize different methodologies and population samples. We investigated blood pressure (BP) changes over 11–12 years in a large cohort of adults aged 50 years and older (n = 820) included in the World Health Organization’s Study on global AGEing and adult health (WHO-SAGE Ghana) Wave 1 (2007/8) with follow up in Wave 3 (2019). Participants’ BP were measured in triplicate and a survey completed at both time points. Survey instruments collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, health behaviors and chronic conditions. While no significant difference was found in systolic BP between Waves 1 and 3, diastolic BP decreased by 9.7mmHg (mean = 88.6, 15.4 to 78.9, 13.6 respectively) and pulse pressure increased by 9.5mmHg (44.8, 13.7 to 54.3, 14.1). Awareness of hypertension increased by 37%, from (20% to 57%), but no differences were found for the proportion of hypertensives receiving treatment nor those that had controlled BP. Mixed effects modelling showed a decrease in diastolic BP was associated with increasing age, living in rural areas and having health insurance. Factors associated with an increased awareness of hypertension were residing in urban areas, having health insurance and increasing body mass index. While diagnosis of hypertension has improved over time in Ghana, there is an ongoing need to improve its treatment in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3120495806,"Smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is more infectious compared to smear-negative PTB and have great significance for epidemiology and infection control. The prevalence of smear-positive PTB rarely affects males and females equally. Hence, we aimed to identify the sex-related differences in the prevalence of smear-positive PTB and its associated factors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Tuberculosis Information System (TBIS) from 1 January, 2015, to 31 December, 2019. The study population was selected using simple random sampling from the list of registered PTB patients in TBIS. The criteria for inclusion were all Malaysian adults aged ≥18 years residing in Kuala Lumpur and registered as PTB in TBIS. Factors associated with smear-positive PTB in male and female patients were determined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Overall prevalence of smear-positive PTB was 68.6%, and male patients predominated (71%). The male:female prevalence ratio of smear-positive PTB was 2.4:1. Male patients who worked as machine operators and elementary workers (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.02, p = 0.007), were self-employed (aOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.46–4.56, p = 0.001), lived in a residence categorized as ‘other’ (aOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.28–4.86, p = 0.007) and were smokers (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01–1.87, p = 0.045) had higher odds for smear-positive PTB. Meanwhile, female patients with diabetes mellitus had higher odds for smear-positive PTB (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.05–3.54, p = 0.035), while female patients who were healthcare workers had lower odds (aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12, 0.94, p = 0.039). The prevalence of smear-positive PTB is higher in males compared to females. The factors associated with smear-positive PTB differed based on sex. The current TB control program, especially on smear-positive PTB, should likely be strategized and stratified by sex."
https://openalex.org/W3118663959,"Nurses continue to disinfect the skin before administering subcutaneous injections as a standard process in clinical settings; despite evidence that disinfection is not necessary. To implement evidence-based practice, it is critical to explore why this gap between “evidence” and “practice” exists. This study aimed to describe the reasons offered by Certified Nurses in Infection Control (CNIC) in Japan for performing skin disinfection before subcutaneous injection. Adopting an inductive qualitative design, interviews were conducted with 10 CNIC in 2013. According to the participants, skin disinfection before subcutaneous injection: (a) was common practice; (b) may have been beneficial if it was omitted; (c) adhered to hospital norms; (d) prevented persistent suspicion of infection; (e) had no detrimental effect; (f) was an ingrained custom; and (g) involved a tacit approval for not disinfecting in home care settings. The themes (c) and (g) were cited as the main reasons affecting decision-making. The CNIC administered injections following skin disinfection in hospitals in accordance with hospital norms. On the contrary, outside the hospital, they administered subcutaneous injections without skin disinfection. All themes except (b) and (g) reflect the barriers and resistance to omitting skin disinfection, while (g) shows that it is already partly implemented in home care settings. It is necessary to create a guideline for skin disinfection before subcutaneous injection that considers the quality of life of patients at home, their physical conditions, and the surrounding environment at the time of injection, in addition to the guidelines applicable in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3120646970,"Despite significant evidence that Rac1 is localized to the nucleus, little is known regarding the function and biological significance of nuclear Rac1. Here, we showed that in response to EGF Rac1 was translocated to nuclear speckles and co-localized with the nuclear speckle marker Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) in Cos-7 cells. We also showed that the nuclear speckle localization of Rac1 was dependent on its T108 phosphorylation and facilitated by Rac1 polybasic region (PBR) that contains a nuclear localization signal and Rac1 GTPase activity. To gain insight into the function of Rac1 in nuclear speckles, we searched for Rac1 binding proteins in the nucleus. We isolated nuclear fraction of HEK 293 cells and incubated with GST-Rac1 and the phosphomimetic GST-Rac1T108E. We identified 463 proteins that were associated with GST-Rac1T108E, but not with GST-Rac1 by LC-MS/MS. Three notable groups of these proteins are: the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and SRSFs, all of which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and associated with nuclear speckles. We further showed by co-immunoprecipitation that Rac1 interacts with SRSF2, hnRNPA1, and U2A' in response to EGF. The interaction is dependent on T108 phosphorylation and facilitated by Rac1 PBR and GTPase activity. We showed that hnRNPA1 translocated in and out of nucleus in response to EGF in a similar pattern to Rac1. Rac1 only partially colocalized with U2A' that localizes to the actual splicing sites adjacent to nuclear speckle. Finally, we showed that Rac1 regulated EGF-induced pre-mRNA splicing and this is mediated by T108 phosphorylation. We conclude that in response to EGF, T108 phosphorylated Rac1 is targeted to nuclear speckles, interacts with multiple groups of proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, and regulates EGF-induced pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W3120966595,"Neuroblasts have a clustered phenotype critical for their unidirectional migration, which in part is dependent on signaling from microvascular endothelial cells (EC) and pericytes (PC). Diffusible signals secreted by vascular cells have been demonstrated to increase survival, proliferation, and differentiation of subventricular zone resident neural stem cells (NSC); however, the signals that promote the necessary initiating step of NSC clustering are undefined. To investigate the role of vascular cells in promoting NSC clustering and directing migration, we created a 3-D hydrogel that mimics the biomechanics, biochemistry, and architectural complexity of brain tissue. We demonstrate that EC, and not PC, have a crucial role in NSC clustering and migration, further verified through microfluidic chamber systems and traction force microscopy. Ablation of the extended NSC aggregate arm halts aggregate movement, suggesting that clustering is a prerequisite for migration. When cultured with EC, NSC clustering occurs and NSC coincidentally increase their expression of N-cadherin, as compared to NSC cultured alone. NSC-presented N-cadherin expression was increased following exposure to EC secreted metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2). We demonstrate that inhibition of MMP2 prevented NSC N-cadherin surface expression and subsequent NSC clustering, even when NSC were in direct contact with EC. Furthermore, with exogenous activation of EGFR, which serves as a downstream activator of N-cadherin cleavage, NSC form clusters. Our results suggest that EC secretion of MMP2 promotes NSC clustering through N-cadherin expression. The insight gained about the mechanisms by which EC promote NSC migration may enhance NSC therapeutic response to sites of injury."

https://openalex.org/W3119105706,"Tissue engineering and gene therapy strategies offer new ways to repair permanent damage to mechanosensory hair cells (MHCs) by differentiating human Wharton’s Jelly cells (HWJCs). Conventionally, these strategies require the classification of each cell as differentiated or undifferentiated. Automated classification tools, however, may serve as a novel method to rapidly classify these cells. In this paper, images from previous work, where HWJCs were differentiated into MHC-like cells, were examined. Various cell features were extracted from these images, and those which were pertinent to classification were identified. Different machine learning models were then developed, some using all extracted data and some using only certain features. To evaluate model performance, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was primarily used. This paper found that limiting algorithms to certain features consistently improved performance. The top performing model, a voting classifier model consisting of two logistic regressions, a support vector machine, and a random forest classifier, obtained an AUC of 0.9638. Ultimately, this paper illustrates the viability of a novel machine learning pipeline to automate the classification of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In the future, this research could aid in automated strategies that determine the viability of MHC-like cells after differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3119550297,"Background The relationship between time-use behaviors and prospective weight change is poorly understood. Methods A subset of Cancer Prevention Study-3 participants (n = 549, 58% women, 66% non-Latinx white) self-reported weight in 2015 and 2018 and completed an accelerometer protocol for seven days. Sedentary time, sleep, light, moderate, and vigorous intensity physical activity (PA) were treated as a compositional variable and multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between activity composition and weight change stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. Compositional isotemporal substitution analysis was used to quantify change in weight associated with reallocating 30 min./day. Results Activity composition was associated with weight change among women ( p = 0.007), but not men ( p = 0.356), and among Latinx ( p = 0.032) and white participants ( p = 0.001), but not Black participants ( p = 0.903). Replacement of 30 min./day sedentary time with moderate-vigorous PA was associated with 3.49 lbs. loss (-6.76, -0.22) in Latinx participants and replacement with sleep was associated with 1.52 (0.25, 2.79) and 1.31 (0.40, 2.21) lbs. gain in white women and men. Conclusion The distribution of time spent in daily behaviors was associated with three-year weight change in women, Latinx, and white participants. This was the first longitudinal compositional study of weight change; thus, more studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3120174751,"On the evening of November 3, 2020, like most Americans, I was waiting with excitement and a certain amount of trepidation for election results. While most of the country was focused on Biden versus Trump, my attention was drawn repeatedly to the emerging results for California Ballot Proposition 14. Proposition 14, The California Stem Cell Research, Treatments, and Cures Initiative of 2020, is a continuation of Proposition 71, which was passed in 2004 by a strong majority, almost 60%, of California voters including numerous Republicans as well as Democrats. Like Proposition 71, Proposition 14 will fund the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) for another 10 years by authorizing $5.5 billion in bonds. Poll numbers had been good, as they were for Proposition 71, but we were worried about the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on public attitudes. Ultimately, Proposition 14 passed, although it took 9 more days to get there. From election night until November 12 we were all waiting hopefully while dropping from 52% Yes to 51% Yes with 49% No, which was the ultimate tally of the votes. Once again, Bob Klein, a Palo Alto housing developer, lawyer, and patient advocate, served as lead author and chair of the campaign for Proposition 14. Bob organized and led a team of committed patient advocates and recruited expert political advice from the political consulting firm Winner and Mandabach, with communications handled primarily by Fiona Hutton and Associates. As with Proposition 71, I served as co-chair of the scientific advisory board (SAB) for the Proposition 14 campaign along with Irv Weissman from Stanford, and Mitra Hooshmand, who had done her Ph.D. work with Aileen Anderson, served as liaison between the SAB and the campaign committee. The scientific advisory board consisted of academic and clinical stem cell and regenerative medicine experts from across California universities, research institutes, and academic health centers. From my vantage point, the SAB worked together effectively and efficiently with the campaign team to get Proposition 14 written, qualified for the ballot, and ultimately passed. During this effort, I learned a great deal about the importance of patient advocates in a political campaign and the interplay of scientific evidence with the needs and behavior of print and broadcast media and the political system. A note about Bob Klein: I have developed enormous respect for Bob’s energy, intelligence, and commitment. Although not a scientist, Bob is a devoted patient advocate committed to medical science in the hope of bettering human health. Bob has worked for more than 20 years to leverage stem cell research in the hopes of finding better therapies to reduce human suffering. Bob’s personal focus is on type 1 diabetes, which afflicted his late son Jordan. I’ve never met anyone quite like Bob—although not a scientist, he listens carefully to scientific arguments, and he has an appreciation for scientific data and principles. But, Bob made his own decisions integrating campaign needs and political reality with accurate scientific advice. Bob’s decisions in this arena have been very good over the years I’ve known him. Based on my experience, science and scientists should provide good, sound, objective expert scientific advice about data, interpretation, design, and outlook, including managing expectations. But, scientists shouldn’t necessarily decide what political directions to go in.A key point about the scientific advisory board to the campaign: it was designed to give advice, not to make decisions. This fits with my own thinking about the role of science in the political process. Based on my experience, science and scientists should provide good, sound, objective expert scientific advice about data, interpretation, design, and outlook, including managing expectations. But, scientists shouldn’t necessarily decide what political directions to go in. That is up to the expert political leadership and communications teams, who must balance scientific input with real world political reality, fundraising, and ultimately messaging. This balancing act can sometimes lead to tension as messages get hammered out that are scientifically accurate but still compelling and understandable to the public at large. We have recently seen the importance of this principal in the sadly erratic handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. An example of this tension is in the messaging around patient responses in early clinical trials. There were numerous cases in CIRM-supported clinical trials of patients who appeared to clearly improve, including children whose genetically damaged immune systems were apparently restored by transplant of genetically engineered hematopoietic stem cells. More than 50 of these children responded dramatically in clinical trials. These results seemed to be very clear given historical data that these children rarely if ever recovered their immune systems on their own. Although most of these children have been healthy for years, as a scientist I knew that the trials didn’t reveal how long restoration would last, nor were there actual placebo controls as ordinarily wanted in gold-standard double-blind clinical trials. Nonetheless, my and others’ judgment was that given the obviously strong responses, messaging could legitimately talk about these children as having their immune systems restored. Similarly, many cancer trials produced dramatic effects with two FDA-approved cancer therapies being developed with important CIRM contributions. In addition, companies developing these and other cancer therapies such as antibodies directed against the CD47 “Don’t Eat Me” signal or ROR1 were purchased for substantial sums based on promising early clinical trial data. What was tricky was finding ways to state these findings without understating or inflating the significance of the early results.Results from trials of cell transplants to treat spinal cord injury, blindness, and other conditions were less dramatic but compared to clinical experience strongly suggested that the cell therapies were having important, positive effects. What was tricky was finding ways to state these findings without understating or inflating the significance of the early results. Again, the role of scientific advice is to help ensure that the campaign messaging is as accurate as possible. We generally managed to develop statements that were scientifically accurate while reflecting uncertainty as straightforwardly as possible. What was often difficult were situations where long and involved statements, caveats, and detailed descriptions couldn’t be used or wouldn’t be accepted because of typical time limits required in sound bites or quotes for radio, TV, or print media. In those situations, my judgement was that the observation needed to be accurately stated and the need noted for additional work as an important reason to pass Proposition 14 so that there would be funds to continue the trials to learn rigorously what was going on in the early-stage therapy trials. TV, radio, and newspapers always carried the hazard, which we often experienced in both the Proposition 71 and Proposition 14 campaigns, that the media outlet we were dealing with would cherry-pick the statements that they wanted to use in their coverage. They would not necessarily include the caveats and in many cases they exaggerated the promise and speed with which effective treatments could be developed. These types of situations were obviously less than ideal, but that is a persistent and long-term hazard of science reporting that I and other scientists have often experienced. These problems are not good reasons to avoid working with the press. Science reporting, even in a political context, is crucial to the long-term health of science and should be fostered and improved since we must find ways to keep the public who pays for our work informed about what we are doing with their funds. I worked closely with Bob and the communications team to try and get communication as accurate as possible while reflecting uncertainty where warranted. Similar to what happens in the writing of scientific papers with collaborators, the discussions often came down to discussions and debates about a single word! One huge problem that we encountered was the pandemic itself. After working for several years to do the background work needed to write the ballot proposition and to begin the public education process, we were irreversibly committed to the 2020 ballot. The pandemic hit while we were about 85% of the way to securing enough signatures for the initiative to qualify for the ballot in November 2020. There was a great deal of scrambling as the campaign worked to mobilize volunteers throughout the state. This effort focused on patient advocacy organizations, patient advocates and their families, and many of the people more formally involved in the campaign itself. We managed, but it was nerve-wracking and a close call. We encountered two additional and formidable problems. First was the problem of how to hold the various meetings needed to garner editorial board support and endorsements from chambers of commerce, political figures, and prominent scientists. Thus, the Proposition 14 campaign was completely different from the Proposition 71 campaign where we had traveled around the state giving interviews, appearing at TV stations for discussions and debates, and meeting with dispersed newspaper editorial boards in the very large state of California. As part of the adjustments needed, I effectively converted my dining room into a makeshift studio for TV and other interviews. The second problem we encountered was that the COVID-19 pandemic created significant political and social questions that had to be answered. California was clearly experiencing new fiscal problems and stresses owing to the pandemic so that we had to make the case more clearly that Proposition 71 and CIRM had made enough progress on treating diseases successfully to warrant the new fiscal commitment required. We were helped in making this case by arguing that Proposition 14 was structured such that financial benefits and stimulation of job creation in this area of biomedicine would accrue early by stimulating the expansion of California’s already substantial biotech and pharma industries. In fact, the argument that California’s innovative science and technology communities were uniquely poised to build on this type of public funding of stem cell research and medicine was well received. Thus, since bond payments wouldn’t start for 5–6 years after initiation of the new effort, the state would accrue financial benefits before payments needed to be made and after the economic problems wrought by the pandemic diminished. Finally, we continued to make the argument that the cost of the proposed research would be an average of $5 per year per California citizen. This amount is a tiny investment compared to the substantial annual financial burden (estimated to be >$300 billion/year) of chronic disease that we thought could be significantly reduced over time by research. An odd feature of this year’s campaign was that most newspaper editorial boards declined to endorse Proposition 14 for reasons that we thought were inadequate or incorrect. We nonetheless secured most other important endorsements including almost all of the important chambers of commerce, which in turn allowed us to make the case that tax and business issues had been appropriately evaluated by groups most engaged with California’s economic health. We also obtained endorsements from the University of California Regents, Governor Newsom, and many other state officials. These latter endorsements may have balanced out the unfavorable reception we received at many editorial boards. In my personal role, I elected to make contributions beyond what I had done in 2004 when we passed Proposition 71. To ensure that I complied with California state law regarding prohibition of the use of state resources for political activity, I went effectively half-time by going on 50% vacation, buying a personal laptop, and having my cell phone billed to me. Because of COVID-19 restrictions I was unable to use my office and so I was working at home owing to UC San Diego policies on work during the pandemic. As part of my personal time use, I signed one of the ballot argument rebuttals and spent a Sunday making a TV commercial that was widely aired. I also gave numerous TV, radio, and newspaper interviews countering what I thought were the sometimes completely false statements from the few and disorganized opponents. I believe that my experience again establishes that scientists can provide input to, and participate in, political debates without losing their integrity, and that their input is in fact essential. My work built upon years of advocacy and education work regarding biomedical science and its value to our citizens and our country. While challenging to balance my public service work with my time running an active lab, I consciously made the decision years ago to make my commitment to education of political figures and the public about science my primary community service work. In turn, I diminished the amount of time I spent reviewing grants and papers, or Study Section and editorial board service. Thus, my participation in the Proposition 14 campaign was a continuation of my committing part of my time to informing the public and the political system of the value of biomedical research in general and stem cell research in particular. I was prepared for the Proposition 14 campaign by a number of experiences. For example, I testified in 1998 about the value of human embryonic stem cells during hearings of the U.S. Senate’s appropriations subcommittee that handled the NIH. This subcommittee was chaired by Senator Arlen Spector whose commitment to biomedical research funding was well known. Since 1998 I testified in numerous other hearings in the Senate, the House, and the California legislature. I participated in numerous briefings of National and California legislators and staff about stem cells, cloning, and biomedical research funding in general. Finally, I participated in the passage of HR 810 in 2005/2006, which sought to broaden the range of human embryonic stem cell lines available to be used with federal funding and that was regrettably vetoed by President Bush. I have always hoped that my commitment to these issues would encourage other scientists to engage with their legislators, though perhaps not at my level of involvement. I have also learned a great deal about interactions with the media over the years. Perhaps most important is the need to properly educate a reporter about the scientific evidence and background so that they would choose appropriately representative examples and quotes.I can however say that informing public entities and the government about the value of scientific research and the importance of funding that is calibrated relative to need is essential to the health of our community and people. Would I recommend that other scientists become as involved in a political campaign as I did? Not necessarily. Everyone in our community will need to find personal solutions to deciding what fraction of their time to devote to service work and whether that work will be directed to political figures, legislators, or other community service work. I can however say that informing public entities and the government about the value of scientific research and the importance of funding that is calibrated relative to need is essential to the health of our community and people. I have found that legislators and their staff, and members of the public I’ve encountered in my neighborhood, at Rotary clubs, churches, and other civic organizations, welcome my participation. They were generally open-minded about the various issues I’ve engaged with over the years such as human embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. It’s certainly been personally rewarding. Most important is that unless scientists engage with the political process and the public, then those with no knowledge of science will make decisions and policies that we will have trouble living with, and that will damage science and scientific research. The increasingly important need to include scientific principles and information in public decision-making is a long-term fight that we must collectively continue.

Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers."
