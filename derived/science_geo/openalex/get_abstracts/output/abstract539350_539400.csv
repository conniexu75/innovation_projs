https://openalex.org/W1263857580,"MYC (also known as c-MYC) overexpression or hyperactivation is one of the most common drivers of human cancer. Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. MYC is a transcription factor, and many of its pro-tumorigenic functions have been attributed to its ability to regulate gene expression programs. Notably, oncogenic MYC activation has also been shown to increase total RNA and protein production in many tissue and disease contexts. While such increases in RNA and protein production may endow cancer cells with pro-tumour hallmarks, this increase in synthesis may also generate new or heightened burden on MYC-driven cancer cells to process these macromolecules properly. Here we discover that the spliceosome is a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a component of the core spliceosome required for its assembly and catalytic activity. Core spliceosomal factors (such as SF3B1 and U2AF1) associated with BUD31 are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total precursor messenger RNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing, and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1768917741,"TP53 (which encodes p53 protein) is the most frequently mutated gene among all human cancers. Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2122113546,"Whether cancer is maintained by a small number of stem cells or is composed of proliferating cells with approximate phenotypic equivalency is a central question in cancer biology. In the stem cell hypothesis, relapse after treatment may occur by failure to eradicate cancer stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is quintessential to this hypothesis. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL. During the chronic phase, this sole genetic abnormality (chromosomal translocation Ph(+): t(9;22)(q34;q11)) at the stem cell level causes increased proliferation of myeloid cells without loss of their capacity to differentiate. Without treatment, most patients progress to the blast phase when additional oncogenic mutations result in a fatal acute leukaemia made of proliferating immature cells. Imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL have improved patient survival markedly. However, fewer than 10% of patients reach the stage of complete molecular response (CMR), defined as the point when BCR-ABL transcripts become undetectable in blood cells. Failure to reach CMR results from the inability of TKIs to eradicate quiescent CML leukaemia stem cells (LSCs). Here we show that the residual CML LSC pool can be gradually purged by the glitazones, antidiabetic drugs that are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). We found that activation of PPARγ by the glitazones decreases expression of STAT5 and its downstream targets HIF2α and CITED2, which are key guardians of the quiescence and stemness of CML LSCs. When pioglitazone was given temporarily to three CML patients in chronic residual disease in spite of continuous treatment with imatinib, all of them achieved sustained CMR, up to 4.7 years after withdrawal of pioglitazone. This suggests that clinically relevant cancer eradication may become a generally attainable goal by combination therapy that erodes the cancer stem cell pool."
https://openalex.org/W1880012261,"The relative age effect (RAE) and its relationships with maturation, anthropometry, and physical performance characteristics were examined across a representative sample of English youth soccer development programmes. Birth dates of 1,212 players, chronologically age-grouped (i.e., U9's-U18's), representing 17 professional clubs (i.e., playing in Leagues 1 & 2) were obtained and categorised into relative age quartiles from the start of the selection year (Q1 = Sep-Nov; Q2 = Dec-Feb; Q3 = Mar-May; Q4 = Jun-Aug). Players were measured for somatic maturation and performed a battery of physical tests to determine aerobic fitness (Multi-Stage Fitness Test [MSFT]), Maximal Vertical Jump (MVJ), sprint (10 & 20m), and agility (T-Test) performance capabilities. Odds ratio's (OR) revealed Q1 players were 5.3 times (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4.08-6.83) more likely to be selected than Q4's, with a particularly strong RAE bias observed in U9 (OR: 5.56) and U13-U16 squads (OR: 5.45-6.13). Multivariate statistical models identified few between quartile differences in anthropometric and fitness characteristics, and confirmed chronological age-group and estimated age at peak height velocity (APHV) as covariates. Assessment of practical significance using magnitude-based inferences demonstrated body size advantages in relatively older players (Q1 vs. Q4) that were very-likely small (Effect Size [ES]: 0.53-0.57), and likely to very-likely moderate (ES: 0.62-0.72) in U12 and U14 squads, respectively. Relatively older U12-U14 players also demonstrated small advantages in 10m (ES: 0.31-0.45) and 20m sprint performance (ES: 0.36-0.46). The data identify a strong RAE bias at the entry-point to English soccer developmental programmes. RAE was also stronger circa-PHV, and relatively older players demonstrated anaerobic performance advantages during the pubescent period. Talent selectors should consider motor function and maturation status assessments to avoid premature and unwarranted drop-out of soccer players within youth development programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2145940538,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Small-Sided Games (SSG) vs. Interval Training (IT) in soccer training on aerobic fitness and physical enjoyment in youth elite soccer players during the last 8 weeks of the season. Seventeen U-16 male soccer players (age = 15.5 ± 0.6 years, and 8.5 years of experience) of a Spanish First Division club academy were randomized to 2 different groups for 6 weeks: SSG group (n = 9) and IT group (n = 8). In addition to the usual technical and tactical sessions and competitive games, the SSG group performed 11 sessions with different SSGs, whereas the IT group performed the same number of sessions of IT. Players were tested before and after the 6-week training intervention with a continuous maximal multistage running field test and the counter movement jump test (CMJ). At the end of the study, players answered the physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES). During the study, heart rate (HR) and session perceived effort (sRPE) were assessed. SSGs were as effective as IT in maintaining the aerobic fitness in elite young soccer players during the last weeks of the season. Players in the SSG group declared a greater physical enjoyment than IT (P = 0.006; ES = 1.86 ± 1.07). Coaches could use SSG training during the last weeks of the season as an option without fear of losing aerobic fitness while promoting high physical enjoyment."
https://openalex.org/W1814587308,"Biochemical and structural studies have shown that the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription proceeds in the following stages: assembly of the polymerase with general transcription factors and promoter DNA in a 'closed' preinitiation complex (PIC); unwinding of about 15 base pairs of the promoter DNA to form an 'open' complex; scanning downstream to a transcription start site; synthesis of a short transcript, thought to be about 10 nucleotides long; and promoter escape. Here we have assembled a 32-protein, 1.5-megadalton PIC derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and observe subsequent initiation processes in real time with optical tweezers. Contrary to expectation, scanning driven by the transcription factor IIH involved the rapid opening of an extended transcription bubble, averaging 85 base pairs, accompanied by the synthesis of a transcript up to the entire length of the extended bubble, followed by promoter escape. PICs that failed to achieve promoter escape nevertheless formed open complexes and extended bubbles, which collapsed back to closed or open complexes, resulting in repeated futile scanning."

https://openalex.org/W2105639793,"The aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of advanced fabrication technology across a broad spectrum of head and neck surgical procedures, including applications in endoscopic sinus surgery, skull base surgery, and maxillofacial reconstruction. The initial case studies demonstrated three applications of rapid prototyping technology are in head and neck surgery: i) a mono-material paranasal sinus phantom for endoscopy training ii) a multi-material skull base simulator and iii) 3D patient-specific mandible templates. Digital processing of these phantoms is based on real patient or cadaveric 3D images such as CT or MRI data. Three endoscopic sinus surgeons examined the realism of the endoscopist training phantom. One experienced endoscopic skull base surgeon conducted advanced sinus procedures on the high-fidelity multi-material skull base simulator. Ten patients participated in a prospective clinical study examining patient-specific modeling for mandibular reconstructive surgery. Qualitative feedback to assess the realism of the endoscopy training phantom and high-fidelity multi-material phantom was acquired. Conformance comparisons using assessments from the blinded reconstructive surgeons measured the geometric performance between intra-operative and pre-operative reconstruction mandible plates. Both the endoscopy training phantom and the high-fidelity multi-material phantom received positive feedback on the realistic structure of the phantom models. Results suggested further improvement on the soft tissue structure of the phantom models is necessary. In the patient-specific mandible template study, the pre-operative plates were judged by two blinded surgeons as providing optimal conformance in 7 out of 10 cases. No statistical differences were found in plate fabrication time and conformance, with pre-operative plating providing the advantage of reducing time spent in the operation room. The applicability of common model design and fabrication techniques across a variety of otolaryngological sub-specialties suggests an emerging role for rapid prototyping technology in surgical education, procedure simulation, and clinical practice."

https://openalex.org/W2160343715,"Austronesian speaking peoples left Southeast Asia and entered the Western Pacific c.4000-3000 years ago, continuing on to colonise Remote Oceania for the first time, where they became the ancestral populations of Polynesians. Understanding the impact of these peoples on the mainland of New Guinea before they entered Remote Oceania has eluded archaeologists. New research from the archaeological site of Wañelek in the New Guinea Highlands has broken this silence. Petrographic and geochemical data from pottery and new radiocarbon dating demonstrates that Austronesian influences penetrated into the highland interior by 3000 years ago. One potsherd was manufactured along the northeast coast of New Guinea, whereas others were manufactured from inland materials. These findings represent the oldest securely dated pottery from an archaeological context on the island of New Guinea. Additionally, the pottery comes from the interior, suggesting the movements of people and technological practices, as well as objects at this time. The antiquity of the Wañelek pottery is coincident with the expansion of Lapita pottery in the Western Pacific. Such occupation also occurs at the same time that changes have been identified in subsistence strategies in the archaeological record at Kuk Swamp suggesting a possible link between the two."
https://openalex.org/W2127434238,"CHO cell culture high productivity relies on optimized culture medium management under fed-batch or perfused chemostat strategies enabling high cell densities. In this work, a dynamic metabolic model for CHO cells was further developed, calibrated and challenged using datasets obtained under four different culture conditions, including two batch and two fed-batch cultures comparing two different culture media. The recombinant CHO-DXB11 cell line producing the EG2-hFc monoclonal antibody was studied. Quantification of extracellular substrates and metabolites concentration, viable cell density, monoclonal antibody concentration and intracellular concentration of metabolite intermediates of glycolysis, pentose-phosphate and TCA cycle, as well as of energetic nucleotides, were obtained for model calibration. Results suggest that a single model structure with a single set of kinetic parameter values is efficient at simulating viable cell behavior in all cases under study, estimating the time course of measured and non-measured intracellular and extracellular metabolites. Model simulations also allowed performing dynamic metabolic flux analysis, showing that the culture media and the fed-batch strategies tested had little impact on flux distribution. This work thus paves the way to an in silico platform allowing to assess the performance of different culture media and fed-batch strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1756216521,"Wetlands are globally important ecosystems that provide critical services for natural communities and human society. Montane wetland ecosystems are expected to be among the most sensitive to changing climate, as their persistence depends on factors directly influenced by climate (e.g. precipitation, snowpack, evaporation). Despite their importance and climate sensitivity, wetlands tend to be understudied due to a lack of tools and data relative to what is available for other ecosystem types. Here, we develop and demonstrate a new method for projecting climate-induced hydrologic changes in montane wetlands. Using observed wetland water levels and soil moisture simulated by the physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, we developed site-specific regression models relating soil moisture to observed wetland water levels to simulate the hydrologic behavior of four types of montane wetlands (ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, permanent wetlands) in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The hybrid models captured observed wetland dynamics in many cases, though were less robust in others. We then used these models to a) hindcast historical wetland behavior in response to observed climate variability (1916-2010 or later) and classify wetland types, and b) project the impacts of climate change on montane wetlands using global climate model scenarios for the 2040s and 2080s (A1B emissions scenario). These future projections show that climate-induced changes to key driving variables (reduced snowpack, higher evapotranspiration, extended summer drought) will result in earlier and faster drawdown in Pacific Northwest montane wetlands, leading to systematic reductions in water levels, shortened wetland hydroperiods, and increased probability of drying. Intermediate hydroperiod wetlands are projected to experience the greatest changes. For the 2080s scenario, widespread conversion of intermediate wetlands to fast-drying ephemeral wetlands will likely reduce wetland habitat availability for many species."
https://openalex.org/W2165206604,"Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a transmembrane proteinase with an extracellular catalytic domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, degrades a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. In addition, MT1-MMP activates intracellular signaling through proteolysis-dependent and independent mechanisms. We have previously shown that binding of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) to MT1-MMP controls cell proliferation and migration, as well as tumor growth in vivo by activating the Ras—extracellular signal regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) pathway through a mechanism that requires the cytoplasmic but not the proteolytic domain of MT1-MMP. Here we show that in MT1-MMP expressing cells TIMP-2 also induces rapid and sustained activation of AKT in a dose- and time-dependent manner and by a mechanism independent of the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP. Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 mediates TIMP-2 induction of ERK1/2 but not of AKT activation; however, Ras activation is necessary to transduce the TIMP-2-activated signal to both the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. ERK1/2 and AKT activation by TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP protects tumor cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation. Conversely, TIMP-2 upregulates apoptosis induced by three-dimensional type I collagen in epithelial cancer cells. Thus, TIMP-2 interaction with MT1-MMP provides tumor cells with either pro- or anti-apoptotic signaling depending on the extracellular environment and apoptotic stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1841982535,"Despite widespread gains toward the 5th Millennium Development Goal (MDG), pro-rich inequalities in reproductive health (RH) and maternal health (MH) are pervasive throughout the world. As countries enter the post-MDG era and strive toward UHC, it will be important to monitor the extent to which countries are achieving equity of RH and MH service coverage. This study explores how equity of service coverage differs across countries, and explores what policy factors are associated with a country's progress, or lack thereof, toward more equitable RH and MH service coverage.We used RH and MH service coverage data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 74 countries to examine trends in equity between countries and over time from 1990 to 2014. We examined trends in both relative and absolute equity, and measured relative equity using a concentration index of coverage data grouped by wealth quintile. Through multivariate analysis we examined the relative importance of policy factors, such as political commitment to health, governance, and the level of prepayment, in determining countries' progress toward greater equity in RH and MH service coverage.Relative equity for the coverage of RH and MH services has continually increased across all countries over the past quarter century; however, inequities in coverage persist, in some countries more than others. Multivariate analysis shows that higher education and greater political commitment (measured as the share of government spending allocated to health) were significantly associated with higher equity of service coverage. Neither country income, i.e., GDP per capita, nor better governance were significantly associated with equity.Equity in RH and MH service coverage has improved but varies considerably across countries and over time. Even among the subset of countries that are close to achieving the MDGs, progress made on equity varies considerably across countries. Enduring disparities in access and outcomes underpin mounting support for targeted reforms within the broader context of universal health coverage (UHC)."
https://openalex.org/W2125377469,"The present study explores whether and to what extent individual differences (i.e., gender and personality traits of perceiver) predict inferences of trustworthiness from emotionally neutral unfamiliar faces and the related confidence in judgment. Four hundred and ten undergraduate students participated in the study. Personality was assessed using the Big Five model (i.e., Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Openness to experience) and measures of trait anxiety and aggression. The results suggest that trustworthiness judgments are affected by the gender of the perceiver, although this effect depends on the valence of the face. Women tend to judge trustworthy-looking faces as significantly more trustworthy than men do, and this is particularly pronounced for judgments of female faces. There were no gender differences for judgments of untrustworthy-looking or neutral faces. Gender also seems to affect the confidence in judgment. Specifically, women were generally less confident than men in judging trustworthiness of unfamiliar faces. Personality also affected judgment. Both low agreeable individuals and high trait aggressive individuals tend to perceive unfamiliar faces as less trustworthy. The present findings suggest that both gender and personality traits are relevant for understanding how people evaluate the trustworthiness of others. Whom we decide to trust is a function not only of their facial features but also of gender and individual differences in personality traits."
https://openalex.org/W2159260876,"Unlike bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, several species of freshwater cyanobacteria are known to contain multiple chromosomal copies per cell, at all stages of their cell cycle. We have characterized the replication of multi-copy chromosomes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter Synechococcus 7942). In Synechococcus 7942, the replication of multi-copy chromosome is asynchronous, not only among cells but also among multi-copy chromosomes. This suggests that DNA replication is not tightly coupled to cell division in Synechococcus 7942. To address this hypothesis, we analysed the relationship between DNA replication and cell doubling at various growth phases of Synechococcus 7942 cell culture. Three distinct growth phases were characterised in Synechococcus 7942 batch culture: lag phase, exponential phase, and arithmetic (linear) phase. The chromosomal copy number was significantly higher during the lag phase than during the exponential and linear phases. Likewise, DNA replication activity was higher in the lag phase cells than in the exponential and linear phase cells, and the lag phase cells were more sensitive to nalidixic acid, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, than cells in other growth phases. To elucidate physiological differences in Synechococcus 7942 during the lag phase, we analysed the metabolome at each growth phase. In addition, we assessed the accumulation of central carbon metabolites, amino acids, and DNA precursors at each phase. The results of these analyses suggest that Synechococcus 7942 cells prepare for cell division during the lag phase by initiating intensive chromosomal DNA replication and accumulating metabolites necessary for the subsequent cell division and elongation steps that occur during the exponential growth and linear phases."
https://openalex.org/W1885409381,"Background There is increasing recognition of the importance of sharing research data within the international scientific community, but also of the ethical and social challenges this presents, particularly in the context of structural inequities and varied capacity in international research. Public involvement is essential to building locally responsive research policies, including on data sharing, but little research has involved stakeholders from low-to-middle income countries. Methods Between January and June 2014, a qualitative study was conducted in Kenya involving sixty stakeholders with varying experiences of research in a deliberative process to explore views on benefits and challenges in research data sharing. In-depth interviews and extended small group discussions based on information sharing and facilitated debate were used to collect data. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, and charting flow and dynamics in debates. Findings The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of communicating about this complex and relatively novel topic for many stakeholders. For more and less research-experienced stakeholders, ethical research data sharing is likely to rest on the development and implementation of appropriate trust-building processes, linked to local perceptions of benefits and challenges. The central nature of trust is underpinned by uncertainties around who might request what data, for what purpose and when. Key benefits perceived in this consultation were concerned with the promotion of public health through science, with legitimate beneficiaries defined differently by different groups. Important challenges were risks to the interests of study participants, communities and originating researchers through stigmatisation, loss of privacy, impacting autonomy and unfair competition, including through forms of intentional and unintentional 'misuse' of data. Risks were also seen for science. Discussion Given background structural inequities in much international research, building trust in this low-to-middle income setting includes ensuring that the interests of study participants, primary communities and originating researchers will be promoted as far as possible, as well as protected. Important ways of building trust in data sharing include involving the public in policy development and implementation, promoting scientific collaborations around data sharing and building close partnerships between researchers and government health authorities to provide checks and balances on data sharing, and promote near and long-term translational benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2117957160,"One of the central controversies regarding the evolution of adhesion concerns how adhesive force scales as animals change in size, either among or within species. A widely held view is that as animals become larger, the primary mechanism that enables them to climb is increasing pad area. However, prior studies show that much of the variation in maximum adhesive force remains unexplained, even when area is accounted for. We tested the hypothesis that maximum adhesive force among pad-bearing gecko species is not solely dictated by toepad area, but also depends on the ratio of toepad area to gecko adhesive system compliance in the loading direction, where compliance (C) is the change in extension (Δ) relative to a change in force (F) while loading a gecko’s adhesive system (C = dΔ/dF). Geckos are well-known for their ability to climb on a range of vertical and overhanging surfaces, and range in mass from several grams to over 300 grams, yet little is understood of the factors that enable adhesion to scale with body size. We examined the maximum adhesive force of six gecko species that vary in body size (~2–100 g). We also examined changes between juveniles and adults within a single species (Phelsuma grandis). We found that maximum adhesive force and toepad area increased with increasing gecko size, and that as gecko species become larger, their adhesive systems become significantly less compliant. Additionally, our hypothesis was supported, as the best predictor of maximum adhesive force was not toepad area or compliance alone, but the ratio of toepad area to compliance. We verified this result using a synthetic “model gecko” system comprised of synthetic adhesive pads attached to a glass substrate and a synthetic tendon (mechanical spring) of finite stiffness. Our data indicate that increases in toepad area as geckos become larger cannot fully account for increased adhesive abilities, and decreased compliance must be included to explain the scaling of adhesion in animals with dry adhesion systems."

As a result, the DHA status may not be optimal for child development and may increase the risk for maternal postpartum depression. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the maternal fatty acid status from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum, and to study the impact of seafood consumption on the individual fatty acid status.Blood samples and seafood consumption habits (gestation week 28, and three-, six- and 12 months postpartum) were collected in a longitudinal observational study of pregnant and postpartum women (n = 118). Multilevel linear modeling was used to assess both changes over time in the fatty acid status of red blood cells (RBC), and in the seafood consumption.Six fatty acids varied the most (>80%) across the four time points analyzed, including the derivative of the essential α-linoleic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), DHA; the essential linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6); and the LA derivative, arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6). Over all, a large variation in individuals' DHA- and AA status was observed; however, over the 15-month study period only small inter-individual differences in the longitudinal trajectory of DHA- and AA abundance in the RBC were detected. The median intake of seafood was lower than recommended. Regardless, the total weekly frequency of seafood and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3)/DHA-supplement intake predicted the maternal level of DHA (μg/g RBC).The period of depletion of the maternal DHA status during pregnancy and lactation, seem to turn to repletion from about six months postpartum towards one year after childbirth, irrespective of RBC concentration of DHA during pregnancy. Seafood and EPA/DHA-supplement intake predicted the DHA levels over time.www.helseforskning.etikkom.no 2009/570/REC, project number: 083.09."

This catabolic conversion generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that triggers cellular signaling cascades including autophagy and apoptosis. This study for the first time demonstrates a role of POX in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120)-induced neuronal autophagy. HIV-1 gp120 is a neurotoxic factor and is involved in HIV-1-associated neurological disorders. However, the mechanism of gp120-mediated neurotoxicity remains unclear. Using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model, this study demonstrates that gp120 treatment induced POX expression and catalytic activity. Concurrently, gp120 also increased intracellular ROS levels. However, increased ROS had a minimal effect on neuronal apoptosis. Further investigation indicated that the immediate cellular response to increased ROS paralleled with induction of autophagy markers, beclin-1 and LC3-II. These data lead to the hypothesis that neuronal autophagy is activated as a cellular protective response to the toxic effects of gp120.

Signal transduction by reactive oxygen species.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Thus, POX has been demonstrated to serve as a multifunctional stress-responsive protein that on the one hand can contribute to ATP production and on the other can mediate apoptosis through generation of ROS (8Phang J.M.

Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that under stress conditions POX-generated ROS elicits cellular protective autophagic signaling pathways (11Zabirnyk O. Liu W. Khalil S. Sharma A. Phang J.M.

Several lines of evidence indicate a role of POX and proline metabolism in normal function and disease conditions in the brain. POX gene is widely expressed (13Gogos J.A. Santha M. Takacs Z.

Behavioral and neurochemical effects of proline.Metab. Brain Dis. 2011; 26: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) emphasize a role of proline metabolism in neurological disorders, the impact of POX and proline metabolism in HIV-1 neurological disorders has not been elucidated. The goal of this study is to examine a role of POX in HIV-1-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HAND affects 20–30% patients in the late stages of AIDS and is believed to be the most common cause of dementia worldwide among people aged 40 or less (24Albright A.V. Soldan S.S. González-Scarano F.

Even though antiretroviral therapy has reduced the severity of HAND (26Joska J.A. Gouse H. Paul R.H. Stein D.J. Flisher A.J. Does highly active antiretroviral therapy improve neurocognitive function? A systematic review.J. Neurovirol. 2010; 16: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the incidence of this neurological disease continues to rise as HIV-1 patients are living longer (27Valcour V. Shikuma C. Shiramizu B. Watters M. Poff P. Selnes O. Holck P. Grove J. Sacktor N. Higher frequency of dementia in older HIV-1 individuals: the Hawaii aging with HIV-1 cohort.Neurology. 2004; 63: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of HAND pathogenesis are not completely understood. The brain is a major target for HIV-1 infection (28McArthur J.C. Steiner J. Sacktor N. Nath A. Human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorders: mind the gap.Ann. Neurol. 2010; 67: 699-714PubMed Google Scholar). The virus enters the brain within days to weeks of infection, and progressive neuronal damage has been observed in infected patients (29Clifford D.B. Human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia.Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Rao V.R. Ruiz A.P. Prasad V.R.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins in neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: S193-S198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although neurons are refractory to HIV-1 infection, macrophages and microglia are the primary target cells that are infected by HIV-1 in the brain (30Rao V.R. Ruiz A.P. Prasad V.R. Viral and cellular factors underlying neuropathogenesis in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).AIDS Res. Ther. 2014; 11: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The neuronal damage in infected patients is partly driven by the neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 proteins produced from the infected cells in the brain (31Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A.

The viral proteins with known neurotoxic effects are the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and the accessory viral proteins Tat, Nef, and Vpr (31Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A.

Martín-García J. The neuropathogenesis of AIDS.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence suggest that gp120 is one of the major drivers of the neuronal loss observed in HAND patients (34Mocchetti I. Bachis A. Avdoshina V. Neurotoxicity of human immunodeficiency virus-1: viral proteins and axonal transport.Neurotox. Res. 2012; 21: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Acquas E. Bachis A. Nosheny R.L.

Res. 2004; 5: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is well documented that the neurotoxic effects of gp120 are predominantly induced by ROS-mediated oxidative stress (36Agrawal L. Louboutin J.P. Marusich E. Reyes B.A. Van Bockstaele E.J. Strayer D.S. Dopaminergic neurotoxicity of HIV-1 gp120: reactive oxygen species as signaling intermediates.Brain Res. 2010; 1306: 116-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Steiner J. Haughey N. Li W.

Preferential sensitivity of human dopaminergic neurons to gp120-induced oxidative damage.J. Neurovirol. 2009; 15: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cellular metabolic enzyme NADPH oxidase has been implicated as the biochemical mediator of gp120-mediated ROS generation (39Jana A. Pahan K. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 induces apoptosis in human primary neurons through redox-regulated activation of neutral sphingomyelinase.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9531-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the impact of gp120 on mitochondrial ROS-mediated oxidative stress is yet to be elucidated. Given that POX is a well established mitochondrial ROS-inducing redox enzyme, we hypothesized that POX-dependent ROS may contribute to HIV-1 gp120-induced neuronal oxidative stress. To test this, we used a neuronal model cell line and examined the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of gp120 on POX expression and catalytic activity. We also examined the impact of gp120 on POX-mediated ROS production, neuronal autophagy, and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that gp120 induced expression and activity of POX in neuronal cells. Importantly, the enhanced POX activity resulted in higher levels of intracellular ROS production. Furthermore, POX-induced ROS elicited neuronal autophagy as a protective mechanism for the cellular stress of gp120. Our mechanistic studies suggest that gp120 regulates POX via CXCR4-mediated induction of p53. These results describe a novel mechanism for gp-120-mediated neuronal dysfunction and implicate POX as a potential biochemical modulator of HAND pathogenesis. Recombinant HIV-1 gp120 IIIB and CXCR4 inhibitor-AMD3100 were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of NIH. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate, bafilomycin A1, N-acetylcysteine, dehydroproline, α-pifithrin, o-aminobenzaldehyde, and anti-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-LC3 was purchased from MBL, sequestosome 1 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and anti-p53 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-POX antibody was a gift from Dr. James Phang (NCI-Frederick). Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco) containing 2 mm glutamine and 1% antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were maintained and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For our studies we seeded the appropriate number of SH-SY5Y cells and treated them with HIV-1 gp120 in a dose-dependent manner from 50–400 ng/ml. These concentrations were used as these concentrations have been suggested in literature to have physiological relevance (40Louboutin J.P. Strayer D.S.

Lu Y. Wang C. Buch S. Cocaine potentiates astrocyte toxicity mediated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protein gp120.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5e13427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Neuronal apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Annexin V apoptosis kit (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Untreated and HIV-1 gp120-treated SH-SY5Y cells (1 × 106) were washed in 1× annexin binding buffer and incubated for 20 min with Annexin V-FITC at 4 °C. After two washes with buffer, propidium iodide (100 μg/ml) was added. Thereafter, cells were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Positive staining of the plasma membrane with Annexin V and lack of concomitant staining of nuclei with propidium iodide (PI) was measured as apoptosis at an early stage, whereas positive staining of cells with both annexin V and PI was indicative of apoptosis at later stages. For measuring ROS levels in neuronal cells, 5 × 105 SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 6-well plates in the growth medium before treatment. Cells were then treated with gp120, as specified, for an additional 24 h before analysis for ROS. For inhibition studies, cells were treated with 10 μm dehydroproline for 1 h before treatment with gp120. 2,7-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) was used as an indicator of the amount of intracellular ROS. On the day of the experiment, treatment medium was removed, and cells were exposed to serum-free, phenol red-free medium containing 10 μm 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Cells were exposed to the dye for 30 min in the dark to allow for equilibration. After two washes fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. In parallel, cells were solubilized with 0.5% SDS and 5 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5). The fluorescent intensity of the lysate was determined using a spectrofluorometer (BioTek) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Data are shown as arbitrary units of fluorescence ±S.D. SH-SY5Y cells (1 × 106) were treated with HIV-1 gp120 overnight. Cell lysates were prepared and quantified according to standard BCA protein assay (Pierce). For lysis with separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic components, after treatment cells were lysed with Pierce NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents. Subcellular fractionation was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Equal amounts of cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked using Tris-buffered saline with 5% nonfat milk (pH 8.0; Sigma). Blots were then probed with the primary antibody in blocking buffer and subsequently by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). All blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (pH 8.0; Sigma) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) procedure (Pierce). Blots were routinely stripped by Restore Plus stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody to serve as loading controls. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz, Piscataway, NJ) was used as secondary antibody. Untreated and treated SH-SY5Y cells after treatment were harvested in cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3.5 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)). Suspensions were then sonicated for 5 s at a setting of 25% (Branson Sonifer 450; Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). Total protein was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). P5C formed due to POX-mediated proline degradation was detected using a specific spectrophotometric method (5Pandhare J. Cooper S.K. Phang J.M. Proline oxidase, a proapoptotic gene, is induced by troglitazone: evidence for both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-dependent and -independent mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2044-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, P5C formed from the substrate proline was reacted with O-aminobenzaldehyde (OAB), and the resultant OAB-P5C complex was quantified. A 200-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 m KPO4 (pH 7.2), 0.12 mg/ml OAB, 0.012 mg/ml cytochrome c, 5 mm proline, and cell extract containing 50 μg of protein was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of OAB (10 mg/ml in 6 n HCl). The samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatants was measured at 440 nm. All the reactions were performed in triplicates, and proper protein controls were included for each measurement. Total RNA from treated and untreated cells was isolated using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Then the cDNAs were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The sequences of the primers used to amplify beclin-1 in the current study were previously reported (42Chen G. Ke Z. Xu M. Liao M. Wang X. Qi Y. Zhang T. Frank J.A. Bower K.A. Shi X. Luo J. Autophagy is a protective response to ethanol neurotoxicity.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and were as follows: beclin-1, (forward) 5′-AGC TGG AGC TGG ATG ATG AG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CGA CCC AGC CTG AAG TTA TT-3′; GAPDH, (forward) 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′. Real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green supermix in a C1000 Touch CFX96 Real time System (Bio-Rad). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. The relative expression of the transcripts was normalized to the internal control gene GAPDH using the ΔΔCq calculation method. For POX mRNA expression measurement, total RNA was isolated from untreated and gp120-treated SH-SY5Y cells. cDNA synthesis was carried out as described before, and real time PCR was conducted using POX-specific primers (forward, 5′-CCACAATGAGGACACAGTGC; reverse, 5′-GACAAGTAGGGCAGCACCTC). For copy number determination a standard curve was generated using the pcDNA-POX plasmid copies from 100 through 108. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 6-well plates in the required growth medium and transfected with pcDNA control vector or POX expression vector, a gift from Dr. James Phang (NCI-Frederick). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. Overexpression of POX in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis as described before. The visualization of autophagosomes was performed using GFP-LC3 expression vector (plasmid 24920: Addgene, Cambridge, MA). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with GFP-LC3 expression vector using Lipofectamine-based methods as described earlier. The transfected cells were treated with the appropriate concentrations of HIV-1 gp120. The GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. POX transcriptional activity was measured using the Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To determine the effect of HIV-1 gp120 on POX promoter activity, cells were transfected with the POX-Luciferase reporter construct (POX-Luc), a gift from Dr. James Phang (NCI-Frederick), and exposed to various concentration of HIV-1 gp120. The effect of p53 on POX promoter activity was measured by co-transfection of POX-Luc construct along with equivalent amounts of p53 cDNA or vector plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were lysed, and luciferase activity of the cell extracts was measured using a plate reader (BioTek). Samples were assayed in triplicate. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. obtained from three independent experiments. The significance of differences between control and treated samples was determined by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Increased oxidative stress is a major driver of HIV-1 gp120 protein-mediated neurotoxicity (36Agrawal L. Louboutin J.P. Marusich E.

However, the molecular and biochemical determinants leading to neuronal oxidative stress are not clearly defined. POX plays an important role in oxidative stress because of its ability to generate ROS (5Pandhare J. Cooper S.K. Phang J.M. Proline oxidase, a proapoptotic gene, is induced by troglitazone: evidence for both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-dependent and -independent mechanisms.J. Biol.

Therefore, we investigated whether POX is induced as an oxidative stress response enzyme by gp120. To test this we treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with gp120 in a dose-dependent manner. Cell lysates of gp120-treated cells were analyzed for POX expression by Western blot analysis. As described in Fig. 2, A and B, exposure of increasing concentrations of gp120 increased POX protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Densitometry analysis illustrated that a maximum induction of 4-fold POX expression was achieved in cells treated with 300 ng/ml gp120 relative to untreated cells (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined whether gp120-induced POX expression resulted in enhanced POX catalytic activity. This was tested by a spectrophotometric assay that detects the product of POX-mediated proli"
https://openalex.org/W1843070187,"The expression, misfolding, and aggregation of long repetitive amino acid tracts are a major contributing factor in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome, myotonic dystrophy type 1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, and the nine polyglutamine diseases. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of each of these diseases. In model organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats, and human cells, expression of proteins with the long repetitive amino acid tracts associated with these diseases recapitulates the protein aggregation that occurs in human disease. Here we show that the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum has evolved to normally encode long polyglutamine tracts and express these proteins in a soluble form. We also show that Dictyostelium has the capacity to suppress aggregation of a polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin construct that aggregates in other model organisms tested. Together, these data identify Dictyostelium as a novel model organism with the capacity to suppress aggregation of proteins with long polyglutamine tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2147793258,"Institutions play a central role in advancing the field of reproductive health in humanitarian settings (RHHS), yet little is known about organizational capacity to deliver RHHS and how this has developed over the past decade. This study aimed to document the current institutional experiences and capacities related to RHHS.Descriptive study using an online questionnaire tool.Respondents represented 82 institutions from 48 countries, of which two-thirds originated from low-and middle-income countries. RHHS work was found not to be restricted to humanitarian agencies (25%), but was also embraced by development organizations (25%) and institutions with dual humanitarian and development mandates (50%). Agencies reported working with refugees (81%), internally-displaced (87%) and stateless persons (20%), in camp-based settings (78%), and in urban (83%) and rural settings (78%). Sixty-eight percent of represented institutions indicated having an RHHS-related policy, 79% an accountability mechanism including humanitarian work, and 90% formal partnerships with other institutions. Seventy-three percent reported routinely appointing RH focal points to ensure coordination of RHHS implementation. There was reported progress in RHHS-related disaster risk reduction (DRR), emergency management and coordination, delivery of the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for RH, comprehensive RH services in post-crisis/recovery situations, gender mainstreaming, and community-based programming. Other reported institutional areas of work included capacity development, program delivery, advocacy/policy work, followed by research and donor activities. Except for abortion-related services, respondents cited improved efforts in advocacy, capacity development and technical support in their institutions for RHHS to address clinical services, including maternal and newborn health, sexual violence prevention and response, HIV prevention, management of sexually-transmitted infections, adolescent RH, and family planning. Approximately half of participants reported that their institutions had experienced an increase in dedicated budget and staff for RHHS, a fifth no change, and 1 in 10 a decrease. The Interagency RH Kits were reportedly the most commonly used supplies to support RHHS implementation.The results suggest overall growth in institutional capacity in RHHS over the past decade, indicating that the field has matured and expanded from crisis response to include RHHS into DRR and other elements of the emergency management cycle. It is critical to consolidate the progress to date, address gaps, and sustain momentum."
https://openalex.org/W2207150473,"Inner Mongolia is among the most important regions in terms of contribution to the socio-economic development of China. Furthermore, its grassland is a major ecological barrier for Northern China. The present study evaluates the changes in ecosystem services availability and human wellbeing based on a survey on864 herdsmen of the grassland and 20 governmental officials. The survey provided the following results: (1) The supporting and provisioning services of the grassland have recently declined, thus affecting the herdsmen’s wellbeing. The intensity of grazing, coal exploitation and tourism development heavily limits the availability of ecosystem services, among which provisioning ones are perceived as the most important. Below a certain threshold, grazing and mining are likely to promote the improvement of herdsmen’s wellbeing, while trespassing that point, the enhancement of the herdsmen’s living standards is curbed. (2) The herdsmen’s cultural exchange, health conditions and social relations are better now than before; however, the threats on herdsmen’s health and safety have increased. (3) A better income is among the most urgent herdsmen’s needs. Livestock revenues did not increase at the same rate as the damage to the grassland and human risk exposure did. (4) The governmental ecological compensation policy did not entirely solve the problem of grassland desertification and environmental degradation, although it is also true that the degree of implementation and effectiveness of government policies is related to the still insufficient herdsmen’s understanding and acceptance of these policies."
https://openalex.org/W1813176339,"The Complicate Observations and Multi-Parameter Land Information Constructions on Allied Telemetry Experiment (COMPLICATE) comprises a network of remote sensing experiments designed to enhance the dynamic analysis and modeling of remotely sensed information for complex land surfaces. Two types of experimental campaigns were established under the framework of COMPLICATE. The first was designed for continuous and elaborate experiments. The experimental strategy helps enhance our understanding of the radiative and scattering mechanisms of soil and vegetation and modeling of remotely sensed information for complex land surfaces. To validate the methodologies and models for dynamic analyses of remote sensing for complex land surfaces, the second campaign consisted of simultaneous satellite-borne, airborne, and ground-based experiments. During field campaigns, several continuous and intensive observations were obtained. Measurements were undertaken to answer key scientific issues, as follows: 1) Determine the characteristics of spatial heterogeneity and the radiative and scattering mechanisms of remote sensing on complex land surfaces. 2) Determine the mechanisms of spatial and temporal scale extensions for remote sensing on complex land surfaces. 3) Determine synergist inversion mechanisms for soil and vegetation parameters using multi-mode remote sensing on complex land surfaces. Here, we introduce the background, the objectives, the experimental designs, the observations and measurements, and the overall advances of COMPLICATE. As a result of the implementation of COMLICATE and for the next several years, we expect to contribute to quantitative remote sensing science and Earth observation techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1761872826,"Miocene baleen whales were highly diverse and included tens of genera. However, their taxonomy and phylogeny, as well as relationships with living whales, are still a subject of controversy. Here, “Mesocetus” argillarius, a poorly known specimen from Denmark, is redescribed with a focus on the cranial anatomy. It was found to represent not only a new genus, Tranatocetus gen. nov., but also a new family; Tranatocetidae. The whales of this family have the rostral bones either overriding or dividing the frontals; the rostral bones are contacting the parietals and nasals dividing the maxillae on the vertex; the occipital shield is dorsoventrally bent. The tympanic bulla is particularly characteristic of this family featuring a short, narrow anterior portion with a rounded or squared anterior end and a wider and higher posterior portion that is swollen in the posteroventral area. A phylogenetic analysis including 51 taxa supports a monophyletic group comprising most Neogene and modern whales, with Tranatocetidae being possibly closer related to Balaenopteridae (rorquals) than to Cetotheriidae. Tranatocetidae exhibit a charahteristic bulla shape. In fact, all Neogene and modern mysticete families examined have a unique shape of the tympanic bulla that is diagnostic at family-level. Inclusion of problematic taxa like Tranatocetus argillarius in phylogenies brings new understanding of the distribution and diagnostic value of character traits. This underlines the need for re-examination of earlier described specimens in the light of the wealth of new information published in later years."
https://openalex.org/W2157275521,"Arthrobacter globiformis T6 isomalto-dextranase (AgIMD) is an enzyme that liberates isomaltose from the non-reducing end of a polymer of glucose, dextran. AgIMD is classified as a member of the glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 27, which comprises mainly α-galactosidases and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, whereas AgIMD does not show α-galactosidase or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities. Here, we determined the crystal structure of AgIMD. AgIMD consists of the following three domains: A, C, and D. Domains A and C are identified as a (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain and an antiparallel β-structure, respectively, both of which are commonly found in GH27 enzymes. However, domain A of AgIMD has subdomain B, loop-1, and loop-2, all of which are not found in GH27 human α-galactosidase. AgIMD in a complex with trisaccharide panose shows that Asp-207, a residue in loop-1, is involved in subsite +1. Kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant enzymes for the small synthetic saccharide p-nitrophenyl α-isomaltoside and the polysaccharide dextran were compared, showing that Asp-207 is important for the catalysis of dextran. Domain D is classified as carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 35, and an isomaltose molecule is seen in this domain in the AgIMD-isomaltose complex. Domain D is highly homologous to CBM35 domains found in GH31 and GH66 enzymes. The results here indicate that some features found in GH13, -31, and -66 enzymes, such as subdomain B, residues at the subsite +1, and the CBM35 domain, are also observed in the GH27 enzyme AgIMD and thus provide insights into the evolutionary relationships among GH13, -27, -31, -36, and -66 enzymes.

Dextran, a polymer of glucose, consists predominantly of α-1,6-glucosidic linkages, and several dextran-hydrolyzing enzymes have been found (1Khalikova E. Susi P. Korpela T.

Isomalto-dextranase (α-1,6-d-glucan isomalto-hydrolase; EC 3.2.1.94) was found in Gram-positive soil bacteria, Arthrobacter globiformis T6 (NRRL B-4425) (2Sawai T. Toriyama K. Yano K.

AgIMD also catalyzes transglycosylation, and the enzymatic synthesis of some oligosaccharides using AgIMD has been reported (6Kim Y.-K. Tsumuraya Y. Sakano Y.

The most notable feature of AgIMD is that the primary structure of the enzyme is homologous to those of α-galactosidases and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, despite the fact that AgIMDhydrolyzes a polymer of glucose. AgIMD is classified as a member of glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 27 in the CAZy database (7Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D490-D495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Another enzyme family, GH36, comprises mainly α-galactosidases and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases. The three-dimensional structures of the two families, GH27 and GH36, share a common structural core (8Dagnall B.H. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H.

It is interesting to note that GH31 also has a similar catalytic (β/α)8 barrel domain, and the three families, GH27, GH31, and GH36, are categorized into clan GH-D. The main GH31 members function as α-glucosidases and α-xylosidases (11Lovering A.L. Lee S.S. Kim Y.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.

Therefore, the structure-function relationships of clan GH-D is complicated, and the study of AgIMD is useful for better understanding of clan GH-D. In addition to the unique phylogenetic position of the catalytic domain, AgIMD has another intriguing architectural feature belonging to carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 35. The CBM35 domains have been shown to share a highly similar fold, although there is considerable diversity in the biological functions of the enzymes possessing CBM35 (14Montanier C. van Bueren A.L.

We have previously constructed the expression system of AgIMD in Escherichia coli (16Tonozuka T. Suzuki S. Ikehara Y. Mizuno M. Kim Y.-K. Nishikawa A. Sakano Y. Heterologous production and characterization of Arthrobacter globiformis T6 isomalto-dextranase.J. Appl. Glycosci. 2004; 51: 27-32Crossref Google Scholar), and the enzyme has been crystallized (17Akita M. Mizuno M. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Matsui H. Hidaka Y. Hatada Y. Ito S. Horikoshi K. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray study of isomalto-dextranase from Arthrobacter globiformis.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 572-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the crystal structure of AgIMD and compared it with those of GH27, GH31, and other related enzymes. An expression plasmid, pETG2Dsp−, which is a derivative of pET3a(+), has been previously obtained (16Tonozuka T. Suzuki S. Ikehara Y. Mizuno M. Kim Y.-K. Nishikawa A. Sakano Y. Heterologous production and characterization of Arthrobacter globiformis T6 isomalto-dextranase.J. Appl. Glycosci. 2004; 51: 27-32Crossref Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of AgIMD, an expression plasmid of His-tagged AgIMD was constructed. pETG2Dsp− was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the fragment was ligated into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET28a(+), resulting in plasmid pET28a-AgIMD. Mutant enzymes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). To construct expression plasmids for mutants, oligonucleotides 5′-C TGG TAC GAG GAC GGA AGG GCC GCG AAT ATT GGG CAG GTC-3′ (for D207A), 5′-TCC TGG TAC GAG GAC GGA AGG GCC GCG GCC ATC GGG CAG G-3′ (for D207A/N209A); and 5′-GAA GTT TCG CTC GTA GCG CCG CAT ATG TTC-3′ (for M243A) and their complementary strands were used as primers (mutated amino acid residues are underlined). All the constructs used were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET28a-AgIMD were grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing kanamycin (50 μg ml−1) to A600 = 0.6–0.8, and then induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.1 mm; the incubation was then continued for 18 h at 20 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. The cells and supernatants of the cultures were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant obtained was applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). After washing the column with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The active fractions were collected, and the buffer was replaced by 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The His tag was cleaved by thrombin (1 unit per 1 mg of AgIMD) at 20 °C for 16 h and applied onto a Ni-NTA column with the same procedure, and the flow-through fraction was collected. The AgIMD mutants were expressed and purified in a manner identical to that used for the wild-type enzyme. The enzyme was crystallized at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, where 1 μl of AgIMD (30 mg ml−1) was mixed with the same volume of well solution containing 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 50 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate. For phase determination, the crystal was first transferred for 1 min to a solution containing 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6) and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, and was then transferred for 48 h to a solution containing 10 mm lead(II) acetate, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6), and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. The obtained crystal was transferred to a cryo-solution of 20% glycerol, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6), and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. Crystals of AgIMD-isomaltose and AgIMD-panose were obtained by soaking in well solutions containing 30% (w/v) isomaltose and panose, respectively, for a few seconds. The solution containing the ligand also acted as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected on the beamlines AR-NW12A and AR-NE3A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). All data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The initial phases were calculated from the single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set using the AutoSol program in the PHENIX suite (19Terwilliger T.C. Adams P.D. Read R.J. McCoy A.J.

Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activity of AgIMD was measured as described (16Tonozuka T. Suzuki S. Ikehara Y. Mizuno M. Kim Y.-K. Nishikawa A. Sakano Y. Heterologous production and characterization of Arthrobacter globiformis T6 isomalto-dextranase.J. Appl. Glycosci. 2004; 51: 27-32Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity of dextran T2000 (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) was measured in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.3) for 30 min at 30 °C. Preparation and measurement of the cleavage of p-nitrophenyl α-d-isomaltoside (pNP-IM) was also performed as described (16Tonozuka T. Suzuki S. Ikehara Y. Mizuno M. Kim Y.-K. Nishikawa A. Sakano Y. Heterologous production and characterization of Arthrobacter globiformis T6 isomalto-dextranase.J. Appl. Glycosci. 2004; 51: 27-32Crossref Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using the molar extinction coefficient (1 mg/ml = 2.487) calculated by the ExPASy ProtParam server. Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The recombinant AgIMD was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography. The N-terminal His tag was then removed by thrombin cleavage, and the protein was crystallized. The crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group I41 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion technique with a crystal soaked in lead acetate solution. A coarse model of AgIMD was initially built with a 2.5-Å resolution dataset, and the model was further refined using a 1.44-Å resolution dataset (Table 1). The 2Fo − Fc electron density contoured at 1 σ showed continuous density for almost all the main chain atoms, but the N-terminal segment, GSHMATAVTARPGV, was not visible. The Ramachandran plot calculated with the Molprobity server shows that only one residue, Asp-312, was identified as an outlier. Asp-312 is one of the key amino acid residues in the active site, and the electron density for this residue was well defined. The structure of AgIMD consists of three domains, designated domain A (residues 21–367), domain C (368–466), and domain D (467–606), as well as an extra loop comprising residues 11–20 in the N terminus (Fig. 1A). Domain A is composed of a (β/α)8-barrel, and domain C is made up of an antiparallel β-structure. This two-domain architecture is commonly found in GH27 enzymes (25Ichinose H. Fujimoto Z. Honda M.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the AgIMD-isomaltose complex is almost isomorphous with that of the unliganded form, and clear electron density maps (Fo − Fc, 3 σ) were obtained for two isomaltose molecules (Fig. 1, B and C). One of the molecules is seen in the active site, and the other molecule is bound to domain D (Fig. 1A). The active site structure of AgIMD-isomaltose was compared with that of unliganded AgIMD. GH27 enzymes employ a retaining mechanism, and two Asp residues act as catalytic residues (31Hart D.O. He S. Chany 2nd, C.J. Withers S.G. Sims P.F. Sinnott M.L. Brumer 3rd, H.

The structural homology with GH27 α-galactosidases indicates that Asp-197 and Asp-265 are identified as a nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively. Based on the position of the catalytic residues, isomaltose is bound to subsites −2 and −1 in AgIMD-isomaltose, and the two glucose residues are labeled Glc −2 and Glc −1 (Fig. 2A). The binding of isomaltose is accompanied by conformational changes in Glu-81, Val-242, and Met-243. The side chain of Glu-81 in unliganded AgIMD points away from the active site, whereas atoms OE1 and OE2 of Glu-81 in AgIMD-isomaltose form hydrogen bonds with atoms O6 and O4 of Glc-2, respectively. Also, the main chain atom O of Val-242 is not oriented toward the active site in unliganded AgIMD, whereas in the AgIMD-isomaltose, significant conformational differences of Val-242 and Met-243 are observed, and atom O of Val-242 interacts with atoms O2 of Glc −1 via a water molecule. We also determined the crystal structure of AgIMD complexed with a trisaccharide, panose (Glc-α(1→6)-Glc-α(1→4)-Glc). AgIMD hydrolyzes panose, albeit inefficiently, to produce isomaltose and glucose (4Takayanagi T. Okada G. Chiba S.

While previous studies focus on measuring aggregate levels of betrayal aversion, the connection between an individual's own betrayal aversion and other individually varying factors, including risk preferences, are currently unexplored. This paper develops a new task to elicit an individual's level of betrayal aversion that can then be compared to individual characteristics. We demonstrate the feasibility of our new task and show that our aggregate individual results are consistent with previous studies. We then use this classification to ask whether betrayal aversion is correlated with risk aversion. While we find risk aversion and betrayal aversion have no significant relationship, we do observe that risk aversion is correlated with non-social risk preferences, but not the social, betrayal related, risk component of the new task."

Methods Aqueous humor was collected from 22 eyes after femtosecond laser pretreatment and from 22 eyes at the beginning of routine cataract surgery. The levels of 45 inflammation-related mediators were measured using multiplex fluorescent bead-based immunoassays. Laser flare photometry was measured preoperatively and at 1 day, 7 days and 30 days postoperatively. Results Compared with the control group, the femtosecond laser treatment group showed significantly higher aqueous humor levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), interleukin (IL)-1ra and IL-18, and significantly lower aqueous humor levels of IL-9, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, eotaxin and TNF-β. Postoperative aqueous flare was significantly greater in the manual cataract surgery group at 1 day (p<0.001), 7days (p<0.001) and 30 days (p = 0.002).No correlation was found between the analyzed mediators and the aqueous flare values. Conclusions The expression profiles of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and the correlations of these profiles with the in vivo inflammatory indexes for patients undergoing cataract surgery with femtosecond laser pretreatment were identified. Our data indicate a disturbance of postoperative inflammation response after femtosecond laser treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2146726380,"Although the acoustic variability of speech is often described as a problem for phonetic recognition, there is little research examining acoustic-phonetic variability over time. We measured naturally occurring acoustic variability in speech production at nine specific time points (three per day over three days) to examine daily change in production as well as change across days for citation-form vowels. Productions of seven different vowels (/EE/, /IH/, /AH/, /UH/, /AE/, /OO/, /EH/) were recorded at 9AM, 3PM and 9PM over the course of each testing day on three different days, every other day, over a span of five days. Results indicate significant systematic change in F1 and F0 values over the course of a day for each of the seven vowels recorded, whereas F2 and F3 remained stable. Despite this systematic change within a day, however, talkers did not show significant changes in F0, F1, F2, and F3 between days, demonstrating that speakers are capable of producing vowels with great reliability over days without any extrinsic feedback besides their own auditory monitoring. The data show that in spite of substantial day-to-day variability in the specific listening and speaking experiences of these participants and thus exposure to different acoustic tokens of speech, there is a high degree of internal precision and consistency for the production of citation form vowels."
https://openalex.org/W1278418250,"Cohort studies and clinical trials may involve multiple events. When occurrence of one of these events prevents the observance of another, the situation is called “competing risks”. A useful measure in such studies is the cumulative incidence of an event, which is useful in evaluating interventions or assessing disease prognosis. When outcomes in such studies are subject to misclassification, the resulting cumulative incidence estimates may be biased. In this work, we study the mechanism of bias in cumulative incidence estimation due to outcome misclassification. We show that even moderate levels of misclassification can lead to seriously biased estimates in a frequently unpredictable manner. We propose an easy to use estimator for correcting this bias that is uniformly consistent. Extensive simulations suggest that this method leads to unbiased estimates in practical settings. The proposed method is useful, both in settings where misclassification probabilities are known by historical data or can be estimated by other means, and for performing sensitivity analyses when the misclassification probabilities are not precisely known."
https://openalex.org/W1892103387,"Behçet’s disease (BD), a multi-organ inflammatory disorder, is associated with the presence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-B*51 allele in many ethnic groups. The possible antigen involvement of the major histocompatibility complex class I chain related gene A transmembrane (MICA-TM) nonapeptide (AAAAAIFVI) has been reported in BD symptomatic patients. This peptide has also been detected in HLA-A*26:01 positive patients. To investigate the link of BD with these two specific HLA alleles, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied on the MICA-TM nonapeptide binding to the two BD-associated HLA alleles in comparison with the two non-BD-associated HLA alleles (B*35:01 and A*11:01). The MD simulations were applied on the four HLA/MICA-TM peptide complexes in aqueous solution. As a result, stabilization for the incoming MICA-TM was found to be predominantly contributed from van der Waals interactions. The P2/P3 residue close to the N-terminal and the P9 residue at the C-terminal of the MICA-TM nonapeptide served as the anchor for the peptide accommodated at the binding groove of the BD associated HLAs. The MM/PBSA free energy calculation predicted a stronger binding of the HLA/peptide complexes for the BD-associated HLA alleles than for the non-BD-associated ones, with a ranked binding strength of B*51:01 > B*35:01 and A*26:01 > A*11:01. Thus, the HLAs associated with BD pathogenesis expose the binding efficiency with the MICA-TM nonapeptide tighter than the non-associated HLA alleles. In addition, the residues 70, 73, 99, 146, 147 and 159 of the two BD-associated HLAs provided the conserved interaction for the MICA-TM peptide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1231936934,"In otariids, mother's recognition by pups is essential to their survival since females nurse exclusively their own young and can be very aggressive towards non-kin. Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella, come ashore to breed and form dense colonies. During the 4-month lactation period, females alternate foraging trips at sea with suckling period ashore. On each return to the colony, females and pups first use vocalizations to find each other among several hundred conspecifics and olfaction is used as a final check. Such vocal identification has to be highly efficient. In this present study, we investigated the components of the individual vocal signature used by pups to identify their mothers by performing playback experiments on pups with synthetic signals. We thus tested the efficiency of this individual vocal signature by performing propagation tests and by testing pups at different playback distances. Pups use both amplitude and frequency modulations to identify their mother's voice, as well as the energy spectrum. Propagation tests showed that frequency modulations propagated reliably up to 64m, whereas amplitude modulations and spectral content greatly were highly degraded for distances over 8m. Playback on pups at different distances suggested that the individual identification is a two-step process: at long range, pups identified first the frequency modulation pattern of their mother's calls, and other components of the vocal signature at closer range. The individual vocal recognition system developed by Antarctic fur seals is well adapted to face the main constraint of finding kin in a crowd."

An alteration in the number of NMDARs at the postsynaptic membrane, which may be achieved via the regulation of NMDAR trafficking at postsynaptic sites, is an important molecular mechanism that underlies changes in synaptic efficacy in NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission. Notably, the insertion or internalization of NMDARs at the postsynaptic membrane is tightly regulated, both during development and in response to synaptic activity and sensory experience (3Lau C.G.

Class II myosin includes motors that constitute the thick filaments of smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscles. Members of this class were initially referred to as “conventional myosin” largely because myosin II isoforms are present in these tissues and were thus the first contractile proteins investigated (12Sellers J.R.

However, a more recent study demonstrated that myosin IIb, a cytoplasmic myosin II that is particularly enriched in the central nervous system, shares a number of features with “unconventional” myosin isoforms, which suggests that myosin IIb exhibits differential functions compared with its conventional myosin II counterparts. This suggestion received substantial supporting evidence from subsequent studies (12Sellers J.R. Myosins: a diverse superfamily.Biochim. Biophys.

As a result of its short coil-coil domain and its lack of a global tail domain, however, it is unlikely that myosin IIb is directly employed in the loading and transport of NMDARs. Therefore, the potential role of myosin IIb in NMDAR trafficking remains unclear. Cofilin is an actin-binding protein that can regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics and, in turn, intracellular receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity (12Sellers J.R.

A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9540) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that F-actin polymerization is not only required for the stabilization of early LTP (16Wylie S.R. Chantler P.D. Separate but linked functions of conventional myosins modulate adhesion and neurite outgrowth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) but also supports the eventual capture of plasticity-related proteins involved in the stabilization of late phase LTP (27Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). NMDAR combined with autophosphorylated CaMKII translocates to the postsynaptic membrane following exposure to LTP-inducing stimuli, including PKC activation and θ burst stimulation (TBS) (7Yan J.Z.

Importantly, this NMDAR-CaMKII complex is proposed to serve as a “seed” for anchoring other plasticity-related proteins, including AMPA receptors (AMPARs) (28Ramachandran B. Frey J.U.

Brain. 2013; 6: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesize that the myosin IIb-dependent regulation of actin dynamics is crucial for NMDAR trafficking during synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we aimed to identify the potential role of myosin IIb in NMDAR trafficking during synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that the knockdown of myosin IIb or the pharmacological blockade of myosin IIb activity suppresses the potentiation in postsynaptic NMDAR expression and function induced by PKC activation or TBS. We further demonstrated that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)- and myosin IIb-dependent actin reorganization is required for NMDAR trafficking. These findings facilitate the elucidation of a mechanical framework for understanding NMDAR trafficking associated with synaptic plasticity. The protocols for animal care and use were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee at Nanjing Medical University. Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 13–18 days, were anesthetized with ethyl ether and decapitated. Their entire brains were then quickly removed. Three hundred fifty-μm-thick brain slices were cut using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Germany) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid that contained 126 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.25 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 26 mmol/liter NaHCO3, and 20 mmol/liter glucose at pH 7.4, which was gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The fresh slices were incubated in a chamber with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid, followed by recovery at 34 °C for 1 h. The recovered hippocampal slices were used for electrophysiological recordings. Conventional whole-cell recordings were obtained with patch pipettes that contained 132.5 mmol/liter cesium gluconate, 17.5 mmol/liter CsCl, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 4 mmol/liter ATP, and 5 mmol/liter QX-314 with the pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. LTP was induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 0.5 μm) or TBS (10 bursts of 4,100-Hz single pulses with a 200-ms interburst interval) at Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses. The data were collected with pClamp version 9.2 software and analyzed using Clampfit version 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). The homogenized slices were stored in cold 0.32 m sucrose that contained 1 mmol/liter HEPES, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 20 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmol/liter β-phosphoglycerol, 0.2 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/liter p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 7.4 in the presence of the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 g/ml aprotinin, 5 g/ml leupeptin, 5 g/ml pepstatin A, and 16 g/ml benzamidine. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and 200–400 μl of the resulting supernatant was collected as the total protein fraction. The remainder was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min, and its supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of hypotonic buffer (in the presence of protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer that contained 75 mm KCl and 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES and homogenized three times (10 s × 3, intertrial interval of 10 s). This fraction was referred to as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (TIF). The TIF was used instead of the classical postsynaptic density preparation because of the limited amount of hippocampal slices (7Yan J.Z. Xu Z. Ren S.Q. Hu B. Yao W. Wang S.H. Liu S.Y. Lu W. Protein kinase C promotes N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor trafficking by indirectly triggering calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25187-25200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein content was measured using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Twenty μg of protein were boiled and separated with 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in 3% (w/v) BSA (fraction V) with TBST (0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After five washes with TBST for 30 min, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies and washed again using the same protocol. The ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare) were added, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Tubulin was employed as the internal reference to normalize the volume of the samples. The mean intensity of each individual band was calculated after background value subtraction, followed by normalization to the mean intensity of the loading tubulin band for each sample in the same lane. Thus, tubulin intensity was normalized as 1, and the relative values of other samples were determined. Subsequently, these normalized values were normalized again to the mean intensity of the loading control band for each sample. The control of each experiment was thus normalized as 1, and the relative values of other groups under various treatments were determined. The shRNA sequence that targeted the rat isoform of MyH10 and the sequence for the MyH10-specific shRNA was gatcaaagttggccgagat. This sequence was subsequently cloned into plasmids for packaging into recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV1) particles constructed with rAAV2 coat proteins (rAAV2/1). The virus titer was 1–1.5 × 1012 genome copies/ml, and the EGFP rAAV2/1 virus was a generous gift from Biomiao Biological Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Rats at 4–5 days after birth were anesthetized with 1% trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate and fixed in a stereotaxic frame that contained a mouse/neonatal rat adaptor (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). The dorsal hippocampus region in the hemisphere was injected with 5 μl of virus at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. The needle was maintained in place for an additional 5 min after virus injection. The rats used for whole-cell recording were 13–14 days of age, whereas the rats used for Western blot were 17–18 days of age. Semiquantification was performed using ImageJ, and the results were normalized by the β-tubulin level and expressed as -fold changes compared with the control. Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18–19 Sprague-Dawley rats and dissociated with trypsin, as described previously (30Malinow R. Madison D.V. Tsien R.W.

Neurons were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine and cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, glutaMAXTM, and β-mercaptoethanol. On days 17 and 18, the neurons were treated with drugs (rAAV2/1 virus was added 1 week earlier) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at −20 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS in a shaker and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) without Triton X-100 at room temperature for 2 h. The detection and secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% fetal calf serum with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed as described previously, and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After the cells were washed, glass coverslips were fixed with gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Nail polish was subsequently added around the glass coverslips. The experiment was conducted in the dark when the secondary antibodies were used. All immunofluorescence images were analyzed using Fiji software (National Institutes of Health). The statistical analyses were performed on a number of regions of interest (ROIs) that contained numerous spines from various cultures. The colocalization was calculated using the Coloc 2 plugin in Fiji following the instructions provided on the Coloc 2 Web site. The Pearson r values obtained from the plugin were automatically selected as the “colocalization values”. Furthermore, the n values indicate n different images, and in every image, one ROI was selected. The ROIs comprised random areas of a 50-μm dendritic shaft located ∼30 μm from the cell body. The MLCK floxed mice were generated as briefly described elsewhere (32He W.Q. Peng Y.J. Zhang W.C. Lv N. Tang J. Chen C. Zhang C.H. Gao S. Chen H.Q. Zhi G. Feil R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Gao X.

All population data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Paired sample t tests were used to assess statistical significance, and independent sample t tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed for comparisons between multiple groups. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Before we investigate the potential role of myosin IIb in NMDAR trafficking, we must establish a reliable model of NMDAR trafficking at postsynaptic sites. It has been reported that PKC activation promotes NMDAR trafficking to the cell surface (3Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. NMDA receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V.L. Zukin R.S. Protein kinase C modulates NMDA receptor trafficking and gating.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether PKC activation triggers NMDAR insertion and subsequent enhancement of NMDAR function at postsynaptic sites. Thus, we examined the effect of the PKC agonist PMA (0.5 μm) on the postsynaptic localization, expression, and function of NMDARs. Using PSD-95 as a postsynaptic marker, we first performed an immunofluorescence assay with hippocampal cultured cells to determine the influence of PMA (0.5 μm) on the postsynaptic localization of NMDARs. The postsynaptic localization of GluN1 was determined by quantifying the degree of colocalization of GluN1 and PSD-95 using a C-terminal antibody against GluN1 under membrane-permeable conditions. We identified an increased GluN1 density at synapses following 15 min of PMA (0.5 μm) treatment (1.34 ± 0.01; n = 19, from 19 ROIs imaged in 19 neurons from eight independent cultures; p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA; Fig. 1, A1 and A2). To further examine these findings following PKC activation, we performed a Western blot assay of the TIF of hippocampal sliced tissue (34Lisman J.E. Zhabotinsky A.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7609-7613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We identified a significant increase in the postsynaptic GluN1 expression (1.30 ± 0.07; n = 6, from six samples of 36 independent animals; p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA; Fig. 1, B1 and B2). These findings support the notion that PKC activation promotes NMDAR trafficking to postsynaptic sites. To further determine whether this enhancement in the level of postsynaptic NMDARs leads to a corresponding enhancement in NMDAR function, we examined the effects of PKC activation on evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA EPSCs) in CA1 hippocampal neurons from acute brain slices. CA1 pyramidal cells were held at +40 mV, which allows relief of the Mg2+ blockage of NMDARs; NMDA EPSCs were subsequently recorded under a whole-cell patch clamp configuration. We identified an increase in NMDA EPSCs after 20 min of PMA treatment (PMA, 1.91 ± 0.33; n = 6, from six whole-cell recordings of five independent animals; p < 0.01, paired sample t test; Fig. 1, C1 and C2). This enhancement of NMDA EPSCs was largely attenuated via the application of the SNARE-dependent exocytosis blocker TeTx (composed of a heavy chain (100 kDa) and a light chain (57 kDa) connected through an interchain disulfide bond, 0.1 μm) in the recording pipette solution (TeTx + PMA, 1.13 ± 0.11; n = 6, from six whole-cell recordings of five independent animals; p > 0.05, paired sample t test). These findings suggest that the insertion of new NMDARs into the postsynaptic membrane accounts for this enhancement in NMDAR function. Myosin IIb has been identified in the NMDA NRC (9Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Proteomic analysis of NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), which suggests that this actin-dependent motor may be involved in NRC trafficking between the postsynaptic membrane and intracellular compartments or the facilitation of NRC movements within the postsynaptic membrane (11Shen"
https://openalex.org/W1849637625,"mRNA translation into proteins is highly regulated, but the role of mRNA isoforms, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and genetic variants remains poorly understood. mRNA levels on polysomes have been shown to correlate well with expressed protein levels, pointing to polysomal loading as a critical factor. To study regulation and genetic factors of protein translation we measured levels and allelic ratios of mRNAs and ncRNAs (including microRNAs) in lymphoblast cell lines (LCL) and in polysomal fractions. We first used targeted assays to measure polysomal loading of mRNA alleles, confirming reported genetic effects on translation of OPRM1 and NAT1, and detecting no effect of rs1045642 (3435C>T) in ABCB1 (MDR1) on polysomal loading while supporting previous results showing increased mRNA turnover of the 3435T allele. Use of high-throughput sequencing of complete transcript profiles (RNA-Seq) in three LCLs revealed significant differences in polysomal loading of individual RNA classes and isoforms. Correlated polysomal distribution between protein-coding and non-coding RNAs suggests interactions between them. Allele-selective polysome recruitment revealed strong genetic influence for multiple RNAs, attributable either to differential expression of RNA isoforms or to differential loading onto polysomes, the latter defining a direct genetic effect on translation. Genes identified by different allelic RNA ratios between cytosol and polysomes were enriched with published expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) affecting RNA functions, and associations with clinical phenotypes. Polysomal RNA-Seq combined with allelic ratio analysis provides a powerful approach to study polysomal RNA recruitment and regulatory variants affecting protein translation."
https://openalex.org/W1870780471,"X-linked primate-specific melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) is a human androgen receptor (AR) coactivator and proto-oncogene expressed at low levels in normal human reproductive tract tissues and at higher levels in castration-resistant prostate cancer where it is required for androgen-dependent cell growth. In this report, we show that MAGE-A11 is targeted for degradation by human p14-ARF, a tumor suppressor expressed from an alternative reading frame of the p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor INK4a/ARF gene. MAGE-A11 degradation by the proteasome was mediated by an interaction with p14-ARF and was independent of lysine ubiquitination. A dose-dependent inverse relationship between MAGE-A11 and p14-ARF correlated with p14-ARF inhibition of the MAGE-A11-induced increase in androgen-dependent AR transcriptional activity and constitutive activity of a splice variant-like AR. Reciprocal stabilization between MAGE-A11 and AR did not protect against degradation promoted by p14-ARF. p14-ARF prevented MAGE-A11 interaction with the E2F1 oncoprotein and inhibited the MAGE-A11-induced increase in E2F1 transcriptional activity. Post-translational down-regulation of MAGE-A11 promoted by p14-ARF was independent of HDM2, the human homologue of mouse double minute 2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibited by p14-ARF. However, MAGE-A11 had a stabilizing effect on HDM2 in the absence or presence of p14-ARF and cooperated with HDM2 to increase E2F1 transcriptional activity in the absence of p14-ARF. We conclude that degradation of MAGE-A11 promoted by the human p14-ARF tumor suppressor contributes to low levels of MAGE-A11 in nontransformed cells and that higher levels of MAGE-A11 associated with low p14-ARF increase AR and E2F1 transcriptional activity and promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Rat and mouse AR Ala33 evolved to Val33 in human AR NH2-terminal sequence 23FQNLFQSVREV33, a sequence change required for human AR to interact with MAGE-A11 (15Liu Q. Su S. Blackwelder A.J. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. Gain in transcriptional activity by primate-specific coevolution of melanoma antigen-A11 and its interaction site in androgen receptor.J. Biol.

However, neither mouse nor rat AR Ala33 or human AR Val33 is required for the FXXLF motif-mediated androgen-dependent AR NH2- and COOH-terminal interaction. These findings suggest that the increase in human AR transcriptional activity resulting from the coactivator activity of MAGE-A11 evolved more recently among primates than evolution of the androgen-dependent AR NH2- and COOH-terminal interaction. In addition to AR coregulator activity, MAGE-A11 has functions that directly impact the cell cycle and require complex regulatory control. MAGE-A11 interacts with and increases the transcriptional activity of E2F1, one of the most important transcription factors and oncoproteins that promotes unscheduled entry into S phase of the cell cycle (5Su S. Minges J.T. Grossman G. Blackwelder A.J. Mohler J.L. Wilson E.M. Proto-oncogene activity of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) regulates retinoblastoma-related p107 and E2F1.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24809-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The increase in E2F1 activity by MAGE-A11 is similar to the effects of E1A, an adenovirus early protein that transforms cells (16Liu X. Marmorstein R. Structure of the retinoblastoma protein bound to adenovirus E1A reveals the molecular basis for viral oncoprotein inactivation of a tumor suppressor.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2711-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ability of MAGE-A11 to increase AR and E2F1 transcriptional activity suggests that MAGE-A11 links AR to cell cycle progression and supports the concept that cancer cells continue to grow through the increased expression and activity of oncoproteins such as E2F1 and MAGE-A11. The unrestrained growth of cancer cells also depends on deregulation of tumor suppressors, such as human p14-ARF (ARF, alternative reading frame) and p53, proteins that protect normal cells from tumorigenesis by arresting the cell cycle or inducing apoptosis. ARF derives from the INK4a/ARF locus in an alternative reading frame by alternate promoter usage and splicing that differs from the p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that is more often mutated in cancer (17Quelle D.E.

A primary function of ARF is to bind and inhibit HDM2 (human homologue of mouse double minute 2), an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of p53 (23Kamijo T. Zindy F.

Inhibition of HDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by ARF increases p53 levels, which induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The inhibitory activity of ARF that promotes p53 accumulation requires a unique ARF exon 1B region (22Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. The INK4A/ARF locus and its two gene products.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Loss of ARF or p53 activity in cancer cells allows cellular proto-oncogenes such as E2F1 and MAGE-A11 to promote uncontrolled cancer cell growth and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this report we provide evidence that human ARF promotes the proteasomal degradation of MAGE-A11 independent of HDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase or lysine ubiquitination. ARF inhibited the ability of MAGE-A11 to stabilize and stimulate AR or E2F1 transcriptional activity but did not overcome a stabilizing effect of MAGE-A11 on HDM2. The findings suggest that ARF maintains normal low levels of MAGE-A11 to limit cell proliferation and preserve the nontransformed phenotype, whereas low levels of ARF in prostate cancer cells contribute to higher levels of MAGE-A11 that promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2112881401,"Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod) stocks in the Barents Sea are currently at levels not seen since the 1950s. Causes for the population increase last century, and understanding of whether such large numbers will be maintained in the future, are unclear. To explore this, we digitised and interrogated historical cod catch and diet datasets from the Barents Sea. Seventeen years of catch data and 12 years of prey data spanning 1930–1959 cover unexplored spatial and temporal ranges, and importantly capture the end of a previous warm period, when temperatures were similar to those currently being experienced. This study aimed to evaluate cod catch per unit effort and prey frequency in relation to spatial, temporal and environmental variables. There was substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity in catches through the time series. The highest catches were generally in the 1930s and 1940s, although at some localities more cod were recorded late in the 1950s. Generalized Additive Models showed that environmental, spatial and temporal variables are all valuable descriptors of cod catches, with the highest occurring from 15–45°E longitude and 73–77°N latitude, at bottom temperatures between 2 and 4°C and at depths between 150 and 250 m. Cod diets were highly variable during the study period, with frequent changes in the relative frequencies of different prey species, particularly Mallotus villosus (capelin). Environmental variables were particularly good at describing the importance of capelin and Clupea harengus (herring) in the diet. These new analyses support existing knowledge about how the ecology of the region is controlled by climatic variability. When viewed in combination with more recent data, these historical relationships will be valuable in forecasting the future of Barents Sea fisheries, and in understanding how environments and ecosystems may respond."
https://openalex.org/W2100238751,"Vitamin E (VitE) only prevented cardiovascular diseases in some patients and the mechanisms remain unknown. VitE levels can be affected by aging and gender. We hypothesize that age and gender can influence VitE’s cardioprotective effect. Mice were divided into 4 groups according to age and gender, and each group of mice were divided into a control group and a VitE group. The mice were administered water or VitE for 21 days; Afterward, the cardiac function and myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were measured after myocardial ischemia reperfusion(MI/R). VitE may significantly improved cardiac function in young male mice and aged female mice by enhancing ERK1/2 activity and reducing JNK activity. Enhanced expression of HSP90 and Bcl-2 were also seen in young male mice. No changes in cardiac function and cardiac proteins were detected in aged male mice and VitE was even liked to exert a reverse effect in cardiac function in young mice by enhancing JNK activity and reducing Bcl-2 expression. Those effects were in accordance with the changes of myocardial infarction size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in each group of mice. VitE may reduce MI/R injury by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis in young male mice and aged female mice but not in aged male mice. VitE was possibly harmful for young female mice, shown as increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI/R. Thus, we speculated that the efficacy of VitE in cardiac protection was associated with age and gender."
https://openalex.org/W2134987363,"Glomerular podocytes are highly differentiated cells that are key components of the kidney filtration units. The podocyte cytoskeleton builds the basis for the dynamic podocyte cytoarchitecture and plays a central role for proper podocyte function. Recent studies implicate that immunosuppressive agents including the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus have a protective role directly on the stability of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, a potential stabilization of microtubules by everolimus has not been studied so far.To elucidate mechanisms underlying mTOR-inhibitor mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements, we carried out microarray gene expression studies to identify target genes and corresponding pathways in response to everolimus. We analyzed the effect of everolimus in a puromycin aminonucleoside experimental in vitro model of podocyte injury.Upon treatment with puromycin aminonucleoside, microarray analysis revealed gene clusters involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, migration and extracellular matrix composition to be affected. Everolimus was capable of protecting podocytes from injury, both on transcriptional and protein level. Rescued genes included tubulin beta 2B class IIb (TUBB2B) and doublecortin domain containing 2 (DCDC2), both involved in microtubule structure formation in neuronal cells but not identified in podocytes so far. Validating gene expression data, Western-blot analysis in cultured podocytes demonstrated an increase of TUBB2B and DCDC2 protein after everolimus treatment, and immunohistochemistry in healthy control kidneys confirmed a podocyte-specific expression. Interestingly, Tubb2bbrdp/brdp mice revealed a delay in glomerular podocyte development as showed by podocyte-specific markers Wilm's tumour 1, Podocin, Nephrin and Synaptopodin.Taken together, our study suggests that off-target, non-immune mediated effects of the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus on the podocyte cytoskeleton might involve regulation of microtubules, revealing a potential novel role of TUBB2B and DCDC2 in glomerular podocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W1893852657,"Female investment in large eggs increases the demand for fatty acids, which are allocated for yolk production. Since the biosynthetic pathway leading to fatty acids uses the same precursors used in the formation of polyketides, allocation trade-offs are expected to emerge. Therefore, egg production should constrain the investment in chemical defenses based on polyketides, such as benzoquinones. We tested this hypothesis using the harvestman Acutiosoma longipes, which produces large eggs and releases benzoquinones as chemical defense. We predicted that the amount of secretion released by ovigerous females (OFs) would be smaller than that of non-ovigerous females (NOF). We also conducted a series of bioassays in the field and in the laboratory to test whether egg production renders OFs more vulnerable to predation. OFs produce less secretion than NOFs, which is congruent with the hypothesis that egg production constrains the investment in chemical defenses. Results of the bioassays show that the secretion released by OFs is less effective in deterring potential predators (ants and spiders) than the secretion released by NOFs. In conclusion, females allocate resources to chemical defenses in a way that preserves a primary biological function related to reproduction. However, the trade-off between egg and secretion production makes OFs vulnerable to predators. We suggest that egg production is a critical moment in the life of harvestman females, representing perhaps the highest cost of reproduction in the group."
https://openalex.org/W2117220199,"This longitudinal study of nine children examined two issues concerning infantile amnesia: the time at which memories for events experienced before the age of 3–4 years disappear from consciousness and whether this timing of memory loss is related to the development of specific aspects of episodic and autobiographical memory. This study followed children from infancy to early childhood and examined the central role of three verbal–cognitive milestones related to autobiographical memory: the age at which children begin to report autobiographical memories using the past tense (Milestone 1); the age at which they begin to verbally acknowledge past events (Milestone 2); and the age at which they begin to spontaneously use memory-related verbs (Milestone 3). As expected, memories of events that occurred before 3–4 years of age were affected by infantile amnesia. Achievement of these milestones followed almost the same developmental progression: Milestone 1 (1 year; 10 months (1;10) to 3 years; 4 months (3;4)) was followed by Milestones 2 (3;1 to 4;0) and 3 (3;5 to 4;4). Milestone 2 was typically related to the onset of infantile amnesia, whereas Milestone 1 occurred during the period for which the children became amnesic as they aged. These data suggest that linguistic meta-cognitive awareness of personal memory is the key feature in infantile amnesia."
https://openalex.org/W2133365382,"The aim of this study was to enhance the understanding of cultural and sample differences in the assessment of attachment by examining the factor structure of the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R). The ECR-R is a self-report measure of adult romantic attachment dimensions. The present study used a Danish sample with the purpose of addressing limitations in previous studies, such as the lack of diversity in cultural background, restricted sample characteristics, and poorly fitting structure models. Participants consisted of 253 parents of children between the ages of 7 and 12 years, 53% being mothers. The parents completed the paper version of the questionnaire. Confirmatory Factor Analyses were carried out to determine whether theoretically and empirically established models including one and two factors would also provide adequate fits in a Danish sample. A previous study using the original ECR suggested that Scandinavian samples may best be described using a five-factor solution. Our results indicated that the one- and two-factor models of the ECR-R did not fit the data well. Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed a five-factor model. Our study provides evidence that further investigation is needed to establish which model may provide the best model fit in the Scandinavian countries."
https://openalex.org/W2162278049,"Several studies and a recent meta-analysis have suggested that previous Cesarean section may increase the risk of stillbirth in a subsequent pregnancy. Given the high rates of Cesarean section in contemporary obstetric practice, this is of considerable public health importance. We sought to evaluate the potential that this association is the result of residual confounding bias.A large perinatal database (Alberta Perinatal Health Project) was searched to identify a matched set of first and second births from the years 1992-2006. Data on pregnancy outcomes, demographics and potential confounding factors were obtained.The cohort was comprised of 98538 matched first and second births. Multivariate analysis did not reveal an association between previous Cesarean section and stillbirth, OR = 1.38 (0.98, 1.93). Restricting the analysis to a low risk group further attenuated the association, OR = .99 (0.62, 1.52). Analysis of the risk by indication for Cesarean section found that the risk was not increased for previous dystocia, OR = .91 (0.53, 1.55) nor for breech presentation, OR = 1.06 (0.50, 2.28) but only for other indications including non reassuring fetal status and fetal distress, OR = 1.96 (1.29, 2.98).The results of our cohort analysis suggest that previous Cesarean section does not cause an increased risk of stillbirth."
https://openalex.org/W1777109764,"Present and future challenges for wild partridge populations include the resistance against possible disease transmission after restocking with captive-reared individuals, and the need to cope with the stress prompted by new dynamic and challenging scenarios. Selection of individuals with the best immune ability may be a good strategy to improve general immunity, and hence adaptation to stress. In this study, non-infectious challenges with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and sheep red blood cells allowed the classification of red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) according to their overall immune responses (IR). Skin from the area of injection of PHA and spleen, both from animals showing extreme high and low IR, were selected to investigate the transcriptional profiles underlying the different ability to cope with pathogens and external aggressions. RNA-seq yielded 97 million raw reads from eight sequencing libraries and approximately 84% of the processed reads were mapped to the reference chicken genome. Differential expression analysis identified 1488 up- and 107 down-regulated loci in individuals with high IR versus low IR. Partridges displaying higher innate IR show an enhanced activation of host defence gene pathways complemented with a tightly controlled desensitization that facilitates the return to cellular homeostasis. These findings indicate that the immune system ability to respond to aggressions (either diseases or stress produced by environmental changes) involves extensive transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, and expand our understanding on the molecular mechanisms of the avian immune system, opening the possibility of improving disease resistance or robustness using genome assisted selection (GAS) approaches for increased IR in partridges by using genes such as AVN or BF2 as markers. This study provides the first transcriptome sequencing data of the Alectoris genus, a resource for molecular ecology that enables integration of genomic tools in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2108096592,"The Internet has dramatically expanded citizens' access to and ability to engage with political information. On many websites, any user can contribute and edit ""crowd-sourced"" information about important political figures. One of the most prominent examples of crowd-sourced information on the Internet is Wikipedia, a free and open encyclopedia created and edited entirely by users, and one of the world's most accessed websites. While previous studies of crowd-sourced information platforms have found them to be accurate, few have considered biases in what kinds of information are included. We report the results of four randomized field experiments that sought to explore what biases exist in the political articles of this collaborative website. By randomly assigning factually true but either positive or negative and cited or uncited information to the Wikipedia pages of U.S. senators, we uncover substantial evidence of an editorial bias toward positivity on Wikipedia: Negative facts are 36% more likely to be removed by Wikipedia editors than positive facts within 12 hours and 29% more likely within 3 days. Although citations substantially increase an edit's survival time, the editorial bias toward positivity is not eliminated by inclusion of a citation. We replicate this study on the Wikipedia pages of deceased as well as recently retired but living senators and find no evidence of an editorial bias in either. Our results demonstrate that crowd-sourced information is subject to an editorial bias that favors the politically active."
https://openalex.org/W2124627434,"Influenza A viruses are characterised by their rapid evolution, and the appearance of point mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) domain causes seasonal epidemics. The A(H3N2) virus has higher mutation rate than the A(H1N1) virus. The aim of this study was to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of the A(H3N2) viruses circulating in Italy between 2004 and 2012 in the light of the forces driving viral evolution.Phylodinamic analyses were made using a Bayesian method, and codon-specific positive selection acting on the HA coding sequence was evaluated.Global and local phylogenetic analyses showed that the Italian strains collected between 2004 and 2012 grouped into five significant Italian clades that included viral sequences circulating in different epidemic seasons. The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the tree root was between May and December 2003. The tMRCA estimates of the major clades suggest that the origin of a new viral strain precedes the effective circulation of the strain in the Italian population by 6-31 months, thus supporting a central role of global migration in seeding the epidemics in Italy. The study of selection pressure showed that four codons were under positive selection, three of which were located in antigenic sites. Analysis of population dynamics showed the alternation of periods of exponential growth followed by a decrease in the effective number of infections corresponding to epidemic and inter-epidemic seasons.Our analyses suggest that a complex interaction between the immune status of the population, migrations, and a few selective sweeps drive the influenza A(H3N2) virus evolution. Our findings suggest the possibility of the year-round survival of local strains even in temperate zones, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1888881544,"Advances in GPS tracking technologies have allowed for rapid assessment of important oceanographic regions for seabirds. This allows us to understand seabird distributions, and the characteristics which determine the success of populations. In many cases, quality GPS tracking data may not be available; however, long term population monitoring data may exist. In this study, a method to infer important oceanographic regions for seabirds will be presented using breeding sooty shearwaters as a case study. This method combines a popular machine learning algorithm (generalized boosted regression modeling), geographic information systems, long-term ecological data and open access oceanographic datasets. Time series of chick size and harvest index data derived from a long term dataset of Maori ‘muttonbirder’ diaries were obtained and used as response variables in a gridded spatial model. It was found that areas of the sub-Antarctic water region best capture the variation in the chick size data. Oceanographic features including wind speed and charnock (a derived variable representing ocean surface roughness) came out as top predictor variables in these models. Previously collected GPS data demonstrates that these regions are used as “flyways” by sooty shearwaters during the breeding season. It is therefore likely that wind speeds in these flyways affect the ability of sooty shearwaters to provision for their chicks due to changes in flight dynamics. This approach was designed to utilize machine learning methodology but can also be implemented with other statistical algorithms. Furthermore, these methods can be applied to any long term time series of population data to identify important regions for a species of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2156615068,"Structural and functional brain connectivity are increasingly used to identify and analyze group differences in studies of brain disease. This study presents methods to analyze uni- and bi-modal brain connectivity and evaluate their ability to identify differences. Novel visualizations of significantly different connections comparing multiple metrics are presented. On the global level, “bi-modal comparison plots” show the distribution of uni- and bi-modal group differences and the relationship between structure and function. Differences between brain lobes are visualized using “worm plots”. Group differences in connections are examined with an existing visualization, the “connectogram”. These visualizations were evaluated in two proof-of-concept studies: (1) middle-aged versus elderly subjects; and (2) patients with schizophrenia versus controls. Each included two measures derived from diffusion weighted images and two from functional magnetic resonance images. The structural measures were minimum cost path between two anatomical regions according to the “Statistical Analysis of Minimum cost path based Structural Connectivity” method and the average fractional anisotropy along the fiber. The functional measures were Pearson’s correlation and partial correlation of mean regional time series. The relationship between structure and function was similar in both studies. Uni-modal group differences varied greatly between connectivity types. Group differences were identified in both studies globally, within brain lobes and between regions. In the aging study, minimum cost path was highly effective in identifying group differences on all levels; fractional anisotropy and mean correlation showed smaller differences on the brain lobe and regional levels. In the schizophrenia study, minimum cost path and fractional anisotropy showed differences on the global level and within brain lobes; mean correlation showed small differences on the lobe level. Only fractional anisotropy and mean correlation showed regional differences. The presented visualizations were helpful in comparing and evaluating connectivity measures on multiple levels in both studies."
