https://openalex.org/W2007181246,"Recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation is mediated in part by endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), which is expressed on activated endothelial cells of the blood vessel walls. ELAM-1 is a member of the LEC-CAM or selectin family of adhesion molecules that contain a lectin motif thought to recognize carbohydrate ligands. In this report, cell adhesion by ELAM-1 is shown to be mediated by a carbohydrate ligand, sialyl-Lewis X (SLex; NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4(Fuc alpha 1,3)-GlcNAc-), a terminal structure found on cell-surface glycoprotein and glycolipid carbohydrate groups of neutrophils."

https://openalex.org/W2130561621,"Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule that allows myeloid cells to attach to the walls of blood vessels adjacent to sites of inflammation. ELAM-1 recognizes the sialyl-Lewis X (sialyl-Lex) determinant, NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc-, a granulocyte carbohydrate also found on the surface of some tumor cell lines. Binding of myeloid cells to soluble ELAM-1 is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody recognizing sialyl-Lex or by proteins bearing sialyl-Lex, some of which may participate in humoral regulation of myeloid cell adhesion. Stimulated granulocytes also release an inhibitor of ELAM-1 binding that can be selectively adsorbed by monoclonal antibody to sialyl-Lex."
https://openalex.org/W2056686421,"A series of dipyridodiazepinones have been shown to be potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). One compound, BI-RG-587, had a Ki of 200 nanomolar for inhibition of HIV-1 RT that was noncompetitive with respect to deoxyguanosine triphosphate. BI-RG-587 was specific for HIV-1 RT, having no effect on feline and simian RT or any mammalian DNA polymerases. BI-RG-587 inhibited HIV-1 replication in vitro as demonstrated by in situ hybridization, inhibition of protein p24 production, and the lack of syncytia formation in cultured human T cell lines and freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity studies of BI-RG-587 on human cells showed a high therapeutic index (greater than 8000) in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2017100096,"Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1), an isozyme of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C family, which occupies a central role in hormonal signal transduction pathways, is an excellent substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. Epidermal growth factor elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis in various cell lines. The ability of tyrosine phosphorylation to activate the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1 was tested. Tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells or in vitro increased the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1. Also, treatment of EGF-activated PLC-gamma 1 with a tyrosine-specific phosphatase substantially decreased the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1. These results suggest that the EGF-stimulated formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in intact cells results, at least in part, from catalytic activation of PLC-gamma 1 through tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2027051533,"Recombination occurs at a high rate in retroviral replication, and its observation requires a virion containing two different RNA molecules (heterodimeric particles). Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed. These data suggest that retroviral recombination is ordered and occurs during the synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1998969662,"Exocrine gland cells secrete Cl(-)-rich fluid when stimulated by neurotransmitters or hormones. This is generally ascribed to a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which leads to activation of Ca2(+)-dependent ion channels. A precise understanding of Cl- secretion from these cells has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the spatial distribution of the Ca2+ signal and of the Ca2(+)-dependent ion channels in the secreting epithelial cells. We have now used the whole-cell patch-clamp method and digital imaging of [Ca2+]i to examine the response of rat pancreatic acinar cells to acetylcholine. We found a polarization of [Ca2+]i elevation and ion channel activation, and suggest that this comprises a novel 'push-pull' mechanism for unidirectional Cl- secretion. This mechanism would represent a role for cytosolic Ca2+ gradients in cellular function. The cytosolic [Ca2+]i gradients and oscillations of many other cells could have similar roles."
https://openalex.org/W1994711900,"The LECCAMs are a family of cell adhesion molecules implicated in certain inflammatory processes. ELAM-1, a LECCAM found on the surface of activated endothelial cells, can mediate adhesion of neutrophils, monocytes, and certain cell lines to endothelial cells in vitro. No ligand for any LECCAM has yet been fully characterized. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA, ELFT (ELAM-1 ligand fucosyltransferase), that can confer ELAM-1 binding activity when transfected into nonbinding cell lines. ELFT encodes a 46 kd protein that has alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase activity, suggesting that a fucosylated carbohydrate structure is an essential component of the ELAM-1 ligand. Furthermore, ELFT is expressed specifically in cell types that bind to ELAM-1, suggesting that this enzyme is an important regulator of inflammatory events in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2091619553,"Receptor-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) generation evokes fluctuations in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Intracellular Ca2+ infusion into single mouse pancreatic acinar cells mimicks the effect of external acetylcholine (ACh) or internal Ins(1,4,5)P3 application by evoking repetitive Ca2+ release monitored by Ca2+-activated Cl− current. Intracellular infusion of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor antagonist heparin fails to inhibit Ca2+ spiking caused by Ca2+ infusion, but blocks ACh- and Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ oscillations. Caffeine (1 mM), a potentiator of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, evokes Ca2+ spiking during subthreshold intracellular Ca2+ infusion. These results indicate that ACh-evoked Ca2+ oscillations are due to pulses of Ca2+ release through a caffeine-sensitive channel triggered by a small steady Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ flow."

https://openalex.org/W2057061887,"Conducting gramicidin channels form predominantly by the transmembrane association of monomers, one from each side of a lipid bilayer. In single-channel experiments in planar bilayers the two gramicidin analogs, [Val1]gramicidin A (gA) and [4,4,4-F3-Val1]gramicidin A (F3gA), form dimeric channels that are structurally equivalent and have characteristically different conductances. When these gramicidins were added asymmetrically, one to each side of a preformed bilayer, the predominant channel type was the hybrid channel, formed between two chemically dissimilar monomers. These channels formed by the association of monomers residing in each half of the membrane. These results also indicate that the hydrophobic gramicidins are surprisingly membrane impermeant, a conclusion that was confirmed in experiments in which gA was added asymmetrically and symmetrically to preformed bilayers."
https://openalex.org/W1979832870,"Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes. The loss of salivary and lacrimal gland function is accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration. Because similar symptoms and glandular pathology are observed in certain persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a search was initiated for a possible retroviral etiology in this syndrome. A human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle that is antigenically related to HIV was detected in lymphoblastoid cells exposed to homogenates of salivary tissue from patients with Sjögren's syndrome. Comparison of this retroviral particle to HIV indicates that they are distinguishable by several ultrastructural, physical, and enzymatic criteria."
https://openalex.org/W1591988375,"Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase.RNase H (RT.RNase H) has an RNA hydrolysis specificity which was influenced both by the sequence of the DNA primer-RNA template and by binding of the polymerase active site to the primer 3' terminus. RT.RNase H selectively hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the 15th and 16th ribonucleotide back from the ribonucleotide that is complementary to the primer 3'-terminal deoxynucleotide. The cleavage site for RT.RNase H remained a fixed distance behind the 3'-primer terminus as the polymerase extended the primer. This cleavage was not strongly affected by the position of the DNA primer on the template nor was it affected by reducing the primer length from 40 to 25 nucleotides. These results suggest that the distance between the RNase H and polymerase active sites corresponds to the length of a 15-16-nucleotide DNA-RNA heteroduplex. Since one helical turn is approximately 10 nucleotides, the distance between the active sites is 1.5 helical turns of heteroduplex. Therefore, the two active sites (catalyzing reactions on opposite strands) bind the same side of the RNA-DNA double helix. RT.RNase H also showed some sequence dependence for the site of hydrolysis. This sequence dependence has not been fully characterized. The rate of RT.RNase H cleavage was weakly inhibited by the next coded deoxynucleoside triphosphate following the incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1505684107,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induce the rapid phosphorylation of the c-raf protein in the growth factor-dependent FDC-P1 and DA-3 murine myeloid cell lines. Furthermore, immunoprecipitates of c-raf isolated from growth factor-stimulated cells demonstrate a marked increase in intrinsic protein kinase activity as measured in vitro. IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induce phosphorylation of c-raf at both serine and tyrosine residues. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from IL-3-stimulated cells demonstrate the rapid and coordinate phosphorylation of both c-raf and a protein co-migrating with the 140-kDa putative IL-3 receptor component. Collectively, the findings of rapid and coordinate ligand-induced phosphorylation of a potential IL-3 growth factor receptor component and cytoplasmic c-raf with concomitant c-raf activation provide a cogent sequential molecular model for linking external growth stimuli to intracellular signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W1600573461,"GMP-140, an inducible granule membrane protein of platelets and endothelial cells, is a member of the selectin family of cell surface receptors that mediate interactions of leukocytes with the blood vessel wall. These molecules all contain an N-terminal lectin-like domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain, a variable number of consensus repeats related to those in complement-binding proteins, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Two variant cDNAs for GMP-140 have been identified, one predicting a soluble form of the molecule lacking the transmembrane domain and the other predicting a molecule containing eight instead of nine consensus repeats. Here we describe the organization of the human gene encoding GMP-140, which spans over 50 kilobase pairs and contains 17 exons. Almost all exons encode distinct structural domains, including the lectin-like domain, the epidermal growth factor-like domain, each of the nine consensus repeats, and the transmembrane region. Each of the two deletions found in the variant cDNAs is precisely encoded by an exon, suggesting that these forms of GMP-140 are derived from alternative splicing of mRNA. By using the polymerase chain reaction, transcripts encoding the putative soluble form of GMP-140 can be amplified from both platelet and endothelial cell RNA. The structure of the GMP-140 gene supports the concept that the selectins evolved as a result of exon duplication and rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1588631487,"Transgenic mice were used to investigate sequences within the promoter of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) from the rat (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) which are involved in tissue-specific and developmental regulation of gene expression. Segments of the PEPCK promoter between -2000 and -109 were linked to the structural gene for bovine growth hormone (bGH) and introduced into the germ line of mice by microinjection. Bovine growth hormone mRNA was found in tissues that express the endogenous PEPCK gene, mainly in the liver but to a lesser extent in the kidney, adipose tissue, small intestine, and mammary gland. In the liver the chimeric PEPCK/bGH(460) gene was expressed in periportal cells, which is consistent with the zonation of endogenous PEPCK. The PEPCK/bGH gene was not transcribed in the livers of fetal mice until immediately before birth; at birth the concentration of bGH mRNA increased 200-fold. Our results indicate that the region of the PEPCK promoter from -460 to +73 base pairs contains regulatory sequences required for tissue-specific and developmental regulation of PEPCK gene expression. Mice transgenic for PEPCK/bGH(460) were not hyperglycemic or hyperinsulinemic in response to elevated bGH, as were transgenic mice with the MT/bGH gene. The number of insulin receptors in skeletal muscle was no different in mice transgenic for MT/bGH when compared with mice transgenic for PEPCK/bGH(460) and control animals. However, mRNA abundance for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter in skeletal muscle was decreased in mice transgenic for the MT/bGH gene. The differences in glucose homeostasis noted with the two types of transgenic mice may be the result of the relative site of expression, the different developmental pattern, or hormonal regulation of expression of the bGH gene."

https://openalex.org/W2037767071,"We have isolated a murine myeloid precursor cell line (FDC-P1/MAC) that simultaneously expresses receptors for multi-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF (c-fms protooncogene). FDC-P1/MAC cells express high levels of c-fms mRNA and protein when grown in M-CSF, whereas growth in multi-CSF or GM-CSF caused a dramatic reduction of c-fms glycoprotein and mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that c-fms transcription was not growth factor dependent and the regulation occurred posttranscriptionally. Factor switching experiments have shown that both multi-CSF and GM-CSF act dominantly and in a factor concentration dependent manner to suppress c-fms expression. In vitro agar assays of bone marrow cells grown in the presence of GM-CSF and M-CSF, individually and in combination, support the concept that GM-CSF can act dominantly to prevent monocyte/macrophage development. These results suggest that GM-CSF and multi-CSF can suppress development along the monocyte/macrophage lineage and offer a simple stochastic mechanism governing myeloid lineage restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2156886984,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of NO on cytosolic calcium levels in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts that were previously shown to lack soluble guanylate cyclase activity. Authentic NO as well as two NO-generating vasodilators, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine and isosorbide dinitrate, decreased cytosolic calcium in these fibroblasts. The effect of NO and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine was concentration-dependent and, for the most part, reversible. Since S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine did not increase either cGMP or cAMP, NO did not increase cGMP, and 8-bromo-cGMP did not alter cytosolic free calcium, we conclude that NO decreases cytosolic free calcium by a cyclic nucleotide-independent mechanism in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1520825376,"Dexamethasone increased the transscriptional activity of several acute-phase plasma protein genes in cytokine-treated HepG2 cells, suggesting the presence of functional glucocorticoid receptors (GR). The level of GR was, however, insufficient for stimulation of transiently transfected gene constructs containing glucocorticoid-response elements (GRE). By complementation of HepG2 cells with a GR expression vector, a cell system was generated that allowed analysis of the interaction between GRE and cytokine-response elements of the rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene and identification of the principal regulatory elements of the rat beta-fibrinogen gene. Although the expression of plasmid-derived GR mRNA was reduced by dexamethasone treatment, the concentration of GR was sufficient for full, short-term stimulation of GRE-containing vectors. By comparing the pattern of regulation of the cloned GRES in HepG2 and mouse L-cells, an equivalent, cell-type independent dexamethasone response was monitored for the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein element but a response limited to HepG2 cells was found for the beta-fibrinogen element. The data indicate that, although substantial differences exist in the organization and composition of the regulatory elements of the two genes, the overall function is, nevertheless, remarkably similar."
https://openalex.org/W1543883876,"Androgens and their nuclear receptor regulate genes necessary for development of the male phenotype, a process that is thought to be modulated by extracellular androgen carrier proteins. Two of these carrier proteins, testicular androgen-binding protein (ABP) and plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), are encoded by the same gene, but differ in glycosylation and possibly amino acid sequence. To investigate ABP-SHBG gene expression in fetal rat liver, we analyzed RNA transcripts and expressed protein. These studies demonstrated a transient expression of ABP in hepatocytes during the time of testosterone-dependent differentiation of the Wolffian duct. Analysis of cDNA clones derived from fetal rat liver cDNA libraries identified two cDNAs encoded by the ABP-SHBG gene that represented alternatively spliced RNAs. One cDNA had an alternate exon 1, suggesting the function of another promoter in fetal liver. This cDNA also lacked testicular exon 6 DNA, an alteration that implicates the encoded protein in regulatory functions. The other cDNA represented a fused transcript of the ABP-SHBG gene (exons 1-5) and the histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene, encoding a Mr 98,000 precursor protein. The two domains were joined at splice junctions of the ABP-SHBG and HDC genes, which were localized to rat chromosomes 10 and 3, respectively. Our results indicate that the joining of the two domains was by a trans (donor and acceptor)-splicing mechanism. Data from Northern hybridization experiments suggest the fusion transcript is present in fetal liver RNA. Polymerase chain reaction experiments with fetal liver cDNA further support the existence of an ABP-HDC fusion transcript, as well as the other alternate mRNA. Moreover, a Mr 93,000 immunoreactive protein was transiently expressed in fetal liver during the time of ABP and HDC gene expression. Expression of the fusion cDNA in COS cells yielded HDC activity and the predicted size protein (Mr = 93,000) on Western immunoblots."
https://openalex.org/W1574663686,"The effect of glucocorticoids on the regulation of the substance P receptor (SPR) mRNA was studied in rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells by Northern blot analysis with the cloned cDNA. After a lag period of about 1 h, dexamethasone rapidly decreased steady-state SPR mRNA to almost negligible levels by 2 h. This decrease occurred in a dose-dependent manner by dexamethasone and was caused by various steroids in accordance with their relative potencies as glucocorticoids. These results indicate that the expression of the SPR mRNA is selectively and negatively regulated by glucocorticoids through interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. The mechanisms of reduction of SPR mRNA levels were studied by treatment of AR42J cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The SPR mRNA half-life was approximately 30 min, and this rate remained unchanged by dexamethasone treatment. Furthermore, the rapid turnover of the SPR mRNA required ongoing protein synthesis. On the basis of the result of actinomycin D treatment, together with kinetics of dexamethasone-induced changes in SPR mRNA levels, we discuss the mechanism in which glucocorticoids act at transcription initiation to reduce SPR mRNA levels."

https://openalex.org/W1559865483,"Platelet activation by the prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH2)/thromboxane (Tx) A2 analog, U46619, involves stimulation of phospholipase (PL) C and an increase in intracellular calcium via distinct receptor subtypes. Agents which stimulate adenylate cyclase inhibit platelet function. We demonstrate that PGH2/TxA2 receptor desensitization is associated with enhanced stimulation of platelet cyclic AMP by the prostacyclin analog, iloprost and by forskolin. Sensitization of adenylate cyclase is mediated via the PGH2/TxA2 receptor subtype which activates PLC, as it is blocked by the specific antagonist, GR32191 (Takahara, K., Murray, R., FitzGerald, G. A., and Fitzgerald, D. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6838-6844). This effect is not observed in platelets desensitized with thrombin or platelet activating factor and is not mediated by protein kinase C. Prior exposure of platelets to platelet activating factor results in much greater desensitization of PGH2/TxA2-induced aggregation (mean 64%) compared with calcium stimulation (mean 18%), consistent with selective heterologous desensitization of the PLC-linked PGH2/TxA2 receptor subtype. Platelet activation by PGH2/TxA2 is a tightly regulated process, involving both homologous desensitization of at least two receptor subtypes and sensitization of the platelet adenylase cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1492757902,"Primary cultures of murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were prepared from marrow cell suspensions. These cells expressed specific receptors that recognized the transformed conformation of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) generated by reaction with CH3NH2. alpha 2M receptor expression was regulated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). The BMMs were deprived of CSF-1 for 6 h and then treated with different concentrations of the purified cytokine. After 18 h, binding of 125I-alpha 2M-CH3NH2 was examined at 4 degrees C. Analysis of the saturation isotherms and Scatchard transformations indicated that the KD was not affected by CSF-1 (1.9-2.4 nM), whereas the maximum specific radioligand binding capacity (Bmax) was increased from 5.6 x 10(4) receptors/cell in the absence of CSF-1 to 2.2 x 10(5) and 2.6 x 10(5) receptors/cell for BMMs treated with 1,000 and 10,000 units/ml CSF-1, respectively. The difference in total cellular protein after exposure to different levels of CSF-1 for 18 h was small (1.50-1.92 ng/cell) and not statistically significant. A 6-12-h lag phase was identified between the time of CSF-1 exposure and increased alpha 2M receptor expression. Cycloheximide completely blocked the increase in alpha 2M receptor expression when added simultaneously with the CSF-1; greater than 50% inhibition was observed when the cycloheximide was added up to 8 h later. The RNA synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D and daunomycin, prevented increased alpha 2M receptor expression when added up to 4 h after the CSF-1, but had no effect at 8 h. At 37 degrees C, uptake and digestion of 125I-alpha 2M-CH3NH2 was increased in BMMs treated with 1,000 units/ml CSF-1 for 18 h compared with untreated cells. These studies demonstrate that CSF-1 increases the expression of alpha 2M receptors in BMMs through a pathway that requires new RNA and protein synthesis. We hypothesize that increased alpha 2M receptor expression may play an important role in cellular growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1495386527,"Characterization of the human insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) promoter was initiated to facilitate study of developmental and hormonal factors regulating IGFBP-1 production. The region immediately 5' to the IGFBP-1 mRNA capsite is typical of a eukaryotic promoter, with a TATA sequence beginning 28 base pairs (bp) and a CCAAT promoter element beginning 72 bp upstream from this capsite. A 1.3-kilobase insert containing the IGFBP-1 capsite and 1205 bp of this putative IGFBP-1 promoter region directs expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in an orientation-specific manner in transfected HEP G2 cells, and the capsite identified for the CAT mRNA is identical to that identified for native IGFBP-1 mRNA. These observations suggest that the 1.3-kilobase insert contains the IGFBP-1 promoter. This promoter was further characterized by deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, gel mobility shift assays, and DNaseI protection assays. These studies identify the CCAAT box region as the major cis element involved in basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity in HEP G2 cells, demonstrate that increased basal promoter activity is associated with the binding of at least one HEP G2 nuclear factor to the CCAAT box region, and indicate that the DNA binding factor(s) responsible for increased basal promoter activity is related to liver factor B1. These observations suggest that liver B1 is the major trans-acting factor stimulating basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity in HEP G2 cells."

These data indicate that proteinase-proteinase inhibitor complexes formed between plasma serpins and their target enzymes could play major roles in signaling for acute phase protein synthesis in response to injury."
https://openalex.org/W1568680485,"Abstract A minigene version of the human gene for the pro alpha(I) chain of type I procollagen (COL1A1) was prepared that contained -2.3 kilobases of the 5'-flanking sequence, the first 5 exons and introns, the last 6 exons and introns, and about 2 kilobases of the 3'-flanking sequence. The gene was then used for stable transfection experiments with mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Because the products of the minigene were shorter, it was possible to compare expression of the minigene with expression of the endogenous pro alpha 1 (I) gene by Northern and Western blot analyses. The results demonstrated that the construct contained enough of the gene to obtain high levels of expression in many of the stably transfected cells. Since previous observations suggested that the first intron of the pro alpha 1 (I) gene contained important cis-regulatory elements, two versions of the minigene were prepared in which most of the first intron was deleted. Comparison of expression of the minigene with expression of two deleted versions of the same gene established that 85% of the total sequences in the first intron are not essential for high levels of expression of the gene in stably transfected mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1523642307,"The binding of chromosomal protein HMG1 to a palindromic sequence that can form the cruciform structure in supercoiled DNA and the subsequent effect on the transcription of the sequence were examined with pBR322 and its derivative plasmids. The plasmid DNA under negative supercoiling showed a selective sensitivity to nuclease S1. HMG1 protected against the nuclease S1 digestion. The results of the filter binding assay indicated that the primary binding target of HMG1 is the single-stranded region within the cruciform in supercoiled DNA. In the transcription from pBR322 DNA in the absence of HMG1, intermediate transcripts of RNA-I, which are encoded from a DNA region containing the palindromic sequence that can form a cruciform, were accumulated with the increase in negative superhelical density whereas the full-length RNA-I was synthesized without an accumulation of intermediate transcripts in the presence of HMG1. The intermediates that accumulated in the absence of HMG1 were elongated to the final product by adding HMG1. These results suggest that the cruciform structure formed under negative supercoiling blocks transcription and that HMG1 can remove the block by altering the DNA conformation to allow the stalled RNA polymerase at the block to resume transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1488947327,"We have isolated a portion of the uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:dolichol phosphate N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate transferase gene (GTR2) from the genome of a tunicamycin-resistant clonal Chinese hamster ovary cell line, 3E11. The genomic fragment was selected by its hybridization to the yeast ALG-7 gene at low stringency. A 2.46-kilobase cDNA was isolated from a library prepared from 3E11 mRNA and probed with GTR2. The cDNA contained an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 408 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44.9 kDa. This protein was 43% identical in amino acid sequence to the protein of 448 amino acids encoded by the ALG-7 gene. The GTR2 gene fragment contained sequences for four exons coding for the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Transferase DNA sequences in 3E11 cells were 12-fold elevated over wild-type cells and 25-fold elevated when 3E11 cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin. Transferase RNA levels in 3E11 cells were also elevated over wild-type levels but appeared unchanged by the presence of tunicamycin in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1518984641,"Recordings of [Ca2+]i in single AR42J cells loaded with Fura 2 were used to study regulation of [Ca2+]i oscillation. Continuous stimulation with the cholecystokinin analogue, (t-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr-(SO3)-norleucine-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester) or carbachol evoked long lasting oscillation in [Ca2+]i. Removal of CCK-JMV-180 after brief stimulation did not abruptly stop the oscillation. Rather, removal of CCK-JMV-180 resulted in time-dependent reduction in amplitude with little change in frequency of oscillation. The patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillation were affected by activation of protein kinase C and protein kinase A. However, down-regulation of protein kinase C activity did not prevent stimulation of [Ca2+]i oscillation. Hence, we conclude that an active protein kinase C pathway is not crucial for [Ca2+]i oscillation in this cell line. Variation in extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+out) was used to further characterize the oscillation. Reducing Ca2+out to approximately 10 microM resulted in a time dependent inhibition of [Ca2+]i oscillation. Subsequent step increases in Ca2+out up to 2-3 mM resulted in increased amplitude and frequency of oscillation. Further increase in Ca2+out or an increase in plasma membrane permeability to Ca2+, brought about by an increase in pHo, resulted in increased amplitude, decreased frequency, and modified shape of the [Ca2+]i spikes. These observations point to the existence of regulatory mechanisms controlling the duration of Ca2+ release and entry during [Ca2+]i oscillation."
https://openalex.org/W1512922227,"Several cis-acting elements interact through their cognate trans-acting factors to confer placenta-specific expression to the alpha subunit gene of glycoprotein hormones. These elements include two tandemly arranged cAMP response elements (CREs, located between base pairs (bp) -146 and -111 relative to the transcription start site), an upstream regulatory element (URE, located between -180 and -150), and a CCAAT box (located between bp -100 and -80). Here, we identify a new regulatory region, junctional regulatory element (JRE), with critical nucleotides located between the CREs and CCAAT box (bp -120 to -100). Although the binding site of the JRE abuts the 3' CRE, methylation interference assays indicate that no overlap occurs between the contact points of the proteins that bind to the JRE and CRE. This new regulatory element is highly conserved across species and contains a palindromic binding site for a 50-kDa nuclear factor(s) which is distinct from the factors that bind the URE, CRE, and CCAAT box of the alpha subunit gene. Finally, gene transfer studies suggest that, although JRE binding activity is found in several cell types, this element acts relatively cell-specifically. We conclude that this element and its cognate trans-acting factor act in conjunction with the complexes formed over the URE, CREs, and CCAAT box to enhance the placenta-specific activity of the alpha subunit promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1607587197,"The ability to assess the importance of secretin in various physiological processes is limited by the lack of specific potent antagonists. Recently, reduced peptide bond (psi) analogues of bombesin or substance P in which the -CONH- bond is replaced by -CH2NH- are reported to be receptor antagonists. To attempt to develop a new class of secretin receptor antagonists, we have adopted a similar strategy with secretin and sequentially altered the eight NH2-terminal peptide bonds, the biological active portion of secretin. In guinea pig pancreatic acini, secretin caused a 75-fold increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP). Secretin inhibited 125I-secretin binding with a half-maximal effect at 7 nM. Each of the psi analogues inhibited 125I-secretin binding. [psi 4,5]Secretin was the most potent, causing the half-maximal inhibition at 4 microM, and was 2-fold more potent than the [psi 1,2]secretin; 7-fold more than [psi 3,4]secretin, [psi 5,6]secretin, and [psi 8,9]secretin; 9-fold more than [psi 7,8]secretin; 13-fold more potent [psi 6,7]secretin, and 17-fold more than [psi 2,3]secretin. Secretin caused a half-maximal increase in cAMP at 1 nM. At concentrations up to 10 microM, [psi 2,3]secretin, [psi 4,5]secretin, and [psi 8,9]secretin did not alter cAMP whereas [psi 1,2]secretin and [psi 6,7]secretin caused a detectable increase in cAMP at 10 nM, [psi 7,8]secretin at 300 nM, [psi 5,6]secretin at 1 microM, and [psi 3,4]secretin at 10 microM. The [psi 4,5], [psi 2,3], and [psi 8,9] analogues of secretin each inhibited 1 nM secretin-stimulated cAMP as well as [psi 3,4]secretin, which functioned as a partial agonist. [psi 4,5]Secretin was the most potent, causing half-maximal inhibition at 3 microM whereas [psi 8,9]secretin was 6-fold less potent, and [psi 2,3]secretin and [psi 3,4]secretin were 17-fold less potent. [psi 4,5]Secretin inhibited secretin-stimulated cAMP and binding of 125I-secretin in a competitive manner. [psi 4,5]Secretin did not interact with cholecystokinin, bombesin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or cholinergic receptors but did interact with receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide, causing half-maximal inhibition at 72 microM and thus had a 18-fold higher affinity for secretin than vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors. These results indicate that reduced peptide bond analogues of the NH2 terminus of secretin represent a new class of secretin receptor antagonists. It is likely that in the future even more potent members of this class can be developed which may be useful to investigate the role of secretin in various physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1483298825,"A glycoprotein of 78,000 molecular mass (78 kDa), associated with the membrane of Leishmania infantum promastigotes, was identified and immunopurified by monoclonal antibody (mAb) LD9 produced against isolated membrane preparations. mAb LD9 was subsequently found to bind to human transferrin, also of 78 kDa. Binding of LD9 to transferrin was completely abolished when the mAb was preabsorbed by Leishmania membranes, thereby indicating that the 78-kDa Leishmania membrane-associated glycoprotein and transferrin have common antigenic epitope(s). The 78-kDa Leishmania membrane-associated protein was released in soluble nonaggregated form by mild treatment with acetic acid saline. Anti-transferrin polyclonal antibodies, recognized both the membrane-associated and the soluble form of the 78-kDa glycoprotein. The 78-kDa soluble form was characterized further as an iron-containing protein. The above data combined with iron uptake by promastigotes as demonstrated by the Prussian blue reaction indicate that the 78-kDa Leishmania membrane-associated glycoprotein is transferrin. The binding of 125I-human transferrin to Leishmania-purified membrane preparations was then investigated. The results indicate the presence of a high affinity saturable binding site (Kd = 2.2 10(-8) M) that is specific for transferrin. We suggest that the 78-kDa glycoprotein recognized by mAb LD9 is transferrin that binds to the surface of Leishmania promastigotes via a transferrin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1496358655,"In the porcine renal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, activation of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway induces the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene. We show here that the cAMP response is enhanced when the intracellular calcium concentration is increased. When LLC-PK1 cells were treated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin alone, there was no uPA mRNA accumulation. However, in the presence of ionomycin the dose-response of 8-bromo-cAMP (Br-cAMP) with respect to uPA mRNA accumulation was shifted toward the lower concentrations of Br-cAMP. A Northern blot analysis after the inhibition of RNA synthesis and nuclear run-on assays showed that the synergistic effect of Ca2+ could be attributed to increases in uPA gene transcription and mRNA stability. In the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, uPA mRNA was stabilized, but the effect of ionomycin on Br-cAMP-induced mRNA accumulation was still maintained. The result suggests that the Ca2+, at least on transcription, does not require new protein synthesis. Ionomycin treatment did not modify the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that Ca2+ either affects a step in the pathway between the kinase and the uPA gene, or acts independently of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. The effect of ionomycin was not suppressed by protein kinase C down-regulation nor by inhibitors of calmodulin. Synergism was also observed when Br-cAMP was replaced with calcitonin, a peptide hormone which is coupled to adenylate cyclase, and when ionomycin was replaced with another ionophore A23187, suggesting that the synergism is due to an interaction between cAMP-dependent and Ca2(+)-dependent signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1591612038,"The purpose of the study was to examine the role of N-linked oligosaccharides in preventing combination of free alpha molecules with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-beta subunit to form the intact hormone, hCG. Culture media from JEG cells incubated in the presence or absence of Swainsonine were filtered on Sephadex G-100, and free alpha was identified by radioimmunoassay. Swainsonine interferes with glycosylation by inhibiting alpha-mannosidase II, resulting in formation of hybrid structures. Approximately 50% of the free alpha molecules from Swainsonine-treated cells (Swainsonine pool 2) had an apparent molecular size that was smaller than that of free alpha from control cells. The oligosaccharides of control alpha molecules were resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment. In contrast, virtually all of the Swainsonine free alpha molecules contained endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides. Swainsonine free alpha and control free alpha molecules were incubated with an excess of hCG-beta subunit, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. Each fraction was assayed by radioimmunoassay for intact hCG and for alpha. Less than 10% of control free alpha molecules combined with hCG-beta. In contrast, 54% of Swainsonine alpha pool 2 and 40% of Swainsonine alpha pool 1 combined with beta to form hCG. Thus, modulation of N-linked oligosaccharide processing converted free alpha molecules to forms that can combine with hCG-beta. These results indicate that the inability of a substantial portion of control free alpha molecules to combine with hCG-beta is due to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide structures that interfere with combination."
https://openalex.org/W1603453379,"The rat pituitary cell line GH3 contains a high molecular weight microtubule-associated protein with properties characteristic of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2). The 280-kDa protein is selectively immunoprecipitated by antibodies to authentic bovine brain MAP-2 and is phosphorylated at appropriate sites by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP kinase) and multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase). Although MAP-2 is a minor cellular constituent, it can be immunoprecipitated from [32P]Pi-labeled GH3 cells and shown to contain a high level of basal phosphorylation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthene, or cholera toxin, treatments which increase cellular cAMP levels, or dibutyryl cAMP stimulate phosphorylation of specific sites on MAP-2 without significantly increasing its high state of basal phosphorylation. Phosphopeptide mapping reveals that the sites phosphorylated by cAMP kinase in vitro are the same sites whose phosphorylation in situ increases following stimulation of GH3 with agents that activate cAMP kinase. Increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels in GH3 cells also stimulates phosphorylation of MAP-2 but at sites distinct from those phosphorylated following treatment with cAMP inducing agonists. Phosphopeptide mapping indicates that the sites phosphorylated by CaM kinase in vitro are the same sites whose phosphorylation in situ increases following Ca2(+)-mediated stimulation. We conclude that activation of cAMP- and Ca2(+)-based signaling pathways leads to phosphorylation of MAP-2 in GH3 cells and that cAMP kinase and CaM kinase mediate phosphorylation by these pathways, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1491021876,"IgA 16.4.12E is a murine monoclonal antibody obtained following immunization with isomaltohexose linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We have studied its interaction with methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside and its derivatives bearing deoxy or deoxyfluoro groups, and with the methyl alpha-glycosides of a series of isomalto-oligosaccharides, some bearing deoxy or deoxy-fluoro groups at selected positions. From the data it is concluded that the antibody binds optimally to 4 sequential glucopyranosyl residues and that the protein subsite possessing the major affinity binds the terminal, nonreducing glucosyl group of that antigenic epitope. All the hydroxyl groups of that terminal glucosyl group are involved in hydrogen bonding, some in a donating and some in an accepting capacity. In the last part of the paper we report the construction of a possible model of the antibody, derived from its known amino acid sequence and the known crystalline structures of two closely related antibodies. It shows a pronounced cavity in the general immunoglobulin combining area which is flanked by 2 solvent-exposed tryptophanyl residues. A model recently reported for anti-dextran IgA W3129 shows a similar cavity with one such residue. Guided by hydrogen bonds, experimentally deduced from the comparison of the affinities of variously derivatized ligands, we suggest a speculative fitting for the nonreducing terminus of the dextran antigen, in the respective cavities of both IgA 16.4.12E and W3129."
https://openalex.org/W1558433859,"The low density lipoproteins (LDL) from patients with Tangier disease are enriched in triglycerides, 27% of LDL mass versus 7% for normal LDL. To study whether this unique LDL core lipid composition affects the surface disposition of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100, we analyzed the LDL by protease digestion and in competitive radioimmunoassays. Limited proteolytic digestion of Tangier LDL by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease generated a prominent fragment of 120 kDa (cleavage site at residue 1076), which was not visible in similarly digested normal LDL. In competitive radioimmunoassay, Tangier LDL bound weakly to the apoB-specific monoclonal antibody MB20, compared with control LDL. We localized the MB20 epitope between residues 1031 and 1084 of apoB-100, probably very near residue 1076. DNA sequencing of exon 21 of apoB genomic clones (coding for residues 1014-1084) from a Tangier patient revealed no difference from the normal DNA sequence, thus eliminating a protein polymorphism as a basis for the altered protease sensitivity and antibody binding. When the triglyceride contents of Tangier LDL were reduced to 10% of mass by incubation with normal high density lipoproteins, production of the 120-kDa fragment by proteolysis decreased and MB20 binding increased in affinity, implying a change toward normal conformation of apoB-100. Thus, using two independent techniques, proteolytic digestion and binding of monoclonal antibodies, we have demonstrated an alternative conformation of apoB-100 in the vicinity of residue 1076, which reflects the content of triglycerides in the LDL particle."
https://openalex.org/W1555273285,"Post-translational processing of the precursor for rat gastrin yields products that include peptides phosphorylated at Ser96, amidated at Phe92, and sulfated at Tyr87 or Tyr103. The phosphorylation site is immediately adjacent to the processing point that gives rise to the biologically active amidated gastrins. We have examined changes in post-translational processing which occur in gastrin cells from rats that are physiologically stimulated (by feeding) or unstimulated (by fasting). Peptides were identified using site-directed radioimmunoassays and chromatographic systems that resolve phosphorylated, amidated, and sulfated progastrin products, including intermediates generated prior to amidation (i.e. C-terminal glycine-extended variants). Assays for Phe92-amidated peptides and for the C-terminal tryptic fragment of progastrin indicated decreases in the total tissue concentrations of immunoreactive peptide with fasting; in contrast, the tissue concentrations of glycine-extended biosynthetic intermediates were similar in fasted and fed rats. Taken together the data suggest a relative failure in amidation mechanisms in unstimulated cells. The endopeptidase cleavage of progastrin was not influenced significantly by fasting. However, the phosphorylation of peptide products containing Ser96 was depressed significantly in fasted rats. The proportions of amidated peptides sulfated at Tyr87 were generally lower than their corresponding glycine-extended biosynthetic precursors, but in both cases the proportion of peptide in the sulfated form was lower than for peptides sulfated at Tyr103. Feeding did not change the sulfation of amidated heptadecapeptide gastrin or its glycine-extended variant. The results suggest that the mechanisms determining phosphorylation and amidation of progastrin-related peptides depend on the patterns of stimulation of gastrin cells. The observation that decreased phosphorylation is associated with a failure to produce active amidated products is consistent with a regulatory function for phosphorylation in gastrin production."
https://openalex.org/W1587762801,"Rats maintained on a low potassium diet develop hypokalemia, which is associated with an approximately 80% decrease in the number of (Na+,K+)-ATPase molecules in skeletal muscle sarcolemma (Norgaard, A., Kjeldsen, K., and Clausen, T. (1981) Nature 293, 739-741); the skeletal muscles of the hypokalemic rats become paralyzed after exposure to insulin in low [K+] media (Otsuka, M., and Ohtsuki, I. (1970) Am. J. Physiol. 219, 1178-1182). We have been interested in the interactions between the insulin receptor and the alpha 2 isoform of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase as a mechanism for the insulin activation of (Na+,K+)-pumping and decided to use the hypokalemic rats to obtain additional information on this question. We show here that the amount of the alpha 2 isoform in the skeletal muscles of hypokalemic rats is greatly decreased as determined by immunoblotting and (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity; the effect of hypokalemia on the amount of the alpha 1 isoform is small. The mechanism of the decrease in the alpha 2 isoform is not known, but it is not due to transcriptional regulation of the alpha 2 gene because the amounts of the transcripts for this polypeptide are increased in the rats on the low potassium diet. The (Na+,K+)-pump that remains in the skeletal muscles of rats on a low potassium diet for a period of 2 weeks is still activated by insulin; under these conditions, however, insulin does not bring about a decrease in the intracellular [Na+] in contrast to the situation with normal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1498906787,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibits the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase activation of plasminogen to plasmin, a protease of trypsin-like specificity which is involved in a number of processes, including fibrinolysis, matrix degradation and angiogenesis. Both phorbol esters and cAMP elevating compounds have been shown to modulate PAI-1 and tPA expression in endothelial cell culture. HBGF-1 (previously designated endothelial cell growth factor) stimulates endothelial cell growth in vitro and is angiogenic in vivo. We have reported that removal of HBGF-1 from human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) media results in an approximately 5-fold increase in PAI-1 mRNA levels and in PAI-1 protein secreted into the media by 20 h. Here we report the effects of HBGF-1 on the phorbol ester and cAMP modulation of HUVEC PAI-1 expression. The phorbol ester PMA induced an approximate 5-fold increase in PAI-1 mRNA levels at 4 h, which returned to base line by 20 h, with or without HBGF-1 present in the media. This increase in PAI-1 mRNA levels was mediated by an increase in PAI-1 gene transcription and was abated in the presence of cycloheximide. Treatment of cells with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor HL 725, in the presence of HBGF-1 or immediately after its withdrawal, decreased PAI-1 mRNA levels and protein secreted into the conditioned media by 20 h. However, forskolin or HL 725 addition had little or no effect on PAI-1 mRNA when added 20 h after HBGF-1 withdrawal. Both the PMA and HBGF-1 modulation of PAI-1 were abolished by treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor H-7. Treatment of HUVEC with HBGF-1 had no acute effect on intracellular inositol phosphate hydrolysis or cAMP levels. Further studies on intracellular pathways involved in HBGF-1 modulation of PAI-1 will enhance our understanding of the role these factors play in cellular proliferation and angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1544830699,"Monoclonal antibody 4A (mAb 4A) against the T alpha subunit of transducin has been widely used to study the structure and function of signal transducing GTP-binding proteins involved in the regulation of visual excitation, hormonal regulation of adenylyl cyclase and ionic channels. Results of mapping the epitope-binding site of mAb 4A on T alpha have been controversial. Hamm and co-workers (Deretic, D., and Hamm, H. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10839-10847) reported that mAb 4A interacts with T alpha at the carboxyl-terminal peptide, whereas Fung and co-workers (Navon, S. E., and Fung, B. K.-k. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 489-498) showed that mAb 4A binds mainly at the amino-terminal peptide. In this report, we examine the epitope-binding site of mAb 4A by Western immunoblotting of the proteolytic fragments of T alpha generated by submaxillary Arg-C protease digestion. Submaxillary Arg-C protease cleaved T alpha at two sites, Arg-204 and Arg-310, generating two major fragments of apparent size 35 (T alpha'SM-35) and 23 kDa (T alpha'SM-23). Both fragments contain the amino-terminal peptide of T alpha but lack the carboxyl-terminal peptide. Western immunoblotting showed that mAb 4A cross-reacted with both peptides. Treatment of T alpha'SM-35 and T alpha'SM-25 with L-1-(tosylamido)-2-phenyethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin removed the amino-terminal 2-kDa peptide with concomitant loss of mAb 4A reactivity. This observation unequivocally confirms the result of Fung and co-workers that the epitope for mAb 4A is located on the amino-terminal 2-kDa peptide of T alpha. This conclusion should provide a more accurate interpretation of results in the literature as well as of future studies in which mAb 4A is used."
