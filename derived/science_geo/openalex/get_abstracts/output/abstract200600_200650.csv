https://openalex.org/W2043309289,"To determine whether peripheral afferent pathways could be bypassed in the performance of purposive movement, a group of monkeys was trained to avoid shock by flexing a forelimb in response to an auditory stimulus. The dorsal roots of the responding limb were then sectioned. Postoperatively it was found that the affected limb could be reconditioned."

https://openalex.org/W1988868447,"FROM time to time during the past decade attempts have been made in this laboratory to determine the mechanism by which the mould Penicillium roqueforti produces the flavouring and aromatic compounds characteristic of the blue-veined cheeses, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola and ‘Bleu’. These aromatic compounds are a family of ketones, each one produced from a specific fatty acid which is one carbon longer, the carboxyl carbon, than the ketone. Thus the mould converts caprylic (octanoic) acid to 2-heptanone, caproic (hexanoic) acid to 2-pentanone, and so on. The overall kinetics for the conversion of fatty acids to ketones by P. roqueforti was published in 19551; however, the individual steps in the conversion were not known. Until recently, the occurrence of the reaction under controlled conditions in the laboratory has been most erratic and unpredictable, not at all commensurate with the apparent reliability of the reaction in the manufacture of blue-veined cheese."

https://openalex.org/W2075817610,"IT has been shown that inert gases at pressures higher than 1 atm. reduce the oxygen-dependent radiosensitivity of the broad bean (Vicia faba) root and of mouse Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in the presence of oxygen1. The effectiveness of the inert gases follows their partition between water and lipids and is paralleled by their anæsthetic potency. It therefore seemed of interest to test nitrous oxide. Results obtained with nitrous oxide on mouse Ehrlich ascites tumour cells show a marked effect, and, since this gas is effective in the range physiologically tolerated by mammals, it seems worth while reporting: the results (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1988113766,"DURING the course of investigation of the reasons underlying the ability of cartilage grafts to survive in foreign hosts for long periods, the effects of cartilage homografts and heterografts on the regional lymph node were studied in order to determine whether such grafts were antigenic1. The results of this test indicated that both types of graft do evoke an active immune response in the host animal, and it was discovered, further, that heterografts do so even after having been boiled for periods of up to 10 min.2. This test does not, however, indicate whether the host animal becomes fully immunized by the foreign cartilage, and in order to determine whether this is so, rabbits bearing cartilage homografts have been challenged with skin homografts from the cartilage donor."

https://openalex.org/W1973656710,"Subjects conditioned concurrently to two different conditioned stimuli, light and tone, exhibited a significantly higher level of conditioning to the stimulus paired with a strong unconditioned stimulus than to the stimulus paired with a weak one. The findings suggest that habit strength in aversive conditioning varies with the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2018213310,"Animals performed with a high degree of accuracy on two concept problems. The bases of these performances, however, differed qualitatively. In one problem, successful performance was based upon responding to specific stimulus patterns. In the other problem, successful performance was based upon responding to the common element or concept."

https://openalex.org/W2016308563,"DURING the course of isolating the yellow pigment contained in the myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, a second crystalline (colourless) material was obtained from the neutral ether extracts of the tissue. Analyses showed that this substance was probably a C30 sterol not hitherto found in Nature. It is proposed that the compound be referred to as ‘physarosterol’."
https://openalex.org/W2001406486,"Sheps and Munson1 have shown how the internal statistics of a single hormone assay may underestimate the variation actually observed on replication of that assay. Inter-assay errors may therefore be important when demonstrating qualitative differences between two hormone preparations by the simultaneous use of two different methods of assay. Such differences have been shown in human urinary gonadotrophins2, and the errors between duplicates of the assays used have therefore been investigated."

In a preliminary report to the fourth International Congress of Nutrition, Bunyan et al.3 gave the potency of η-tocopherol as less than 5 per cent of α-tocopherol."

https://openalex.org/W2021936354,"RECENT communications1,2 on the variance of the dosage-mortality response of strains of housefly and mosquito susceptible and resistant to insecticide serve to emphasize that, although there is considerable information on the inheritance of resistance to insecticide in some insects, especially houseflies3, Drosophila4 and now mosquitoes5, there has as yet been no direct estimate of how much of the unselected tolerance is genetically determined, how much is due to environmental effects. Beard6, who first directed attention to the possibilities, considered the non-genetic variation might so predominate as to overwhelm the genetic components."
https://openalex.org/W2042300353,"THE antigenic individuality of red cells of cattle was noted in 19101, and studies conducted since 1940 by many workers have made it possible to identify more than fifty blood factors. The number of blood-group combinations is very large, and in practice it is difficult to find two individuals with the same combination. Identification of red cell antigens in cattle and knowledge of the mode of inheritance of these characters have been found to have a practical application among others in the exclusion of paternity and the control of pedigree. A condition for the efficacy of these tests is the possession by the laboratory of a large number of immune sera (reagents)."
