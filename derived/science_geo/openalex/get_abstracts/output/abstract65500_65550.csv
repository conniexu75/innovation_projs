https://openalex.org/W1480834102,"When a solution containing the complex ion, [PtCl6]=, and NH4+ ions is irradiated, a photochemical change occurs in which the chloride ions of the ligand are sequentially replaced by 1, 2, or 3 ammonia molecules. The total charge on the complex ion decreases by 1 negative charge for each replacement. These changes can be followed by changes occurring in absorption spectra or in ionophoretic patterns. Each charged species of the complex has a unique effect on the bacteriological growth of Escherichia coli. The doubly negative species is a bacteriocide. The singly negative species appears to have little effect on either growth or cell division processes. The neutral species has little effect on growth, but markedly inhibits cell division processes, forcing filamentous growth. The cis and trans forms of the diamino complex, [PtCl4(NH3)2]0, have been synthesized. The absorption spectra of both have a λmax at 207 mµ. The electrophoretic patterns indicate predominantly neutral species in both cases. The trans form is relatively inefficient in inhibiting cell division, whereas the cis form is fully as efficient as the neutral species in inhibiting cell division. We identify the neutral species as the cis form of the complex."

Purified aspartate transcarbamylase was dissociated by treatment with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to yield two kinds of protein subunits which were separated by column chromatography. The separated subunits retained their functional properties, namely, catalytic activity or affinity for the regulatory metabolite, cytidine triphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2000434120,"Fifty-five clinical isolates and laboratory stocks of Escherichia coli and Salmonella were studied for resistance to each of ten metals. Eleven clinical isolates carrying R factors were resistant to mercury, and, in each case, the resistance was mediated by a previously undefined R-factor gene. The gene was phenotypically expressed within 2 to 4 minutes after entry into sensitive bacteria, but the basis for the resistance remains undefined. Fourteen strains, 12 infected with R factors, were resistant to cobalt and nickel, but these resistances were mediated by R-factor genes in only two strains; separate R-factor genes mediated the resistances to nickel and cobalt. These and other results indicate that the genetic composition of R factors is greater than that originally defined."
https://openalex.org/W1576429219,"Succinic anhydride reacts with pepsinogen to form succinylpepsinogen in which the 10 e-amino groups of the lysine residues are succinylated. In addition reaction occurs with 16 tyrosine residues and 10 to 13 hydroxyamino acid residues of the protein. In contrast to the O-succinyltyrosines of succinylpepsinogen which are spontaneously decomposed in 3 to 4 hours, the succinylhydroxyamino acid residues are stable but can be deacylated with hydroxylamine. Succinylation of pepsinogen is accompanied by a decreased susceptibility to activation at pH 2.0. An enzymically active product can be obtained on exposure of succinylpepsinogen to pH 5.0 followed by assay for proteolysis of hemoglobin at pH 2.0. Succinylation results in a change of the macromolecular conformation of the protein as reflected by a decrease of λc from 236 to 222 mµ and a decrease in [α]366 from -222 to -320 and of [R']227 from -3978 to -5200."
https://openalex.org/W1488111235,"Abstract N5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine transmethylase was isolated in millimicromole quantities (290-fold purified) from an extract of 2 kg of Escherichia coli B. Although it was not homogeneous the purity of the enzyme was sufficient to show that the salmon color of the preparations was due to a tightly bound vitamin B12 derivative which reacts with cyanide. In the visible region the absorption spectrum of the vitamin B12 enzyme closely resembled that of B12r (a reduced derivative containing monovalent cobalt). By sucrose gradient centrifugation a sedimentation coefficient of 7.1 was obtained for the purified enzyme. The vitamin B12 transmethylase was isolated entirely in the form of its holoenzyme and it catalyzed methionine formation from homocysteine plus N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, or methyl-B12 (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide methyl) as the methyl donor. Transmethylation from either N5-methyltetrahydrofolate or S-adenosyl-l-methionine required a chemical reducing system whereas methyl group transfer from methyl-B12 did not."

Although not homogeneous at this stage, the enzyme was of sufficient purity to determine some physical characteristics. The sedimentation constant was 2.02 which would indicate a molecular weight of approximately 25,000. In addition to the substrates of the reaction a partial dependency on magnesium ion was observed. The identity of the formyl donor was elucidated and found to be N10-formyltetrahydrofolate."

Two fractions were obtained which appeared pure upon electrophoresis on cellulose polyacetate at pH 5 or pH 8.6, or in polyacrylamide gel at pH 9.3. Evidence is presented that these preparations, termed the and fragments, include the two terminal sites of the albumin molecule. The amino-terminal or Asp fragment, mol wt 2808, contains 24 residues and has the same amino-terminal sequence, Asp-Thr-, as has the parent albumin. Its amino acid composition is: alanine, 1; glycine, 2; valine, 1; leucine, 3; isoleucine, 1; phenylalanine, 2; serine, 1; threonine, 1; arginine, 1; histidine, 3; lysine, 3; aspartic acid, 2; and glutamic acid, 3. There is no tyrosine or tryptophan, and no cystine or proline is present to restrict helical folding. The presence of 3 histidine residues and of the free terminal amino group suggests a role in binding small compounds. The Phe fragment, mol wt 8553, is believed to be the carboxyl-terminal fragment. It contains 77 residues, and has the albumin carboxyl-terminal sequence, -(Ala,Thr)-Leu-Ala. Its composition is: alanine, 9; glycine, 1; valine, 7; leucine, 7; isoleucine, 2; proline, 3; phenylalanine, 5; serine, 1; threonine, 8; half-cystine, 4; methionine, 1; histidine, 2; lysine, 10; aspartic acid, 6; glutamic acid, 11; and amide, 5."

The procedure used for purification preserved the histidine sensitivity of the enzyme. A molecular weight of 215,000 for native enzyme was obtained.

https://openalex.org/W1533794942,"The partial purification of a uridine diphosphate sugar hydrolase from Escherichia coli ATCC 12793 and a specific protein inhibitor of this enzyme are described. The products of the hydrolysis are uridine, inorganic phosphate, and sugar 1-phosphate. The enzyme appears to be identical with the 5'-nucleotidase in this organism. In addition, these cells contain a specific adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphatase. The 5'-nucleotidase is relatively nonspecific, but the uridine diphosphate sugar hydrolase activity cleaves only uridine nucleotides at a significant rate. Other nucleoside diphosphate sugars containing adenine, guanine, or cytosine as the base are cleaved at less than 5% of the rate of the uridine nucleotides, although the apparent affinity of these nucleotides for the enzyme is the same as that of the uridine nucleotides. Both enzymatic activities show an absolute requirement for the addition of a divalent cation. At pH 8.0 in Tris-Cl buffer, this requirement can be satisfied in order of decreasing affinity by Co++, Mn++, and Mg++, while at pH 5.1 in acetate buffer only Co++ and Mn++ are effective. These same metals protect the enzyme against heat inactivation. Similar, if not identical, enzymes are present in several other strains of E. coli, and a similar enzyme is also present in Salmonella weslaco. All of these enzymes are released into the medium when cells are converted to spheroplasts, but the inhibitor remains in the spheroplast. In Salmonella typhimurium LT-2, a soluble adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphatase and a particle-bound nucleoside diphosphate sugar pyrophosphatase of broader specificity which is not associated with 5'-nucleotidase activity are present. Some of the properties and possible functions of these enzymes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1489843428,"Abstract The sequence of 27 residues at the carboxyl end of the single polypeptide chain of porcine pepsin has been found to be: -Ile-Leu-Gly-Asp-Val-Phe-Ile-Arg-Gln-Tyr-Tyr-Thr-Val-Phe-Asp-Arg-Ala-Asn-Asn-Lys-Val-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro-Val-Ala. The peptides from which this sequence has been derived were isolated from tryptic and chymotryptic digests of pepsin and its reduced aminoethylated and trifluoracetylated derivatives. All 3 of the strongly basic residues in pepsin (1 lysine and 2 arginine residues) are thus found in this terminal segment of the chain. There is no half-cystine residue in this portion of the molecule, and hence the crosslinking of the enzyme by three —S—S— bonds occurs within a highly acidic sequence of about 300 residues in which the only basic residue is that of the single histidine. The absence of positive charges in this sequence undoubtedly contributes to the acid stability and alkali lability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1836770688,"Abstract 1. The pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was separated into lipoamide hydrogenase (s020,w = 5.55 S) and a colorless fraction by the fractionation on a calcium phosphate gel-cellulose column in the presence of 4 m urea. Subsequently, in the presence of 0.3 m potassium iodide, the colorless fraction was fractionated into two additional components, pyruvate dehydrogenase (7.45 S) and partially resolved lipoate acetyltransferase, with ammonium sulfate. Highly purified lipoate acetyltransferase (28.2 S) was isolated by the resolution of the yellow fraction with 4 m urea, which was separated from the complex in the presence of 0.02 m ethanolamine (pH 9.4) on the calcium phosphate gel-cellulose column. 2. The molecular weights of the original complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lipoate acetyltransferase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and the reconstituted complex were approximately 7.4 million, 110,000, 150,000, 2.0 million, and 7.5 million, respectively. 3. All three isolated constituent enzymes were required to reconstitute coenzyme A- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. Reconstitution of these constituent enzymes to produce a large unit resembling the original complex in composition, hydrodynamic parameters, and enzymic activities was achieved. Lipoate acetyltransferase appears to possess specific binding sites for pyruvate dehydrogenase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. 4. Morphological resolution and reconstitution of the complex through electron microscopic data have been shown. The macromolecular organization of the complex is discussed."

At a concentration of 2x 10(-4) mole per liter, the drug is bacteriostatic, the syntheses of protein and DNA (but not that of RNA) are partially inhibited, and the bacteria grow into giant filaments. Impairment of DNA replication is proposed as the mode of action of quinacrine."
https://openalex.org/W1570376291,"Abstract Crystalline tryptophanase from Escherichia coli catalyzes a variety of α,β elimination and β replacement reactions corresponding, respectively, to Equations i and ii. RCH2CHNH2COOH + H2O→CH3COCOOH + RH + NH3 (i) RCH2CHNH2COOH + indole→tryptophan + RH (ii) The initial rates of these reactions were followed spectrophotometrically by measuring pyruvate formation in the presence and absence of indole by use of a coupled system containing reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide and lactate dehydrogenase. The affinity of tryptophanase for a given substrate is the same in Reaction i as in Reaction ii; consequently, association of the enzyme with indole, for which it shows high affinity (Km = 0.01 mm), does not result in any conformational change in the active site that is reflected in its affinity for its other substrates. Unlike indole, even high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide or methylmercaptan do not inhibit pyruvate formation in Reaction i and hence do not replace indole in β replacement reactions analogous to ii, although the corresponding amino acids, cysteine and S-methylcysteine, are excellent substrates for both reactions. These reactions are visualized as occurring by the mechanism outlined in Equations iii to v, where E represents tryptophanase. E + tryptophan (b)/⇌ E·amminoacrylate + indole (iii) E + RCH2CHNH2COOH ⇌ E·RCH2CHNH2COOH (b)/→ E·amminoacrylate + RH (iv) E·amminoacrylate + H2O → E + pyruvate + NH3 (v) Three kinetic cases can be distinguished: (a) the formation of pyruvate from tryptophan (Reactions iii + v), (b) the formation of pyruvate from other substrates (Reactions iv + v), and (c) the formation of tryptophan from other substrates plus indole (Reactions iv and iii in reverse). Rate equations derived for each of the three cases were tested graphically and were satisfied by kinetic data obtained with each of the five substrates (l-tryptophan, l-serine, l-cysteine, S-methyl-l-cysteine, and S-ethyl-l-cysteine) tested. In accordance with the proposed mechanism, an essentially identical value was obtained with all substrates for the kinetic parameter corresponding to the affinity constant of indole for the enzyme-aminoacrylate complex, the common intermediate in Reactions i and ii. This common intermediate decomposes to form tryptophanase, pyruvate, and ammonia at a rate approximately equal to that of dissociation of the enzyme-tryptophan complex. The maximal velocity of pyruvate formation from a given substrate in Reaction i is essentially identical with that of tryptophan synthesis from that same substrate in Reaction ii. Differences in the maximal velocity (Vmax) of Reactions i and ii are observed for different substrates, and these differences, considered in relation to the physical meaning of Vmax in terms of individual rate constants, provide strong kinetic evidence that the rate-determining step in each of the tryptophanase-catalyzed reactions lies in the removal of the β substituent from the substrate (Step b of Reactions iii and iv)."

https://openalex.org/W1502409094,"Abstract A deoxynucleotide kinase induced in Escherichia coli infected with T4 bacteriophage, purified 400-fold with respect to the crude extract, catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxythymidylate, deoxyguanylate, and 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate to the corresponding diphosphates. All three activities are inactivated at the same rate by heat and also by 8 m urea, and the three activities fractionate similarly during the purification scheme. This constitutes biochemical evidence that the three activities are catalyzed by a single enzyme. The following genetic evidence supports this view. Amber mutants of T4, defective in gene 1, do not induce any one of the three activities in the nonpermissive host, E. coli B. Spontaneous revertants of these mutants regain all three of the activities simultaneously. The enzyme induced by one of the mutants in the permissive host, E. coli CR 63, has an altered heat stability when compared to the enzyme induced by wild type T4 infecting the same host. These results indicate that a single structural gene in the bacteriophage is responsible for the synthesis of a single protein catalyzing all three activities."
https://openalex.org/W1487795266,"Fatty acyl coenzyme A-glycerol 3-phosphate, fatty acyl coenzyme A-lysophosphatidic acid, fatty acyl coenzyme A-monoglyceride, and fatty acyl coenzyme A-diglyceride acyltransferase activities were found in a particulate fraction of broken cell preparations of Escherichia coli. The synthesis of phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid catalyzed by these enzymes was demonstrated to be dependent upon the presence of glycerol 3-phosphate, fatty acyl-CoA, and magnesium ion. Magnesium ion was partially replaceable by calcium ion. Isolated, radiochemically pure lysophosphatidic acid served as a substrate in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid in an enzymatic reaction with fatty acyl-CoA. This observation suggests that lysophosphatidic acid functions as an intermediary in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid from glycerol 3-phosphate and fatty acyl-CoA. Under similar conditions of incubation both monoglyceride and diglyceride functioned as acceptors of the fatty acyl moiety from fatty acyl-CoA. Glycerol, however, did not serve as a substrate in the acylation reaction. Glycerol was incorporated into phospholipid only when adenosine triphosphate was added to an incubation system capable of acylating glycerol 3-phosphate. Lauryl, myristyl, palmityl, stearyl, oleyl, linoleyl, linolenyl, cis-vaccenyl, and trans-vaccenyl coenzyme A derivatives were tested and found to be active substrates in vitro in the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate. However, lauric, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, and trans-vaccenic acids have not been reported to exist as constituents of the phospholipids of E. coli. This finding suggests that the acyl transferase reaction does not possess the specificity required for excluding certain fatty acids which do not naturally occur in the phospholipids of E. coli."

By a variety of techniques, the enzyme preparation was shown to be homogeneous and to have a molecular weight of 59,000 daltons.

https://openalex.org/W1527882519,"A mutant of Escherichia coli that has an alteration in the structural gene for the alkaline phosphatase has been found to synthesize an anomalous subunit that is unable to dimerize under normal conditions of cell growth and, thus, cannot form active enzyme. This subunit was detected by the use of antibodies prepared against a chemically modified subunit obtained from the wild type enzyme. The mutationally altered subunit is detected only when the mutant's growth is limited by inorganic phosphate except in a constitutive strain in which this subunit is formed even though inorganic phosphate is present in the growth medium. When fully induced, cells produce 6% of their total protein as the defective subunit which can be released into the medium when spheroplasts are prepared with lysozyme. Inability to make the active dimeric form of this enzyme does not, therefore, affect the regulation of the synthesis of this protein or its localization to the bacterial cell's envelope. The addition of zinc ions and inorganic phosphate to cultures of this mutant or to extracts of sonically disrupted cells leads to the appearance of enzymatically active protein which differs in several respects from wild type alkaline phosphatase. Subunits prepared from a highly purified sample of the active form of the mutationally altered protein are similar to those found in the growing cells."

https://openalex.org/W1517193856,"Abstract Deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase, induced by the infection of Escherichia coli by T4 bacteriophage, specifically catalyzes an exchange between the hydrogen atom on carbon 5 of dCMP and water. The exchange is conveniently measured by the release of tritium from dCMP-5-3H into water. While tetrahydrofolate is required for the exchange, formaldehyde has been shown not to be involved. This exchange was not detectable in crude extracts of E. coli, but was found only in extracts of infected cells. The exchange activity was absent in extracts of cells infected by amber mutants of T4 which do not show dCMP hydroxymethylase activity. During purification of dCMP hydroxymethylase, the ratio of the rate of the over-all reaction to the rate of displacement of tritium from dCMP-5-3H remained constant. The rates of displacement of tritium from dCMP-5-3H, the incorporation of tritium ions from water into dCMP, and the incorporation of formaldehyde into hydroxymethyl dCMP have been compared. From these and other data, it has been concluded that the dCMP hydroxymethylase reaction consists of two reversible steps: the first, a tetrahydrofolate-dependent displacement of the hydrogen on carbon 5 of dCMP, and the second, the 5-hydroxymethylation of dCMP by formaldehyde or a derivative of formaldehyde, perhaps 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. The first step has been postulated to be a reaction between carbon 5 of dCMP and the enzyme. The relationship of the hydroxymethylase system to the thymidylate synthetase reaction has been discussed. The release of tritium from dCMP-5-3H is a specific and sensitive assay for dCMP hydroxymethylase. dCMP hydroxymethylase induced by the infection of E. coli with bacteriophage T4 exhibited essentially the same properties during purification as the enzyme induced by phage T6."

The exchange reaction exhibited an absolute requirement only for tetrahydrofolate. In the absence of formaldehyde or of Mg++, the exchange activity was reduced to about 25 and 40%, respectively, of the activity of the complete system, whereas the rates of both the over-all reaction and the displacement of tritium from deoxyuridylate-5-3H were reduced to about 5 and 25%, respectively. These findings have been interpreted as support for the reversible formation of an intermediate having a methylene bridge between carbon atom 5 of deoxyuridylate and nitrogen atom 5 of tetrahydrofolate."

Since all of the dihydro- derivatives were efficiently reduced by the action of dihydrofolate reductase from L1210 mouse leukemia cells, the tetrahydro- derivatives thus formed could be tested directly for cofactor and inhibitor activity with thymidylate synthetase. Although thymidylate synthetase of Escherichia coli showed relatively high sensitivity to changes in the amino acid part of the folate molecule, certain tetrahydro analogues were found to show cofactor activity. These included the aminoadipate, aminopimelate, β-methylglutamate, and lysine analogues of pteroylmonoglutamate.

Both methyl iodide and S-adenosyl-l-ethionine were about one-third as effective as S-adenosyl-l-methionine when the reducing system consisted of reduced flavin mononucleotide in the presence of dithiothreitol. However, methyl iodide was only 14% as effective as S-adenosyl-l-methionine in a 2-mercaptoethanol-vitamin B12-reducing system; S-adenosyl-l-ethionine exhibited negligible cofactor activity in this reducing system. In the presence of reduced flavin mononucleotide and dithiothreitol, S-methyl-l-methionine and ethyl iodide permitted a slow but significant rate of catalysis, whereas S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine was inactive. 14CH3-Methionine was identified as the radioactive transmethylation product from N5-methyl-14C-H4-folate when unlabeled methyl iodide was substituted for S-adenosyl-l-methionine in the reduced flavin mononucleotide system. From the cofactor activities given by various related compounds in a reduced flavin mononucleotide-dithiothreitol-reducing system, it is tentatively suggested that S-adenosyl-l-methionine activates the vitamin B12 enzyme by methylation. A reactive methyl or ethyl group appeared to be the essential structural feature for S-adenosyl-l-methionine-like cofactor activity."

https://openalex.org/W1572162084,"Abstract The mechanism of the reactivity of the enzymes of fatty acid synthesis from Escherichia coli with thioester substrates of acyl carrier protein has been investigated by structural modification of this protein. Carboxypeptidase A treatment of acyl carrier protein releases the carboxyl-terminal residue, alanine, and 0.3 residue each of histidine and glutamine. Carboxypeptidase A-treated acyl carrier protein remains fully active as assayed in the malonyl-coenzyme A CO2-exchange reaction of fatty acid synthesis. Limited acid hydrolysis of acyl carrier protein at pH 2.0, 100°, results in the preferential cleavage and release of aspartic acid residues and rapidly inactivates the protein. After a single aspartic acid residue has been released, 80% of acyl carrier protein activity has been lost. Treatment of acyl carrier protein for 80 min at pH 2.0, 100°, results in the release of 0.39 mole of aspartic acid per mole of acyl carrier protein. Following this treatment a single peptide was isolated in large yield. This peptide comprised three-fourths of the molecule and contained the intact carboxyl-terminal end of acyl carrier protein. The amino terminus of this peptide was serine, and the peptide was inactive in the malonyl-CoA CO2-exchange reaction. After tryptic hydrolysis of acyl carrier protein a peptide containing 42 amino acid residues was isolated. This peptide contained the intact prosthetic group. It had aminoterminal glutamic acid and the carboxyl-terminal sequence (Leu,Val)-Met-Ala-Lys, and was unable to replace acyl carrier protein, either in the malonyl-CoA CO2-exchange reaction or in long chain fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl tryptic peptide was unable to replace malonyl acyl carrier protein in the β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthetase reaction, thus explaining the inability of this peptide to function in long chain fatty acid synthesis. Acetoacetyl tryptic peptide was reduced slowly in the presence of β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase with a Michaelis constant of 1.7 x 10-3 m and a maximum velocity of 0.21 µmole of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidized per min per mg, compared to values of 6.6 x 10-5 m and 1.36 µmoles of TPNH oxidized per min per mg for acetoacetyl acyl carrier protein. This difference suggests that the site which confers the high reactivity of the acyl carrier protein substrate is missing in the tryptic peptide. The existence of such a site is indicated by the fact that free acyl carrier protein competitively inhibited (Ki = 2.2 x 10-4 m) the reduction of acetoacetyl acyl carrier protein catalyzed by β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase. The tryptic peptide at concentrations up to 5 x 10-4 m did not inhibit the reduction of acetoacetyl acyl carrier protein. These experiments suggest that acyl carrier protein interacts with β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase at a site different from the prosthetic group-active site interaction and that this site has been altered or lost upon tryptic digestion of acyl carrier protein. Further primary structure of acyl carrier protein is presented."

The tolerance persists without further drug treatment and is specific for donor tissue.

https://openalex.org/W180114417,"The incorporation of p-fluorophenylalanine into protein involves reactions that are similar to those occurring with phenylalanine. Although the initial rates are similar, the extent of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) loading is different for the two amino acids. The greater capacity for phenylalanine can be accounted for by degeneracy and not by errors in the tRNA loaded. Chromatography with methylated serum albumin under the conditions used was unable to resolve phenylalanyl-tRNA and p-fluorophenylalanyl-tRNA. Synthetic polyribonucleotides stimulated the incorporation of p-fluorophenylalanine; however, the effect of varying UC compositions in the polynucleotides on p-fluorophenylalanine and phenylalanine incorporation was consistent with degeneracy. It appears that only the AAA-containing tRNA (only the UUU codon) is accessible to p-fluorophenylalanine, while both UUU and UUC codons function with phenylalanine."

In small animals, dye injected intravenously provides immediate colouring of the skin over an intact vasculature."
