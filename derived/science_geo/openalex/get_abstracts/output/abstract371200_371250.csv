https://openalex.org/W2021714239,"Structural variations of DNA greater than 1 kilobase in size account for most bases that vary among human genomes, but are still relatively under-ascertained. Here we use tiling oligonucleotide microarrays, comprising 42 million probes, to generate a comprehensive map of 11,700 copy number variations (CNVs) greater than 443 base pairs, of which most (8,599) have been validated independently. For 4,978 of these CNVs, we generated reference genotypes from 450 individuals of European, African or East Asian ancestry. The predominant mutational mechanisms differ among CNV size classes. Retrotransposition has duplicated and inserted some coding and non-coding DNA segments randomly around the genome. Furthermore, by correlation with known trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified 30 loci with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease susceptibility. Despite this, having assessed the completeness of our map and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium between CNVs and SNPs, we conclude that, for complex traits, the heritability void left by genome-wide association studies will not be accounted for by common CNVs."
https://openalex.org/W1974259877,"Hominid fossils predating the emergence of Australopithecus have been sparse and fragmentary. The evolution of our lineage after the last common ancestor we shared with chimpanzees has therefore remained unclear. Ardipithecus ramidus , recovered in ecologically and temporally resolved contexts in Ethiopia’s Afar Rift, now illuminates earlier hominid paleobiology and aspects of extant African ape evolution. More than 110 specimens recovered from 4.4-million-year-old sediments include a partial skeleton with much of the skull, hands, feet, limbs, and pelvis. This hominid combined arboreal palmigrade clambering and careful climbing with a form of terrestrial bipedality more primitive than that of Australopithecus . Ar. ramidus had a reduced canine/premolar complex and a little-derived cranial morphology and consumed a predominantly C 3 plant–based diet (plants using the C 3 photosynthetic pathway). Its ecological habitat appears to have been largely woodland-focused. Ar. ramidus lacks any characters typical of suspension, vertical climbing, or knuckle-walking. Ar. ramidus indicates that despite the genetic similarities of living humans and chimpanzees, the ancestor we last shared probably differed substantially from any extant African ape. Hominids and extant African apes have each become highly specialized through very different evolutionary pathways. This evidence also illuminates the origins of orthogrady, bipedality, ecology, diet, and social behavior in earliest Hominidae and helps to define the basal hominid adaptation, thereby accentuating the derived nature of Australopithecus ."
https://openalex.org/W2034394760,"The slicer activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex resides within its Argonaute (Ago) component, in which the PIWI domain provides the catalytic residues governing guide-strand mediated site-specific cleavage of target RNA. Here we report on structures of ternary complexes of Thermus thermophilus Ago catalytic mutants with 5'-phosphorylated 21-nucleotide guide DNA and complementary target RNAs of 12, 15 and 19 nucleotides in length, which define the molecular basis for Mg(2+)-facilitated site-specific cleavage of the target. We observe pivot-like domain movements within the Ago scaffold on proceeding from nucleation to propagation steps of guide-target duplex formation, with duplex zippering beyond one turn of the helix requiring the release of the 3'-end of the guide from the PAZ pocket. Cleavage assays on targets of various lengths supported this model, and sugar-phosphate-backbone-modified target strands showed the importance of structural and catalytic divalent metal ions observed in the crystal structures."

https://openalex.org/W2073418703,"The femur and pelvis of Ardipithecus ramidus have characters indicative of both upright bipedal walking and movement in trees. Consequently, bipedality in Ar. ramidus was more primitive than in later Australopithecus . Compared with monkeys and Early Miocene apes such as Proconsul , the ilium in Ar. ramidus is mediolaterally expanded, and its sacroiliac joint is located more posteriorly. These changes are shared with some Middle and Late Miocene apes as well as with African apes and later hominids. However, in contrast to extant apes, bipedality in Ar. ramidus was facilitated by craniocaudal shortening of the ilium and enhanced lordotic recurvature of the lower spine. Given the predominant absence of derived traits in other skeletal regions of Ar. ramidus , including the forelimb, these adaptations were probably acquired shortly after divergence from our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. They therefore bear little or no functional relationship to the highly derived suspension, vertical climbing, knuckle-walking, and facultative bipedality of extant African apes."
https://openalex.org/W2145521965,"Referential models based on extant African apes have dominated reconstructions of early human evolution since Darwin’s time. These models visualize fundamental human behaviors as intensifications of behaviors observed in living chimpanzees and/or gorillas (for instance, upright feeding, male dominance displays, tool use, culture, hunting, and warfare). Ardipithecus essentially falsifies such models, because extant apes are highly derived relative to our last common ancestors. Moreover, uniquely derived hominid characters, especially those of locomotion and canine reduction, appear to have emerged shortly after the hominid/chimpanzee divergence. Hence, Ardipithecus provides a new window through which to view our clade’s earliest evolution and its ecological context. Early hominids and extant apes are remarkably divergent in many cardinal characters. We can no longer rely on homologies with African apes for accounts of our origins and must turn instead to general evolutionary theory. A proposed adaptive suite for the emergence of Ardipithecus from the last common ancestor that we shared with chimpanzees accounts for these principal ape/human differences, as well as the marked demographic success and cognitive efflorescence of later Plio-Pleistocene hominids."
https://openalex.org/W2047253662,"Genomic comparisons have established the chimpanzee and bonobo as our closest living relatives. However, the intricacies of gene regulation and expression caution against the use of these extant apes in deducing the anatomical structure of the last common ancestor that we shared with them. Evidence for this structure must therefore be sought from the fossil record. Until now, that record has provided few relevant data because available fossils were too recent or too incomplete. Evidence from Ardipithecus ramidus now suggests that the last common ancestor lacked the hand, foot, pelvic, vertebral, and limb structures and proportions specialized for suspension, vertical climbing, and knuckle-walking among extant African apes. If this hypothesis is correct, each extant African ape genus must have independently acquired these specializations from more generalized ancestors who still practiced careful arboreal climbing and bridging. African apes and hominids acquired advanced orthogrady in parallel. Hominoid spinal invagination is an embryogenetic mechanism that reoriented the shoulder girdle more laterally. It was unaccompanied by substantial lumbar spine abbreviation, an adaptation restricted to vertical climbing and/or suspension. The specialized locomotor anatomies and behaviors of chimpanzees and gorillas therefore constitute poor models for the origin and evolution of human bipedality."

https://openalex.org/W1977421720,"Several elements of the Ardipithecus ramidus foot are preserved, primarily in the ARA-VP-6/500 partial skeleton. The foot has a widely abducent hallux, which was not propulsive during terrestrial bipedality. However, it lacks the highly derived tarsometatarsal laxity and inversion in extant African apes that provide maximum conformity to substrates during vertical climbing. Instead, it exhibits primitive characters that maintain plantar rigidity from foot-flat through toe-off, reminiscent of some Miocene apes and Old World monkeys. Moreover, the action of the fibularis longus muscle was more like its homolog in Old World monkeys than in African apes. Phalangeal lengths were most similar to those of Gorilla . The Ardipithecus gait pattern would thus have been unique among known primates. The last common ancestor of hominids and chimpanzees was therefore a careful climber that retained adaptations to above-branch plantigrady."
https://openalex.org/W2047001575,"A diverse assemblage of large mammals is spatially and stratigraphically associated with Ardipithecus ramidus at Aramis. The most common species are tragelaphine antelope and colobine monkeys. Analyses of their postcranial remains situate them in a closed habitat. Assessment of dental mesowear, microwear, and stable isotopes from these and a wider range of abundant associated larger mammals indicates that the local habitat at Aramis was predominantly woodland. The Ar. ramidus enamel isotope values indicate a minimal C4 vegetation component in its diet (plants using the C4 photosynthetic pathway), which is consistent with predominantly forest/woodland feeding. Although the Early Pliocene Afar included a range of environments, and the local environment at Aramis and its vicinity ranged from forests to wooded grasslands, the integration of available physical and biological evidence establishes Ar. ramidus as a denizen of the closed habitats along this continuum."
https://openalex.org/W2157046704,"The Ardipithecus ramidus hand and wrist exhibit none of the derived mechanisms that restrict motion in extant great apes and are reminiscent of those of Miocene apes, such as Proconsul. The capitate head is more palmar than in all other known hominoids, permitting extreme midcarpal dorsiflexion. Ar. ramidus and all later hominids lack the carpometacarpal articular and ligamentous specializations of extant apes. Manual proportions are unlike those of any extant ape. Metacarpals 2 through 5 are relatively short, lacking any morphological traits associable with knuckle-walking. Humeral and ulnar characters are primitive and like those of later hominids. The Ar. ramidus forelimb complex implies palmigrady during bridging and careful climbing and exhibits none of the adaptations to vertical climbing, forelimb suspension, and knuckle-walking that are seen in extant African apes."
https://openalex.org/W2170228902,"The Middle Awash Ardipithecus ramidus sample comprises over 145 teeth, including associated maxillary and mandibular sets. These help reveal the earliest stages of human evolution. Ar. ramidus lacks the postcanine megadontia of Australopithecus . Its molars have thinner enamel and are functionally less durable than those of Australopithecus but lack the derived Pan pattern of thin occlusal enamel associated with ripe-fruit frugivory. The Ar. ramidus dental morphology and wear pattern are consistent with a partially terrestrial, omnivorous/frugivorous niche. Analyses show that the ARA-VP-6/500 skeleton is female and that Ar. ramidus was nearly monomorphic in canine size and shape. The canine/lower third premolar complex indicates a reduction of canine size and honing capacity early in hominid evolution, possibly driven by selection targeted on the male upper canine."
https://openalex.org/W1992206577,"Sediments containing Ardipithecus ramidus were deposited 4.4 million years ago on an alluvial floodplain in Ethiopia’s western Afar rift.

Geological data presented here, along with floral, invertebrate, and vertebrate paleontological and taphonomic evidence associated with the hominids, suggest that they occupied a wooded biotope over the western three-fourths of the paleotransect. Phytoliths and oxygen and carbon stable isotopes of pedogenic carbonates provide evidence of humid cool woodlands with a grassy substrate."

Anatomical comparisons and micro–computed tomography–based analysis of this and other remains reveal pre- Australopithecus hominid craniofacial morphology and structure. The Ardipithecus ramidus skull exhibits a small endocranial capacity (300 to 350 cubic centimeters), small cranial size relative to body size, considerable midfacial projection, and a lack of modern African ape–like extreme lower facial prognathism. Its short posterior cranial base differs from that of both Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus . Ar. ramidus lacks the broad, anteriorly situated zygomaxillary facial skeleton developed in later Australopithecus .

https://openalex.org/W2069253142,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) are enzymes that modify target proteins by the addition and removal, respectively, of ADP-ribose polymers. Although a role for PARP-1 in gene regulation has been well established, the role of PARG is less clear. To investigate how PARP-1 and PARG coordinately regulate global patterns of gene expression, we used short hairpin RNAs to stably knock down PARP-1 or PARG in MCF-7 cells followed by expression microarray analyses. Correlation analyses showed that the majority of genes affected by the knockdown of one factor were similarly affected by the knockdown of the other factor. The most robustly regulated common genes were enriched for stress-response and metabolic functions. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, PARP-1 and PARG localized to the promoters of positively and negatively regulated target genes. The levels of chromatin-bound PARG at a given promoter generally correlated with the levels of PARP-1 across the subset of promoters tested. For about half of the genes tested, the binding of PARP-1 at the promoter was dependent on the binding of PARG. Experiments using stable re-expression of short hairpin RNA-resistant catalytic mutants showed that PARP-1 and PARG enzymatic activities are required for some, but not all, target genes. Collectively, our results indicate that PARP-1 and PARG, nuclear enzymes with opposing enzymatic activities, localize to target promoters and act in a similar, rather than antagonistic, manner to regulate gene expression."

The approved NRTIs are nucleoside or nucleotide analogs that are phosphorylated to their triphosphate or diphosphate active metabolites in cells (Fig. 1). NRTIs, once incorporated into the viral DNA, act as DNA chain terminators due to the lack of a 3′-OH group.

These structures provide the basic framework for understanding DNA polymerization and binding of TFV-DP to RT, but they do not explain the effects of the K65R mutation on polymerization, excision, or TFV resistance.

Here we report the crystal structures of ternary complexes of K65R mutant RT·dsDNA with TFV-DP or the natural substrate dATP. The K65R crystal structures presented here show how this mutation restricts the structural adaptability of the enzyme by forming a molecular platform involving the conserved residue Arg72; the platform may discriminate against the incorporation of NRTIs, interfere with the binding of ATP as an excision substrate, and interact with other NRTI resistance mutations.

The 20-mer primer DNA (5′-ACA GTC CCT GTT CGG GCG CC-3′) bearing a cross-linkable thioalkyl tether (on G in the sequence) was synthesized and annealed to the template. The 27:20-mer dsDNA was cross-linked to K65R RT at the p66 C258 site, the cross-linked primer was extended with a dideoxy-G at the 3′-end through RT polymerization (33.Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D.

The K65R RT·dsDNA sample was co-crystallized with TFV-DP by hanging drop vapor diffusion against the well solution containing 50 mm Bistris propane, pH 6.4, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2). The crystallization drops, containing 2 μl of RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP added to 2 μl of the well solution, produced crystals in 2–3 weeks at 4 °C. Crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·dATP were obtained by soaking the crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP in the well solution containing 10 mm dATP for 10 min. The substitution of TFV-DP by dATP in the crystal by soaking was confirmed using a fluorescent dATP analog (supplemental Fig. 1). Crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP complex were stabilized in crystallization buffer containing 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 and then cryoprotected by dipping in the respective transfer solution containing 25% glycerol for ∼5 s and cryocooled in liquid N2. The x-ray diffraction data sets were collected at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source beam line F1. Three different data sets, each to 3 Å resolution, were collected from three crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP; two crystals grew in the presence of MgCl2, and one grew in the presence of MnCl2. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the protein atoms from the wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP structure (29.Tuske S. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Naeger L.K. White K.L.

The difference electron density (|Fo| − |Fc|) maps were strong and clear for TFV-DP (Fig. 2A), the model for which was not included in the initial stages of refinement. Cycles of model building and refinement using one of the three data sets yielded the final structure of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP (Table 1). Binding of one metal at the polymerase active site in the current structures was confirmed by the electron density map calculated from the crystal that contained MnCl2 during crystallization (supplemental Fig. 3).TABLE 1Diffraction data and refinement statisticsK65R mutant RT·dsDNA·TFV-DPK65R mutant RT·dsDNA·dATPProtein Data Bank code3JSM3JYTX-ray sourceCHESS F1CHESS F1No. of crystals used13Wavelength (Å)0.91790.9179Space groupP3112P3112Cell constants (a, b, c in Å; α, β, γ in degrees)170.31, 170.31, 155.44; 90, 90, 120169.72, 169.72, 155.41; 90, 90, 120Resolution range (Å)50.0–3.050–3.3No. of unique reflections (no. of observations)49,494 (164,942)37,809 (510,405)Completeness (%)95.998.6RmergeaRmerge = Σhkl Σi |I(hkl)i − 〈I(hkl)〉|/Σhkl Σi 〈I(hkl)i〉.

Open table in a new tab The K65R RT·dsDNA·dATP complex was obtained by soaking the crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP in crystallization solution containing 10 mm dATP for 10 min. The soaked crystals were stabilized at 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 and cryoprotected following the procedure described for TFV-DP-containing crystals. The 10 mm concentration of dATP was maintained in both the stabilization and cryoprotectant solutions. The dATP-soaked crystals were very sensitive to x-ray exposure; therefore, diffraction data from three crystals were merged to obtain an almost complete data set (Table 1) with high redundancy. High redundancy (∼13.5) of data resulted in a relatively high Rmerge value; however, the merged overall data set produced better quality electron density maps compared with the maps from less complete individual data sets. The K65R RT·dsDNA model from the K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP structure was used to determine the structure of the K65R RT·dsDNA·dATP complex. Programs CNS 1.2 (35.Brunger A.T. Nat.

The diffraction data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. The coordinates and structure factors for the crystal structures of K65R mutant RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP and K65R mutant RT·dsDNA·dATP complexes are available from the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3JSM and 3JYT, respectively. For the biochemical studies, wild-type and K65R mutant heterodimeric p66/p51 HIV-1 RT were expressed and purified as described (27.White K.L. Margot N.A. Ly J.K. Chen J.M. Ray A.S. Pavelko M. Wang R. McDermott M. Swaminathan S. Miller M.D. AIDS. 2005; 19: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The DNA 19-mer primer (5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAC) and 36-mer template D36A (5′-TCTCTATGTGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCTGAAAGC) were used in the study. Pre-steady state constants (kpol) were determined using dATP (Roche Applied Science) or dATP-α-S (Sp isomer) (Biolog, Bremen, Germany) at 5 times the Kd value (200 μm for wild-type RT and 75 μm for K65R RT) and 100 nm active wild-type or K65R RT with a KinTek rapid quench-flow apparatus as described (37.Feng J.Y. Shi J. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of K65R RT·27:21-mer dsDNA·TFV-DP (supplemental Fig. 2) was determined at 3.0 Å resolution and refined to Rwork and Rfree of 0.252 and 0.285, respectively, using 49,494 reflections (Table 1). Multiple crystal form averaging using three independent data sets yielded improved and unbiased electron density maps that helped to enhance the quality of this structure. The ternary complex of K65R RT crystallized in a crystal form similar to that of wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP (29.Tuske S. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Naeger L.K. White K.L. Miller M.D. Gibbs C.S. Boyer P.L. Clark P. Wang G. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Comparison of the wild type and K65R mutant structures shows similar RT conformation, mode of dsDNA-binding, and crystal packing; the root mean square deviation for all Cα atoms is ∼0.5 Å when both structures are overlaid. The position and conformation of TFV-DP in the new structure could be determined by well defined electron density in difference maps calculated prior to the inclusion of the TFV-DP molecule in the refinement (Fig. 2A). The TFV-DP molecule in the structure unambiguously fits the electron density in a low energy conformation, base-pairs with the first template overhang, and coordinates a catalytic Mg2+ ion via three phosphate oxygen atoms. As observed in the wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP crystal structure, only one Mg2+ ion (metal-B) is present in the polymerase active site that coordinates with the catalytic aspartates Asp110 and Asp185, the main-chain carbonyl of Val111, and one oxygen atom from each phosphate group of TFV-DP. The presence of only one metal ion at the active site of the current structure was confirmed by determining the crystal structure of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP with Mn2+ ions (supplemental Fig. 3) replacing Mg2+ ions, which is in agreement with our earlier analysis (38.Das K. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicating that the binding of the second Mg2+ ion at the polymerase active site requires coordination with Asp186. In the current structures, the side chain of D186 has turned away from the putative metal-A binding site. Amino acid residues K65R, Arg72, and Tyr115, which interact with TFV-DP, are clearly defined in the electron density map (Fig. 2), and key interactions of RT with the bound nucleotide substrate are maintained. The mutated residue K65R has an orientation similar to Lys65 in the wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP (29.Tuske S. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Naeger L.K. White K.L. Miller M.D. Gibbs C.S. Boyer P.L. Clark P. Wang G. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and wild-type RT·dsDNA·dTTP structures (28.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) where one of the guanidinium Nη nitrogens interacts with the γ-phosphate oxygen (N … O distance of 2.6 Å). The other guanidinium Nη nitrogen of K65R interacts with the oxygen atom linking the β- and γ-phosphates of TFV-DP, which mimics the interaction of K65 with TFV-DP in the wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP structure (29.Tuske S. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Naeger L.K. White K.L. Miller M.D. Gibbs C.S. Boyer P.L. Clark P. Wang G. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The major difference between wild-type and the K65R RT structures is at the β3-β4 fingers loop. The Cα position of Arg65 on the flexible β3-β4 loop is displaced (“pushed back”) by about the length of a covalent bond (∼1.5 Å) compared with the Cα position of Lys65 in the dTTP-bound wild-type RT structure for accommodating 1-bond length longer arginine when substituted for lysine (supplemental Fig. 3). The rearrangement of the β3-β4 loop accommodates a sulfate ion that interacts with the side chain of Arg72 and the main chain amide group of Lys66. The guanidinium plane of K65R is stacked with the guanidinium plane of Arg72 with an approximate distance of 3.8 Å between the two guanidinium planes. The Arg72 guanidinium plane is also stacked on its other side with the adenine base of TFV-DP. Arg72 is a highly conserved amino acid residue that is critical for RT function. The side chain of Arg72 interacts with all three components (base, sugar, and α-phosphate) of an incoming dNTP (Fig. 2) and is expected to stabilize the transition state of the nucleophilic attack by the 3′-end of the primer on the α-phosphate of the dNTP. A comparison of the crystal structures of the RT ternary complexes suggests that the stacking of the guanidinium groups of K65R and the conserved Arg72 imposes a constraint on adaptability of both of the amino acid residues. To obtain a better understanding of how the K65R mutation helps RT discriminate between TFV-DP and dATP, we also determined the crystal structure of the K65R mutant RT·dsDNA·dATP complex. Our attempt to co-crystallize dATP with the 27:21-mer dsDNA cross-linked K65R mutant RT produced crystals that had a shape similar to the rodlike crystals of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP complex; however, the crystals of the dATP complex did not grow to a size suitable for diffraction studies. Therefore, the feasibility of exchanging the incoming nucleotides was evaluated. Crystals of the RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP complex were soaked with 5 mm 2AP-TP for 5 min, and fluorescence of 2-aminopurine was measured. The resulting fluorescence demonstrated that 2AP-TP had replaced TFV-DP (supplemental Fig. 1). This approach was used to obtain the structure of the RT·dsDNA·dATP complex by soaking the natural substrate dATP into the crystals of RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP complex. The soaked crystals diffracted X-rays to 3.3 Å compared with the 3.0 Å resolution diffraction from the parent RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP crystals. The dATP-soaked crystals were relatively sensitive to radiation damage, and diffraction data from three crystals were merged to obtain the final data set. The structure solution revealed clear electron density for the dATP molecule and the interacting amino acid residues (Fig. 2B). The final model was refined to Rwork and Rfree of 0.253 and 0.287, respectively, using a total of 37,789 reflections (Table 1). The overall structure of K65R RT·dsDNA·dATP complex is similar to that of K65R RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP complex. The adenine bases and the triphosphates of TFV-DP and dATP superimpose when the two ternary complex structures of K65R mutant RT are compared (Fig. 3A). TFV-DP has an acyclic phosphonomethoxypropyl group substituted for the ribose α-phosphate moiety of dATP (Fig. 1); this difference can be seen in the superimposed structures. In the dATP-bound structure, the ribose ring is stacked against the aromatic ring of Tyr115. The 3′-OH of dATP forms a hydrogen bond network with its β-phosphate oxygen (3.1 Å) and the main-chain amino group of Tyr115 (distance 3.1 Å). Because TFV-DP lacks a 3′-OH group, the interactions that involve the 3′-OH of dATP are not present, and the methyl group of TFV-DP stacks with Tyr115 in a way that is analogous to but less extensive than the stacking of the ribose ring of dATP and Tyr115. Superposition of the two structures shows that the oxygen atom in the phosphonomethoxypropyl group of TFV-DP is positioned ∼1.7 Å away from the ribose C4* atom of dATP (Fig. 3A), which reorients the side-chain rotameric conformation of Arg72. In the TFV-DP-bound K65R RT structure, Arg72 has a rotameric conformation (rotamer-2) that is analogous to the orientation of Arg72 in the wild-type RT·dsDNA·TFV-DP structure (29.Tuske S. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Naeger L.K. White K.L. Miller M.D. Gibbs C.S. Boyer P.L. Clark P. Wang G. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Jerina D.M. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Nat. Struct. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2121774886,"High density lipoprotein (HDL), the carrier of so-called ""good"" cholesterol, serves as the major athero-protective lipoprotein and has emerged as a key therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease. We applied small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation and selective isotopic deuteration to the study of nascent HDL to obtain the low resolution structure in solution of the overall time-averaged conformation of apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) versus the lipid (acyl chain) core of the particle. Remarkably, apoA-I is observed to possess an open helical shape that wraps around a central ellipsoidal lipid phase. Using the low resolution SANS shapes of the protein and lipid core as scaffolding, an all-atom computational model for the protein and lipid components of nascent HDL was developed by integrating complementary structural data from hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and previously published constraints from multiple biophysical techniques. Both SANS data and the new computational model, the double superhelix model, suggest an unexpected structural arrangement of protein and lipids of nascent HDL, an anti-parallel double superhelix wrapped around an ellipsoidal lipid phase. The protein and lipid organization in nascent HDL envisages a potential generalized mechanism for lipoprotein biogenesis and remodeling, biological processes critical to sterol and lipid transport, organismal energy metabolism, and innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2148865869,"We hypothesized that willingness to financially support conservation depends on one's experience with nature. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a novel time-lagged correlation analysis to look at times series data concerning nature participation, and evaluate its relationship with future conservation support (measured as contributions to conservation NGOs). Our results suggest that the type and timing of nature experience may determine future conservation investment. Time spent hiking or backpacking is correlated with increased conservation contributions 11-12 years later. On the other hand, contributions are negatively correlated with past time spent on activities such as public lands visitation or fishing. Our results suggest that each hiker or backpacker translates to $200-$300 annually in future NGO contributions. We project that the recent decline in popularity of hiking and backpacking will negatively impact conservation NGO contributions from approximately 2010-2011 through at least 2018."

IntroductionDystrophin is a large cytoplasmic protein located at the inner face of the sarcolemma in muscle cells. The N-terminal portion of the protein binds actin, and the C-terminal portion binds β-dystroglycan, which is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex; this complex is believed to provide a framework that connects the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton (1.Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Because of this structural organization, dystrophin has been postulated to protect fibers against mechanical damage. Knowledge of the role of dystrophin in skeletal muscle has been gained by intensive studies of muscles from patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 2The abbreviations used are: DMDDuchenne muscular dystrophyDAPCdystrophin-associated protein complexSOCstore-operated channelSOCEstore-operated calcium entryMSmechanosensitivesiRNAsmall interfering RNAshRNAshort hairpin RNAFLfull-lengthGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseBSAbovine serum albuminTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateFAM6-carboxyfluoresceinTAMRA6-carboxytetramethylrhodamineSERCAsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase. as well as from mdx mice, the animal model of the genetic disease. In very severe DMD phenotypes, the total absence of dystrophin leads to necrosis of skeletal muscle and results in a reduction or complete absence of dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) components such as sarcoglycans and syntrophins (2.Peters M.F.

The binding of syntrophins to a variety of channels or enzymes has contributed to the idea that these proteins are molecular adaptors that confer a signaling role to the DAPC. α1-Syntrophin is the predominant syntrophin isoform in skeletal and cardiac muscles (4.Adams M.E.

Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) showed that complete or partial depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum stores during repetitive activation of calcium release stimulates store-operated calcium entry. Recent studies have revealed high levels of Orai1 (19.Vig M. DeHaven W.I. Bird G.S. Billingsley J.M. Wang H. Rao P.E. Hutchings A.B. Jouvin M.H. Putney J.W. Kinet J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and STIM1 at the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (20.Stiber J. Hawkins A. Zhang Z.S. Wang S. Burch J. Graham V. Ward C.C. Seth M. Finch E. Malouf N. Williams R.S. Eu J.P. Rosenberg P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) in skeletal muscle as well as a requirement for STIM1 in SOCE and in the contractile function of skeletal muscle (20.Stiber J. Hawkins A. Zhang Z.S. Wang S. Burch J. Graham V. Ward C.C. Seth M. Finch E. Malouf N. Williams R.S. Eu J.P. Rosenberg P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The localization of STIM1 at the sarcoplasmic reticulum suggests its involvement in the activation of SOCs and calcium influx through the membrane of T-tubule, which occurs after calcium release (21.Launikonis B.S. Rios E. J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).At the sarcolemma, TRPC1 and TRPC4 are involved in a cationic channel with activity enhanced by the depletion of calcium stores by thapsigargin (22.Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and with many biophysical properties similar to those of the mechanosensitive (MS) channels recorded in the same preparation (23.Ducret T. Vandebrouck C. Cao M.L. Lebacq J. Gailly P. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, a stretch-activated channel, as well as a SOC, was shown to be encoded by the TRPC1 gene (24.Maroto R. Raso A. Wood T.G. Kurosky A. Martinac B. Hamill O.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that MS channels and SOCs may represent the same channel, constituted by at least TRPC1. The activity of MS channels (25.Franco-Obregon A. Lansman J.B. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26.Franco-Obregon Jr., A. Lansman J.B. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is higher in dystrophin-deficient muscle cells. The sarcolemma of dystrophin-deficient muscle also displays cation channels that are active when muscles are at rest, with greater open probability (28.Hopf F.W. Reddy P. Hong J. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22358-22367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and an antisense strategy suggested that the spontaneously active channels are constituted by TRPC protein (22.Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These studies and others led to the hypothesis that the DAPC may control TRPC-MS/SOC channels at the sarcolemma and that is involved in regulating subsarcolemmal calcium concentration. These channels could be regulated directly in normal cells by the presence of the DAPC, which could explain the enhanced SOCE observed in dystrophin-deficient muscles (29.Boittin F.X. Petermann O. Hirn C. Mittaud P. Dorchies O.M. Roulet E. Ruegg U.T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30.Vandebrouck A. Ducret T. Basset O. Sebille S. Raymond G. Ruegg U. Gailly P. Cognard C. Constantin B. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In accordance with this idea, we recently reported that when transfected in dystrophin-deficient myotubes, recombinant mini-dystrophin or α1-syntrophin forms a complex with TRPC1 channels and restores normal divalent cation entry after store depletion (7.Vandebrouck A. Sabourin J. Rivet J. Balghi H. Sebille S. Kitzis A. Raymond G. Cognard C. Bourmeyster N. Constantin B. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because TRPC1 has the ability to form heteromeric channels, the association with other TRPC was explored. Several contributions have shown that TRPC1 and TRPC4 associate to build a cation channel that is permeable to calcium (31.Beech D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that reducing TRPC1 and TRPC4 expression decreases the occurrence of store-operated currents recorded at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers (22.Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).These data and the association of TRPC1 with endogenous complex α1-syntrophin/dystrophin prompted us to investigate whether α1-syntrophin, the predominant syntrophin isoform in striated muscle, could play a crucial role in regulating the sarcolemmal cation channels supported by TRPC1 and TRPC4. We thus performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments to establish whether the reduction of α1-syntrophin could result in cation influx deregulation. Deletion of the N terminus corresponding to the PH1a (pleckstrin homology 1a) and PDZ domains, as well as forced expression of the deleted α1-syntrophin in dystrophin-deficient myotubes, was also performed to determine whether the N-terminal domain is necessary for this regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs and Recombinant ProteinsFull-length (FL) Mus musculus α1-syntrophin cDNA was obtained from Stephen Gee (University of Ottawa, Canada) and subcloned in pCMS-enhanced GFP with NheI and NotI restriction enzymes and with two tandem N-terminal Myc epitope tags. The ΔN-α1-syntrophin was obtained by deleting a 162-bp fragment, which corresponds to the PH1a and PDZ domains. This cDNA was ligated into bicistronic pCMS-enhanced GFP. The GST-PDZ domain (amino acids 75–170 of α1-syntrophin) was obtained and produced by means of the plasmid pGEX-5X-3. Recombinant proteins were prepared as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (Tg1), purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with glutathione, and used as GST fusion proteins. Plasmids containing the cDNA of TRPC1 and TRPC4 were obtained from Dr. Craig Montell (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore).Cell Culture and TransfectionsExperiments were performed on two cell lines: dystrophin-deficient dys− SolC1 and one expressing mini-dystrophin minidys+ SolD6. These cell lines were cultured as described elsewhere (30.Vandebrouck A. Ducret T. Basset O. Sebille S. Raymond G. Ruegg U. Gailly P. Cognard C. Constantin B. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed on proliferative myoblasts, and experiments were performed on myotubes at days 3 and 4 after initiation of myoblasts fusion. For primary cultures, the procedure was as described elsewhere (7.Vandebrouck A. Sabourin J. Rivet J. Balghi H. Sebille S. Kitzis A. Raymond G. Cognard C. Bourmeyster N. Constantin B. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were transfected on the day of seeding in plastic dishes or glass coverslips using Nucleofector transfection (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). One million cells were centrifuged at 90 × g at room temperature for 10 min and resuspended at room temperature in Nucleofector solution (Nucleofector kit V) to a final concentration of 1 million cells/100 μl. The 100-μl cell suspension was mixed with plasmid solution prepared with a Qiagen plasmid purification maxi kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). For single transfection of syntrophin in bicistronic plasmid, 2 μg of ΔN-α1-syntrophin-EGFP or FL-α1-syntrophin-EGFP was diluted in cell suspension. For double transfection of TRPC1 or TRPC4 with EGFP, the 100-μl cell suspension was mixed with 1 μg of pmaxGFP and 5 μg of TRPC1 or TRPC4 plasmids. The cell suspension was submitted to a pulse protocol (Amaxa B-032, kit V) for nucleotransfection (Amaxa Biosystems). 500 μl of prewarmed culture medium was added to transfected cells, and the mix was added to the myoblasts.Silencing of α1-Syntrophin, TRPC1, and TRPC4 ExpressionWe obtained mouse SolD6 myotubes with reduced α1-syntrophin expression using transient transfection of siRNA. The siRNA silencing sequence (5′-AAGGUAUGAAUGUGCCGAUCUGCGC-3′ (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium)) was designed to target mouse α1-syntrophin mRNA (GenBankTM accession number NM_009228). SiRNA and its control (sequence with no homology with any known eukaryotic gene; Eurogentec) were transfected at 3 μg/1 million cells into SolD6 myoblasts using a Nucleofector transfection device. Silencing was also performed using the same transfection protocol with 3 μg of a bicistronic shRNA plasmid (SuperArray, Bioscience Corp.) encoding a short hairpin silencing sequence (5′-TGTGTTGGAGGTTAAGTACAT-3′). The bicistronic shRNA plasmid contains the shRNA under control of the U1 promoter and the EGFP cDNA to enable the identification of transfected myotubes. Silencing of the TRPC1 or TRPC4 gene was performed by means of the same transfection protocol using two different siRNA sequences (Eurogentec) against mouse TRPC1 mRNA (5′-GCAUCGUAUUUCACAUUCU-3′; 5′-UGAGCCUCUUGACAAACGA-3′) or against the mouse TRPC4 mRNA (5′-CCCUUUCCUUACUGCCUU-3′; 5′-CGAGUUCACUGAGUUUGU-3′).AntibodiesAntibodies used against TRPC1 and TRPC4 (Sigma-Aldrich) were rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and those against α1-syntrophin were goat and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Antibodies against dystrophin were rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NCLDYS2 mouse monoclonal (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK). Others antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and FluoProbes 488 anti-mouse IgG antibodies (FluoProbes, Interchim, Montluçon, France). Secondary antibodies for Western blotting (Amersham Biosciences) were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG.Pulldown AssaysTotal cell lysates were obtained from minidys+ SolD6. Cells were washed three times in cold 1× TBS (20 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) and then lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (w/v), 1% deoxycholate (w/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v)) in the presence of a 1% protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm leupeptin, 0.8 mm aprotinin, and 10 mm pepstatin). Protein lysates were homogenized by mechanical dissociation. The total protein concentration was measured by means of a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Glutathione S-transferase (60 μg) or fusion protein consisting of GST and α1-syntrophin PDZ domain (60 μg) was incubated with 600 μg of cell lysates in a volume of NET solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) at 4 °C overnight with constant mixing followed by washing three times in NET. The bound proteins were eluted in an equal volume (20 μl) of loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 90 °C. The bound proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with an anti-TRPC1 or anti-TRPC4 antibody.ImmunoprecipitationAfter cell lysis, 2 μg of antibody was added to 200 μl of cell lysates diluted with 600 μl of NET solubilization buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant mixing. Then, the protein-antibody complex was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing with 40 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in NET. After denaturing, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted with antibodies against dystrophin, TRPC1, TRPC4, c-Myc, and α1-syntrophin, probed for 1 h with 1:3000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular weight of proteins was estimated according to prestained protein markers (Rainbow, Sigma-Aldrich).Immunological StainingThe cultured cells were fixed in freshly made TBS, 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with TBS, 0.5% Triton X-100. A saturation step was executed with TBS, 1% BSA. Samples were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in TBS, 1% BSA (20 mm Tris base, 154 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). After washing out in TBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in TBS, 1% BSA with secondary antibodies. The cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Muscle tissue was fixed by perfusion of TBS, 4% paraformaldehyde in situ for 30 min. Skeletal muscles were removed by dissection from 4-week-old mice and immediately fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C. The fixed tissue was infused with a 30% sucrose solutions in PBS (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. Cryosections of muscle fibers were immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C for indirect immunofluorescence with primary antibodies diluted at 2–5 μg/ml after 4 h in blocking solution (TBS, 1% BSA). The immunolabeled samples were examined using an Olympus IX71 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and confocal images were acquired by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus confocal system (confocal FV-1000 station). The maximal resolution was obtained with an Olympus UplanSapo ×60 water, 1.2 NA, objective lens. Fluorophores were excited with a 488-nm line of an argon laser (for fluorescein isothiocyanate), a 543-nm line of a HeNe laser (for TRITC). The emitted fluorescence was detected through spectral detection channels between 500 and 530 nm and 550 and 625 nm, for green and red fluorescence, respectively.Measurement of Cation Influx Using Mn2+ Quenching of fura-2 FluorescenceMyotubes at 3 or 4 days were rinsed with an external 1.8 Ca2+ solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH) and incubated for 30 min in darkness and then for 15 min at 37 °C in the same solution supplemented with 3 μm (final concentration) fura-2/AM (FluoProbes). Loaded cells were washed with Ca2+-free solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH) before measurements were made. fura-2 was excited at 360 nm with a Cairn monochromator (Cairn Research Ltd., Faversham, UK), and emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm using an intensified cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photonic Science Ltd., Robertsbridge, UK) coupled to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (×40 water immersion fluorescence objective). Transfected cells were located by EGFP fluorescence at 520 nm with excitation at 450 nm. The cation influx was evaluated by the quenching of fura-2 fluorescence at 360 nm when Mn2+ ions entered the cell. Fluorescence variations were recorded using Imaging Workbench 4.0 (IW 4.0) software (INDEC BioSystems, Mountain View, CA). The depletion protocol was three 1-min applications of 0 Ca2+, 15 μm cyclopiazonic acid (reversible inhibitor of SERCA) alternating with three 1-min applications of free Ca2+, 5 μm cyclopiazonic acid + 10 mm caffeine solution. The quench rate of the fluorescence intensity was estimated using linear regression of the decaying phase (slope) during the first 40 s after Mn2+ addition (50 μm, final concentration). The quench rate was expressed as percent/minute to correct for differences in the cell size or fluorophore loading. Statistical analysis was performed with Origin 5.0 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). No bleaching was observed during fluorescence measurements or a decrease of less than 0.5%/min. The difference between the mean values of measured parameters was tested statistically using the Student's t test and was considered significant at p < 0.05.Membrane Potential RecordingsMembrane potential was recorded at room temperature from cultured myotubes using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Glass micropipettes (2–5 megohms) were connected to the head stage of the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) driven by an IBM PC-AT-compatible microcomputer equipped with an A/D-D/A conversion board (Digidata 1320A, Axon Instruments). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the pCLAMP software package (Axon Instruments). Resting membrane potential (Vm) was recorded with the whole-cell patch clamp technique using the current clamp mode (current was clamped to zero). In this case, pipettes were filled with an internal medium containing (mm): 1 MgCl2, 0.005 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH. The external medium was composed of (mm): 0.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5.6 glucose, 10 HEPES, 130 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, pH 7.4, with NaOH.Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-time PCRReverse TranscriptionTotal cellular RNA was extracted using RNABle kit (Eurobio). RNAs (10 μl) were reverse transcribed in 25 μl of reaction mixture consisting of first strand buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 37.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each dNTP, 2.4 mg of random hexamers, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (RNAguard, Amersham Biosciences), and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 60 min followed by 2 min at 100 °C. The solution was then diluted twice in water.Real-time PCRThe 15-μl reaction mixture contained 7.5 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 μl of reverse transcription products, and the appropriate primers and probes (900 and 200 nm, respectively). All probes contained a 3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) quencher dye and were labeled at the 5′-end with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) reporter fluorescent dye. Amplification was performed at 50 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (1 min). Reactions were performed in MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All measurements were normalized to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S6 (Mrps6, an endogenous control) to account for the variability in the initial concentration and quality of the total RNA.For α1-syntrophin, the forward primer was 5′-ACT-GAC-CCA-GAG-CCC-AGG-TA-3′, and the reverse primer was 3′-TTG-GCC-CTC-AAG-AAG-ACA-GC-5′; the probe was 5′-6-FAM-CCT-GGC-CGT-CCG-CTG-CAC-AGA-T-3′-TAMRA. For SP6 protein control, the forward primer was 5′-TTT-GAT-TCT-GAA-AGC-CAT-GCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 3′-CGG-TCC-ATC-AGG-GAT-TCT-ATT-G-3′; the probe was 5′-6-FAM-CGG-CCA-GAG-ACC-GCT-GCT-GCT-3′-TAMRA.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present new evidence for a crucial role of α1-syntrophin in regulating TRPC1- and TRPC4-dependent cation influx in skeletal muscle cells. We demonstrate the interaction of TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels with α1-syntrophin and the PDZ domain. Moreover, we show the requirement of this domain and of the presence of α1-syntrophin in the DAPC for normal regulation of TRPC-dependent cation entry.Several studies performed with dystrophin-deficient mice or human muscles have suggested that the DAPC regulates the activity of sarcolemmal cation channels responsible of sustained calcium influx (39.Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Steinhardt R.A. Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 45: 429-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among these voltage-independent channels with higher activity in dystrophin-deficient muscle, TRPC1 and TRPC4 (22.Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) have been shown to support sarcolemmal calc"

The carcasses of larger mammals were heavily ravaged by carnivores. Nearly 10,000 small-mammal remains appear to be derived primarily from decomposed owl pellets. The rich avifauna includes at least 29 species, mostly nonaquatic forms. Modern analogs of the most abundant birds and of a variety of rodents are associated with mesic woodland environments distant from large water bodies. These findings support inferences from associated geological, isotopic, invertebrate, and large-vertebrate assemblages. The combined results suggest that Ar. ramidus occupied a wooded Pliocene habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2109933964,"The physiology of two metabolites of vitamin A is understood in substantial detail: retinaldehyde functions as the universal chromophore in the vertebrate and invertebrate eye;retinoic acid regulates a set of vertebrate transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptor superfamily. The third member of this retinoid triumvirate is retinol. While functioning as the precursor of retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, a growing body of evidence suggests a far more fundamental role for retinol in signal transduction. Here we show that retinol is essential for the metabolic fitness of mitochondria. When cells were deprived of retinol, respiration and ATP synthesis defaulted to basal levels. They recovered to significantly higher energy output as soon as retinol was restored to physiological concentration, without the need for metabolic conversion to other retinoids. Retinol emerged as an essential cofactor of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), without which this enzyme failed to be activated in mitochondria. Furthermore, retinol needed to physically bind PKCδ, because mutation of the retinol binding site rendered PKCδ unresponsive to Rol, while retaining responsiveness to phorbol ester. The PKCδ/retinol complex signaled the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex for enhanced flux of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle. The baseline response was reduced in vitamin A-deficient lecithin:retinol acyl transferase-knockout mice, but this was corrected within 3h by intraperitoneal injection of vitamin A; this suggests that vitamin A is physiologically important. These results illuminate a hitherto unsuspected role of vitamin A in mitochondrial bioenergetics of mammals, acting as a nutritional sensor. As such, retinol is of fundamental importance for energy homeostasis. The data provide a mechanistic explanation to the nearly 100-yr-old question of why vitamin A deficiency causes so many pathologies that are independent of retinoic acid action.—Acin-Perez, T., Hoyos, B., Zhao, F., Vinogradov, V., Fischman, D.

https://openalex.org/W2032576808,"Truncating GLI3 mutations in Pallister-Hall Syndrome with renal malformation suggests a requirement for Hedgehog signaling during renal development. HH-dependent signaling increases levels of GLI transcriptional activators and decreases processing of GLI3 to a shorter transcriptional repressor. Previously, we showed that Shh-deficiency interrupts early inductive events during renal development in a manner dependent on GLI3 repressor. Here we identify a novel function for GLI3 repressor in controlling nephron number. During renal morphogenesis, HH signaling activity, assayed by expression of Ptc1-lacZ, is localized to ureteric cells of the medulla, but is undetectable in the cortex. Targeted inactivation of Smo, the HH effector, in the ureteric cell lineage causes no detectable abnormality in renal morphogenesis. The functional significance of absent HH signaling activity in cortical ureteric cells was determined by targeted deletion of Ptc1, the SMO inhibitor, in the ureteric cell lineage. Ptc1−/−UB mice demonstrate ectopic Ptc1-lacZ expression in ureteric branch tips and renal hypoplasia characterized by reduced kidney size and a paucity of mature and intermediate nephrogenic structures. Ureteric tip cells are remarkable for abnormal morphology and impaired expression of Ret and Wnt11, markers of tip cell differentiation. A finding of renal hypoplasia in Gli3−/− mice suggests a pathogenic role for reduced GLI3 repressor in the Ptc1−/−UB mice. Indeed, constitutive expression of GLI3 repressor via the Gli3Δ699 allele in Ptc1−/−UB mice restores the normal pattern of HH signaling, and expression of Ret and Wnt11 and rescued the renal phenotype. Thus, GLI3 repressor controls nephron number by regulating ureteric tip cell expression of Wnt11 and Ret."
https://openalex.org/W1974668232,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), strategically located at the cell-tissue-organ interface, regulate major biological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. These vital functions are compromised in tumors, due, in part, to alterations in heparan sulfate (HS) expression and structure. How these modifications occur is largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether epigenetic abnormalities involving aberrant DNA methylation affect HS biosynthetic enzymes in cancer cells. Analysis of the methylation status of glycosyltransferase and sulfotransferase genes in H-HEMC-SS chondrosarcoma cells showed a typical hypermethylation profile of 3-OST sulfotransferase genes. Exposure of chondrosarcoma cells to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc), a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, up-regulated expression of 3-OST1, 3-OST2, and 3-OST3A mRNAs, indicating that aberrant methylation affects transcription of these genes. Furthermore, HS expression was restored on 5-Aza-dc treatment or reintroduction of 3-OST expression, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and/or analysis of HS chains by anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Notably, 5-Aza-dc treatment of HEMC cells or expression of 3-OST3A cDNA reduced their proliferative and invading properties and augmented adhesion of chondrosarcoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W1974160054,"The evolution of Leishmania infection depends on the balance between microbicidal and suppressor macrophage functions. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR), a classic antiviral protein, is able to regulate a number of signaling pathways and macrophage functions. We investigated the possible role of PKR in the modulation of Leishmania infection. Our data demonstrated that Leishmania amazonensis infection led to PKR activation and increased PKR levels. Consistently, in macrophages from PKR knockout 129Sv/Ev mice and RAW-264.7 cells stably expressing a dominant-negative (DN) construct of PKR (DN-PKR), L. amazonensis infection was strongly reduced. The treatment of infected macrophages with the synthetic double-stranded RNA poly(I:C), a potent PKR inductor, increased L. amazonensis intracellular proliferation. This effect was reversed by 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a pharmacological inhibitor of PKR, as well as by the expression of DN-PKR. NO release induced by dsRNA treatment was inhibited by L. amazonensis through NF-κB modulation. PKR activation induced by dsRNA also resulted in IL-10 production, whose neutralization with specific antibody completely abrogated L. amazonensis proliferation. Our data demonstrated a new role of PKR in protozoan parasitic infection through IL-10 modulation.—Pereira, R. M. S., Teixeira, K. L. D., Barreto-de-Souza, V. Calegari-Silva, T. C., De-Melo, D.

Accordingly, a deficiency in HR or its deregulation leads to meiotic aneuploidy, genomic instability, and the tumor phenotype (for review, see Refs. 1.Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).HR is often initiated via the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). After DSB formation, the ends of the break are nucleolytically processed to yield single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails (for review, see Ref. 4.Raynard S. Niu H. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous single-strand DNA-binding protein RPA first decorates the ssDNA. RPA is subsequently replaced by the Rad51 recombinase to form a right-handed helical polymer, referred to as the presynaptic filament. This nucleoprotein complex conducts a search for a homologous DNA sequence and invades the latter to form a nascent DNA joint called the displacement loop, or D-loop (for review, see Ref. 5.San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). After invasion, the 3′ end of the invading strand primes DNA synthesis, which serves to replace the genetic information lost during the end-processing reaction and to expand the D-loop.The D-loop intermediate can be resolved by two mechanistically distinct pathways. In the synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing pathway, the invading DNA strand with its newly synthesized DNA extension is displaced from the information donor and subsequently annealed to the ssDNA tail that adjoins the second end of the break. The synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing mode of HR does not have the potential of generating crossover recombinants. In the DNA double-strand break repair pathway, the D-loop is maintained and recruits the second ssDNA tail by annealing, to assemble a double Holliday junction. The resolution of the double Holliday junction by a resolvase then yields a mixture of crossover and noncrossover recombinants (1.Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar).The Rad52 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is needed for two distinct stages of the HR process. As a recombination mediator, Rad52 helps nucleate Rad51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA to seed the assembly of the presynaptic filament (5.San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Later in the HR process Rad52 promotes the capture of the second DNA strand via its DNA annealing activity to help complete the synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing or double-strand break repair reaction (2.Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have revealed two distinct DNA binding domains in ScRad52, located within the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein (6.Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R.

Rad52 orthologs from different species exhibit the highest degree of relatedness in their amino-terminal region (8.Muris D.F. Bezzubova O. Buerstedde J.M. Vreeken K. Balajee A.S. Osgood C.J.

Genomics. 1994; 23: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain has no perceptible effect on the generation of single-end-invasion intermediates in meiotic recombination (12.Lao J.P. Oh S.D. Shinohara M. Shinohara A. Hunter N. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 517-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), one can infer that it is dispensable for second DNA end capture.In this study we have employed the rad52-R70A mutant, impaired in the amino-terminal DNA binding activity, to address the role of this activity in the known HR functions of S. cerevisiae Rad52. We provide biochemical evidence that this mutation does not affect Rad52 recombination mediator attribute but specifically impairs its ability to carry out the annealing of RPA-coated complementary DNA strands. Accordingly, rad52-R70A cells can initiate but fail to complete the mating type switching reaction that is triggered by an HO endonuclease-made DSB. These results, thus, identify the critical role fulfilled by the evolutionarily conserved amino-terminal DNA binding domain of Rad52 in HR.DISCUSSIONIn the Rad51-dependent recombination reaction, Rad52 plays an important role at two distinct stages of the process. Its early role at the presynaptic stage is to promote the assembly of the Rad51 presynaptic filament by mediating removal of RPA from the ssDNA tails that results from the resection of the ends of a DSB. Thus, Rad52 facilitates Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand invasion to form the D-loop intermediate in this manner. This recombination mediator or presynaptic role of Rad52 has been well characterized and studied. Fewer mechanistic details are available regarding the postsynaptic role of Rad52, wherein it has been postulated to mediate the annealing of the displaced DNA strand to the other end of the DSB (33.Sugiyama T. Kantake N. Wu Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5539-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34.Nimonkar A.V. Sica R.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rad52 is also involved in the single-strand annealing pathway of HR that is independent of Rad51.Our findings that the R70A mutation impairs the amino-terminal DNA binding activity of Rad52 and its ability to anneal RPA-coated ssDNA strands have allowed us to address the role of the conserved DNA annealing activity in HR. In concordance with this observation is the fact that rad52-R70A cells are deficient in the single-strand annealing reaction (22.Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Previously, cytological analysis has determined that the rad52-R70A mutant protein associates with DSBs normally and can efficiently promote the DSB recruitment of Rad51 as well (23.Lettier G. Feng Q. de Mayolo A.A. Erdeniz N. Reid R.J. Lisby M. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Importantly, through a variety of in vitro studies using purified proteins and also chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have furnished evidence that the recombination mediator function of Rad52 is intact in the rad52-R70A mutant, suggesting that the DNA annealing activity present in the Rad52 amino terminus is required at a later step in DSB repair. In support of this view, in vivo studies monitoring a DSB-induced, site-specific gene conversion event at MAT by PCR analyses have established that rad52-R70A cells are just as capable as wild-type cells in catalyzing DNA strand invasion but that the completion of the HR event is greatly reduced in the mutant. Knowing that the rad52-R70A mutant protein is impaired for its ability to anneal RPA-coated single DNA strands, we attribute the gene conversion defect seen in our in vivo studies to an inability of mutant cells to anneal the DNA strand liberated from the D-loop structure with the ssDNA tail associated with the second DNA end.Interestingly, the rad52-R70A mutant was originally identified as a mutant that exhibits sensitivity to γ-irradiation without affecting spontaneous interchromosomal heteroallelic HR (25.Mortensen U.H. Erdeniz N. Feng Q. Rothstein R. Genetics. 2002; 161: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, our results suggest that spontaneous HR depends on DNA strand invasion but that the DNA strand annealing activity of Rad52 is actually dispensable in this regard.In summary, the studies reported herein have provided insights into the biochemical and biological roles of the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of the S. cerevisiae Rad52 protein in homologous recombination. Our results should be useful toward delineating the role of the highly conserved amino-terminal domain of Rad52 orthologs in recombination processes in other eukaryotes.

Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Previously, cytological analysis has determined that the rad52-R70A mutant protein associates with DSBs normally and can efficiently promote the DSB recruitment of Rad51 as well (23.Lettier G. Feng Q. de Mayolo A.A. Erdeniz N. Reid R.J. Lisby M. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Importantly, through a variety of in vitro studies using purified proteins and also chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have furnished evidence that the recombination mediator function of Rad52 is intact in the rad52-R70A mutant, suggesting that the DNA annealing activity present in the Rad52 amino terminus is required at a later step in DSB repair. In support of this view, in vivo studies monitoring a DSB-induced, site-specific gene conversion event at MAT by PCR analyses have established that rad52-R70A cells are just as capable as wild-type cells in catalyzing DNA strand invasion but that the completion of the HR event is greatly reduced in the mutant. Knowing that the rad52-R70A mutant protein is impaired for its ability to anneal RPA-coated single DNA strands, we attribute the gene conversion defect seen in our in vivo studies to an inability of mutant cells to anneal the DNA strand liberated from the D-loop structure with the ssDNA tail associated with the second DNA end.Interestingly, the rad52-R70A mutant was originally identified as a mutant that exhibits sensitivity to γ-irradiation without affecting spontaneous interchromosomal heteroallelic HR (25.Mortensen U.H. Erdeniz N. Feng Q. Rothstein R. Genetics. 2002; 161: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, our results suggest that spontaneous HR depends on DNA strand invasion but that the DNA strand annealing activity of Rad52 is actually dispensable in this regard.In summary, the studies reported herein have provided insights into the biochemical and biological roles of the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of the S. cerevisiae Rad52 protein in homologous recombination. Our results should be useful toward delineating the role of the highly conserved amino-terminal domain of Rad52 orthologs in recombination processes in other eukaryotes. In the Rad51-dependent recombination reaction, Rad52 plays an important role at two distinct stages of the process. Its early role at the presynaptic stage is to promote the assembly of the Rad51 presynaptic filament by mediating removal of RPA from the ssDNA tails that results from the resection of the ends of a DSB. Thus, Rad52 facilitates Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand invasion to form the D-loop intermediate in this manner. This recombination mediator or presynaptic role of Rad52 has been well characterized and studied. Fewer mechanistic details are available regarding the postsynaptic role of Rad52, wherein it has been postulated to mediate the annealing of the displaced DNA strand to the other end of the DSB (33.Sugiyama T. Kantake N. Wu Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5539-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34.Nimonkar A.V. Sica R.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2084292282,"Three human influenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968. Influenza pandemic strains are the results of emerging viruses from non-human reservoirs to which humans have little or no immunity. At least two of these pandemic strains, in 1957 and in 1968, were the results of reassortments between human and avian viruses. Also, many cases of swine influenza viruses have reportedly infected humans, in particular, the recent H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin, isolated in Mexico and the United States. Pigs are documented to allow productive replication of human, avian, and swine influenza viruses. Thus it has been conjectured that pigs are the “mixing vessel” that create the avian-human reassortant strains, causing the human pandemics. Hence, studying the process and patterns of viral reassortment, especially in pigs, is a key to better understanding of human influenza pandemics. In the last few years, databases containing sequences of influenza A viruses, including swine viruses, collected since 1918 from diverse geographical locations, have been developed and made publicly available. In this paper, we study an ensemble of swine influenza viruses to analyze the reassortment phenomena through several statistical techniques. The reassortment patterns in swine viruses prove to be similar to the previous results found in human viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, that the surface glycoprotein coding segments reassort most often. Moreover, we find that one of the polymerase segments (PB1), reassorted in the strains responsible for the last two human pandemics, also reassorts frequently."
https://openalex.org/W2051162625,"Here we describe the identification of novel cell migration-promoting genes based on an unbiased functional genetic screen in cultured cells. After the introduction of the retroviral mouse brain cDNA library into NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, migration-promoted cells were selected by a 3-dimensional migration assay using cell culture inserts. After 5 rounds of enrichment, cDNAs were retrieved from the cells with a selected phenotype. Cell migration-promoting activity was confirmed by independent migration assays for the retrieved cDNAs, among which further investigation was focused on coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 2 (chchd2). Whereas overexpression of chchd2 promoted cell migration, knockdown of endogenous chchd2 expression reduced cell migration. Chchd2-induced cell migration was associated with augmented formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion, which was mediated through Akt, RhoA/ROCK, and Jnk pathways. CHCHD2 protein directly interacted with hyaluronic acid-binding protein 1 (HABP1) that possessed migration-suppressing activity. Intracellular localization and further functional studies suggested that CHCHD2 and HABP1 may mutually regulate each other to balance cell migration. Thus, chchd2 is a novel cell migration determinant identified by an in vitro functional genetic selection strategy. The selection method can also be useful for the isolation of genes that give other phenotypes of interest.—Seo, M., Lee, W.-H., Suk, K.

https://openalex.org/W1888120685,"Oxidative stress can damage the active site cysteine of the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin (Prx) to the sulfinic acid form, Prx-SO(2)(-). This modification leads to inactivation. Sulfiredoxin (Srx) utilizes a unique ATP-Mg(2+)-dependent mechanism to repair the Prx molecule. Using selective protein engineering that involves disulfide bond formation and site-directed mutagenesis, a mimic of the enzyme.substrate complex has been trapped. Here, we present the 2.1 A crystal structure of human Srx in complex with PrxI, ATP, and Mg(2+). The Cys(52) sulfinic acid moiety was substituted by mutating this residue to Asp, leading to a replacement of the sulfur atom with a carbon atom. Because the Srx reaction cannot occur, the structural changes in the Prx active site that lead to the attack on ATP may be visualized. The local unfolding of the helix containing C52D resulted in the packing of Phe(50) in PrxI within a hydrophobic pocket of Srx. Importantly, this structural rearrangement positioned one of the oxygen atoms of Asp(52) within 4.3 A of the gamma-phosphate of ATP bound to Srx. These observations support a mechanism where phosphorylation of Prx-SO(2)(-) is the first chemical step."

Here we show that receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) is an important positive regulator of Fyn activation and signaling that is required for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). PTPα is expressed in OPCs and is up-regulated during differentiation. We used two model systems to investigate the role of PTPα in OPC differentiation: the rat CG4 cell line where PTPα expression was silenced by small interfering RNA, and oligosphere-derived primary OPCs isolated from wild-type and PTPα-null mouse embryos. In both cell systems, the ablation of PTPα inhibited differentiation and morphological changes that accompany this process. Although Fyn was activated upon induction of differentiation, the level of activation was severely reduced in cells lacking PTPα, as was the activation of Fyn effector molecules focal adhesion kinase, Rac1, and Cdc42, and inactivation of Rho. Interestingly, another downstream effector of Fyn, p190RhoGAP, which is responsible for Rho inactivation during differentiation, was not affected by PTPα ablation. In vivo studies revealed defective myelination in the PTPα−/− mouse brain.

We investigated whether plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration and CD4 cell count at viral set-point have changed over time in the HIV epidemic in the Netherlands.We selected 906 therapy-naïve patients with at least one plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration measured 9 to 27 months after estimated seroconversion. Changes in HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count at viral set-point over time were analysed using linear regression models. The ATHENA national observational cohort contributed all patients who seroconverted in or after 1996; the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) contributed seroconverters before 1996. The mean of the first HIV-1 RNA concentration measured 9-27 months after seroconversion was 4.30 log(10) copies/ml (95% CI 4.17-4.42) for seroconverters from 1984 through 1995 (n = 163); 4.27 (4.16-4.37) for seroconverters 1996-2002 (n = 232), and 4.59 (4.52-4.66) for seroconverters 2003-2007 (n = 511). Compared to patients seroconverting between 2003-2007, the adjusted mean HIV-1 RNA concentration at set-point was 0.28 log(10) copies/ml (95% CI 0.16-0.40; p<0.0001) and 0.26 (0.11-0.41; p = 0.0006) lower for those seroconverting between 1996-2002 and 1984-1995, respectively. Results were robust regardless of type of HIV-1 RNA assay, HIV-1 subtype, and interval between measurement and seroconversion. CD4 cell count at viral set-point declined over calendar time at approximately 5 cells/mm(3)/year.The HIV-1 RNA plasma concentration at viral set-point has increased over the last decade of the HIV epidemic in the Netherlands. This is accompanied by a decreasing CD4 cell count over the period 1984-2007 and may have implications for both the course of the HIV infection and the epidemic."

Suppression of Aurora A by RNAi results in the loss of neuronal polarity. Aurora A interacts directly with the aPKC binding domain of Par3 and phosphorylates it at Ser962. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 is required for its function in the establishment of neuronal polarity.DISCUSSIONIn addition to its function during the cell cycle, Aurora A also regulates asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts by phosphorylating Par6 (10.Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, we show that rodent Aurora A phosphorylates Par3 at Ser962 and that Par3 Ser962 phosphorylation is required in hippocampal neurons for the formation of axons.Aurora A and B are expressed in hippocampal neurons during the initial stages of their differentiation. Suppression of Aurora A by RNAi results in the loss of neuronal polarity. After knockdown of Aurora A, neurons formed multiple neurites that were longer than minor neurites but lacked the characteristics of axons. These neurites were shorter than axons and showed no or only weak staining for the axonal marker Tau-1. Expression of inactive Aurora A had a similar phenotype, indicating that it has a dominant negative effect. Overexpression of Aurora A did not affect axon formation, probably because it has to be activated by upstream kinases or by association with other proteins (1.Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3.Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr.

Although Aurora B is also expressed in hippocampal neurons, expression of inactive Aurora B or its suppression by RNAi did not affect axon formation. These results demonstrate a novel function for Aurora A, which belongs to a growing list of proteins with important functions in cell cycle regulation and in postmitotic neurons (32.Frank C.L. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2009; 62: 312-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The phenotype of suppressing endogenous Aurora A in neurons is similar to that of Par3 (14.Schwamborn J.C. Khazaei M.R. Püschel A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35259-35268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We could show that Aurora A interacts directly with the Par3-aPKCBD and phosphorylates it. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 is important for axon formation. Wild type Par3 and the phosphomimic mutant Par3-S962D rescued the loss of endogenous Par3. By contrast, the nonphosphorylatable mutant Par3-S962A could not efficiently compensate for the knockdown of Par3. These results suggests that phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 by Aurora A promotes its function in axon formation.The ability to rescue the loss of endogenous Par3 by Par3-S962D but not Par3-S962A indicates that Par3 is one of the targets for Aurora A in hippocampal neurons. Unlike Par6, Par3-Ser962 phosphorylation does not appear to be involved in aPKC activation because the inhibition of aPKC (15.Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

However, preliminary results show that Aurora A phosphorylation does not affect the binding of these proteins. Future experiments will have to identify additional binding partners of Par3 that might be affected by Aurora A.Aurora A is necessary for the polarization of Drosophila neuroblasts and regulates aPKC recruitment to the Par complex (10.Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Aurora A phosphorylates Par6 and releases its inhibition of aPKC. Although Aurora A also phosphorylates mammalian Par6, the phosphorylation of Par3 does not appear to be conserved. Sequence comparison shows that the Aurora A phosphorylation site in Par3 is conserved in vertebrates but is not present in Drosophila Bazooka.In summary, our results show that Aurora A is required for the establishment of neuronal polarity. It binds to and phosphorylates Par3. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 contributes to its function in the establishment of neuronal polarity. The loss of Aurora A or a failure to phosphorylate Par3 at Ser962 leads to the loss of axons and the formation of multiple indeterminate neurites. IntroductionThe Aurora kinases are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that perform essential functions during the cell cycle (1.Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Suppression of Aurora A by RNAi results in the loss of neuronal polarity. Aurora A interacts directly with the aPKC binding domain of Par3 and phosphorylates it at Ser962. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 is required for its function in the establishment of neuronal polarity. DISCUSSIONIn addition to its function during the cell cycle, Aurora A also regulates asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts by phosphorylating Par6 (10.Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, we show that rodent Aurora A phosphorylates Par3 at Ser962 and that Par3 Ser962 phosphorylation is required in hippocampal neurons for the formation of axons.Aurora A and B are expressed in hippocampal neurons during the initial stages of their differentiation. Suppression of Aurora A by RNAi results in the loss of neuronal polarity. After knockdown of Aurora A, neurons formed multiple neurites that were longer than minor neurites but lacked the characteristics of axons. These neurites were shorter than axons and showed no or only weak staining for the axonal marker Tau-1. Expression of inactive Aurora A had a similar phenotype, indicating that it has a dominant negative effect. Overexpression of Aurora A did not affect axon formation, probably because it has to be activated by upstream kinases or by association with other proteins (1.Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3.Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Aurora kinases might not be sufficient by themselves to have an effect on axon formation. Although Aurora B is also expressed in hippocampal neurons, expression of inactive Aurora B or its suppression by RNAi did not affect axon formation. These results demonstrate a novel function for Aurora A, which belongs to a growing list of proteins with important functions in cell cycle regulation and in postmitotic neurons (32.Frank C.L. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2009; 62: 312-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The phenotype of suppressing endogenous Aurora A in neurons is similar to that of Par3 (14.Schwamborn J.C. Khazaei M.R. Püschel A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35259-35268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We could show that Aurora A interacts directly with the Par3-aPKCBD and phosphorylates it. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 is important for axon formation. Wild type Par3 and the phosphomimic mutant Par3-S962D rescued the loss of endogenous Par3. By contrast, the nonphosphorylatable mutant Par3-S962A could not efficiently compensate for the knockdown of Par3. These results suggests that phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 by Aurora A promotes its function in axon formation.The ability to rescue the loss of endogenous Par3 by Par3-S962D but not Par3-S962A indicates that Par3 is one of the targets for Aurora A in hippocampal neurons. Unlike Par6, Par3-Ser962 phosphorylation does not appear to be involved in aPKC activation because the inhibition of aPKC (15.Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and suppression of Aurora A result in different phenotypes. Par3 phosphorylation at Ser962 could change the affinity for its interaction partners, as it has been reported for other kinases such as aPKC, ROK, and Src family kinases (33.Nagai-Tamai Y. Mizuno K.

However, preliminary results show that Aurora A phosphorylation does not affect the binding of these proteins. Future experiments will have to identify additional binding partners of Par3 that might be affected by Aurora A.Aurora A is necessary for the polarization of Drosophila neuroblasts and regulates aPKC recruitment to the Par complex (10.Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Aurora A phosphorylates Par6 and releases its inhibition of aPKC. Although Aurora A also phosphorylates mammalian Par6, the phosphorylation of Par3 does not appear to be conserved. Sequence comparison shows that the Aurora A phosphorylation site in Par3 is conserved in vertebrates but is not present in Drosophila Bazooka.In summary, our results show that Aurora A is required for the establishment of neuronal polarity. It binds to and phosphorylates Par3. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 contributes to its function in the establishment of neuronal polarity. The loss of Aurora A or a failure to phosphorylate Par3 at Ser962 leads to the loss of axons and the formation of multiple indeterminate neurites. In addition to its function during the cell cycle, Aurora A also regulates asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts by phosphorylating Par6 (10.Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, we show that rodent Aurora A phosphorylates Par3 at Ser962 and that Par3 Ser962 phosphorylation is required in hippocampal neurons for the formation of axons. Aurora A and B are expressed in hippocampal neurons during the initial stages of their differentiation. Suppression of Aurora A by RNAi results in the loss of neuronal polarity. After knockdown of Aurora A, neurons formed multiple neurites that were longer than minor neurites but lacked the characteristics of axons. These neurites were shorter than axons and showed no or only weak staining for the axonal marker Tau-1. Expression of inactive Aurora A had a similar phenotype, indicating that it has a dominant negative effect. Overexpression of Aurora A did not affect axon formation, probably because it has to be activated by upstream kinases or by association with other proteins (1.Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3.Eyers P.A. Erikson E. Chen L.G. Maller J.L. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Aurora kinases might not be sufficient by themselves to have an effect on axon formation. Although Aurora B is also expressed in hippocampal neurons, expression of inactive Aurora B or its suppression by RNAi did not affect axon formation. These results demonstrate a novel function for Aurora A, which belongs to a growing list of proteins with important functions in cell cycle regulation and in postmitotic neurons (32.Frank C.L. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2009; 62: 312-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The phenotype of suppressing endogenous Aurora A in neurons is similar to that of Par3 (14.Schwamborn J.C. Khazaei M.R. Püschel A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35259-35268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We could show that Aurora A interacts directly with the Par3-aPKCBD and phosphorylates it. The phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 is important for axon formation. Wild type Par3 and the phosphomimic mutant Par3-S962D rescued the loss of endogenous Par3. By contrast, the nonphosphorylatable mutant Par3-S962A could not efficiently compensate for the knockdown of Par3. These results suggests that phosphorylation of Par3 at Ser962 by Aurora A promotes its function in axon formation. The ability to rescue the loss of endogenous Par3 by Par3-S962D but not Par3-S962A indicates that Par3 is one of the targets for Aurora A in hippocampal neurons. Unlike Par6, Par3-Ser962 phosphorylation does not appear to be involved in aPKC activation because the inhibition of aPKC (15.Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and suppression of Aurora A result in different phenotypes. Par3 phosphorylation at Ser962 could change the affinity for its interaction partners, as it has been reported for other kinases such as aPKC, ROK, and Src family kinases (33.Nagai-Tamai Y. Mizuno K.

IntroductionScabies is a transmissible parasitic skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is common worldwide and spreads rapidly under crowded conditions, such as those found in institutional settings, e.g. prisons and long term care facilities. Scabies is a major public health problem in socially disadvantaged communities, such as those found in indigenous populations and in developing countries (1.Walton S.F. Dougall A. Pizzutto S. Holt D. Taplin D. Arlian L.G. Morgan M. Currie B.J. Kemp D.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2.Walton S.F. Currie B.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20: 268-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Infestation occurs when the adult female mite burrows in the skin. Pruritic scabies lesions are often accompanied by bacterial infections (3.Brook I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2139-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), particularly Group A streptococci. These secondary infections cause significant sequelae (cellulitis, septicemia, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis), and the increased community streptococcal burden contributes to extreme levels of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (4.Currie B.J. Carapetis J.R. Australas. J. Dermatol. 2000; 41: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that treatment efficacy for scabies is decreasing (5.Currie B.J. Harumal P. McKinnon M. Walton S.F. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 39: e8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6.Mounsey K.E. Holt D.C. McCarthy J. Currie B.J. Walton S.F. Future Microbiol. 2008; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), indicating that the development of novel control strategies is necessary.Mite gut proteases involved in host protein digestion offer an avenue for interfering with parasite establishment. In scabies mite-related but non-parasitic astigmatid house dust mites, serine and cysteine proteases have been implicated in skin protein digestion (7.Chua K.Y. Stewart G.A. Thomas W.R. Simpson R.J. Dilworth R.J. Plozza T.M. Turner K.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart G.A. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Thompson P.J.

Kuo M.C. Rogers B.L. Thomas W.R. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1994; 24: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11.Thomas W.R. Smith W. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Group 3 allergens, typified by Der p 3 from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, are abundant serine proteases of the S1 family (12.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). They are thought to be secreted into the gut of the mite and shown to be excreted in fecal pellets, which can become aerosols and, hence, are implicated among elicitors of the allergic response in asthma (11.Thomas W.R. Smith W. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13.Platts-Mills T.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: S364-S366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interference with scabies mite homologs of house dust mite gut allergens may lead to inhibition of mite digestion, thereby presenting a novel approach to protective intervention. We have previously described a family of at least 33 scabies mite proteins homologous to the serine protease group 3 major allergens of house dust mites (14.Holt D.C. Fischer K. Allen G.E. Wilson D. Wilson P. Slade R. Currie B.J. Walton S.F. Kemp D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1419-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, all but one of these molecules is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to mutations of the catalytic amino acids in the active site (scabies mite-inactivated protease paralogues). The sequence exhibiting the closest match to the group 3 allergens of house dust mites (Yv7016G03) displayed a complete catalytic triad and was designated Sar s 3 according to the nomenclature used for house dust mite allergens. Here we have expressed and purified an active recombinant form of the enzyme and used it to characterize the enzyme activity and substrate specificity. The specificity information was used to examine the role(s) of Sar s 3. In addition, the site of expression of Sar s 3 within the mite body was localized. Together, these data have provided significant insight into the role of the enzyme in scabies biology.DISCUSSIONThe scabies mite is a parasite that lives in the epidermal layer of human skin. The mite is thought to continually feed on constituents of the uppermost layer of the epidermis known as the stratum corneum or cornified envelope (CE). The CE is formed by flattened dead-cell remnants to create a physical barrier against the environment. At the molecular level, the CE is formed by proteins, including filaggrin, loricrin, trichohyalin, involucrin, small proline-rich proteins, and keratin intermediate filaments. These components are highly cross-linked by transglutaminases. In addition, a complex series of insoluble lipids help produce a complete barrier. The function of the CE is to exclude foreign substances and harmful organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and to prevent the loss of vital fluids. This system is continuously regenerated by differentiating keratinocytes in a highly organized process (for review, see Refs. 29.Candi E. Schmidt R. Melino G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar and 30.McGrath J.A. Uitto J. Trends Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 20-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When the female scabies mite burrows into the superficial skin layers, it moves by mechanically disrupting the CE (31.Van Neste D. Dermatologica. 1985; 171: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Proteases would be required to digest the ingested skin proteins and perhaps also might play a role in degrading skin proteins outside of the mite (32.Fimiani M. Mazzatenta C. Alessandrini C. Paccagnini E. Andreassi L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1997; 29: 105-113PubMed Google Scholar). Scybala (feces) are left behind as they travel through the epidermis, creating linear lesions clinically recognized as burrows (33.Prins C. Stucki L. French L. Saurat J.H. Braun R.P. Dermatology. 2004; 208: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown that a serine protease from the scabies mite, Sar s 3, can be found in the digestive tract of the mite and also in fecal matter deposited in the skin by the parasite; this led us to question whether the enzyme was involved in digesting skin proteins either within the mite or externally.We successfully expressed a recombinant form of the Sar s 3 serine protease in a yeast expression system. The enzyme was purified and shown to be an active, mature form with the propeptide cleaved at the position required to liberate the N- terminal Ile residue required to complete the oxyanion hole of the enzyme. The data indicate that the propeptide of the enzyme is vital for formation of active enzyme and that processing after the Leu residue at position 8 of the propeptide is necessary to produce mature protease. The Lys residue at position 7 is clearly required for the cleavage by the yeast enzyme responsible for generating mature and active rSar s 3. The enzymes responsible for similarly processing the enzyme within the mite are currently unknown, although the cleavage is unlikely to be an autocatalytic event given that Sar s 3 appears to be trypsin-like and, therefore, unlikely to cleave after the Leu residue at position 8. Our current hypothesis is, therefore, that the Sar s 3 enzyme is cleaved by an unknown Scabies mite enzyme in the digestive tract to form active, mature enzyme, therefore, allowing Sar s 3 to be active in both the digestive tract of the mite and in the feces deposited in the skin.The rSar s 3 was not inhibited by a number of host protease inhibitors, although α2-macroglobulin was capable of inhibiting the enzyme. The enzyme had a highly alkaline pH optimum, although the physiological implications of this are unclear given that the pH of the mite gut is unknown. The enzyme also displayed a strong specificity for residues at the P1-P2′ positions of substrates, with the motif of RSG/A being strongly recognized at these positions, suggesting that the S1′ and S2′ subsites of the enzyme might be somewhat occluded and, thus, unable to accept larger amino acids at these positions in substrates. Attempts to crystallize the enzyme thus far have been unsuccessful, and models could not be built based on known structures due to poor sequence homology. Thus, further insights into the reasons for the high specificity at these positions await further structural insights. Nevertheless, the information regarding the substrate specificity of the enzyme, which was confirmed using peptide substrates, allowed us to examine the human proteome for potential substrates, revealing that several skin proteins contained potential cleavage sites for the mite enzyme.We have shown here that rSar s 3 was able to digest a recombinant fragment of the human skin protein, filaggrin (filament aggregating protein), which is a key component of the CE. We predict that the full-length filaggrin will be significantly more sensitive to Sar s 3 digestion as the protein outside of the recombinant fragment used contains highly optimal predicted sites for cleavage by the protease. Filaggrin is formed from profilaggrin, a highly phosphorylated, histidine-rich, 500-kDa polypeptide consisting of 10–12 tandemly arranged 35-kDa filaggrin units. Candi et al. (29.Candi E. Schmidt R. Melino G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) termed these units “KIFglue,” the matrix that embeds, aligns, and aggregates keratin intermediate filaments and subsequently maintains the epidermal texture. If there is a reduction or complete absence of filaggrin, as occurs in heritable skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis or ichthyosis vulgaris (34.Nomura T. Akiyama M. Sandilands A. Nemoto-Hasebe I. Sakai K. Nagasaki A. Ota M. Hata H. Evans A.T. Palmer C.N. Shimizu H. McLean W.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 1436-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the skin barrier may be defective and permeable to external factors such as allergens or pathogens. The mechanical disruption of the filaggrin matrix by the scabies mite and subsequent digestion of the protein in the mite digestive tract would be predicted to have similar effects.The excretion of the protease in the mite feces would be expected to allow the protease access to the proteins found in the epidermal layer. As proteins in house dust mite feces have been found to gain considerable access to lung tissue of allergy sufferers (35.Wan H. Winton H.L. Soeller C. Tovey E.R. Gruenert D.C. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Taylor G.W. Garrod D.R. Cannell M.B. Robinson C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), it is similarly likely that the protease in the mite fecal matter might gain such access to skin. The actions of this protease would be anticipated to cause considerable disruption to the proper assembly and structure of the epidermal layer. The precise cleavage of proteins such as filaggrin has been shown to be essential to proper formation of this vital protective layer (36.List K. Szabo R. Wertz P.W. Segre J. Haudenschild C.C. Kim S.Y. Bugge T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Disruption of the structure of this protein, which has been shown here to be a substrate of the Sar s 3 protease, would be expected to substantially disrupt the CE, and indeed such disruption of the epidermis is commonly observed in sufferers of scabies mite infestations. The disruption of the epidermis would also be expected to render patients susceptible to secondary infections, which is in fact the case (4.Currie B.J. Carapetis J.R. Australas. J. Dermatol. 2000; 41: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, the Sar s 3 protease has emerged as an excellent candidate for the development of inhibitors to combat the allergic symptoms engendered in patients infested with scabies mites as well as the associated secondary infections. The unique specificity motif of the protease identified in this study together with some atypical enzymatic properties might be of considerable utility in the development of such inhibitors.

They are thought to be secreted into the gut of the mite and shown to be excreted in fecal pellets, which can become aerosols and, hence, are implicated among elicitors of the allergic response in asthma (11.Thomas W.R.

Interference with scabies mite homologs of house dust mite gut allergens may lead to inhibition of mite digestion, thereby presenting a novel approach to protective intervention. We have previously described a family of at least 33 scabies mite proteins homologous to the serine protease group 3 major allergens of house dust mites (14.Holt D.C. Fischer K. Allen G.E. Wilson D.

Surprisingly, all but one of these molecules is predicted to be catalytically inactive due to mutations of the catalytic amino acids in the active site (scabies mite-inactivated protease paralogues). The sequence exhibiting the closest match to the group 3 allergens of house dust mites (Yv7016G03) displayed a complete catalytic triad and was designated Sar s 3 according to the nomenclature used for house dust mite allergens. Here we have expressed and purified an active recombinant form of the enzyme and used it to characterize the enzyme activity and substrate specificity. The specificity information was used to examine the role(s) of Sar s 3. In addition, the site of expression of Sar s 3 within the mite body was localized. Together, these data have provided significant insight into the role of the enzyme in scabies biology."
https://openalex.org/W2014287197,"TEM-1 beta-lactamase is the most common plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria and is a model class A enzyme. The active site of class A beta-lactamases share several conserved residues including Ser(70), Glu(166), and Asn(170) that coordinate a hydrolytic water involved in deacylation. Unlike Ser(70) and Glu(166), the functional significance of residue Asn(170) is not well understood even though it forms hydrogen bonds with both Glu(166) and the hydrolytic water. The goal of this study was to examine the importance of Asn(170) for catalysis and substrate specificity of beta-lactam antibiotic hydrolysis. The codon for position 170 was randomized to create a library containing all 20 possible amino acids. The random library was introduced into Escherichia coli, and functional clones were selected on agar plates containing ampicillin. DNA sequencing of the functional clones revealed that only asparagine (wild type) and glycine at this position are consistent with wild-type function. The determination of kinetic parameters for several substrates revealed that the N170G mutant is very efficient at hydrolyzing substrates that contain a primary amine in the antibiotic R-group that would be close to the Asn(170) side chain in the acyl-intermediate. In addition, the x-ray structure of the N170G enzyme indicated that the position of an active site water important for deacylation is altered compared with the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, the results suggest the N170G TEM-1 enzyme hydrolyzes ampicillin efficiently because of substrate-assisted catalysis where the primary amine of the ampicillin R-group positions the hydrolytic water and allows for efficient deacylation."
https://openalex.org/W2042228362,"Functional alterations of Müller cells, the principal glia of the retina, are an early hallmark of most retina diseases and contribute to their further progression. The molecular mechanisms of these reactive Müller cell alterations, resulting in disturbed retinal homeostasis, remain largely unknown. Here we show that experimental detachment of mouse retina induces mislocation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir4.1) and a downregulation of the water channel protein (AQP4) in Müller cells. These alterations are associated with a strong decrease of Dp71, a cytoskeleton protein responsible for the localization and the clustering of Kir4.1 and AQP4. Partial (in detached retinas) or total depletion of Dp71 in Müller cells (in Dp71-null mice) impairs the capability of volume regulation of Müller cells under osmotic stress. The abnormal swelling of Müller cells In Dp71-null mice involves the action of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we investigated whether the alterations in Müller cells of Dp71-null mice may interfere with their regulatory effect on the blood-retina barrier. In the absence of Dp71, the retinal vascular permeability was increased as compared to the controls. Our results reveal that Dp71 is crucially implicated in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis, in transmembraneous water transport, and in the Müller cell-mediated regulation of retinal vascular permeability. Furthermore, our data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of retinal homeostasis provided by Müller cells under normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2147958482,"Background Cross-sectional surveys utilizing biomarkers that test for recent infection provide a convenient and cost effective way to estimate HIV incidence. In particular, the BED assay has been developed for this purpose. Controversy surrounding the way in which false positive results from the biomarker should be handled has lead to a number of different estimators that account for imperfect specificity. We compare the estimators proposed by McDougal et al., Hargrove et al. and McWalter & Welte. Methodology/Principal Findings The three estimators are analyzed and compared. An identity showing a relationship between the calibration parameters in the McDougal methodology is shown. When the three estimators are tested under a steady state epidemic, which includes individuals who fail to progress on the biomarker, only the McWalter/Welte method recovers an unbiased result. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis shows that the McDougal estimator can be reduced to a formula that only requires calibration of a mean window period and a long-term specificity. This allows simpler calibration techniques to be used and shows that all three estimators can be expressed using the same set of parameters. The McWalter/Welte method is applicable under the least restrictive assumptions and is the least prone to bias of the methods reviewed."

PKD2 encodes polycystin-2 (TRPP2), which is a homologue of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel proteins. Here we identify a novel PKD2 mutation that generates a C-terminal tail-truncated TRPP2 mutant 697fsX with a frameshift resulting in an aberrant 17-amino acid addition after glutamic acid residue 697 from a family showing mild ADPKD symptoms. When recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells, wild-type (WT) TRPP2 localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane significantly enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER upon muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) stimulation. In contrast, 697fsX, which showed a predominant plasma membrane localization characteristic of TRPP2 mutants with C terminus deletion, prominently increased mAChR-activated Ca2+ influx in cells expressing TRPC3 or TRPC7. Coimmunoprecipitation, pulldown assay, and cross-linking experiments revealed a physical association between 697fsX and TRPC3 or TRPC7. 697fsX but not WT TRPP2 elicited a depolarizing shift of reversal potentials and an enhancement of single-channel conductance indicative of altered ion-permeating pore properties of mAChR-activated currents. Importantly, in kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells the recombinant 679fsX construct was codistributed with native TRPC3 proteins at the apical membrane area, but the WT construct was distributed in the basolateral membrane and adjacent intracellular areas.

ADPKD is characterized clinically by progressive formation and enlargement of renal cysts that demonstrate abnormalities in cell growth, fluid secretion, and extracellular matrix with other common complications (2.Harris P.C. Torres V.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Linkage analyses have shown that either PKD1 or PKD2 loci are responsible for almost all ADPKD pedigrees. Nearly 85% of ADPKD pedigrees have been linked to PKD1, and ∼15% have been linked to PKD2 (2.Harris P.C. Torres V.E. Annu. Rev.

In PKD2 cases end-stage renal disease develops at a mean age of 10–15 years later than in PKD1 cases, although heterogeneity in clinical phenotype is seen among PKD2 mutations (4.Hateboer N. v Dijk M.A. Bogdanova N.

Invertebrate and vertebrate TRP homologues of the so-called “canonical” TRPC subfamily are characterized by activation induced upon stimulation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (11.Abramowitz J.

TRPC channels have been originally proposed as store-operated channels activated by Ca2+ depletion of stores, whereas closely related TRPC homologues, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7, showed activation sensitivity to the membrane-delimited action of diacylglycerol (12.Boulay G.

Nauli et al. (20.Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat.

Naturally occurring pathogenic mutations of TRPP2, which disrupt their associations through their C-terminal tails (30.Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), result in the defect in translocation of TRPP2 to PM. In contrast, a role of TRPP2 as a subunit of intracellular channels with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting sequence, whose deletion induces trafficking to PM in pathogenic PKD2 mutants, has been suggested (26.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27.Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G.

Another possibility is that TRPP2 functions appropriately both as Ca2+ release channels in ER and, under certain defined conditions, as PM Ca2+ entry channels (31.Vassilev P.M. Guo L. Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Peng J.B. Basora N. Babakhanlou H. Cruger G. Kanazirska M. Ye Cp. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how the C terminus-truncated TRPP2 mutant proteins behave after being mistranslocated from ER to the PM independently of the interaction with PC1. Thus, the physiological function of normal and pathogenic mutant TRPP2 as well as its operating subcellular site is yet to be established.In the present study we have identified a novel PKD2 gene mutation (2092delA) that generates a TRPP2 product (697fsX) with a frameshift resulting in an aberrant 17-amino acid addition after glutamic acid residue 697 (Glu697) at the C terminus in a Japanese family. The recombinant TRPP2 mutant 697fsX was examined for subcellular localization as well as molecular and functional properties in HEK293 cells. 697fsX localized at the PM elicited a physical association with the TRPC3 or TRPC7 protein and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR)-activated Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells coexpressing TRPC3 or TRPC7, whereas wild-type (WT) TRPP2 localized at the ER significantly enhanced mAChR-activated Ca2+ release. In polarized kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells, confocal image analysis revealed codistribution of native TRPC3 with transfected 697fsX in the apical membrane but not with WT TRPP2 distributed in the basolateral membrane area. These observations suggest dual impacts of PKD2 mutations producing TRPP2 proteins deleted with the C-terminal tail in the pathogenesis of ADPKD.DISCUSSIONCoimmunoprecipitation, GST pulldown, and cross-linking experiments suggest that the C terminus-truncated TRPP2 mutant 697fsX undergoes physical association with TRPC3 and TRPC7. In electrophysiological recordings, coexpression of 697fsX but not that of WT TRPP2 caused a depolarizing shift of reversal potentials and an increased single-channel amplitude of mAChR-induced currents in TRPC3-expressing cells. These altered ion permeation properties of TRPC3-mediated cation currents after coexpression of 697fsX suggest that TRPC3 and 697fsX form heteromultimeric cation channels in which both TRPC3 and 697fsX function as pore-forming subunits, and pore-lining residues are different from those of homomultimeric TRPC3 channels. Consistent with this notion, HEK293 cells coexpressing 697fsX with WT TRPC3 and those with E632Q TRPC3 mutant showed single-channel currents with different amplitudes, excluding a possibility that TRPC3 proteins, which form channels independently of 697fsX proteins, support co-translocation of 697fsX via indirect mechanisms, for example, by sharing the same membrane microdomain.Previously, the TRPP2 C-terminal tail containing the coiled-coil domain 772–796 was shown to be responsible for the assembly of TRPP2 with PC1 using the C-terminal tail-truncated mutant R742X (6.Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Because the coiled-coil domain is also deleted from the TRPP2 sequence in the 697fsX mutant, 697fsX can be incapable of forming a complex with PC1. In LLC-PK1 cells, native TRPC3 proteins were colocalized with transfected 697fsX in the apical membrane area but not with WT TRPP2 distributed in the basolateral membrane and adjacent intracellular areas (Fig. 7). Therefore, in native tissues of ADPKD patients with 697fsX, a deficiency of PC1 interaction can lead to the formation of heteromultimeric TRPP2/TRPC3 channels with ion permeation properties different from those of TRPC3-containing channels in normal tissues. Interestingly, cation influx activity is increased when 697fsX is coexpressed with TRPC3. It is, therefore, possible that 697fsX enhances trafficking of TRPC3 channels through protein multimerization, as previously reported for TRPV4 associated with TRPP2 (47.Köttgen M. Buchholz B.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and to functionally interact with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-induced Ca2+ release (52.Li Y. Wright J.M. Qian F. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41298-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TRPP2 is also reported to form protein complexes with PC1 or TRPC1 to induce Ca2+ influx at the PM (6.Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, because our data clearly indicate that overexpression of TRPP2 potentiates receptor-activated Ca2+ release but not Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells, TRPP2 should mainly function as a Ca2+ release channel. In this study we detected endogenous expression of PC1, TRPP2, TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Interestingly, our data suggest a higher expression level of TRPP2 compared with those of PC1 and TRPC1, further suggesting that endogenous PC1 and TRPC1 are fully associated with endogenous TRPP2 and that PC1 and TRPC1 are not freely accessible for recombinant TRPP2. With regard to the augmentation of Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells recombinantly expressing 697fsX, endogenous TRPC3 but not TRPC7 was detected in HEK293 cells. Other TRPCs such as TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are also endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells but fail to show enhancement of Ca2+ influx by 697fsX when recombinantly expressed (Fig. 5B). Therefore, endogenous TRPC3 may interact with 697fsX at the PM.The present study reveals that the TRPP2 C terminus-truncating mutations exert a dual pathogenic impact at different subcellular sites, the ER and PM, on receptor-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization. At the ER, the potentiation effect of WT TRPP2 on receptor-activated Ca2+ release from ER was abolished by the 697fsX mutation in HEK293 cells. This is consistent with the previous report of Cai et al. (27.Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), which suggested that the C terminus-truncated mutation (R742X) abolishes retention of TRPP2 at the ER membrane, where TRPP2 regulates Ca2+ release (26.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). At the PM, physical and functional association of 697fsX TRPP2 proteins with TRPC3 or TRPC7 prominently enhanced receptor-activated Ca2+ entry into HEK293 cells. This finding clarifies the interaction target of C terminus-truncated TRPP2 proteins and their activation mechanism as ion channels, which were unresolved issues. Previous reports only described the disrupted assembly of TRPP2 with PC1 and consequent PM mistranslocation of TRPP2 by the R742X mutation (6.Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) as well as the abnormal spontaneous [Ca2+]i-independent cation current via the R742X TRPP2 mutant (29.Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Basora N. Guo L. Peng J.B. Babakhanlou H. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, compared with the proposed loss of Ca2+ influx by ablation of the association between PC1 and TRPP2s, the enhanced Ca2+ influx via complexation with TRPC3 or TRPC7 proteins is a gain of function more likely consistent with the dominant phenotype of the PKD mutations. Thus, the obtained data may provide an important clue to address the discrepancy between seemingly conflicting hypotheses with regard to the subcellular sites of the pathogenic action of TRPP2 C terminus mutants (6.Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 26.Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L.

The observed enhancement of receptor-induced Ca2+ entry via association of 697fsX with TRPC3 supports the contention that 697fsX induces dysregulated cell growth and death in ADPKD, as TRPC3 channels are indeed activated upon receptors such as B cell (38.Nishida M.

Importantly, ADPKD is a systemic disorder with a variety of other manifestations including liver cysts, cerebral aneurysms, and various cardiac valvular abnormalities. Wide expression of TRPC3, TRPC7, and TRPP2 in various tissues including kidney (60.Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H. Oba A. Ikenaka K. Kurosaki T.

In addition, basolateral localization of TRPC1 in MDCK cells (64.Bandyopadhyay B.C. Swaim W.D. Liu X. Redman R.S. Patterson R.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Notably, during preparation of this manuscript, it has been reported that the heteromeric channels comprised of TRPP2 and TRPC1 are activated in response to receptor stimulation (66.Bai C.X. Giamarchi A. Rodat-Despoix L. Padilla F. Downs T. Tsiokas L. Delmas P. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, speculated that C-terminal truncations disrupt the PC1-TRPP2 assembly as well as the formation of heteromultimeric TRPC1/TRPP2 channels in the basolateral membrane (65.Roitbak T. Ward C.J. Harris P.C. Bacallao R. Ness S.A. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1334-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The heteromultimerization may consequently induce mislocalization of TRPP2 proteins and the formation of heteromultimeric TRPC3/TRPP2 channels in the apical membrane, finally leading to transduction of pathogenic signals in ADPKD tissues. Taking into consideration that TRPC3 and TRPC7 are different from TRPC1 in molecular and functional properties (11.Abramowitz J. Birnbaumer L. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 297-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), a conclusion based on TRPC1 should not be directly extrapolated to TRPC3 and TRPC7. This is consistent with an idea that TRPP2 mutants associated with TRPC3 and TRPC7 indeed play unique pathophysiological roles in signal transduction. We can raise a different possibility that unknown regulatory mechanisms, which suppress the action of the TRPP2 C terminus, may induce translocation to the apical membrane and subsequent heteromultimerization with WT TRPP2 and TRPC3 also in normal tissues under certain cellular conditions. In this scenario it is conceivable that the 697fsX mutant is constantly present at the apical membrane to transmit constitutively active aberrant signals in ADPKD tissues.At the cellular level ADPKD inherited in a dominant manner has been explained by a recessive mechanism, leading to the complete loss of function through somatic mutations in the normal PKD2 allele (the two-hit model). However, TRPP2 (PC2) is frequently observed in renal cy"

WRN deficiency induces cellular defects in DNA replication, mitotic homologous recombination (HR), and telomere stability. In addition to DNA unwinding activity, WRN also possesses exonuclease, strand annealing, and branch migration activities. The single strand binding proteins replication protein A (RPA) and telomere-specific POT1 specifically stimulate WRN DNA unwinding activity. To determine whether RPA and POT1 also modulate WRN branch migration activity, we examined biologically relevant mobile D-loops that mimic structures in HR strand invasion and at telomere ends. Both RPA and POT1 block WRN exonuclease digestion of the invading strand by loading on the strand. However, only RPA robustly stimulates WRN branch migration activity and increases the percentage of D-loops that are disrupted. Our results are consistent with cellular data that support RPA enhancement of branch migration during HR repair and, conversely, POT1 limitation of inappropriate recombination and branch migration at telomeric ends. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that RPA can stimulate branch migration activity."

Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 27.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 28.Resnitzky D. Gossen M.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that deregulation of cyclin E interferes with pre-RC assembly during early G1, and this defect leads possibly to impairment of replication initiation and/or fork elongation but does not affect the functions of cyclin E involved in the G1/S transition (30.Ekholm-Reed S. Méndez J. Tedesco D. Zetterberg A. Stillman B. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, this mechanism can potentially explain both the accelerated entry into S phase and the slower rate of DNA synthesis caused by cyclin E overexpression. Cell cycle checkpoints are induced in response to DNA damage to allow additional time for lesions to be repaired and to carry out other aspects of the DNA damage response such as programmed cell death (31.Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 32.Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). In response to the formation of double-strand breaks by ionizing radiation (IR), S phase checkpoints are mediated by two parallel pathways involving the upstream signaling kinases ATM and ATR and result in a rapid but transient inhibition of DNA synthesis (31.Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 33.Lambert S. Carr A.M. Biochimie. 2005; 87: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first of these pathways requires the activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, both of which target the Cdc25A phosphatase for degradation resulting in an impairment of Cdk2 activation. The second pathway involves the MRN complex, Mdc1, and Smc1l however, how this pathway affects DNA replication is not known. Both of these pathways have also been implicated in the checkpoint responses to replication fork-blocking lesions such as DNA interstrand cross-links that are mediated by ATR (34.Pichierri P. Rosselli F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35.Mladenov E. Tsaneva I. Anachkova B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, interstrand cross-links cause an extended S phase arrest that can last for several days (36.Liu L. Akhter S. Bae J.B. Mukhopadhyay S.S. Richie C.T. Liu X. Legerski R. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37.Akkari Y.M. Bateman R.L. Reifsteck C.A. Olson S.B. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and that is not observed after exposure to IR, suggesting the possibility of additional checkpoint pathways that mediate long term arrest. Here, we show that in response to the cross-linking drug mitomycin C (MMC) or UV irradiation, but not to IR, cyclin E is strongly stabilized during S phase. This stabilization of cyclin E interferes with the activation of Cdk2-cyclin A and impedes DNA synthesis and S phase progression. Interestingly, the stabilization of cyclin E is not dependent on either Chk1 or Nbs1, but does depend upon ATR. In addition, cyclin E is required for the stabilization of Cdc6, which has been shown previously to be required for the activation of Chk1 (38.Clay-Farrace L. Pelizon C. Santamaria D. Pines J. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39.Oehlmann M. Score A.J. Blow J.J. J.

These findings suggest that ATR-mediated stabilization of cyclin E represents a novel mechanism that induces a sustained arrest in response to fork-blocking lesions. HeLa S3, HEK293T, and MRC5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa S3 cells were synchronized at G1/S phase by using a double-thymidine block as described previously (42.Whitfield M.L. Zheng L.X. Baldwin A. Ohta T. Hurt M.M. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4188-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa S3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm thymidine for periods of 19 h and 16 h with an interval of 9 h in regular medium in between. After the second thymidine block period, cells were released into regular medium or were treated with MMC (Sigma), UV, or IR. Progression of the cell cycle was monitored by FACS analysis of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells that were collected at the indicated time points. The modeling program FlowJo was used to calculate the peak of PI value which is the mode of the PI profile statistically. Pulse labeling of cells with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 30 min was performed following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Roche Applied Science in situ cell proliferation kit). Cells were trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, incubated in blocking solution (4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% Triton X-100) for 30 min followed by incubation in 2 m HCl for 25 min. Cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd for 45 min followed by a 20-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Synchronized HeLa cells were collected at the indicated times and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 120 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Sucrose gradient analysis was performed as described previously (43.McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were loaded onto 5–30% sucrose gradients and spun at 28,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman SW 40i rotor. Fractions were collected and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for immunoblot analysis. Protein bands were quantitated with Alpha Imager software (Alpha Innotech). Antibodies used for immunoblot analysis, including cyclin E (sc-247), cyclin A (sc-751), ATR (sc-1887), Cdk2 (sc-163), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (sc-25280), Cdc6 (sc-9964), Nbs1 (sc-8580), MCM4 (sc-22779), p21 (sc-397-G), and HA (sc-7392) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Pin1 (3722), Chk1 (2345), and GSK3β (9315) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. ORC2 (559260) and p27 (610241) antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Nbs1 (L-009641-00), cyclin E (J-003213-10), Pin1 (J-003291-10), Chk1 (D-003255-06), and ATR (44.Geng L. Zhang X. Zheng S. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon. An additional ATR siRNA was purchased from Sigma (SASI_HS01_00176271). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's recommended protocol were used for siRNA transfections. For in vivo ubiquitylation assays, HeLa cells were transfected with pCDNA3/HA- ubiquitin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) followed by double-thymidine synchronization. Cells were collected and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer at the indicated time points. Anti-HA-conjugated agarose beads (sc-7392 AC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for HA IP. IP kinase assays were performed as described previously (45.Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cdk2 or cyclin A was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates for 90 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was incubated with histone H1 (M2501; New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 4 mm ATP) for 30 min at 25 °C. Proteins in the reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. RNA was prepared from synchronized HeLa S3 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). pOTB7/cyclin E (clone ID 3841192) was purchased from the ATCC. A fragment produced by NcoI restriction digest of cyclin E cDNA was labeled by random priming and used for Northern blot analysis. Chromatin isolation was performed by the method described previously (46.Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were collected at the time points indicated in the figure. Cells were suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Cells were incubated on ice for 8 min and then spun to collect the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed on ice for 30 min. The supernatant (nucleoplasmic fraction) was combined with the cytosolic fraction as the soluble fraction. The pellet was dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer as the chromatin fraction. Cyclin E overexpression causes a prolonged S phase (25.Spruck C.H. Won K.A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1999; 401: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 27.Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 995-997PubMed Google Scholar), and recently it has been shown that cyclin E is a phosphorylation substrate of the checkpoint kinase ATR (47.Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. Shiloh Y. Gygi S.P. Elledge S.J. Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the possibility that stabilization of cyclin E may mediate a long term arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle in response to replication stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we synchronized HeLa cells via a double-thymidine block and then released the cells into MMC. At 5 ng/ml MMC, cells exhibited a transient delay (note the 13 h time point), whereas at 250 ng/ml MMC a greatly decreased progression through S phase was observed (Fig. 1A). In untreated cells S phase was complete by 8 h, whereas in treated cells it was not fully complete by 24 h. Next we examined cyclin E levels, and we observed that it was slightly stabilized at 5 ng/ml MMC, but was strongly stabilized at the higher concentration of MMC (Fig. 1B). We performed similar experiments with synchronized HeLa cells using either UV or IR as the source of DNA damage (Fig. 1, C and D). Interestingly, UV, but not IR, also induced stabilization of cyclin E, suggesting that lesions that block replication forks induce the observed stabilization. As a further demonstration, we exposed unsynchronized primary human MRC5 fibroblast cells or HEK293T cells to MMC and observed stabilization of cyclin E for up to at least 48 h and a very prolonged S phase arrest (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S1). To verify that cyclin E was responsible for the observed S phase delay, we overexpressed GFP-cyclin E and noted a prolongation of S phase (supplemental Fig. S2). Note that the exogenous GFP-cyclin E was strongly decreased compared with endogenous cyclin E, which is highly stabilized in the presence of drug or UV (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, we examined whether the stabilization of cyclin E occurred through a transcriptional or posttranslational mechanism. Synchronized HeLa cells were examined for levels of cyclin E transcripts by Northern blot analysis, and no increase was observed in the presence of MMC during the 4–10-h postrelease period when stabilization of cyclin E protein levels were observed (Fig. 2A). However, an examination of the degree of ubiquitylation of cyclin E showed that this modification was greatly reduced in the presence of MMC (Fig. 2B), and the stabilization of cyclin E in this experiment was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that exposure to MMC inhibits the normal ubiquitylation and degradation of cyclin E that occurs during S phase. In addition to being a regulator of Cdk2, cyclin E is also a substrate of this kinase and GSK3β (5.Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M.

Cell. 2006; 23: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by these kinases is required for the ubiquitylation and ultimate degradation of cyclin E that occurs during S phase. In addition, the proline isomerase Pin1 is also required for ubiquitylation of cyclin E (12.van Drogen F. Sangfelt O. Malyukova A. Matskova L. Yeh E. Means A.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48.Yeh E.S. Lew B.O. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the association between these proteins and cyclin E by sucrose gradient sedimentation. As shown (Fig. 3A), at the time of release from synchronization the sedimentation profile of cyclin E partially overlaps with Cdk2 and GSK3β, but not with Pin1, in what appears to be a configuration intermediate between G1 and S phases. Two hours after release of untreated cells into S phase, the sedimentation profiles of all four proteins almost exactly overlap in a slower sedimenting complex (S phase configuration) that presumably mediates ubiquitylation of cyclin E. At 13 h after release, when cells have cycled into the G1 phase, cyclin E has returned to a G1 configuration with some overlap with Cdk2, but little overlap with GSK3β or Pin1. On the other hand, release of cells into MMC showed that cyclin E was maintained in the G1 configuration with only little or no overlap with GSK3β and Pin1 for many hours (Fig. 3B). This latter finding was also confirmed by co-IP experiments in which in the presence of MMC cyclin E no longer interacted with either GSK3β or Pin1 (Fig. 3C). Also, MMC did not affect the levels of either GSK3β or Pin1 (Fig. 3D). To confirm further that GSK3β is required for degradation of cyclin E during S phase, we depleted expression of GKS3β by siRNA and observed extended stabilization of cyclin E and slower progress through S phase (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that treatment with MMC negatively affects the association between cyclin E and two factors that are required for its ubiquitylation, namely GSK3β and Pin1. Furthermore, they are consistent with the findings described above demonstrating that MMC induces stabilization of cyclin E via inhibition of ubiquitylation.FIGURE 3Gradient sedimentation profiles of cyclin E and its binding partners in response to MMC.

One possible explanation for this effect is that elevated levels of cyclin E may negatively affect Cdk2-cyclin A activity. To examine this hypothesis, HeLa cells were synchronized and released into medium with or without MMC. Approximately 6 h after release, untreated cells showed an increase in Cdk2 activity as determined in an IP-kinase assay using histone H1 as substrate (Fig. 4A, left upper panels). This increase in activity correlated with decreases in cyclin E levels. On the other hand, MMC-treated cells exhibited a distinctly lower level of Cdk2 kinase activity (Fig. 4A, right upper panels). We also measured cyclin A-associated kinase activity and found similarly that it was also reduced in the presence of MMC (Fig. 4A, lower panels). We also confirmed that stabilized cyclin E remained associated with Cdk2 as determined by a co-IP experiment (Fig. 4B). We next examined the sedimentation profile of cyclin A and found that 8 h after release the profiles for cyclin A and Cdk2 almost precisely overlapped in untreated cells. However, in the presence of MMC a portion of Cdk2 no longer co-sedimented with cyclin A (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a co-IP experiment indicated that the interaction between cyclin A and Cdk2 was reduced by approximately half (Fig. 4D). These findings support the hypothesis that stabilization of cyclin E during S phase impairs the full activation of Cdk2-cyclin A. P21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are well known inhibitors of Cdk2 (49.Borriello A. Cucciolla V. Oliva A. Zappia V. Della Ragione F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 50.Abukhdeir A.M. Park B.H. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2008; 10: e19Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and could be responsible for the prolonged S phase arrest observed in the presence of MMC. We therefore examined whether treatment with MMC causes an increase in the levels of either of these inhibitors. As shown (Fig. 4E), neither p21 nor p27 levels were increased upon release into MMC compared with untreated cells. Furthermore, p21 did not co-sediment with either cyclin E or cyclin A in the presence of MMC (Fig. 4F). Attempts to detect p27 in these gradients were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, these experiments suggest that neither p21 nor p27 is responsible for the decrease in Cdk2 activity or the prolonged arrest observed in the presence of replication fork-blocking agents. To examine the effect of MMC on DNA synthesis, we released synchronized cells and pulse-labeled them with BrdUrd at various times during the subsequent incubation. For untreated control cells, the fraction of BrdUrd-positive cells had decreased dramatically by 8 h after release, whereas for MMC-treated cells, a large fraction still incorporated BrdUrd at 15 h after release (Fig. 5A). We also examined the degree of BrdUrd incorporation and found that it was still ongoing in the MMC-treated cells, although not to the extent observed in the control cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, cells damaged by MMC treatment exhibit a prolonged and substantial rate of DNA synthesis, suggesting that ongoing DNA replication is not completely blocked. Some component of the"
https://openalex.org/W2123259316,"Background Carriage of Neisseria meningitidis occurs approximately in 10% of the population, onset of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cannot be predicted and differs between ages. It remains unclear, which host factors determine invasion of the bloodstream by the bacteria. Innate immunity has a very important role in the first recognition of invading pathogens. The functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) CD14 C-159T and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) Asp299Gly have been associated with the risk of gram-negative infections. However, their role in development of IMD still remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the influence of CD14 C-159T and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms on the risk of IMD. Methodology/Principal Findings It was a retrospective case control study. Surviving Austrian meningococcal disease patients were enrolled by sending buccal swabs for DNA analysis. 185 cases with a proven meningococcal infection and 770 healthy controls were enrolled. In surviving meningococcal disease patients DNA analysis of CD14 C-159T and TLR 4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms was performed, as they are part of the innate immune response to bacterial determinants. CD14 C-159T and TLR4 Asp299Gly SNPs were not significantly associated with the presence of IMD when compared to healthy controls. The odds ratio for CD14 C-159T SNP was 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–1.43; p = 0.266). In TLR4 Asp 299 Gly SNP the odds ratio was 0.78 (CI 0.47–1.43; p = 0.359). Conclusion/Significance We could not observe a significant influence of CD14 C-159T and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms on the risk of developing IMD in surviving meningococcal disease patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the influence of the CD14 C-159T SNP on the susceptibility to IMD."

https://openalex.org/W2083783310,"Background Despite increasing evidence for the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav) isoforms and measurements of Nav channel currents with the patch-clamp technique in arterial myocytes, no information is available to date as to whether or not Nav channels play a functional role in arteries. The aim of the present work was to look for a physiological role of Nav channels in the control of rat aortic contraction. Methodology/Principal Findings Nav channels were detected in the aortic media by Western blot analysis and double immunofluorescence labeling for Nav channels and smooth muscle α-actin using specific antibodies. In parallel, using real time RT-PCR, we identified three Nav transcripts: Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.5. Only the Nav1.2 isoform was found in the intact media and in freshly isolated myocytes excluding contamination by other cell types. Using the specific Nav channel agonist veratridine and antagonist tetrodotoxin (TTX), we unmasked a contribution of these channels in the response to the depolarizing agent KCl on rat aortic isometric tension recorded from endothelium-denuded aortic rings. Experimental conditions excluded a contribution of Nav channels from the perivascular sympathetic nerve terminals. Addition of low concentrations of KCl (2–10 mM), which induced moderate membrane depolarization (e.g., from −55.9±1.4 mV to −45.9±1.2 mV at 10 mmol/L as measured with microelectrodes), triggered a contraction potentiated by veratridine (100 µM) and blocked by TTX (1 µM). KB-R7943, an inhibitor of the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, mimicked the effect of TTX and had no additive effect in presence of TTX. Conclusions/Significance These results define a new role for Nav channels in arterial physiology, and suggest that the TTX-sensitive Nav1.2 isoform, together with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, contributes to the contractile response of aortic myocytes at physiological range of membrane depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2013323818,"Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in acid beta-glucosidase (GCase) leading to defective hydrolysis and accumulation of its substrates. Two L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers-verapamil and diltiazem-have been reported to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding, trafficking, and activity of GCase in human Gaucher disease fibroblasts. Similarly, these LTCC blockers were tested with cultured skin fibroblasts from homozygous point-mutated GCase mice (V394L, D409H, D409V, and N370S) with the effect of enhancing of GCase activity. Correspondingly, diltiazem increased GCase protein and facilitated GCase trafficking to the lysosomes of these cells. The in vivo effects of diltiazem on GCase were evaluated in mice homozygous wild-type (WT), V394L and D409H. In D409H homozygotes diltiazem (10 mg/kg/d via drinking water or 50-200 mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) had minor effects on increasing GCase activity in brain and liver (1.2-fold). Diltiazem treatment (10 mg/kg/d) had essentially no effect on WT and V394L GCase protein or activity levels (<1.2-fold) in liver. These results show that LTCC blockers had the ex vivo effects of increasing GCase activity and protein in the mouse fibroblasts, but these effects did not translate into similar changes in vivo even at very high drug doses."
https://openalex.org/W2056314951,"Partitioning-defective proteins (PAR) are detected to express mainly in the cytoplast, and play an important role in cell polarity. However, we showed here that PAR6, one kind of PAR protein, was localized in the nuclei of mouse oocytes that formed primordial follicles during the perinatal period, suggesting a new role of PAR protein. It is the first time we found that, in mouse fetal ovaries, PAR6 appeared in somatic cell cytoplasm and fell weak when somatic cells invaded germ cell cysts at 17.5 days post coitus (dpc). Meanwhile, the expression of PAR6 was observed in cysts, and became strong in the nuclei of some germ cells at 19.5 dpc and all primordial follicular oocytes at 3 day post parturition (dpp), and then obviously declined when the primordial follicles entered the folliculogenic growth phase. During the primordial follicle pool foundation, the number of PAR6 positive germ cells remained steady and was consistent with that of formed follicles at 3 dpp. There were no TUNEL (apoptosis examination) positive germ cells stained with PAR6 at any time studied. The number of follicles significantly declined when 15.5 dpc ovaries were treated with the anti-PAR6 antibody and PAR6 RNA interference. Carbenoxolone (CBX, a known blocker of gap junctions) inhibited the expression of PAR6 in germ cells and the formation of follicles. Our results suggest that PAR6 could be used as a potential marker of germ cells for the primordial follicle formation, and the expression of PAR6 by a gap junction-dependent process may contribute to the formation of primordial follicles and the maintenance of oocytes at the diplotene stage."

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) interferes with NO formation, causing endothelial dysfunction. ADMA is a predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality in humans. It is eliminated primarily by enzymatic activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated whether human DDAH-1 (hDDAH-1) transgenicity protects from ischemic tissue damage in temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. Infarct sizes did not significantly differ between hDDAH-1 transgenic (TG) mice and wild-type littermates (WT). As expected, ADMA plasma concentrations were significantly decreased, cerebral hDDAH expression and protein significantly increased in transgenic animals. Interestingly, neither brain tissue DDAH activity nor ADMA concentrations were different between TG and WT mice. In contrast, muscular DDAH activity was generally lower than in brain but significantly increased in TG mice. Conclusion/Significance Our study demonstrates that hDDAH-1 transgenic mice are not protected from ischemic cerebral tissue damage in tMCAO. This lack of protection is due to high basal cerebral DDAH activity, which is not further increasable by transgenic overexpression of DDAH."

In the elderly, vascular deposition of amyloid can also have another impact: it can be associated with brain hemorrhage. Amyloid deposition increases the risk for small hemorrhages, dubbed micro-hemorrhages, and for a particular type of spontaneous hemorrhage within the gray matter of the brain, called a lobar hemorrhage. But not all individuals who suffer from amyloid deposition are at risk for hemorrhage (Fig. 1). One possibility is that the risk depends on the type of amyloid deposited.

Findings within the past few years have hinted that a domain that inhibits proteases, called a Kunitz protease inhibitor (or KPI) domain, found in several isoforms of β-amyloid (Aβ), inactivates proteins in the blood that cause clotting1–5.

Does this inactivation underlie the link between amyloid and hemorrhage? Two recent studies by Xu et al.1,2 bolster this hypothesis. In one study, the authors found that mice constructed to make increased amounts of the precursor protein to Aβ peptide (AβPP) had larger hemorrhages than wild-type mice in a model of artificial brain hemorrhage1. In a second study, mice that did not make AβPP experienced smaller hemorrhages in the same model2. What’s more, the isolated KPI domain could block coagulation1,2. The two studies suggest that, with aging, deposition of some isoforms of Aβ in brain microvessels may increase the chance of hemorrhage by blocking coagulation locally.

Previous observations have suggested that the location of amyloid seems to influence the location of the hemorrhage. In blood vessels, amyloid deposits are found predominantly in the walls of arterioles and arteries in the cortex and deep brain structures. This location explains the frequent lobar distribution of the amyloid-associated hemorrhages. AβPP is found less often in capillaries and veins, but when it is, AβPP infiltrates the matrix that forms the basal lamina, as well as the surrounding tissue. This deposition interferes with normal vessel function and may also lead to microhemorrhages.

Another condition associated with aging, ischemic stroke, may also play into the risk of amyloid-associated hemorrhage. Hemorrhage occurs in the injury regions in up to 65% of ischemic strokes. Deposits of Aβ peptide are seen in cerebral vessels of some individuals after ischemic stroke. Ischemia alters the adhesion of endothelial cells and astrocytes to the intervening basal lamina6,7, and it can also promote thrombosis within brain microvessels8. One possibility is that Aβ peptides change cell-matrix interactions within brain microvessels and cause their instability, thereby promoting hemorrhage when the vessels are injured.

The notion that Aβ peptides themselves might directly promote hemorrhage by inhibiting thrombosis gained traction with studies of KPI domains. AβPP, the precursor of Aβ, occurs in numerous isoforms, a result of alternative splicing of a single gene. Two isoforms of AβPP have KPI domains that do not occur in other forms of the protein. Kunitz domains have a characteristic active site and a typical double-loop structure that is conserved among proteins in which KPI domains are found. One or more such domains are found in biologically active proteinase inhibitors, including tissue factor pathway inhibitor, aprotinin, and the AβPP9,10. Inhibitors with Kunitz-like folds, or KPI-containing inhibitors, are employed by many species to regulate the initiation of clotting that prevents hemorrhage from a vessel (hemostasis) or to block coagulation at specific steps (such as thrombin formation). Ticks also use such domains to block blood coagulation9–11. In addition, peptides derived from the KPI domain can have antihemostatic activity.

One isoform of AβPP found in cerebral blood vessels and in brain deposits in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease has a KPI domain identical to protease nexin-2 (PN-2), a protein known to regulate hemostasis12. In vitro studies have suggested that AβPP/PN-2 (the PN-2–identical isoform of AβPP) inhibits the coagulation factors IXa and XIa10,11, which, by blocking thrombosis, could promote hemorrhage. Xu et al.1,2 now flesh out this model.

The researchers examined transgenic mouse strains with either increased expression of a KPI-containing isoform of AβPP in platelets or in neurons1. They subjected the mice to a standardized experimental hemorrhage, made by injecting a fixed amount of the matrix protease collagenase into the brain1. The volume of hemorrhage and hemoglobin deposition, they found, was substantially higher in the transgenic mice than in wild-type mice1,5. The authors also examined occlusion in the carotid artery in a model of laser-induced arterial thrombosis and found that occlusion occurred more rapidly in the mice expressing the KPI-containing AβPP/PN-2 in platelets compared with wild-type mice or mice over-expressing the KPI-containing AβPP/PN-2 in neurons1. These findings suggest that the AβPP KPI insert could be responsible for enlargement of the cerebral hemorrhage in the model.

Xu et al.2 also examined mice engineered not to express AβPP and its KPI domain. They compared these mice to wild-type mice in the hemorrhage model and found substantially smaller cerebral hemorrhages with less hemoglobin deposition2. Similarly, mice lacking the amyloid precursor–like protein-2 (APLP-2), which has a KPI domain, showed a decreased volume of hemorrhage compared to wild-type mice. Experiments in the carotid artery model indicated that when AβPP or APLP-2 were absent thrombosis was enhanced2. Again, the KPI domains alone inhibited coagulation in vitro.

These findings have implications for aged individuals, but the studies are not without concerns. Models of cerebral hemorrhage are complex. The method used by the investigators degrades collagen in the vascular basal lamina and surrounding tissues to produce a consistent circumscribed hemorrhage. The model is not pathophysiological partly because the collagenase stimulates its own inflammatory cell response and nonvascular cell injury independent of the hemorrhage—limiting the interpretation of experimental results. Models of ischemic stroke that produce hemorrhagic transformation of the injury (where ischemia causes the hemorrhage) would be of interest but are less consistent. Nonetheless, the ability of AβPP/PN-2 to increase the size of the hemorrhage in the model used suggests that some portion of the molecule has an anticoagulant effect, and this seems to be the KPI domain. Intriguingly, mice lacking AβPP/PN-2 had decreased hemorrhage volume in this model, implying either that enhanced thrombosis limited the hemorrhage size or that there are some aspects of the artificial hemorrhage in mice that express AβPP with the KPI domain that are not understood.

Studies building on the new findings could broaden their clinical relevance. But it is important first to know how cerebral microvessels interact molecularly with AβPP and the KPI domain. The matrix barrier in the cerebral microvasculature could well be a partner in these events. Perhaps AβPP can interrupt the interaction of endothelial cells and other components of the microvessel with the basal lamina.

As hemorrhagic transformation is a common accompaniment of focal ischemia, what would be the impact of varying amounts of AβPP with and without the KPI domain on the risk of hemorrhage in the setting of mouse ischemic stroke? Does AβPP/PN-2 contribute to the varying risk of hemorrhage in individuals after ischemic stroke? Perhaps some people have one AβPP isoform with a KPI domain and others have non–KPI-containing isoforms. Perhaps the various isoforms of amyloid within the cerebral vessels promote different risks of hemorrhage. Maybe the frequency of hemorrhage in individuals with ischemic stroke is linked to the amount of Aβ deposition.

Knowing whether Aβ is deposited, and which isoforms are present in people who are at risk for stroke, could help us know who might carry the risk of cerebral hemorrhage."
