A series of such measurements on children and young adults shows good correlations with skin-fold thickness and weight/height ratio as indices of fatness."

https://openalex.org/W145122927,"The metabolism of the estrogenic hormone is oxidative in nature in contrast to the reductive pathway for the neutral steroid hormones. It has been postulated that estrone is the precursor of estriol on the evidence that the required ketol intermediates are normal metabolites of the estrogenic hormone (2-4). However, it is equally true that enzymatic hydroxylation of chemically unreactive methylene groups is a common feature of steroid biochemistry (5), and thus estradiol might serve as the immediate precursor of estriol with the ketols formed by subsequent oxidation. To clarify this problem we have examined the metabolism of estrone and estradiol simultaneously in the same human subject. For this purpose, estradiol labeled with tritium in ring B and estrone-16-Cl4 were dissolved together and administered intravenously to three different patients. The ratio of weight as well as isotope of the two hormones was varied in each of the studies. Urine and blood collections were obtained at successive intervals immediately after the injections and the isotopic content of the metabolites was examined after purification to radiochemical homogeneity. The results of the three studies were completely concordant. It was shown that the rate of conversion of estrone to estradiol was slow, whereas the reverse reaction was quite rapid. It seems clear that estrone rather than estradiol is the major precursor of estriol, 2-methoxyestrone, and 16-epiestriol."

The chemical evidence for the identity of uracil rests on chromatography, spectrography, color tests, and melting points and analyses of isolated material. The place of uracil in a scheme of biochemical origins, including carbon dioxide as an intermediate, is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2040933072,Portulaca oleracea L. is one of the plants reputed to be of value in the treatment of cardio-vascular diseases in Jamaican folk-lore1. It was therefore examined for the possible occurrence of pharmacologically active substances.

https://openalex.org/W2016424077,"The Isla Verde, Puerto Rico, laboratory colony, highly resistant to DDT and dieldrin in 1959, became even more so by 1960; resistance to organic phosphates was also greater than before. In laboratory tests Bayer 29493 was best for killing resistant larvae and adults. It is improved with piperonyl butoxide at the ratio of 10:1."
https://openalex.org/W2084069608,"THIS Laboratory is examining the chemistry of ‘gastrin’, about which little has been reported. We have recently prepared a gastrin-like secretory stimulant from porcine antral mucosa by a new and somewhat novel method. This is a preliminary report on its chemical properties, and similar data on ‘gastrin’ as prepared by a more conventional procedure. The quotation marks signify only that it is not known whether gastrin is a single compound, or a group of similar structures with a common unique moiety, or a group of biologically, more or less, specific substances. The facts that gastrin has been reported as dialysable1, non-dialysable2, with an isoelectric point near pH 5.03, or pH 8.04, to name only a few of its properties, leave the question very much open. Recently, Gregory et al. 5 described a gastrin-like substance isolated from a pancreatic tumour."

https://openalex.org/W1984181533,"Wakil, Titchener and Gibson1 have shown that the formation of malonate from acetate and carbon dioxide is an early step in the synthesis of fatty acids in cell-free preparations of pigeon liver. They have also shown that biotin is necessary for this reaction, since it is inhibited by avidin, a specific inhibitor of biotin. By observing the effect of avidin, we have been able to show that, in cell-free preparations of rat liver, biotin is also required for the synthesis from acetate of fatty acids, but is not required for synthesis of cholesterol. It is thus possible to inhibit one biosynthetic pathway without influencing the other."
https://openalex.org/W1986855556,"IN order to find the cause of hypomagnesæmia in adult ruminants, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the mechanism controlling magnesium-levels in blood and particularly the relationship between bone and blood magnesium. Bone from cows suffering from hypomagnesæmia showed no depletion of magnesium1, and this has led to the theory that the lability of bone magnesium is much reduced in adult animals2. There are no figures in the literature, however, for either the amount or the rate of mobilization of skeletal magnesium in adult ruminants, but such data can be obtained from work on the uptake of radioactive magnesium by bone. Because of the short half-life of magnesium-28, only that part of the bone magnesium which is rapidly exchanged with the magnesium of plasma and other body fluids can be measured."

However, trains of 1000 light pulses per second alternated successively with trains of 500 light pulses per second may be perceived as flickering even though the time-average luminance is the same in each train."

Sum and Lind1, in a preliminary communication, have recently described a flocculation test using toxoplasma antigen adsorbed on to acrylic particles. They stated that preliminary results of absorption experiments showed the existence of more than one toxoplasma antigen. The following experiments carried out in this Laboratory may be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2045811441,"In order to determine whether the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium in living organisms is accompanied by changes in amounts and distribution of the cellular components, a preliminary cytochemical investigation has been made on deuterated Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmis obliquus. Cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid is more widely distributed and occurs in higher quantities in deuterated than in nondeuterated algae. Nuclei of deuterated cells are more irregular in shape, and mitotic figures appear with greater frequency in the deuterated organisms."

When pecking was completely disrupted by tone, shock was disconnected, and the training tone and tones having new frequencies were presented. Initially the gradient of generalization was broad; as testing proceeded, however, the gradient narrowed severely."

https://openalex.org/W2032258804,"IT is well known that the proteolytic enzyme trypsin fails to hydrolyse native proteins, or hydrolyses them to only a very small extent. The denaturation of protein substrate is therefore a customary preliminary operation in all work involving the action of trypsin on proteins. We report here the effect of trypsin on some chemical derivatives of a pure de-ionized1 Bence-Jones protein isolated in large amounts from the urine of a single patient."
https://openalex.org/W2161687859,"Reduced pyridine nucleotides are oxidatively catalyzed in weakly acidic solutions. The rate is proportional to the acidity, and at constant acidic pH, the reaction follows first-order kinetics. The rate of oxidation of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide is approximately 3 times that of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. The reaction offers a very plausible explanation for the metabolic efficiency of the malignant tumor cell. It may also play a key role in wound healing and muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2031801323,"Figures of speech are tangible manifestations of deeply rooted modes of perception and conceptualization. They represent categories or models for interpreting the universe-natural and supernatural, and material and non-material phenomena. These categories or models are reflected in all aspects of culture and are fundamentally determined by culture. They should not be considered universal but, rather, extremely relative and highly variable. Some students of language and culture, such as Whorf, would consider figures of speech not to be the most important organizing categories and would give precedence to grammatical constructions-that is, subject-predicate division or verb tenses. The use of figures of speech, however, is in some ways more easily investigated than grammatical categories, and their analysis can provide both unique and corroborative insights into various aspects of a culture, as has been demonstrated here with Palauan social organization."
