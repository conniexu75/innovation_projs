https://openalex.org/W2032640007,"Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression, but the mechanisms by which they act are still largely unknown. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome during development in female mammals. Despite extensive efforts to define the mechanism of Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins required for this role. The main challenge is that there are currently no methods to comprehensively define the proteins that directly interact with a lncRNA in the cell. Here we develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify ten proteins that specifically associate with Xist, three of these proteins--SHARP, SAF-A and LBR--are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing. We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor that activates HDAC3, is not only essential for silencing, but is also required for the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and HDAC3 are also required for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to silencing transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the X chromosome. Our results suggest that Xist silences transcription by directly interacting with SHARP, recruiting SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude Pol II across the X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2101995469,"Homeostasis is a biological principle for regulation of essential physiological parameters within a set range. Behavioural responses due to deviation from homeostasis are critical for survival, but motivational processes engaged by physiological need states are incompletely understood. We examined motivational characteristics of two separate neuron populations that regulate energy and fluid homeostasis by using cell-type-specific activity manipulations in mice. We found that starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons exhibit properties consistent with a negative-valence teaching signal. Mice avoided activation of AGRP neurons, indicating that AGRP neuron activity has negative valence. AGRP neuron inhibition conditioned preference for flavours and places. Correspondingly, deep-brain calcium imaging revealed that AGRP neuron activity rapidly reduced in response to food-related cues. Complementary experiments activating thirst-promoting neurons also conditioned avoidance. Therefore, these need-sensing neurons condition preference for environmental cues associated with nutrient or water ingestion, which is learned through reduction of negative-valence signals during restoration of homeostasis. Cell-type-specific electrical activity manipulations and deep-brain imaging in mice of neuronal populations associated with homeostasis of nutrient or fluid intake reveals that learning is conditioned by a negative-valence signal from the hunger-mediating AGRP neurons and also from the thirst-mediating neurons in the subfornical organ. Animals respond to deviations in physiological balance with specific behaviours designed to rebalance their state. The motivational drive underlying these adjustments in pursuit of homeostasis are not well understood. Here, Scott Sternson and colleagues investigate the motivational processes mediated by homeostatic neurons for hunger and thirst. They find that as well as promoting food or water seeking behaviours, starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons and thirst-promoting neurons transmit negative valence teaching signals that are actively avoided. The net effect may be to condition the animal to have a preference for cues associated with food intake, offsetting negative valence signals as the animal achieves physiological balance through food and water intake."
https://openalex.org/W2111940175,"Active neurons exert a mitogenic effect on normal neural precursor and oligodendroglial precursor cells, the putative cellular origins of high-grade glioma (HGG). By using optogenetic control of cortical neuronal activity in a patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma xenograft model, we demonstrate that active neurons similarly promote HGG proliferation and growth in vivo. Conditioned medium from optogenetically stimulated cortical slices promoted proliferation of pediatric and adult patient-derived HGG cultures, indicating secretion of activity-regulated mitogen(s). The synaptic protein neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) was identified as the leading candidate mitogen, and soluble NLGN3 was sufficient and necessary to promote robust HGG cell proliferation. NLGN3 induced PI3K-mTOR pathway activity and feedforward expression of NLGN3 in glioma cells. NLGN3 expression levels in human HGG negatively correlated with patient overall survival. These findings indicate the important role of active neurons in the brain tumor microenvironment and identify secreted NLGN3 as an unexpected mechanism promoting neuronal activity-regulated cancer growth."

https://openalex.org/W2110177837,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that serves as a primary regulator for blood pressure maintenance. Although several anti-hypertensive drugs have been developed as AT(1)R blockers (ARBs), the structural basis for AT(1)R ligand-binding and regulation has remained elusive, mostly due to the difficulties of growing high-quality crystals for structure determination using synchrotron radiation. By applying the recently developed method of serial femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser, we successfully determined the room-temperature crystal structure of the human AT(1)R in complex with its selective antagonist ZD7155 at 2.9-Å resolution. The AT(1)R-ZD7155 complex structure revealed key structural features of AT(1)R and critical interactions for ZD7155 binding. Docking simulations of the clinically used ARBs into the AT(1)R structure further elucidated both the common and distinct binding modes for these anti-hypertensive drugs. Our results thereby provide fundamental insights into AT(1)R structure-function relationship and structure-based drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1987261355,"Corticothalamic neurons provide massive input to the thalamus. This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically excite thalamocortical cells, but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic influence is dynamic, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During low-frequency activity, corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive, whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic influence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus, possibly to meet changing behavioral demands."
https://openalex.org/W2081528800,"The genomic regulatory programmes that underlie human organogenesis are poorly understood. Pancreas development, in particular, has pivotal implications for pancreatic regeneration, cancer and diabetes. We have now characterized the regulatory landscape of embryonic multipotent progenitor cells that give rise to all pancreatic epithelial lineages. Using human embryonic pancreas and embryonic-stem-cell-derived progenitors we identify stage-specific transcripts and associated enhancers, many of which are co-occupied by transcription factors that are essential for pancreas development. We further show that TEAD1, a Hippo signalling effector, is an integral component of the transcription factor combinatorial code of pancreatic progenitor enhancers. TEAD and its coactivator YAP activate key pancreatic signalling mediators and transcription factors, and regulate the expansion of pancreatic progenitors. This work therefore uncovers a central role for TEAD and YAP as signal-responsive regulators of multipotent pancreatic progenitors, and provides a resource for the study of embryonic development of the human pancreas. By deciphering the transcriptional network of human embryonic pancreatic progenitors, Ferrer and colleagues identify the Hippo-responsive transcription factor TEAD1 as a regulator of the pancreatic progenitor enhancer programme."
https://openalex.org/W2069856609,"Lipid rafts in plasma membranes have emerged as possible platforms for the entry of HIV and other viruses into cells. However, little is known about how lipid phase heterogeneity contributes to viral entry because of the fine-grained and still poorly understood complexity of biological membranes. We used model systems mimicking HIV envelopes and T cell membranes and found that raft-like liquid-ordered (Lo-phase) lipid domains were necessary and sufficient for efficient membrane targeting and fusion. Interestingly, membrane binding and fusion were low in homogeneous liquid-disordered (Ld-phase) and Lo-phase membranes, indicating that lipid phase heterogeneity is essential. The HIV fusion peptide preferentially targeted to Lo-Ld boundary regions and promoted full fusion at the interface between ordered and disordered lipids. Ld-phase vesicles proceeded only to hemifusion. Thus, we propose that edges but not areas of raft-like ordered lipid domains are vital for HIV entry and membrane fusion."

Our findings provide valuable mechanistic insights into the cognitive and psychiatric symptoms associated with a schizophrenia-predisposing mutation. Deletions of the 22q11.2 locus are among the most common chromosomal abnormalities and occur predominantly de novo (McDonald-McGinn et al., 2001McDonald-McGinn D.M. Tonnesen M.K. Laufer-Cahana A.

Housman D. et al.Psychotic illness in patients diagnosed with velo-cardio-facial syndrome and their relatives.J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 1994; 182: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). New 22q11.2 deletions account for 1%–2% of sporadic schizophrenia cases (Xu et al., 2008Xu B. Roos J.L. Levy S. van Rensburg E.J. Gogos J.A. Karayiorgou M. Strong association of de novo copy number mutations with sporadic schizophrenia.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Most affected individuals carry a 3 Mb deletion, whereas 7% have a nested 1.5 Mb deletion spanning 27 known genes. Previous work has provided insights into the genetic basis of the psychiatric and cognitive symptoms observed in carriers of 22q11.2 deletions and implicated a subset of these genes including ZDHHC8 (Mukai et al., 2004Mukai J. Liu H. Burt R.A. Swor D.E. Lai W.S. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Evidence that the gene encoding ZDHHC8 contributes to the risk of schizophrenia.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Notably, a genetic variant of ZDHHC8 that modulates the complex splicing pattern at this locus was associated with schizophrenia in some cohorts of karyotypically normal patients (Mukai et al., 2004Mukai J. Liu H. Burt R.A. Swor D.E. Lai W.S. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Evidence that the gene encoding ZDHHC8 contributes to the risk of schizophrenia.Nat.

Genet. 2004; 13: 2991-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ZDHHC8 is a palmitoyltransferase belonging to a 23-member family of enzymes that share a conserved cysteine-rich signature catalytic domain (DHHC domain) (Fukata and Fukata, 2010Fukata Y. Fukata M. Protein palmitoylation in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Protein palmitoylation describes the addition of the saturated 16-carbon palmitate lipid at specific cysteine residues by a liable thioester bond (el-Husseini and Bredt, 2002el-Husseini Ael.-D. Bredt D.S. Protein palmitoylation: a regulator of neuronal development and function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and has emerged as a key reversible posttranslational protein modification involved in the protein trafficking and the regulation of diverse membrane and cytosolic proteins, especially in neurons (el-Husseini and Bredt, 2002el-Husseini Ael.-D. Bredt D.S. Protein palmitoylation: a regulator of neuronal development and function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The biochemical machinery involved has only recently been identified, and our earlier work established a connection between palmitoylation and neural signaling in vivo (Mukai et al., 2008Mukai J. Dhilla A. Drew L.J. Stark K.L. Cao L. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Palmitoylation-dependent neurodevelopmental deficits in a mouse model of 22q11 microdeletion.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using chromosomal engineering, we generated the Df(16)A+/− mouse model, which carries a 1.3 Mb chromosomal deficiency (Df(16)A) that is syntenic to the human 22q11.2 1.5 Mb deletion (Stark et al., 2008Stark K.L. Xu B. Bagchi A. Lai W.S. Liu H. Hsu R. Wan X. Pavlidis P. Mills A.A. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Altered brain microRNA biogenesis contributes to phenotypic deficits in a 22q11-deletion mouse model.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We also reported the generation and characterization of a mouse strain carrying a deletion of the Zdhhc8 gene (Mukai et al., 2004Mukai J. Liu H. Burt R.A. Swor D.E. Lai W.S. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Df(16)A+/− mice have reduced dendritic branching and spine density in hippocampal neurons, a phenotype, which is also observed in Zdhhc8-deficient mice (Mukai et al., 2008Mukai J. Dhilla A. Drew L.J. Stark K.L. Cao L. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Palmitoylation-dependent neurodevelopmental deficits in a mouse model of 22q11 microdeletion.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We also provided evidence that PSD95, a key postsynaptic protein, is one of the substrates of ZDHHC8, a finding replicated recently by Ho et al., 2011Ho G.P. Selvakumar B. Mukai J. Hester L.D. Wang Y. Gogos J.A. Snyder S.H. S-nitrosylation and S-palmitoylation reciprocally regulate synaptic targeting of PSD-95.Neuron. 2011; 71: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and Yoshii et al., 2011Yoshii A. Murata Y. Kim J. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Constantine-Paton M. TrkB and protein kinase Mζ regulate synaptic localization of PSD-95 in developing cortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11894-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. As part of our systematic efforts to identify additional ZDHHC8 substrates, we made the unexpected discovery that Zdhhc8 deficiency affects palmitoylation of a number of proteins thought to regulate axonal growth and branching. By following up this finding, we present the results of a comprehensive analysis of axonal projections of pyramidal neurons from both Df(16)A+/− and Zdhhc8-deficient mice. We found that mutant mice have deficits in axonal growth during embryogenesis as well as in terminal arborization, which can be prevented by reintroduction of enzymatically active ZDHHC8. Impaired terminal arborization of pyramidal neurons is accompanied by a reduction in the strength of synaptic connections as well as altered functional connectivity and spatial working memory (WM) performance. Finally, using genetic and pharmacological rescue, we show that the effect of ZDHHC8 on axon growth is mediated in part via Cdc42-dependent modulation of Akt/Gsk3β signaling at the tip of the axon. The palmitoylation-dependent changes in structural connectivity we describe represent possible predisposing factors to the psychiatric and cognitive symptoms associated with the 22q11.2 deletion. To find substrates of ZDHHC8 palmitoyltransferase activity, we employed the acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) proteomic technology (Wan et al., 2007Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Palmitoylated proteins: purification and identification.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which purifies palmitoylated proteins from complex protein extracts. Proteins extracted from cultured mouse embryonic cortical neurons from Zdhhc8−/− and wild-type (WT) mice at DIV21 were used for this analysis. We have previously shown that PSD95 is a ZDHHC8 substrate (Mukai et al., 2008Mukai J. Dhilla A. Drew L.J. Stark K.L. Cao L. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A.

Other proposed ZDHHC8 substrates include GAP43 (Mukai et al., 2008Mukai J. Dhilla A. Drew L.J. Stark K.L. Cao L. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Palmitoylation-dependent neurodevelopmental deficits in a mouse model of 22q11 microdeletion.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and GRIP1 (Thomas et al., 2012Thomas G.M. Hayashi T. Chiu S.L. Chen C.M. Huganir R.L. Palmitoylation by DHHC5/8 targets GRIP1 to dendritic endosomes to regulate AMPA-R trafficking.Neuron. 2012; 73: 482-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ABE analysis showed that, compared with WT neurons, palmitoylation level of PSD95 was reduced by 30% in Zdhhc8−/− (Zdhhc8−/−, 22 mice, n = 22; Zdhhc8+/+, 21 mice, n = 21, p < 0.0003) (Figure 1A). GRIP1 was also reduced 26% in Zdhhc8−/− (Zdhhc8−/−, 17 mice, n = 17; Zdhhc8+/+, 16 mice, n = 16, p < 0.005) (Figures 1A and 1B). Palmitoylation of GAP43 was reduced by 17% in Zdhhc8−/− neurons (Zdhhc8−/−, 26 mice, n = 26; Zdhhc8+/+, 28 mice, n = 28, p < 0.001). In contrast, SNAP25 (Zdhhc8−/−, 112%, 17 mice, n = 17; Zdhhc8+/+, 16 mice, n = 16, p > 0.1) and Synaptotagmin I (Zdhhc8−/−, 99%, 17 mice, n = 17; Zdhhc8+/+, 16 mice, n = 16, p > 0.1), which were not palmitoylated by ZDHHC8 in vitro (Mukai et al., 2008Mukai J. Dhilla A. Drew L.J. Stark K.L. Cao L. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Palmitoylation-dependent neurodevelopmental deficits in a mouse model of 22q11 microdeletion.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), showed no change of palmitoylation level in Zdhhc8−/− neurons as assayed by ABE. Having validated our approach, we looked for additional substrates. The strongest reduction of palmitoylation in Zdhhc8−/− neurons was observed for Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, which regulate actin cytoskeleton and cellular morphology inducing filopodia and lamellipodia in many cell types (Iden and Collard, 2008Iden S. Collard J.G. Crosstalk between small GTPases and polarity proteins in cell polarization.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In Zdhhc8−/− neurons, palmitoylation of Cdc42 was reduced by 33% (Zdhhc8−/−, 17 mice, n = 17; Zdhhc8+/+, 16 mice, n = 16, p < 0.005), and palmitoylation of Rac1 was reduced by 38% (Zdhhc8−/−, 17 mice, n = 17; Zdhhc8+/+, 16 mice, n = 16, p < 0.0001). Our finding that ZDHHC8 palmitoylates a number of proteins involved in axonal development prompted us to investigate the role of Zdhhc8 in this process. To this end, we first used cortical cultures from Zdhhc8-deficient mice (Zdhhc8+/−, Zdhhc8−/−) and Zdhhc8+/+ littermates (see Figure S1A available online). Dissociated cortical neurons were cultured for 3 days, and axon polarity was analyzed by staining with anti-Tau-1 antibody as an axon-specific marker, anti- MAP2 antibody as a dendritic marker, and phalloidin to visualize the whole neuron. Control WT cortical neurons developed normal polarity, with most of them having a single axon and multiple dendrites (77.0% ± 0.9%), 3.4% ± 0.5% of neurons with multiple axons, and 19.6% ± 1.2% of neurons with no discernable axon. Zdhhc8 deficiency significantly reduced the portion of neurons having a single axon (Zdhhc8+/−, 67.3% ± 1.3%, p < 0.0001; Zdhhc8−/−, 62.1% ± 1.8%, p < 0.0001) (Figures S1A and S1B). The axons of Zdhhc8-deficient neurons were also significantly shorter than those of the WT cells (Figure S1C). The length and number of dendrites were modestly, but significantly, reduced in Zdhhc8-deficient neurons (Figures S1D and S1E). To elaborate further on this observation, dissociated cortical neurons were transfected with a plasmid for EGFP at DIV2 and cultured for 4 days before analysis of axon length and branching. Primary axon length was reduced in Zdhhc8+/− and Zdhhc8−/− neurons at DIV4 (341.2 ± 14.6 μm, n = 24, p < 0.05; 305.2 ± 22.2 μm, n = 24, p < 0.005), compared to Zdhhc8+/+ neurons (421.4 ± 17.1 μm, n = 24) (Figures 1C and 1D). Specifically, Zdhhc8 deficiency caused a decrease in the number of branch points in both Zdhhc8+/− (4.0 ± 0.3, n = 24, p < 0.05) and Zdhhc8−/− (3.3 ± 0.3, n = 24, p < 0.001) neurons compared to Zdhhc8+/+ neurons (5.3 ± 0.3, n = 24; Figures 1C and 1D), respectively. To confirm that the effect on axonal growth was directly mediated via ZDHHC8 transferase activity, we expressed the full-length enzymatically active form (ZDHHC8-FL) or an enzymatically inactive form (ZDHHC8-C134A) in cortical neurons from Zdhhc8−/− mice. In Zdhhc8−/− neurons expressing ZDHHC8-FL (n = 24), the numbers of total branchpoints (5.2 ± 0.3, n = 24, p < 0.05) and primary axon length (397.0 ± 22.7, n = 24, p < 0.05) were restored to Zdhhc8+/+ levels, whereas the enzymatically inactive form (n = 18) did not influence these parameters (Figures 1C and 1D). Prompted by these findings, we investigated further whether palmitoylation in general regulates axon polarity. The consequence of suppressing palmitoylation in developing neurons was examined using 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), an inhibitor to palmitoyltransferase activity, to treat cultured cortical neurons during the transition from stage 2 to stage 3, a critical period in which rapid axonal growth and polarization occur (Yoshimura et al., 2006Yoshimura T. Arimura N. Kaibuchi K. Signaling networks in neuronal polarization.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10626-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). While most WT cells displayed a single neurite marked by the axonal marker Tau-1 (78.0% ± 0.5% of the cells), treatment with 2-BP reduced neurons with a single Tau-1-positive neurite (to 56.0% ± 1.1% of cells treated with 0.1 μM 2-BP) (Figures S1F and S1G). Both axons (Figures S1F and S1H) and MAP2-stained dendrites (Figures S1I and S1J) of treated cells were significantly shorter (in a dosage-dependent manner) than that of untreated cells. In addition, analysis of axon branching at DIV4 (following treatment with 0.1 μM 2-BP) revealed a reduction in primary axon length compared to control neurons (288.0 ± 11.2 μm versus 432.5 ± 23.9 μm, n = 18, p < 0.001) as well as a significant decrease in the number of branchpoints compared to control neurons (2.3 ± 0.2 μm versus 5.8 ± 0.5 μm, n = 18, p < 0.005) (Figures S1M–S1P). Interestingly, 0.1 μM 2-BP treatment further reduced the portion of Zdhhc8−/− single-axon cells compared to untreated Zdhhc8−/− cells (49.8% ± 2.2% versus 62.0% ± 1.8%, Figures S1K and S1L), suggesting that other DHHC isoforms might also contribute to modulate neuronal polarity. To determine the effect of ZDHHC8 activity on axon development in vivo, we used in utero electroporation to express EGFP in newly divided cortical neurons of Zdhhc8−/− embryos and examine axon morphology at a single-cell resolution (Figure S2A). Following electroporation at E14.5, embryos were placed back into the mother and allowed to develop for an additional 3 days (E17.5), at which point the morphology of EGFP-positive migrating neurons was examined. Electroporated neurons in both control and mutant cortices had migrated through the intermediate zone (IZ) and reached the cortical plate (CP) (Figure S2A), indicating that ZDHHC8 is dispensable for proper radial migration. When neuronal migration through the CP is completed, transfected layers 2/3 neurons show a polarized morphology with developing dendritic arbors and thin, straight axons. In WT brains, EGFP-expressing neurons show a typical basal axon and multiple apical dendrites derived from a single dendritic base (Figures S2B and S2C). The vast majority of both WT and mutant neurons have a single axon. Although we cannot exclude subtle polarity differences among genotypes, Zdhhc8 deficiency does not appear to have a strong effect on polarity in vivo. This likely relates to the redundancy of DHHC palmitoyltransferases and polarity signaling pathways. On the other hand, examination of the length of axons in WT or Zdhhc8-deficient cortices confirmed that Zdhhc8 deficiency resulted in a decrease in axon length (11% in Zdhhc8+/− [n = 24, p < 0.05], 25% in Zdhhc8−/− [n = 24, p < 0.001]) compared with Zdhhc8+/+ brains (n = 24) (Figures S2B and S2C). Expression of ZDHHC8 FL (n = 18) restored axonal length in Zdhhc8−/− brains to Zdhhc8+/+ levels (Figures S2B and S2C). To investigate further the role of ZDHHC8 on axonal branching, plasmids encoding EGFP were electroporated in utero into the dorsolateral ventricular zone of the mouse forebrain at E15.5, and embryos were allowed to be born and develop to P8.5 for analysis. All cells labeled with EGFP completed their migration into layers 2/3 by P8.5. As shown previously (Jeanneteau et al., 2010Jeanneteau F. Deinhardt K. Miyoshi G. Bennett A.M. Chao M.V. The MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1 regulates BDNF-induced axon branching.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), callosal axons crossed the midline, coursed beneath the gray matter of the contralateral somatosensory cortex, penetrated the gray matter, and ascended to layers 1–3 and 5 (Figure 2A). The number of callosal axon-terminal branches within the contralateral cortical layers 1–4 was decreased by disruption of Zdhhc8, with notably fewer secondary branches (total branch number, 34% in Zdhhc8+/− [n = 19, p < 0.0001], 45% in Zdhhc8−/− [n = 19, p < 0.0001]), compared with Zdhhc8+/+ brains (n = 19) (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E). Analysis of the collateral branching of axons within the ipsilateral cortical layers 2–4 (Figures 2C and 2F) showed that disruption of Zdhhc8 resulted in a decrease in the number of axonal branches (23% in Zdhhc8+/− [n = 19, p < 0.001], 31% in Zdhhc8−/− [n = 19, p < 0.0001]) compared with Zdhhc8+/+ brains (n = 19) (Figure 2G). To confirm that the effect on axonal branching was directly mediated via ZDHHC8 activity, we electroporated a construct driving both EGFP and ZDHHC8FL (ZDHHC8FL::IRES-EGFP) into Zdhhc8−/− embryos in utero. Restricting our analysis to ipsilateral projections, we showed that ZDHHC8FL expression reversed the number of axonal branches in cortical layers 2–4 to WT levels (Figures 2H and 2I). To examine whether reduced axonal arborization persists in adulthood, mice were electroporated with EGFP at E15.5 and were sacrificed at P56 to evaluate adult patterns of axonal branching. As shown previously in P21 brain (Courchet et al., 2013Courchet J. Lewis Jr., T.L. Lee S. Courchet V. Liou D.Y. Aizawa S. Polleux F. Terminal axon branching is regulated by the LKB1-NUAK1 kinase pathway via presynaptic mitochondrial capture.Cell. 2013; 153: 1510-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), callosal axons of layers 2/3 pyramidal neurons branch extensively between P8.5 and P56 in contralateral layers 1–3 and layer 5 (Figures S2D and 2J) and ipsilateral layers 2/3 and layer 5 (Figure 2K) while avoiding branching in layers 4 and 6 both contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. We analyzed EGFP intensity in ipsilateral and contralateral axon target regions to quantify the complexity of axon branching. Zdhhc8 deficiency showed significantly reduced branching contralaterally in both layer 1 and 2/3 (Figure 2J) as well as ipsilaterally in layer 5 (Figure 2L). We have previously shown that 22q11.2 deletion lead to abnormal PFC–HPC coupling, similar to the one reported in schizophrenia patients (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Such long-range connectivity deficits may underlie deficits in cognition and other aspects of the clinical diagnosis. We have also reported an impairment of spatial WM in Df(16)+/− mice, which appears to be due in part to altered functional connectivity between the HPC and mPFC (Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The circuit basis for this deficit may be complex, involving at least in part anatomical connections affected in terms of axonal extension and branching. We therefore asked whether Zdhhc8 deficiency disrupts the long-range projection from the HPC to mPFC and affects HPC-mPFC synchrony and WM performance. Initial analysis of axonal morphogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons collected from Zdhhc8-deficient mice and their WT littermates revealed a deficit of polarity as well as a pattern and degree of axonal arbor simplification (Figures S3A–S3I) very similar to those observed in Zdhhc8-deficient cortical neurons. Most importantly, deficits observed in vitro in neuronal cultures are recapitulated in the developing brains of mutant mice. Following in utero electroporation of an EGFP construct to ventral hippocampus (vHPC) at E16.5 (Figure S3J), the morphology of EGFP-positive axons was examined in sagittal brain sections during postnatal development. Labeled ventral field CA1axons in both Zdhhc8+/+ and Zdhhc8+/− projected normally to frontal regions of the cerebral cortex, extended rostrally through the lateral septal nucleus in the precommissural fornix, and reached the dorsal tenia tecta. At P16.5 a subset of fibers at the tenia tecta extended dorsally near the genu of the corpus callosum to the infralimbic area, prelimbic area, and anterior cingulated area (Figure S3J). At P16.5 the number of axon-terminal branches in the layer 5 of prelimbic mPFC was significantly reduced in Zdhhc8+/− mice, with notably fewer secondary branches (Figures S3K and 3A–3C ). To examine whether reduced axonal arborization persists in adulthood, we injected an adeno-associated virus (rAAV1/hSynapsin/EGFP) into CA1 in the vHPC at P56 (8 weeks), and mice were sacrificed at P84 (12 weeks) (Figure S3L). Evaluation of patterns of axonal branching in mPFC of Zdhhc8-deficient mice showed significantly reduced axon branching in layer 5 of prelimbic mPFC (Figures 3D–3F). To examine the impact of Zdhhc8 deficiency on long-range functional connectivity and WM, Zdhhc8+/− mice and their WT littermates were implanted with recording electrodes aimed at the ventral (vHPC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), as well as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Neural activity was then recorded at baseline, and during training and testing in the T-maze delayed nonmatch to sample test of spatial WM. Behaviorally, Zdhhc8+/− mice took significantly longer than WT mice to reach criterion performance on the T-maze task (Figure 3G). Zdhhc8+/− mice also showed lower theta-frequency (4–12 Hz) coherence between vHPC and mPFC as well as vHPC and dHPC after acquisition of the task (Figures 3H–3K). Although there was no statistically significant difference in theta coherence during a baseline session before training (Figure 3L), baseline theta coherence between vHPC and mPFC was inversely correlated with days to criterion (Figure 3M). Thus, the observed deficits in anatomical connectivity between vHPC and mPFC, due to Zdhhc8 deficiency, are accompanied by a disruption of functional connectivity between these two areas during behavior, which was narrower than that seen with the complete mutation (Df16(A) +/− mice; Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In turn, disruption of the long-range projections from HPC to mPFC may contribute, possibly along with more localized deficits in pyramidal and inhibitory neuron function, to the impaired WM performance. In addition to the impaired connectivity between vHPC and mPFC, several other salient features identified by our analysis of Zdhhc8-deficient mice were recapitulated in Df(16)A+/− mice. First, ABE analysis showed that, compared with WT neurons, palmitoylation level of PSD95, Cdc42, and Rac1 was reduced in Df(16)A+/− (Figures S4A and S4B), but to a lesser extent than in Zdhhc8−/− (Figures 1A and 1B). Second, analysis of axonal morphogenesis in primary cortical neurons from Df(16)A+/− mice and their WT littermates revealed a pattern and degree of axonal arbor simplification very similar to those observed in Zdhhc8 deficient neurons. Specifically, compared to DIV3 WT neurons, Df(16)A+/− neurons demonstrated a significantly reduced portion of single axon cells (66.0% ± 1.0% versus 78.0% ± 1.0% in WT, p < 0.0001; Figures S4C and S4D). Also, the axons of Df(16)A+/− neurons were significantly shorter than those of the WT cells (78.1 ± 3.0 μm versus 116.2 ± 3.0 μm in WT, p < 0.0001; Figure S4E). The length and number of dendrites were also significantly reduced in Df(16)A+/− neurons (Figures S4F and"
https://openalex.org/W2012400528,"How embryonic stem cells (ESCs) commit to specific cell lineages and yield all cell types of a fully formed organism remains a major question. ESC differentiation is accompanied by large-scale histone and DNA modifications, but the relations between these epigenetic categories are not understood. Here we demonstrate the interplay between the histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and the ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TETs). SIRT6 targets acetylated histone H3 at Lys 9 and 56 (H3K9ac and H3K56ac), while TETs convert 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). ESCs derived from Sirt6 knockout (S6KO) mice are skewed towards neuroectoderm development. This phenotype involves derepression of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, which causes an upregulation of TET-dependent production of 5hmC. Genome-wide analysis revealed neural genes marked with 5hmC in S6KO ESCs, thereby implicating TET enzymes in the neuroectoderm-skewed differentiation phenotype. We demonstrate that SIRT6 functions as a chromatin regulator safeguarding the balance between pluripotency and differentiation through Tet-mediated production of 5hmC. Mostoslavsky and colleagues reveal that in embryonic stem cells (ESC) the deacetylase SIRT6 regulates pluripotency genes, which in turn controls ESC differentiation though the activity of Tet enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2117674180,"Innate defense behaviors (IDBs) evoked by threatening sensory stimuli are essential for animal survival. Although subcortical circuits are implicated in IDBs, it remains largely unclear whether sensory cortex modulates IDBs and what the underlying neural pathways are. Here, we show that optogenetic silencing of corticotectal projections from layer 5 (L5) of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) to the superior colliculus (SC) significantly reduces an SC-dependent innate behavior (i.e., temporary suspension of locomotion upon a sudden flash of light as short as milliseconds). Surprisingly, optogenetic activation of SC-projecting neurons in V1 or their axon terminals in SC sufficiently elicits the behavior, in contrast to other major L5 corticofugal projections. Thus, via the same corticofugal projection, visual cortex not only modulates the light-induced arrest behavior, but also can directly drive the behavior. Our results suggest that sensory cortex may play a previously unrecognized role in the top-down initiation of sensory-motor behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1995306952,"In flowering plants, fertilization-dependent degeneration of the persistent synergid cell ensures one-on-one pairings of male and female gametes. Here, we report that the fusion of the persistent synergid cell and the endosperm selectively inactivates the persistent synergid cell in Arabidopsis thaliana. The synergid-endosperm fusion causes rapid dilution of pre-secreted pollen tube attractant in the persistent synergid cell and selective disorganization of the synergid nucleus during the endosperm proliferation, preventing attractions of excess number of pollen tubes (polytubey). The synergid-endosperm fusion is induced by fertilization of the central cell, while the egg cell fertilization predominantly activates ethylene signaling, an inducer of the synergid nuclear disorganization. Therefore, two female gametes (the egg and the central cell) control independent pathways yet coordinately accomplish the elimination of the persistent synergid cell by double fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2024400317,"The differentiation of stem cells is a tightly regulated process essential for animal development and tissue homeostasis. Through this process, attainment of new identity and function is achieved by marked changes in cellular properties. Intrinsic cellular mechanisms governing stem cell differentiation remain largely unknown, in part because systematic forward genetic approaches to the problem have not been widely used. Analysing genes required for germline stem cell differentiation in the Drosophila ovary, we find that the mitochondrial ATP synthase plays a critical role in this process. Unexpectedly, the ATP synthesizing function of this complex was not necessary for differentiation, as knockdown of other members of the oxidative phosphorylation system did not disrupt the process. Instead, the ATP synthase acted to promote the maturation of mitochondrial cristae during differentiation through dimerization and specific upregulation of the ATP synthase complex. Taken together, our results suggest that ATP synthase-dependent crista maturation is a key developmental process required for differentiation independent of oxidative phosphorylation."

Here we report that certain receptors containing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) are crucial for the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Inhibition of expression of the ITIM-containing receptor LAIR1 does not affect normal haematopoiesis but abolishes leukaemia development. LAIR1 induces activation of SHP-1, which acts as a phosphatase-independent signalling adaptor to recruit CAMK1 for activation of downstream CREB in AML cells. The LAIR1-SHP-1-CAMK1-CREB pathway sustains the survival and self-renewal of AML stem cells. Intervention in the signalling initiated by ITIM-containing receptors such as LAIR1 may result in successful treatment of AML."
https://openalex.org/W2114279126,"It has previously been observed that a loss of β-catenin expression occurs with melanoma progression and that nuclear β-catenin levels are inversely proportional to cellular proliferation, suggesting that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may provide benefit for melanoma patients. In order to further probe this concept we tested LY2090314, a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor with activity against GSK3α and GSK3β isoforms. In a panel of melanoma cell lines, nM concentrations of LY2090314 stimulated TCF/LEF TOPFlash reporter activity, stabilized β-catenin and elevated the expression of Axin2, a Wnt responsive gene and marker of pathway activation. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that melanoma cell lines are very sensitive to LY2090314 in vitro (IC50 ~10 nM after 72hr of treatment) in contrast to other solid tumor cell lines (IC50 >10 uM) as evidenced by caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Cell lines harboring mutant B-RAF or N-RAS were equally sensitive to LY2090314 as were those with acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib. shRNA studies demonstrated that β-catenin stabilization is required for apoptosis following treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor since the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to LY290314 could be overcome by β-catenin knockdown. We further demonstrate that in vivo, LY2090314 elevates Axin2 gene expression after a single dose and produces tumor growth delay in A375 melanoma xenografts with repeat dosing. The activity of LY2090314 in preclinical models suggests that the role of Wnt activators for the treatment of melanoma should be further explored."

ParR links the filaments with centromeric parC plasmid DNA, while facilitating the addition of subunits to ParM filaments. Growing ParMRC spindles push sister plasmids to the cell poles. Here, using modern electron cryomicroscopy methods, we investigate the structures and arrangements of ParM filaments in vitro and in cells, revealing at near-atomic resolution how subunits and filaments come together to produce the simplest known mitotic machinery. To understand the mechanism of dynamic instability, we determine structures of ParM filaments in different nucleotide states. The structure of filaments bound to the ATP analogue AMPPNP is determined at 4.3 Å resolution and refined. The ParM filament structure shows strong longitudinal interfaces and weaker lateral interactions. Also using electron cryomicroscopy, we reconstruct ParM doublets forming antiparallel spindles. Finally, with whole-cell electron cryotomography, we show that doublets are abundant in bacterial cells containing low-copy-number plasmids with the ParMRC locus, leading to an asynchronous model of R1 plasmid segregation."

Pregnant women were prospectively recruited to the study, and blood samples were collected at the time of a routine oral glucose tolerance test. These samples were then analyzed for levels of endocrine and surrogate markers of oxidative stress.Compared to control subjects, women with GDM exhibited elevated values for plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (IR), and showed reduced HOMA pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA-B), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), insulinogenic index, and corrected insulin response at 24-28 weeks gestation. A bivariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and high fluorescence reticulocytes at fasting, and hs-CRP in a 1-h OGTT, were significantly associated with GDM. A linear regression analysis showed that levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.003) and reticulocytes (P = 0.029) at fasting were associated with IR, and levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.002) and monocytes (P = 0.006) in a 1-h OGTT were associated with ISI.Pregnant women with GDM developed a pathological IR and exhibited β-cell dysfunction. Their decreased ability to compensate for oxidative stress was associated with increased IR and a reduced ISI, which might be important factors in GDM."
https://openalex.org/W2091824071,"During mouse development, core planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins become polarized in the epidermal plane to guide angling/morphogenesis of hair follicles. How PCP is established is poorly understood. Here, we identify a key role for Wdr1 (also known as Aip1), an F-actin-binding protein that enhances cofilin/destrin-mediated F-actin disassembly. We show that cofilin and destrin function redundantly in developing epidermis, but their combined depletion perturbs cell adhesion, cytokinesis, apicobasal polarity and PCP. Although Wdr1 depletion accentuates single-loss-of-cofilin/destrin phenotypes, alone it resembles core PCP mutations. Seeking a mechanism, we find that Wdr1 and cofilin/destrin-mediated actomyosin remodelling are essential for generating or maintaining cortical tension within the developing epidermal sheet and driving the cell shape and planar orientation changes that accompany establishment of PCP in mammalian epidermis. Our findings suggest intriguing evolutionary parallels but mechanistic modifications to the distal wing hinge-mediated mechanical forces that drive cell shape change and orient PCP in the Drosophila wing disc."

We therefore expressed the fluorescent ATP biosensor Perceval in mouse pancreatic islets and loaded them with a Ca2+ indicator. With total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we recorded subplasma membrane concentrations of Ca2+ and ATP ([Ca2+]pm; [ATP]pm)in superficial α-and β-cells of intact islets and related signaling to glucagon and insulin secretion by immunoassay. Consistent with ATP's controlling glucagon and insulin secretion during hypo- and hyperglycemia, respectively, the dose-response relationship for glucose-induced [ATP]pm generation was left shifted in α-cells compared to β-cells. Both cell types showed [Ca2+]pm and [ATP]pm oscillations in opposite phase, probably reflecting energy-consuming Ca2+ transport. Although pulsatile insulin and glucagon release are in opposite phase, [Ca2+]pm synchronized in the same phase between α-and β-cells. This paradox can be explained by the overriding of Ca2+ stimulation by paracrine inhibition, because somatostatin receptor blockade potently stimulated glucagon release with little effect on Ca2+. The data indicate that an α-cell-intrinsic mechanism controls glucagon in hypoglycemia and that paracrine factors shape pulsatile secretion in hyperglycemia.—Li, J., Yu, Q., Ahooghalandari, P., Gribble, F.

https://openalex.org/W2166788494,"To understand the proximate and ultimate causes that shape acoustic communication in animals, objective characterizations of the vocal repertoire of a given species are critical, as they provide the foundation for comparative analyses among individuals, populations and taxa. Progress in this field has been hampered by a lack of standard in methodology, however. One problem is that researchers may settle on different variables to characterize the calls, which may impact on the classification of calls. More important, there is no agreement how to best characterize the overall structure of the repertoire in terms of the amount of gradation within and between call types. Here, we address these challenges by examining 912 calls recorded from wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We extracted 118 acoustic variables from spectrograms, from which we constructed different sets of acoustic features, containing 9, 38, and 118 variables; as well 19 factors derived from principal component analysis. We compared and validated the resulting classifications of k-means and hierarchical clustering. Datasets with a higher number of acoustic features lead to better clustering results than datasets with only a few features. The use of factors in the cluster analysis resulted in an extremely poor resolution of emerging call types. Another important finding is that none of the applied clustering methods gave strong support to a specific cluster solution. Instead, the cluster analysis revealed that within distinct call types, subtypes may exist. Because hard clustering methods are not well suited to capture such gradation within call types, we applied a fuzzy clustering algorithm. We found that this algorithm provides a detailed and quantitative description of the gradation within and between chacma baboon call types. In conclusion, we suggest that fuzzy clustering should be used in future studies to analyze the graded structure of vocal repertoires. Moreover, the use of factor analyses to reduce the number of acoustic variables should be discouraged."

In particular, exaggerated mGluR-dependent LTD is featured in fragile X syndrome, but the mechanisms that regulate mGluR-LTD remain incompletely understood. We report that conditional knockout of Cdh1, the key regulatory subunit of the ubiquitin ligase Cdh1-anaphase-promoting complex (Cdh1-APC), profoundly impairs mGluR-LTD in the hippocampus. Mechanistically, we find that Cdh1-APC operates in the cytoplasm to drive mGluR-LTD. We also identify the fragile X syndrome protein FMRP as a substrate of Cdh1-APC. Endogenous Cdh1-APC forms a complex with endogenous FMRP, and knockout of Cdh1 impairs mGluR-induced ubiquitination and degradation of FMRP in the hippocampus. Knockout of FMRP suppresses, and expression of an FMRP mutant protein that fails to interact with Cdh1 phenocopies, the Cdh1 knockout phenotype of impaired mGluR-LTD. These findings define Cdh1-APC and FMRP as components of a novel ubiquitin signaling pathway that regulates mGluR-LTD in the brain."

The hiChondrocytes are stable and comparable to adult articular chondrocytes in global gene expression, extracellular matrix production, and ability to generate cartilage tissue in vitro and in immune-deficient mice. Molecular characterization identified an early SRY (sex-determining region Y) box (Sox)9(low) cluster of differentiation (CD)44(low)CD140(low) prechondrogenic population during hiPSC differentiation. In addition, 2 distinct Sox9-regulated gene networks were identified in the Sox9(low) and Sox9(high) populations providing novel molecular insights into chondrogenic fate commitment and differentiation. Our findings present a favorable method for generating hiPSC-derived articular-like chondrocytes. The hiChondrocytes are an attractive cell source for cartilage engineering because of their abundance, autologous nature, and potential to generate articular-like cartilage rather than fibrocartilage. In addition, hiChondrocytes can be excellent tools for modeling human musculoskeletal diseases in a dish and for rapid drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W2164582844,"Glucolipotoxic stress has been identified as a key player in the progression of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction contributing to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). It has been suggested that bioactive lipid intermediates, formed under lipotoxic conditions, are involved in these processes. Here, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) levels are not only increased in palmitate-stimulated pancreatic β-cells but also regulate β-cell homeostasis in a divergent manner. Although S1P possesses a prosurvival effect in β-cells, an enhanced level of the sphingolipid antagonizes insulin-mediated cell growth and survival via the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 2 (S1P2) followed by an inhibition of Akt-signaling. In an attempt to investigate the role of the S1P/S1P2 axis in vivo, the New Zealand obese (NZO) diabetic mouse model, characterized by β-cell loss under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, was used. The occurrence of T2D was accompanied by an increase of plasma S1P levels. To examine whether S1P contributes to the morphologic changes of islets via S1P2, the receptor antagonist JTE-013 was administered. Most interestingly, JTE-013 rescued β-cell damage clearly indicating an important role of the S1P2 in β-cell homeostasis.

Although the sleep-wakefulness pattern of most toddlers includes an afternoon nap, the association between napping and circadian phase in early childhood remains unexplored. This study examined differences in circadian phase and sleep between napping and non-napping toddlers. Data were collected on 20 toddlers (34.2±2.0 months; 12 females; 15 nappers). Children followed their habitual napping and non-napping sleep schedules (monitored with actigraphy) for 5 days before an in-home salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) assessment. On average, napping children fell asleep during their nap opportunities on 3.6±1.2 of the 5 days before the DLMO assessment. For these napping children, melatonin onset time was 38 min later (p = 0.044; d = 0.93), actigraphically-estimated bedtime was 43 min later (p = 0.014; d = 1.24), sleep onset time was 59 min later (p = 0.006; d = 1.46), and sleep onset latency was 16 min longer (p = 0.030; d = 1.03) than those not napping. Midsleep and wake time did not differ by napping status. No difference was observed in the bedtime, sleep onset, or midsleep phase relationships with DLMO; however, the wake time phase difference was 47 min smaller for napping toddlers (p = 0.029; d = 1.23). On average, nappers had 69 min shorter nighttime sleep durations (p = 0.006; d = 1.47) and spent 49 min less time in bed (p = 0.019; d = 1.16) than non-nappers. Number of days napping was correlated with melatonin onset time (r = 0.49; p = 0.014). Our findings indicate that napping influences individual variability in melatonin onset time in early childhood. The delayed bedtimes of napping toddlers likely permits light exposure later in the evening, thereby delaying the timing of the clock and sleep. Whether the early developmental trajectory of circadian phase involves an advance associated with the decline in napping is a question necessitating longitudinal data as children transition from a biphasic to monophasic sleep-wakefulness pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2136251503,"Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the α5 subunit modulate nicotine consumption, and the human CHRNA5 rs16969968 polymorphism, causing the replacement of the aspartic acid residue at position 398 with an asparagine (α5DN), has recently been associated with increased use of tobacco and higher incidence of lung cancer. We show that in ventral midbrain neurons, the α5 subunit is essential for heteromeric nAChR-induced intracellular-free Ca(2+) concentration elevations and that in α5(-/-) mice, a class of large-amplitude nicotine-evoked currents is lost. Furthermore, the expression of the α5DN subunit is not able to restore nicotinic responses, indicating a loss of function by this subunit in native neurons. To understand how α5DN impairs heteromeric nAChR functions, we coexpressed α4, α5, or α5DN subunits with a dimeric concatemer (β2α4) in a heterologous system, to obtain nAChRs with fixed stoichiometry. Both α5(β2α4)2 and α5DN(β2α4)2 nAChRs yielded similar levels of functional expression and Ca(2+) permeability, measured as fractional Ca(2+) currents (8.2 ± 0.7% and 8.0 ± 1.9%, respectively), 2-fold higher than α4(β2α4)2. Our results indicate that the loss of function of nicotinic responses observed in α5DN-expressing ventral midbrain neurons is neither due to an intrinsic inability of this subunit to form functional nAChRs nor to an altered Ca(2+) permeability but likely to intracellular modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973689318,"Pachymic acid (PA) is a purified triterpene extracted from medicinal fungus Poria cocos. In this paper, we investigated the anticancer effect of PA on human chemotherapy resistant pancreatic cancer. PA triggered apoptosis in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Comparative gene expression array analysis demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was induced by PA through activation of heat shock response and unfolded protein response related genes. Induced ER stress was confirmed by increasing expression of XBP-1s, ATF4, Hsp70, CHOP and phospho-eIF2α. Moreover, ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) blocked PA induced apoptosis. In addition, 25 mg kg-1 of PA significantly suppressed MIA PaCa-2 tumor growth in vivo without toxicity, which correlated with induction of apoptosis and expression of ER stress related proteins in tumor tissues. Taken together, growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis by PA in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells were associated with ER stress activation both in vitro and in vivo. PA may be potentially exploited for the use in treatment of chemotherapy resistant pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2003866316,"Elevated levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) correlate with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ADMA is generated by the catabolism of proteins methylated on arginine residues by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) and is degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase. Reports have shown that dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase activity is down-regulated and PRMT1 protein expression is up-regulated under oxidative stress conditions, leading many to conclude that ADMA accumulation occurs via increased synthesis by PRMTs and decreased degradation. However, we now report that the methyltransferase activity of PRMT1, the major PRMT isoform in humans, is impaired under oxidative conditions. Oxidized PRMT1 displays decreased activity, which can be rescued by reduction. This oxidation event involves one or more cysteine residues that become oxidized to sulfenic acid (-SOH). We demonstrate a hydrogen peroxide concentration-dependent inhibition of PRMT1 activity that is readily reversed under physiological H2O2 concentrations. Our results challenge the unilateral view that increased PRMT1 expression necessarily results in increased ADMA synthesis and demonstrate that enzymatic activity can be regulated in a redox-sensitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W2254832624,"Reversible lysine acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification controlling the activity of proteins in different subcellular compartments. We previously demonstrated that a class II histone deacetylase (HDAC), HDAC4, and a histone acetyltransferase, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor, associate with cardiac sarcomeres and that a class I and II HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, enhances contractile activity of myofilaments. In this study we show that a class I HDAC, HDAC3, is also present at cardiac sarcomeres. By immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses, we found that HDAC3 was localized to A-band of sarcomeres and capable of deacetylating myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. The motor domains of both cardiac α- and β-MHC isoforms were found to be reversibly acetylated. Biomechanical studies revealed that lysine acetylation significantly decreased the Km for the actin-activated ATPase activity of MHC isoforms. By in vitro motility assay, we found that lysine acetylation increased the actin-sliding velocity of α-myosin by 20% and β-myosin by 36% compared with their respective non-acetylated isoforms. Moreover, myosin acetylation was found to be sensitive to cardiac stress. During induction of hypertrophy, myosin isoform acetylation increased progressively with duration of stress stimuli independently of isoform shift, suggesting that lysine acetylation of myosin could be an early response of myofilaments to increase contractile performance of the heart. These studies provide the first evidence for localization of HDAC3 at myofilaments and uncover a novel mechanism modulating the motor activity of cardiac MHC isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2085289756,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesised in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) of supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. In response to the hyperosmotic stressors of dehydration (complete fluid deprivation, DH) or salt loading (drinking 2% salt solution, SL), AVP synthesis increases in MCNs, which over-burdens the protein folding machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are signaling pathways that improve ER function in response to the accumulation of misfold/unfold protein. We asked whether an ER stress response was activated in the SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. We observed increased mRNA expression for the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4), C/EBP-homologous protein (Chop), and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 1 (Creb3l1) in both SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. Although we found no changes in the splicing pattern of X box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1), an increase in the level of the unspliced form of Xbp1 (Xbp1U) was observed in DH and SL rats. CREB3L1, a novel ER stress inducer, has been shown to be activated by ER stress to regulate the expression of target genes. We have previously shown that CREB3L1 is a transcriptional regulator of the AVP gene; however, a role for CREB3L1 in the response to ER stress has yet to be investigated in MCNs. Here, we used lentiviral vectors to introduce a dominant negative form of CREB3L1 (CREB3L1DN) in the rat SON. Expression of CREB3L1DN in the SON decreased Chop and Xbp1U mRNA levels, but not BiP and Atf4 transcript expression. CREB3L1 is thus implicated as a transcriptional mediator of the ER stress response in the osmotically stimulated SON."
https://openalex.org/W2127442400,"Elevated levels of serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) contribute to insulin resistance and correlate with increased prevalence of hypertension and myocardial infarction. We sought to determine whether lowering RBP4 would improve blood pressure (BP) and protect against obesity- or angiotensin (Ang)-II-induced hypertension. Systolic and diastolic BP were lower in the RBP4-knockout (RBP4-KO) mice and higher in the RBP4-overexpressing (RBP4-Tg) mice compared with BP in the wild-type (WT) littermates. Carbachol-induced vasodilatation was increased in arteries from the RBP4-KO compared with the WT mice and was impaired in the RBP4-Tg mice. Aortic eNOS(Ser1177) phosphorylation was enhanced ∼50% in the RBP4-KO mice, with no change in total eNOS protein. Feeding a high-fat diet increased BP in the RBP4-KO mice only to the level in the WT mice fed chow and had no effect on aortic eNOS(Ser1177) phosphorylation. Ang-II infusion resulted in 22 mmHg lower systolic BP in the RBP4-KO than in the WT mice, although the relative BP increase over saline infusion was ∼30% in both. Ang-II treatment decreased aortic eNOS(Ser1177) phosphorylation in the WT and RBP4-KO mice, but phosphorylation remained higher in the RBP4-KO mice. Cardiac hypertrophy with Ang-II treatment was diminished by 56% in the RBP4-KO mice. Thus, elevated serum RBP4 raises BP and lack of RBP4 reduces it, with commensurate changes in aortic eNOS(Ser1177) phosphorylation. Lowering RBP4 may reduce BP through enhanced eNOS-mediated vasodilatation and may be a novel therapeutic approach for hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1986964976,"Memory retrieval in primates is orchestrated by a brain-wide neuronal circuit. To elucidate the operation of this circuit, it is imperative to comprehend neuronal mechanisms of coordination between area-to-area interaction and information processing within individual areas. By simultaneous recording from area 36 (A36) and area TE (TE) of the temporal cortex while monkeys performed a pair-association memory task, we found two distinct inter-area signal flows during memory retrieval: A36 spiking activity exhibited coherence with low-frequency field activity in either the supragranular or infragranular layer of TE. Of these two flows, only signal flow targeting the infragranular layer of TE was further translaminarly coupled with gamma activity in the supragranular layer of TE. Moreover, this coupling was observed when monkeys succeeded in the retrieval of the sought object but not when they failed. The results suggest that local translaminar processing can be recruited via a layer-specific inter-area network for memory retrieval."

Thirty age and sex matched healthy subjects served as the controls. Serum concentrations of OCM nutrients and peripheral blood DNA methylation status were measured.Compared to the control group, the VPA group had higher serum levels of homocysteine (p<0.05). No difference in homocysteine concentration was observed in the LTG group. Patients receiving VPA or LTG had significantly lower serum folate levels in comparison with controls (p<0.001). The level of methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) in peripheral blood was not significantly different between the AED monotherapy group and healthy controls. A difference in the methylation levels of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) amplicon was observed between AED-treated patients with epilepsy and controls (p<0.01).

Using AM, we developed a novel method for cultivating oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets. We investigated the autologous transplantation of oral mucosal epithelial cells cultured on AM in patients undergoing oral surgeries. We obtained specimens of AM from women undergoing cesarean sections. This study included five patients without any history of a medical disorder who underwent autologous cultured oral epithelial transplantation following oral surgical procedures. Using oral mucosal biopsy specimens obtained from these patients, we cultured oral epithelial cells on an AM carrier. We transplanted the resultant cell sheets onto the oral mucosal defects. Patients were followed-up for at least 12 months after transplantation. After 2-3 weeks of being cultured on AM, epithelial cells were well differentiated and had stratified into five to seven layers. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the cultured cells expressed highly specific mucosal epithelial cell markers and basement membrane proteins. After the surgical procedures, no infection, bleeding, rejection, or sheet detachment occurred at the reconstructed sites, at which new oral mucous membranes were evident. No recurrence was observed in the long-term follow-up, and the postoperative course was excellent. Our results suggest that AM-cultured oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets represent a useful biomaterial and feasible method for oral mucosal reconstruction. However, our primary clinical study only evaluated their effects on a limited number of small oral mucosal defects."

Here, we show that tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an integral role to induce KLF17 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). p53 is recruited to the KLF17 promoter and results in the formation of p53-DNA complex. p53 enhances binding of p300 and favors histone acetylation on the KLF17 promoter.

We show that p53 empowers tumor-suppressive KLF17 signaling during cancer metastasis. KLF17 suppresses EMT and metastasis in a p53-dependent manner in NSCLC. Mechanistically, p53 forms a complex with KLF17 and hence potentiates KL17-mediated EMT gene transcription and the tumor-suppressive function of KLF17. Intriguingly, chemotherapeutic agents that activate p53 show recruitment of KLF17 to EMT target gene promoters via a p53-dependent pathway. Moreover, our results show that novel cross-talk and a positive feedback loop exist between p53 and KLF17 in NSCLC and play an important role in the inhibition of cancer metastasis. Functionally, KLF17 required p53 to suppress cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results describe novel molecular and functional insights into the anti-EMT effect of KLF17 via a p53-dependent pathway in NSCLC. KLF17 may be a new therapeutic target with p53 status in NSCLC, which may improve treatment and prognosis of NSCLC patients. pcDNA3.1-p53 plasmid was described in our previous study (33Ali A. Wang Z.

H1299 and A549 lung cancer cell lines were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used in Western blot and ChIP experiments: anti-p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-KLF17 (Abcam), anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-P300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-AcH4 (Millipore). H1299 and A549 cells were described previously in our study (33Ali A. Wang Z. Fu J. Ji L. Liu J. Li L. Wang H. Chen J. Caulin C. Myers J.N. Zhang P. Xiao J. Zhang B. Li X. Differential regulation of the REGγ-proteasome pathway by p53/TGF-β signalling and mutant p53 in cancer cells.Nat. Commun. 2013; 42667Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For cell treatments, we used Nutlin-3 (10 μm) (Sigma- Aldrich), Adriamycin (0.5 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich), and etoposide (10 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich). EMSA was performed with 32P-radiolabeled probes. 2 μg of nuclear extract or different concentrations of purified proteins were incubated with 32P-radiolabeled probes in 20 μl of EMSA reaction buffer (2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 12% glycerol). To perform the competition assay, an excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the EMSA reaction mixture. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE and exposed to a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). ChIP was performed as described previously (33Ali A. Wang Z. Fu J. Ji L. Liu J. Li L. Wang H. Chen J. Caulin C. Myers J.N. Zhang P. Xiao J. Zhang B. Li X. Differential regulation of the REGγ-proteasome pathway by p53/TGF-β signalling and mutant p53 in cancer cells.Nat. Commun. 2013; 42667Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of the genomic fragments was performed with specific primers flanking putative binding sites on the KLF17 promoter. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2.0% agarose. DNA fragments containing KLF17 genomic sequences were amplified from 293T cell genomic DNA using PCR and primers derived from human genomic KLF17 and ligated into KpnI/XhoI sites of the promoterless pGL3-Basic (Promega) vector to make this construct, pGL3-KLF17-luc. Different deletion constructs of the KLF17 promoter were generated from the 2-kb KLF17 promoter and ligated into KpnI/XhoI sites of pGL3-Basic vector. After transfection and/or treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times. The cells were then lysed in the luciferase cell culture lysis buffer provided with the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). After a brief vortex, whole cell lysates were centrifuged in the cold (4 °C) at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatant was collected in a fresh tube, and 20–30 ml of that was added to luciferase assay substrate (60–80 ml). Luminescence was measured as relative light units, twice for each lysate, taking the reading of the luciferase assay using a LUMIstar OPTIMA (BMG LABTECH). Each assay was repeated three times. -Fold repression values are represented as means of the three experiments. Cells were cultured to 30% confluence. For each well in a 6-well culture dish, 20 nm KLF17/p53 siRNAs or appropriate negative control siRNAs was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, and 6–8 h later, 10% serum growth medium was added to the transfection mixture. Cell extracts were assayed by Western blot for KLF17/p53 protein expression at 72 h post-transfection and for mRNA expression at 48 h after transfection. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (33Ali A. Wang Z. Fu J. Ji L. Liu J. Li L. Wang H. Chen J. Caulin C. Myers J.N. Zhang P. Xiao J. Zhang B. Li X. Differential regulation of the REGγ-proteasome pathway by p53/TGF-β signalling and mutant p53 in cancer cells.Nat. Commun. 2013; 42667Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in duplicates and repeated three times. Cells were washed with PBS and treated with an extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin/pepstatin). Cell extract was stored at −20 °C until required. Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and the blot was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (0.1% PBST with 5% fat-free dried milk powder). The blot was then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The blot was washed with 0.1% TBST three times and incubated with secondary antibodies (mouse and rabbit) (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h. The blot was washed again three times and exposed to an Odyssey LI-COR scanner. Cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay in replicates. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 2.5 × 103 cells/well and incubated in 10% FBS supplemented with DMEM for 24 h. After that, cells were treated with Nutlin-3/Adriamycin for the indicated times. Controls received DMSO vehicle at a concentration equal to that in drug-treated cells. After that, drug-containing medium was replaced with 200 μl of 10% FBS supplemented with DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT; cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h; and absorbance (490 nm) was measured and analyzed. Cell culture inserts with a pore size of 8 μm were precoated by adding 10 μg/ml collagen I in PBS to the upper chamber at room temperature for 2 h. At the onset of each experiment, the cells were detached with Versene solution and resuspended as single cells in serum-free DMEM. For the migration experiments, we took 25,000 cells in 0.5 ml and diluted them in serum-low DMEM (supplemented with 2% FBS). Cells were added to the upper chamber, and the lower chamber was filled with 0.70 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The experiment was terminated by discarding the medium and fixing the cells in the filter with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Non-invading cells on the upper side of the insert were removed by a cotton-tipped applicator. Staining of the cells on the bottom of the membrane was performed with DAPI (300 nm in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Membranes were excised from the inserts and mounted on slides using Dako fluorescent mounting medium. Cells were counted either manually or with the help of the ImageJ software. Cell invasion experiments were performed in BD MatrigelTM invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) with a membrane pore diameter of 8 μm. For the invasion experiments, we used 50,000 cells/well suspended in 0.5 ml of serum-low DMEM (supplemented with 2% FBS). The rest of the protocol was identical to that described for the migration assay. KLF17 negatively regulates metastasis (4Gumireddy K. Li A. Gimotty P.A. Klein-Szanto A.J. Showe L.C. Katsaros D.

However, the affect of p53 on KLF17 transcription remains unknown during cancer progression. Therefore, we investigated the role of p53 on KLF17 regulation in A549 cells. A549 cell lines express tumor-suppressive p53 (TP53) (34Mirza A. McGuirk M. Hockenberry T.N. Wu Q. Ashar H. Black S. Wen S.F. Wang L. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Nielsen L.L. Pickett C.B.

Health Perspect. 2003; 111: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We depleted p53 expression in A549 cells using specific siRNA targeting p53. We found that KLF17 mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to Nutlin-3 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, we did not observed any induction in KLF17 transcript levels in p53-depleted cells treated with Nutlin-3 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that p53 is important for KLF17 induction. Nutlin-3 activates/stabilizes p53 by blocking the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 (36Arva N.C. Talbott K.E. Okoro D.R. Brekman A. Qiu W.G. Bargonetti J.

Pharmacological activation of the p53 pathway by Nutlin-3 exerts anti-tumoral effects in medulloblastomas.Neuro Oncol. 2012; 14: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, silencing of p53 by siRNA resulted in decreased expression of KLF17 in lung cancer cells (Fig. 1, B–D). We treated A549 cells with different p53-activating chemotherapeutic agents and observed that these drugs were able to induce KLF17 expression (Fig. 1E). To further verify our results, we performed protein analysis of KLF17 in response to Nutlin-3. We found that the KLF17 protein level enhanced in Nutlin-3-treated cell lines (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our data suggest that p53 enhances KLF17 mRNA and protein levels in lung cancer cells. Next, we aimed to analyze the transcriptional regulation of KLF17 by p53. In a dose-dependent manner, p53 was able to induce transcriptional activity of the KLF17-luc reporter in H1299 (p53-null) lung cancer cells (Fig. 1G). Next, we generated different deletion constructs of KLF17-luc to find the minimal responsive region required for KLF17 activation by p53 (Fig. 1H). Luciferase analysis indicated that the region between −2000 and −498 is responsive to p53 (Fig. 1I), whereas the region from −498 to +1 was unable to enhance the KLF17 transcription (Fig. 1I), suggesting that the p53-responsive region lies between −1015 and −498. Using the NCBI database, we found the p53 consensus-responsive element (p53RE) within the KLF17 promoter (Fig. 1I). Mutation analysis of this p53RE indicated that p53 was unable to activate the KLF17 transcription from this mutated region (Fig. 1J). These data indicate that p53RE is critical for KLF17 regulation by p53 in lung cancer cells. To gain insight into the molecular details of KLF17 regulation by p53, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in A549 cells. ChIP analysis indicated that Nutlin-3-treated cells showed recruitment of p53 to the KLF17 promoter, which contains bona fide p53RE. In contrast, no recruitment of p53 was observed within the upstream region of the KLF17 promoter (Fig. 2, A and B). We obtained similar results using Adriamycin, an anti-cancer drug (Fig. 2C).

https://openalex.org/W2065570489,"Abnormalities of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signalling as well as the down-regulation of neurotrophic factors in several areas of the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues are hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD). As there is no therapy for this hereditary, neurodegenerative fatal disease, further effort should be made to slow the progression of neurodegeneration in patients through the definition of early therapeutic interventions. For this purpose, molecular biomarker(s) for monitoring disease onset and/or progression and response to treatment need to be identified. In the attempt to contribute to the research of peripheral candidate biomarkers in HD, we adopted a multiplex real-time PCR approach to analyse the mRNA level of targeted genes involved in the control of cellular calcium homeostasis and in neuroprotection. For this purpose we recruited a total of 110 subjects possessing the HD mutation at different clinical stages of the disease and 54 sex- and age-matched controls. This study provides evidence of reduced transcript levels of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum-associated ATP2A2 calcium pump (SERCA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of manifest and pre-manifest HD subjects. Our results provide a potentially new candidate molecular biomarker for monitoring the progression of this disease and contribute to understanding some early events that might have a role in triggering cellular dysfunctions in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2014186920,"We analyze the patent filing strategies of foreign pharmaceutical companies in Chile distinguishing between ""primary"" (active ingredient) and ""secondary"" patents (patents on modified compounds, formulations, dosages, particular medical uses, etc.). There is prior evidence that secondary patents are used by pharmaceutical originator companies in the U.S. and Europe to extend patent protection on drugs in length and breadth. Using a novel dataset that comprises all drugs registered in Chile between 1991 and 2010 as well as the corresponding patents and trademarks, we find evidence that foreign originator companies pursue similar strategies in Chile. We find a primary to secondary patents ratio of 1:4 at the drug-level, which is comparable to the available evidence for Europe; most secondary patents are filed over several years following the original primary patent and after the protected active ingredient has obtained market approval in Chile. This points toward effective patent term extensions through secondary patents. Secondary patents dominate ""older"" therapeutic classes like anti-ulcer and anti-depressants. In contrast, newer areas like anti-virals and anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer) have a much larger share of primary patents."
https://openalex.org/W2015700148,"Continental copepods have been derived from several independent invasive events from the sea, but the subsequent evolutionary processes that account for the current diversity in lacustrine environments are virtually unknown. Salinity is highly variable among lakes and constitutes a source of divergent selection driving potential reproductive isolation. We studied four populations of the calanoid copepod Leptodiaptomus cf. sicilis inhabiting four neighboring lakes with a common history (since the Late Pleistocene) located in the Oriental Basin, Mexico; one lake is shallow and varies in salinity periodically (1.4-10 g L(-1)), while three are deep and permanent, with constant salinity (0.5, 1.1 and 6.5 g L(-1), respectively). We hypothesized that (1) these populations belong to a different species than L. sicilis sensu stricto and (2) are experiencing ecologically based divergence due to salinity differences. We assessed morphological and molecular (mtDNA) COI variation, as well as fitness differences and tests of reproductive isolation. Although relationships of the Mexican populations with L. sicilis s.s. could not be elucidated, we identified a clear pattern of divergent selection driven by salinity conditions. The four populations can still be considered a single biological species (sexual recognition and hybridization are still possible in laboratory conditions), but they have diverged into at least three different phenotypes: two locally adapted, specialized in the lakes of constant salinity (saline vs. freshwater), and an intermediate generalist phenotype inhabiting the temporary lake with fluctuating salinity. The specialized phenotypes are poorly suited as migrants, so prezygotic isolation due to immigrant inviability is highly probable. This implication was supported by molecular evidence that showed restricted gene flow, persistence of founder events, and a pattern of allopatric fragmentation. This study showed how ecologically based divergent selection may explain diversification patterns in lacustrine copepods."
https://openalex.org/W2030202231,"Monocyclic phenols and catechols are important antioxidant compounds for the food and pharmaceutic industries; their production through biotransformation of low-added value starting compounds is of major biotechnological interest. The toluene o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) from Pseudomonas sp. OX1 is a bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase (BMM) that is able to hydroxylate a wide array of aromatic compounds and has already proven to be a versatile biochemical tool to produce mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives of aromatic compounds. The molecular determinants of its regioselectivity and substrate specificity have been thoroughly investigated, and a computational strategy has been developed which allows designing mutants able to hydroxylate non-natural substrates of this enzyme to obtain high-added value compounds of commercial interest. In this work, we have investigated the use of recombinant ToMO, expressed in cells of Escherichia coli strain JM109, for the biotransformation of non-natural substrates of this enzyme such as 2-phenoxyethanol, phthalan and 2-indanol to produce six hydroxylated derivatives. The hydroxylated products obtained were identified, isolated and their antioxidant potential was assessed both in vitro, using the DPPH assay, and on the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2. Incubation of H9c2 cells with the hydroxylated compounds obtained from ToMO-catalyzed biotransformation induced a differential protective effect towards a mild oxidative stress induced by the presence of sodium arsenite. The results obtained confirm once again the versatility of the ToMO system for oxyfunctionalization reactions of biotechnological importance. Moreover, the hydroxylated derivatives obtained possess an interesting antioxidant potential that encourages the use of the enzyme for further functionalization reactions and their possible use as scaffolds to design novel bioactive molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2086316352,"De novo formation of blood vessels is a pivotal mechanism during cancer development. During the past few years, antiangiogenic drugs have been developed to target tumor vasculature. However, because of limitations and adverse effects observed with current therapies, there is a strong need for alternative antiangiogenic strategies. Using specific anti-junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-B antibodies and Jam-b-deficient mice, we studied the role in antiangiogenesis of JAM-B. We found that antibodies against murine JAM-B, an endothelium-specific adhesion molecule, inhibited microvessel outgrowth from ex vivo aortic rings and in vitro endothelial network formation. In addition, anti-JAM-B antibodies blocked VEGF signaling, an essential pathway for angiogenesis. Moreover, increased aortic ring branching was observed in aortas isolated from Jam-b-deficient animals, suggesting that JAM-B negatively regulates proangiogenic pathways. In mice, JAM-B expression was detected in de novo-formed blood vessels of tumors, but anti-JAM-B antibodies unexpectedly did not reduce tumor growth. Accordingly, JAM-B deficiency in vivo had no impact on blood vessel formation, suggesting that targeting JAM-B in vivo may be offset by other proangiogenic mechanisms. In conclusion, despite the promising effects observed in vitro, targeting JAM-B during tumor progression seems to be inefficient as a stand-alone antiangiogenesis therapy."

Although a variety of software exists suited for the visualization of meteorological data, none of them fulfills all of the typical domain-specific requirements: support for quasi-standard data formats and different grid types, standard visualization techniques for scalar and vector data, visualization of the context (e.g., topography) and other static data, support for multiple presentation devices used in modern sciences (e.g., virtual reality), a user-friendly interface, and suitability for cooperative work.Instead of attempting to develop yet another new visualization system to fulfill all possible needs in this application domain, our approach is to provide a flexible workflow that combines different existing state-of-the-art visualization software components in order to hide the complexity of 3D data visualization tools from the end user. To complete the workflow and to enable the domain scientists to interactively visualize their data without advanced skills in 3D visualization systems, we developed a lightweight custom visualization application (MEVA - multifaceted environmental data visualization application) that supports the most relevant visualization and interaction techniques and can be easily deployed. Specifically, our workflow combines a variety of different data abstraction methods provided by a state-of-the-art 3D visualization application with the interaction and presentation features of a computer-games engine. Our customized application includes solutions for the analysis of multirun data, specifically with respect to data uncertainty and differences between simulation runs. In an iterative development process, our easy-to-use application was developed in close cooperation with meteorologists and visualization experts. The usability of the application has been validated with user tests. We report on how this application supports the users to prove and disprove existing hypotheses and discover new insights. In addition, the application has been used at public events to communicate research results."
https://openalex.org/W2095059143,"Airways infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is contained mostly by T cell responses, however, Mtb has developed evasion mechanisms which affect antigen presenting cell (APC) maturation/recruitment delaying the onset of Ag-specific T cell responses. Hypothetically, bypassing the natural infection routes by delivering antigens directly to APCs may overcome the pathogen’s naturally evolved evasion mechanisms, thus facilitating the induction of protective immune responses. We generated a murine monoclonal fusion antibody (α-DEC-ESAT) to deliver Early Secretory Antigen Target (ESAT)-6 directly to DEC205+ APCs and to assess its in vivo effects on protection associated responses (IFN-γ production, in vivo CTL killing, and pulmonary mycobacterial load). Treatment with α-DEC-ESAT alone induced ESAT-6-specific IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells and prime-boost immunization prior to Mtb infection resulted in early influx (d14 post-infection) and increased IFN-γ+ production by specific T cells in the lungs, compared to scarce IFN-γ production in control mice. In vivo CTL killing was quantified in relevant tissues upon transferring target cells loaded with mycobacterial antigens. During infection, α-DEC-ESAT-treated mice showed increased target cell killing in the lungs, where histology revealed cellular infiltrate and considerably reduced bacterial burden. Targeting the mycobacterial antigen ESAT-6 to DEC205+ APCs before infection expands specific T cell clones responsible for early T cell responses (IFN-γ production and CTL activity) and substantially reduces lung bacterial burden. Delivering mycobacterial antigens directly to APCs provides a unique approach to study in vivo the role of APCs and specific T cell responses to assess their potential anti-mycobacterial functions."
https://openalex.org/W1964267129,"Drug delivery systems based on polymeric microparticles represent an interesting field of development for the treatment of several infectious diseases for humans and animals. In this work, we developed PLGA microparticles loaded with ceftiofur (PLGA-cef), a third- generation cephalosporin that is used exclusively used in animals. PLGA-cef was prepared by the double emulsion w/o/w method, and exhibited a diameter in the range of 1.5-2.2 μm, and a negative ζ potential in the range of -35 to -55 mV. The loading yield of PLGA-cef was ~7% and encapsulation efficiency was approximately 40%. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated a sustained release profile of ceftiofur for 20 days. PLGA-cef administrated in a single dose was more effective than ceftiofur non-encapsulated in rats challenged with S. Typhimurium. The in vivo toxicological evaluation showed that PLGA-cef did not affect the blood biochemical, hematological and hemostasis parameters. Overall, the PLGA-cef showed slow in vivo release profile, high antibacterial efficacy, and low toxicity. The results obtained supports the safe application of PLGA-cef as sustained release platform in the veterinary industry."
https://openalex.org/W2062031481,"To more scientifically and reasonably control the quality of Huangqi Granules, preliminary studies on the pharmacodynamics and serum pharmacochemistry of this medicine were performed. DPPH and MTT experiments showed that water extracts of Huangqi Granules had good antioxidant activity and increased immunity. Timed blood samples collected 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after oral administration of a set amount of Huangqi Granules were collected and tested using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. As a result, calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, ononin, calycosin, astragaloside IV, and formononetin were found to exist in rat blood after dosing, indicating that the five chemical compounds might have pharmacological activity, and based on this result, they were designated biomarkers for quality control of Huangqi Granules. Consequently, a simple, rapid and efficient method was developed in the present study for the simultaneous determination of the five characteristic compounds in Huangqi Granules using HPLC-DAD-ELSD.The separation was performed using an Agilent Hypersil ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at 30 ℃. The mobile phase was composed of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The drift tube temperature of the ELSD system was set to 85 ℃, and the nitrogen pressure was 3.5 bar.All five characteristic compounds had good linear behavior with r2 values greater than 0.9972. The recoveries varied from 96.31% to 101.22%. Subsequently, the developed method was applied to evaluate the quality of Huangqi Granules from different batches, and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was used to analyze the classification of the samples based on the values of the five compounds.The established HPLC method combined with HCA proved to be effective to evaluate the quality of Huangqi Granules."
https://openalex.org/W2018494697,"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl esters from high density lipoprotein to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. CETP expression can be transcriptionally activated by liver X receptor (LXR). Etoposide and teniposide are DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors. Etoposide has been reported to inhibit atherosclerosis in rabbits with un-fully elucidated mechanisms. In this study we determined if Topo II activity can influence cholesterol metabolism by regulating hepatic CETP expression. Inhibition of Topo II by etoposide, teniposide, or Topo II siRNA increased CETP expression in human hepatic cell line, HepG2 cells, which was associated with increased CETP secretion and mRNA expression. Meanwhile, inhibition of LXR expression by LXR siRNA attenuated induction of CETP expression by etoposide and teniposide. Etoposide and teniposide induced LXRα expression and LXRα/β nuclear translocation while inhibiting expression of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140), an LXR co-repressor. In vivo, administration of teniposide moderately reduced serum lipid profiles, induced CETP expression in the liver, and activated reverse cholesterol transport in CETP transgenic mice. Our study demonstrates a novel function of Topo II inhibitors in cholesterol metabolism by activating hepatic CETP expression and reverse cholesterol transport. Background: CETP expression mediates cholesterol metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. Results: Inhibition of Topo II activates CETP expression in HepG2 cells and CETP transgenic mouse liver, which was associated with increased reverse cholesterol transport in vivo. Conclusion: Topo II inhibitors induced CETP expression and RCT by activating LXR pathway. Significance: We found an important function of Topo II inhibition in regulating cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2312424574,"Hodgkin's lymphoma is an example for a tumor with an extremely tight interaction of tumor cells with cells from the tumor micro-environment. These so-called bystander cells are not inert but interact actively with the tumor cells. Some of these cells support tumor growth by delivery of co-stimulating and anti-apoptotic signals (""helper cells""). Other cells (""killer cells"") are involved in the anti-tumor immune response which is obviously not efficient enough for tumor elimination. The activity of both helper cells and killer cells is regulated by additional cells in the stroma (""regulatory cells""). The dynamic behavior of such multi-component systems is difficult to predict. In the present paper we propose a model that can be used for simulation of essential features of this system. In this model, tumor growth depends on (i) presence of few cancer stem cells, (ii) co-stimulation of cancer cells by the tumor stroma, (iii) activity of regulatory cells that suppress killer cells without suppression of helper cells. The success of cytotoxic/cytostatic therapy in this model varies depending on the therapy-related toxicity for each of the cell populations. The model also allows the analysis of immunotherapeutic interventions. Under certain conditions, paradox enhancement of tumor growth can occur after therapeutic intervention. The model might be useful for the design of new treatment strategies for Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors with prominent tumor-stroma interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2166941701,"Probabilistic association discovery aims at identifying the association between random vectors, regardless of number of variables involved or linear/nonlinear functional forms. Recently, applications in high-dimensional data have generated rising interest in probabilistic association discovery. We developed a framework based on functions on the observation graph, named MeDiA (Mean Distance Association). We generalize its property to a group of functions on the observation graph. The group of functions encapsulates major existing methods in association discovery, e.g. mutual information and Brownian Covariance, and can be expanded to more complicated forms. We conducted numerical comparison of the statistical power of related methods under multiple scenarios. We further demonstrated the application of MeDiA as a method of gene set analysis that captures a broader range of responses than traditional gene set analysis methods."
