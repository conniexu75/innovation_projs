https://openalex.org/W1994664175,"Breast cancer exhibits familial aggregation, consistent with variation in genetic susceptibility to the disease. Known susceptibility genes account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks. To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies. We used 227,876 SNPs that were estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r2 > 0.5. SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and consistent evidence of association with breast cancer (P < 10-7). Four of these contain plausible causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1). At the second stage, 1,792 SNPs were significant at the P < 0.05 level compared with an estimated 1,343 that would be expected by chance, indicating that many additional common susceptibility alleles may be identifiable by this approach. Until the genome-wide association study on page 1087 was published online, known susceptibility genes — such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 — accounted for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer. The new study, which involved 21,860 patients and 22,578 controls, has identified four genes positively associated with genetic susceptibility to breast cancer (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1). Most previously identified breast cancer susceptibility genes are involved in DNA repair, but the newly discovered associations appear to relate more to the control of cell growth or to cell signalling. Only one of the genes — FGFR2 — had a clear prior relevance to breast cancer. The identification of these genes opens up new avenues of research into the causes of breast cancer. They may also become part of a new strategy to classify women's risk, paving the way for better disease prevention. Previous work has identified several genes where mutations lead to breast cancer, but other genetic and environmental factors must still be accounted for. A large study of genetic association with breast cancer points to four novel genes and many more genetic markers that should be pursued for their link to cancer susceptibility."

https://openalex.org/W2006423274,"We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer by genotyping 528,173 SNPs in 1,145 postmenopausal women of European ancestry with invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls. We identified four SNPs in intron 2 of FGFR2 (which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and is amplified or overexpressed in some breast cancers) that were highly associated with breast cancer and confirmed this association in 1,776 affected individuals and 2,072 controls from three additional studies. Across the four studies, the association with all four SNPs was highly statistically significant (P(trend) for the most strongly associated SNP (rs1219648) = 1.1 x 10(-10); population attributable risk = 16%). Four SNPs at other loci most strongly associated with breast cancer in the initial GWAS were not associated in the replication studies. Our summary results from the GWAS are available online in a form that should speed the identification of additional risk loci."

https://openalex.org/W2114857255,"Naturally occurring variation in gene copy number is increasingly recognized as a heritable source of susceptibility to genetically complex diseases. Here we report strong association between FCGR3B copy number and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (P = 2.7 x 10(-8)), microscopic polyangiitis (P = 2.9 x 10(-4)) and Wegener's granulomatosis in two independent cohorts from the UK (P = 3 x 10(-3)) and France (P = 1.1 x 10(-4)). We did not observe this association in the organ-specific Graves' disease or Addison's disease. Our findings suggest that low FCGR3B copy number, and in particular complete FCGR3B deficiency, has a key role in the development of systemic autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1988036748,"The metabolism of vitamin A and the diverse effects of its metabolites are tightly controlled by distinct retinoid-generating enzymes, retinoid-binding proteins and retinoid-activated nuclear receptors. Retinoic acid regulates differentiation and metabolism by activating the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor (RXR), indirectly influencing RXR heterodimeric partners. Retinoic acid is formed solely from retinaldehyde (Rald), which in turn is derived from vitamin A. Rald currently has no defined biologic role outside the eye. Here we show that Rald is present in rodent fat, binds retinol-binding proteins (CRBP1, RBP4), inhibits adipogenesis and suppresses peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and RXR responses. In vivo, mice lacking the Rald-catabolizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Raldh1) resisted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and showed increased energy dissipation. In ob/ob mice, administrating Rald or a Raldh inhibitor reduced fat and increased insulin sensitivity. These results identify Rald as a distinct transcriptional regulator of the metabolic responses to a high-fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W1976094170,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major contributing factor to hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Dgat), of which there are two isoforms (Dgat1 and Dgat2), catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis. We evaluated the metabolic impact of pharmacological reduction of DGAT1 and -2 expression in liver and fat using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in rats with diet-induced NAFLD. Dgat1 and Dgat2 ASO treatment selectively reduced DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA levels in liver and fat, but only Dgat2 ASO treatment significantly reduced hepatic lipids (diacylglycerol and triglyceride but not long chain acyl CoAs) and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. Because Dgat catalyzes triglyceride synthesis from diacylglycerol, and because we have hypothesized that diacylglycerol accumulation triggers fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance through protein kinase Cɛ activation, we next sought to understand the paradoxical reduction in diacylglycerol in Dgat2 ASO-treated rats. Within 3 days of starting Dgat2 ASO therapy in high fat-fed rats, plasma fatty acids increased, whereas hepatic lysophosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol levels were similar to those of control rats. These changes were associated with reduced expression of lipogenic genes (SREBP1c, ACC1, SCD1, and mtGPAT) and increased expression of oxidative/thermogenic genes (CPT1 and UCP2). Taken together, these data suggest that knocking down Dgat2 protects against fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance by paradoxically lowering hepatic diacylglycerol content and protein kinase Cɛ activation through decreased SREBP1c-mediated lipogenesis and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation.

Accumulating evidence suggests that hepatic lipid accumulation causes hepatic insulin resistance. For example, increasing hepatic lipid stores in mice by overexpressing lipoprotein lipase in the liver (5Kim J.K. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Yu C. Moore I.K. Pypaert M. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Velez-Carrasco W.

We have also shown that moderate weight loss in patients with T2DM lowers liver triglycerides and specifically improves hepatic insulin sensitivity (10Petersen K.F. Dufour S. Befroy D. Lehrke M. Hendler R.E. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Although the above data strongly suggest that hepatic lipid accumulation causes hepatic insulin resistance, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain uncertain. We have proposed a model in which excess diacylglycerol (DAG) activates protein kinase Cɛ (PKCɛ), a serine/threonine kinase that in turn binds to the insulin receptor and inhibits its tyrosine kinase activity (11Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Wang A. Beddow S.A. Geisler J.G. Kahn M. Zhang X.M. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 737-745Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Until very recently, long chain acyl-coenzymes A (LCCoAs) were a favored candidate for fat-induced insulin resistance, but recent studies in mitochondrial acyl-coenzyme A (CoA):glycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase (mtGPAT) knock-out mice, which accumulate LCCoAs in the liver but have reduced liver DAG content and are protected from fat-induced hepatic insulin resistance (12Neschen S.

DAG is also a potent activator of novel PKCs (13Considine R.V. Nyce M.R. Allen L.E. Morales L.M. Triester S. Serrano J. Colberg J. Lanza-Jacoby S. Caro J.F. J. Clin.

Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Dgat) catalyzes the final step in TG synthesis by facilitating the linkage of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) with an LCCoA. Dgat exists in two primary isoforms: Dgat1 and Dgat2 (16Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc.

There is some evidence suggesting that the two enzymes play different roles in TG metabolism. DGAT1 knock-out mice have ∼50% less TG in tissues and are protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through a mechanism involving increased energy expenditure (at least partly attributable to increased physical activity) (18Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Ladha Z. Jensen D.R. Ferreira L.D. Pulawa L.K. McGuire J.G. Pitas R.E. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin.

Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Study of Dgat2 has been more difficult as homozygous DGAT2 knock-out mice die shortly after birth because of severe lipopenia (∼90% TG reduction in DGAT2 null carcasses) and impaired skin barrier function (20Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11767-11776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Here we sought to address two key questions. First, what effect does DGAT1 or DGAT2 knockdown in liver and fat have on hepatic insulin action? Other than the mtGPAT knock-out model, previous successful therapeutic strategies for NAFLD have primarily focused on increasing fat oxidation as opposed to inhibiting fat synthesis. In this study, we were therefore interested in examining the effect of inhibiting another key regulator of fat synthesis. Second, which lipid intermediates are increased or decreased by DGAT knockdown? Conventional wisdom suggests that DAG, a substrate for the enzyme activity of Dgat, might accumulate in the face of Dgat knockdown, an event which we have suggested induces insulin resistance (21Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Med. 2006; 119 (-S16): S10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 22Reznick R.M. Shulman G.I. J. Physiol.

The present study demonstrates that Dgat2, but not Dgat1 ASO treatment, improves hepatic steatosis, insulin sensitivity, and somewhat surprisingly reduces hepatic DAG content. In addition, we provide evidence suggesting a potential mechanism to explain this paradoxical effect of DGAT2 inhibition on hepatic DAG content. Animals—All rats were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University School of Medicine. Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼200 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and acclimated for 1 week after arrival before initiation of the experiment. Rats received food and water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 a.m.). They were housed individually, and food consumption and body weight were monitored. Rats received either regular rodent chow (60% carbohydrate, 10% fat, 30% protein calories) or a high fat diet (26% carbohydrate, 59% fat, 15% protein calories). Safflower oil was the major constituent of the high fat diet (Dyets Inc.). We have shown previously that this diet produces hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance within 3 days (6Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Qu X. Elder B.D. Bilz S. Befroy D. Romanelli A.J. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32345-32353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal ASO therapy was initiated 3 days after commencing the high fat diet. All ASOs (control, Dgat1, and Dgat2) were prepared in normal saline, and the solutions were sterilized through a 0.2-μm filter. Rats were given ASO solutions or saline twice per week via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50 or 75 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks. ASO control rats were treated at the higher dose (75 mg/kg/week). During the treatment period, body weight and food intake were measured twice weekly. The Yale Animal Care and Use Committee approved all protocols. Selection of Rat Dgat ASOs—To identify rat Dgat1 and Dgat2 ASO inhibitors, rapid throughput screens were performed in vitro as described previously (24Watts L.M. Manchem V.P. Leedom T.A. Rivard A.L. McKay R.A. Bao D. Neroladakis T. Monia B.P. Bodenmiller D.M. Cao J.X. Zhang H.Y. Cox A.L. Jacobs S.J. Michael M.D. Sloop K.W. Bhanot S. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1846-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief, 80 ASOs were designed to the rat DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNAs sequences, respectively, and initial screens identified several potent and specific ASOs, all of which targeted a binding site within the coding region of the DGAT1 and DGAT2 mRNAs. After extensive dose-response characterization of the most potent ASOs from the screen, two lead ASOs, ISIS-327822 (sequence CCTTCGCTGGCGGCACCACA) for Dgat1 and ISIS-369235 (sequence GCATTACCACTCCCATTCTT) for Dgat2, were chosen. The control ASO, ISIS-141923, has the following sequence, 5′-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC-3′, and does not have perfect complementarity to any known gene in public data bases. The first five bases and last five bases of chimeric ASOs have a 2′-O-(2-methoxy)-ethyl modification, and the ASOs also have a phosphorothioate backbone. This chimeric design has been shown to provide both increased nuclease resistance and mRNA affinity, while maintaining the robust RNase H terminating mechanism utilized by these types of ASOs (25McKay R.A. Miraglia L.J. Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Sasmor H. Dean N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1715-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These benefits result in an attractive in vivo pharmacological and toxicological profile for 2′-O-(2-methoxy)-ethyl chimeric ASOs. Determination of DGAT Activity in Liver Homogenates and Fatty Acid Oxidation and Triglyceride Synthesis in Transfected Rat Hepatocytes in Vitro—Total DGAT activity was measured in liver tissue homogenates from ASO-treated rats as described previously (16Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated as described previously and plated onto collagen-coated 25-cm2 flasks for fatty acid oxidation measurement or 60-mm plates for triglyceride synthesis measurement (27Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K. Booten S.L. Bao D. Song X.Z. Kelly S. Chen S. McKay R. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were treated with ASO (150 nm) and Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) mixture for 4 h in serum-free William’s E media (Invitrogen). ASO and Lipofectin were mixed in a ratio of 3 μg of Lipofectin® for every 1 ml of 100 nm ASO concentration. After 4 h, ASO reaction mixture was replaced with normal maintenance media (William’s E media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm insulin). The cells were incubated under normal conditions for 20–24 h, and then fatty acid ([14C]oleate) oxidation and triglyceride synthesis (incorporation of [3H]glycerol into triglyceride) were measured as described previously (27Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K. Booten S.L. Bao D. Song X.Z. Kelly S. Chen S. McKay R. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Studies—Seven days prior to the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, indwelling catheters were placed into the right internal jugular vein extending to the right atrium, and the left carotid artery extending to the aortic arch. After an overnight fast, [3-3H]glucose (HPLC-purified; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was infused at a rate of 0.15 μCi/min for 3 h to assess the basal glucose turnover. Following the basal period, the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was conducted for 135 min with a primed/continuous infusion of human insulin (60 milliunits/kg prime, 4 milliunits/kg/min infusion) (Novo Nordisk) and a variable infusion of 20% dextrose to maintain euglycemia (∼100 mg/dl). [3-3H]Glucose was infused at a rate of 0.4 μCi/min throughout the clamps. A 25-μCi bolus of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected at the 90th min of the clamp to estimate the rate of insulin-stimulated tissue glucose uptake. Additional blood samples (20–60 μl) were taken at 0, 70, and 135 min for the determination of plasma FFA and/or insulin concentrations. At the end of the clamp, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium injection (150 mg/kg), and all tissues were taken within 4 min, frozen immediately using liquid N2-cooled aluminum tongs, and stored at -80 °C for subsequent analysis. Biochemical Analysis and Calculations—Plasma glucose was analyzed during the clamps using 10 μl of plasma by a glucose oxidase method on a Beckman glucose analyzer II (Beckman Coulter). Plasma insulin, adiponectin, and leptin were measured by radioimmunoassay using kits from Linco Research Inc. The adiponectin kit was primarily designed to measure mouse adiponectin, but it shows significant cross-reactivity with rat adiponectin. Plasma fatty acid concentrations were determined using an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.). Plasma lipoprotein and cholesterol profiling in pooled samples of each group was performed with a Beckman System Gold 126 HPLC system, 507e refrigerated antosampler, 126-photodiode array detector (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) and a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pfizer, Chicago) as described by Crooke et al. (28Crooke R.M. Graham M.J. Lemonidis K.M. Whipple C.P. Koo S. Perera R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 872-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For the determination of plasma [3H]glucose, plasma was deproteinized with ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2, dried to remove 3H2O, resuspended in water, and counted in scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Beckman scintillation counter. Rates of basal and insulin-stimulated whole body glucose turnover were determined as the ratio of the [3-3H]glucose infusion rate (disintegrations per min (dpm)) to the specific activity of plasma glucose (dpm per mg) at the end of the basal period and during the final 30 min of the clamp experiment, respectively. Hepatic glucose production was determined by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the rate of total glucose appearance. The plasma concentration of 3H2O was determined by the difference between 3H counts without and with drying, and whole body glycolysis was calculated from the rate of increase in plasma 3H2O concentration, determined by linear regression of the measurements at 100, 105, 115, 125, and 135 min (29Youn J.H. Buchanan T.A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whole body glycogen synthesis was estimated by subtracting whole body glycolysis from whole body glucose uptake, assuming that glycolysis and glycogen synthesis account for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (30Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in individual muscles were calculated from muscle 2-[14C]deoxyglucose 6-phosphate (2-DG-6-P) content and 3H incorporation into muscle glycogen as described previously (29Youn J.H. Buchanan T.A. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the determination of muscle 2-DG-6-P content, muscle samples were homogenized, and the supernatants were subjected to an ion-exchange column to separate 2-DG-6-P from 2-DG as described previously (31Ohshima K. Shargill N.S. Chan T.M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246 (-E197): E193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity of 3H in muscle glycogen was determined by digesting muscle samples in KOH and precipitating glycogen with EtOH as described previously (30Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Tissue Lipid Measurement—The solid-phase extraction and purification of medium, long chain, and very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs from liver have been described previously (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can.

After purification, fatty acyl-CoA fractions were dissolved in methanol/H2O (1:1, v/v) and subjected to lipid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. A turbo ion spray source was interfaced with an API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in conjunction with two 200 series micro pumps and a 200 series autosampler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The DAG extraction and analysis were performed as described previously (12Neschen S. Morino K. Hammond L.E. Zhang D. Liu Z.X. Romanelli A.J. Cline G.W. Pongratz R.L. Zhang X.M. Choi C.S. Coleman R.A.

Total DAG content is expressed as the sum of individual species. Tissue TG was extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) and measured using a DCL triglyceride reagent (Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd.). Tissue lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) content was measured as described previously (12Neschen S. Morino K. Hammond L.E. Zhang D. Liu Z.X. Romanelli A.J. Cline G.W. Pongratz R.L. Zhang X.M. Choi C.S.

In short, ∼100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) with 1 nmol of C17-lysophosphatidic acid as an internal standard. After phase separation with H2O, samples were vortexed and centrifuged, and the methanol/water phase was collected. The supernatant was applied to conditioned Waters Oasis HLB extraction cartridges (Waters), and after a washing step LPA was eluted using methanol. Individual LPA derivatives were measured using lipid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and total LPA content was expressed as the sum of individual species. Insulin Signaling—IRS2-associated PI3K and Akt2 activity were assessed in protein extracts from livers harvested after short term insulin stimulation. PI3K and Akt2 assays were performed according to methods previously described (6Samuel V.T. Liu Z.X. Qu X. Elder B.D. Bilz S. Befroy D. Romanelli A.J. Shulman G.I. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies used for experiments were rabbit polyclonal IgG. Antibodies for PI3K and Akt2 were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). For PKCɛ membrane translocation, 50 μg of crude membrane and cytosol protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (DuPont) using a semidry-transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (PBS-T:10 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 80 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 0.145 mol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, washed twice, and then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-peptide antibody against PKCɛ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in rinsing solution. After further washings, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG fraction of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T, for 2 h. PKCɛ translocation was expressed as the ratio of membrane bands over cytosol bands (arbitrary units). Total RNA Preparation, Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis, and Immunoblotting Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using total RNA isolation reagent (BL-10500, Biotecx Laboratories Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using custom- made RT-PCR enzymes and reagents kit (Invitrogen.) and ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosciences). Primers and probes for analysis of the expression of different genes (supplemental Table 1) were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosciences). For the analysis, 100 ng of total RNA was used. Each RNA sample was run in duplicate, and the mean value was used to calculate the gene expression level. For Western protein analysis, 200 μl of homogenization buffer (160 NaCl, 20 Trizma (Tris base), 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 1 dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 1 sodium fluoride, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A) was added to 20 mg of powdered tissue. After homogenization for 15 min on ice, the samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and rotated on a rocking platform for 30 min in the cold room. After centrifugation for 60 min at 20,500 relative centrifugal fields in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4 °C, insoluble debris was removed. Forty micrograms of tissue lysates were then separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with SREBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 13551), ACC1 (Cell Signaling, catalog number 36620), SCD1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 14720), or UCP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 6526) antibodies. Fat Absorption—During the treatment period, fat absorption was measured by placing a sucrose polybehenate marker in a safflower oil diet and measuring the percent discarded in collected stool samples (37Jandacek R.J. Heubi J.E. Tso P. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 139-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the differences in mean values among the three groups was evaluated using the one-way analysis of variance, followed by ad hoc analysis using the (Duncan’s test). Statistical analyses for the two groups were made using a two-tailed Student’s t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

https://openalex.org/W1970379805,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the insidious onset of dyspnea or cough. However, a subset of patients has a short duration of symptoms with rapid progression to end-stage disease. In this study, we evaluated clinical and molecular features of “rapid” and “slow” progressors with IPF. Methods and Findings 26 patients with <6 months of symptoms before first presentation [rapid progressors] and 88 patients with >24 months of symptoms [slow progressors] were studied. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meyer method and proportional hazard's model. Lung microarrays and tissue proteins were measured in a subset of patients. No differences were found in age, physiologic impairment and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular profile. There were more males (OR = 6.5; CI:1.4-29.5; p = 0.006) and smokers (OR = 3.04; CI:1.1-8.3; p = 0.04) in the rapid progressors group. Survival from the beginning of symptoms was significantly reduced in rapid progressors (HR = 9.0; CI:4.48-18.3; p<0.0001) and there was a tendency for decreased survival from the time of diagnosis (HR = 1.5; CI:0.81-2.87; p = 0.18). We identified 437 differentially expressed genes. Lungs of rapid progressors overexpressed genes involved in morphogenesis, oxidative stress, migration/proliferation, and genes from fibroblasts/smooth muscle cells. Upregulation of two of these genes, adenosine-2B receptor and prominin-1/CD133, was validated by immunohistochemistry and were expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. BAL from rapid progressors showed a >2-fold increase of active matrix metalloproteinase-9, and induced a higher fibroblast migration compared with slow progressors and controls [238±98% versus 123±29% (p<0.05) and 30±17% (p<0.01)]. Conclusions/Significance A subgroup of IPF patients, predominantly smoking males, display an accelerated clinical course and have a gene expression pattern that is different from those with slower progression and longer survival. These findings highlight the variability in the progression of IPF, and may explain, in part, the difficulty in obtaining significant and reproducible results in studies of therapeutic interventions in patients with IPF."

https://openalex.org/W2109353494,"The transient receptor potential channel, subfamily V, member 6 (TRPV6), is strongly expressed in advanced prostate cancer and significantly correlates with the Gleason >7 grading, being undetectable in healthy and benign prostate tissues. However, the role of TRPV6 as a highly Ca(2+)-selective channel in prostate carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we report that TRPV6 is directly involved in the control of prostate cancer cell (LNCaP cell line) proliferation by decreasing: (i) proliferation rate; (ii) cell accumulation in the S-phase of cell cycle and (iii) proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. We demonstrate that the Ca(2+) uptake into LNCaP cells is mediated by TRPV6, with the subsequent downstream activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell transcription factor (NFAT). TRPV6-mediated Ca(2+) entry is also involved in apoptosis resistance of LNCaP cells. Our results suggest that TRPV6 expression in LNCaP cells is regulated by androgen receptor, however, in a ligand-independent manner. We conclude that the upregulation of TRPV6 Ca(2+) channel in prostate cancer cells may represent a mechanism for maintaining a higher proliferation rate, increasing cell survival and apoptosis resistance as well."
https://openalex.org/W2029599962,"Hypoxic cancer cells are resistant to treatment, leading to the selection of cells with a more malignant phenotype. The expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of solid tumors including prostate cancer. Recently, we detected elevated expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in human prostate cancer tissue. The objective of the current study was to determine whether hypoxia increases IL-8 and IL-8 receptor expression in prostate cancer cells and whether this contributes to a survival advantage in hypoxic cells. IL-8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in PC3 cells was upregulated in response to hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. Elevated IL-8 secretion following hypoxia was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while immunoblotting confirmed elevated receptor expression. Attenuation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a HIF-1 dominant-negative and pharmacological inhibitors, abrogated hypoxia-induced transcription of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in PC3 cells. Furthermore, chromatin-IP analysis demonstrated binding of HIF-1 and NF-κB to CXCR1. Finally, inhibition of IL-8 signaling potentiated etoposide-induced cell death in hypoxic PC3 cells. These results suggest that IL-8 signaling confers a survival advantage to hypoxic prostate cancer cells, and therefore, strategies to inhibit IL-8 signaling may sensitize hypoxic tumor cells to conventional treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2040092826,"Spontaneous DNA breakage is predicted to be a frequent, inevitable consequence of DNA replication and is thought to underlie much of the genomic change that fuels cancer and evolution. Despite its importance, there has been little direct measurement of the amounts, types, sources and fates of spontaneous DNA lesions in living cells. We present a direct, sensitive flow cytometric assay in single living Escherichia coli cells for DNA lesions capable of inducing the SOS DNA damage response, and we report its use in quantification of spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We report efficient detection of single chromosomal DSBs and rates of spontaneous breakage approximately 20- to 100-fold lower than predicted. In addition, we implicate DNA replication in the origin of spontaneous DSBs with the finding of fewer spontaneous DSBs in a mutant with altered DNA polymerase III. The data imply that spontaneous DSBs induce genomic changes and instability 20-100 times more potently than previously appreciated. Finally, FACS demonstrated two main cell fates after spontaneous DNA damage: viability with or without resumption of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2047644930,"Cells store lipids in droplets. Studies addressing how mammals control lipid-based energy homeostasis have implicated proteins of the PAT domain family, such as perilipin that surrounds the lipid droplets. Perilipin knock-out mice are lean and resistant to obesity. Factors that mediate lipid storage in fungi are still unknown. Here we describe a gene (Mpl1) in the economically important insect fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae that has structural similarities to mammalian perilipins. Consistent with a role in lipid storage, Mpl1 is predominantly expressed when M. anisopliae is engaged in accumulating lipids and ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-tagged MPL1 (Metarhizium perilipin-like protein) localized to lipid droplets. Mutant M. anisopliae lacking MPL1 have thinner hyphae, fewer lipid droplets, particularly in appressoria (specialized infection structures at the end of germ tubes), and a decrease in total lipids. Mpl1 therefore acts in a perilipin-like manner suggesting an evolutionary conserved function in lipid metabolism. However, reflecting general differences between animal and fungal lineages, these proteins have also been selected to cope with different tasks. Thus, turgor generation by ΔMpl1 appressoria is dramatically reduced indicating that lipid droplets are required for solute accumulation. This was linked with the reduced ability to breach insect cuticle so that Mpl1 is a pathogenicity determinant. Blast searches of fungal genomes revealed that perilipin homologs are found only in pezizomycotinal ascomycetes and occur as single copy genes. Expression of Mpl1 in yeast cells, a fungus that lacks a perilipin-like gene, blocked their ability to mobilize lipids during starvation conditions. Cells store lipids in droplets.

Expression of Mpl1 in yeast cells, a fungus that lacks a perilipin-like gene, blocked their ability to mobilize lipids during starvation conditions. Eukaryotic cells contain droplets of triglycerides encased in phospholipid membranes. These lipid droplets (LDs) 3The abbreviations used are: LDs, lipid droplets; PAT, perilipin, adipocyte differentiation-related protein and TIP47; TAG, triacylglycerol; OA, oleic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDA, potato dextrose agar; NR, Nile Red; WT, wild type; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Per A, perilipin A. 3The abbreviations used are: LDs, lipid droplets; PAT, perilipin, adipocyte differentiation-related protein and TIP47; TAG, triacylglycerol; OA, oleic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDA, potato dextrose agar; NR, Nile Red; WT, wild type; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Per A, perilipin A. were once considered to be just inert storage vessels for energy-rich fat, but recent studies have shown they have additional roles in maintaining membranes and moving components around cells. The lipid droplets have also been implicated in lipid diseases, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease (1Beckman M. Science. 2006; 311: 1232-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with fat droplets being metabolically active, the membranes encasing them have proteins with wide ranging biochemical activities. The best studied are mammalian proteins of the perilipin family (also called the PAT family) such as perilipin, adipocyte differentiation-related protein, and TIP47. These proteins have a characteristic series of hydrophobic sequences (the PAT domain) that facilitate their localization to the surface of lipid droplets. By coating droplets, perilipin forms a barrier that restricts the access of cytosolic lipases. During food deprivation, perilipin is phosphorylated by protein kinase A; the barrier function of perilipin is attenuated, and lipolysis increases (2Marcinkiewicz A. Gauthier D. Garcia A. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11901-11909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In comparison with normal mice, perilipin-deficient mice have less fat, more muscle, a higher metabolic rate, and are resistant to diet-induced and genetic obesity (3Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B.

Sztalryd C. Hlavin E.M. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The effects of perilipin have also been studied in Drosophila where the lack of the perilipin homolog results in flies with less fat (6Teixeira L. Rabouille C. Rorth P. Ephrussi A. Vanzo N.F. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For perilipin-free animals, fat storage is a losing battle because hormone-sensitive lipase metabolizes fat as soon as it is made. Not surprisingly therefore, human perilipin variants are also associated with obesity or leanness (7Qi L. Corella D. Sorli J.V. Portoles O. Shen H. Coltell O. Godoy D. Greenberg A.S. Ordovas J.M. Clin. Genet. 2004; 66: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The proteins that mediate lipid storage in fungi are still unknown. In this study we show that the ascomycete Metarhizium anisopliae, a ubiquitous insect pathogen and biocontrol agent (8Blanford S. Chan B.H.K. Jenkins N. Sim D. Turner R.J. Read A.F. Thomas M.B. Science. 2005; 308: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), produces a single mammalian perilipin homolog we designated as Mpl1 for Metarhizium perilipin-like protein. To demonstrate possible conserved functions, we characterized the Mpl1 gene, asked whether its product participates in the regulation of lipid storage, and investigated its influence on fungal processes such as pathogenicity. Our data suggest that M. anisopliae represents a tractable new model system to study the functions of LDs and identify the components and mechanisms of energy homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Cloning and Deletion—Our EST analysis identified a high frequency contig (CN808339, 1.5% of transcripts) when the fungus was grown in insect hemolymph (9Wang C. Hu G. St. Leger R.J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2005; 42: 704-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A BLAST search showed that it has a high similarity with the virulence factor CAP20 of plant fungal pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (10Hwang C.S. Flaishman M.A. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). To study its potential function in M. anisopliae, a full cDNA sequence was cloned, and the genomic DNA with flanking sequences was obtained by primer walking (DNA Walking Speedup™ kit, Seegene Inc.). Gene deletion was conducted using the plasmid pGPS3Bar as described before (11Wang C. St. Leger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The detailed procedure is provided in supplemental Fig. S1.GFP Fusion Constructs and Expression—Full-length cDNA of Mpl1 was amplified from a library of genes expressed by M. anisopliae in insect hemolymph (9Wang C. Hu G. St. Leger R.J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2005; 42: 704-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The primers PerEF (CTTGGATCCCGGGATGGCTGTCCCTCAGGTCAA) and PerER (CTTGGATCCTTGGCATTGGCATAGACT) were used to introduce BamHI sites at both ends as well as an additional SmaI site at the 5′ end. The product was digested with BamHI and then inserted into the BamHI site of pYes2 (Invitrogen) to generate pYes2Per. The GFP gene was amplified from pEGFP (Clontech) with the primers GfpPerF (CCGAGCTCGGATCCCGTACCGGTCGCCACCATG) and GfpPerR (AGGGACAGCCATCCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC) by deleting the 3′ TAA stop codon (the underlined regions exactly match the terminal regions of pYes2Per after digestion with SmaI). The product was integrated into the SmaI site of plasmid pYes2Per using an in-fusion dry-down PCR cloning kit (Clontech) to generate the plasmid pGfpPer.To determine whether MPL1 localizes to LDs in a fungus lacking endogenous perilipin-like proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen) was transformed with pGfpPer and the transformant grown overnight in SC-U medium plus 2% raffinose. The culture was adjusted to A600 = 0.4 in 2% galactose SC-U medium and incubated at 30 °C, 250 rpm for 12 h.To ectopically express GFP-tagged MPL1 in its endogenous M. anisopliae environment, the Gfp-Mpl1 fusion product was excised from pGfpPer and inserted into the BamHI site of pBARGPE1 (20Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) under the control of a constitutive Aspergillus GpdA promoter. The construct was linearized with ScaI and transformed into M. anisopliae protoplasts as described (11Wang C. St. Leger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—To monitor gene expression of Mpl1 mycelium from 36-h Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB), cultures were collected by filtration and washed three times with sterile distilled water. Equal amounts (0.2 g, wet weight) of mycelia were incubated (6 h) in 10 ml of water or water supplemented with 0.1% bean root exudate (25Welte M.A. Cermelli S. Griner J. Viera A. Guo Y. Kim D.H.

Mycelia were also incubated in minimal medium (MM, glucose 10 g/liter, NaNO3 6 g/liter, KCl 0.52 g/liter, MgSO4·7H2O 0.52 g/liter, KH2PO4 0.25 g/liter) or in hemolymph of Manduca sexta. For time course studies, conidia were inoculated in SDB for 1–12 h. To identify any inductive relationship with fatty acids, oleic acid (OA, 600 μm) was added to 36-h MM cultures and incubated for 1–12 h. The mycelia were collected for RNA extraction, cDNA conversion, and RT-PCR analysis as described before (11Wang C. St. Leger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast or Metarhizium cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then washed four times with PBS (12DiDonato D. Brasaemle D.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were then stained with either Nile Red (NR, Sigma) or Bodipy (D3922, Invitrogen) to detect neutral lipids. A stock solution of NR (500 μg/ml) was prepared in acetone and diluted to 5–10 μg/ml in PBS. Bodipy was used at 10 μg/ml (stock, 1 mg/ml in ethanol) in PBS and provided a more stable fluorescent signal than NR.Lipid Quantification—Total lipid quantification was conducted using a phosphoric acid-vanillin method (13Izard J. Limberger R.J. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2003; 55: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Conidia of both the wild type and mutant were harvested from newly mycosed Manduca larvae, potato dextrose agar (PDA), or PDA plus 600 μm oleic acid. Spore suspensions (0.5 ml containing ∼1.5 × 108 conidia/ml) were added to glass tubes. To each tube, 2 ml of 18 m H2SO4 was added, and the tubes were boiled in a water bath for 10 min. After cooling (5 min at room temperature), 5 ml of phosphoric acid-vanillin reagent (0.12 g of vanillin, 20 ml of water and the volume adjusted to 100 ml with 85% H3PO4) was added, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance of supernatants was measured at 530 nm. A standard curve was generated using triolein (Sigma).For yeast studies, a single colony of pYes2Per transformed yeast cells was incubated overnight in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose), YPD plus 600 μm OA, 2% raffinose SC-U, or 2% raffinose SC-U plus OA. Cells harvested from the different media were washed three times, adjusted to A600 = 1.0 with sterile water, and incubated for up to 20 h to induce starvation. The cell concentration was adjusted to A600 = 2.0 and 0.5 ml used for lipid assay. Differences in lipid content between treatments were compared using the Duncan’s analysis of variance analysis (SPSS, 11.0.0).Appressorial Turgor Assay—To examine the potential involvement of MPL1 in this process, appressoria were induced on locust hind wings (14Wang C. St. Leger R.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Appressorial turgor pressure was assayed using serial solutions of PEG-8000 (2–13 g in 10 ml of distilled water) (15Howard R.J. Ferrari M.A. Roach D.H. Money N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11281-11284Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Individual wings were dipped in PEG solutions for 10 min, and the percentage of collapsed appressoria was determined from 300 cells per PEG solution.Insect Bioassay—Virulence of the wild type and ΔMpl1 was assayed against newly emerged 5th instar larvae of M. sexta (16St. Leger R.J.

Conidia were applied either topically by immersion of larvae in an aqueous suspension containing 2 × 107 conidia/ml for 20 s or by injecting the second proleg with 10 μl of an aqueous suspension containing 5 × 106 spores per ml. Each treatment had three replicates with 10 insects each, and the experiments were repeated twice. Mortality was recorded every 12 h.RESULTSProtein Structure and Characteristics—The mammalian PAT proteins are characterized by conservation through ∼350 amino acids of the N-terminal sequence where the lipid targeting functions reside. Distal to the N-terminal conservations, the proteins diverge to varying degrees (17Garcia A. Subramanian V. Sekowski A. Bhattacharyya S. Love M.W. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8409-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The full open reading frame of Mpl1 encodes a protein of 183 amino acids (20.3 kDa with a predicted pI of 8.96). MPL1 is therefore only 35% the size of mouse perilipin A (Per A), but it has a similar overall structure and several conserved regions with its N-terminal sequence (overall sequence similarity E = 1 × 10-5) (Fig. 1A). In particular, like the N terminus of Per A (17Garcia A. Subramanian V. Sekowski A. Bhattacharyya S. Love M.W. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8409-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Subramanian V. Garcia A. Sekowski A. Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1983-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the MPL1 protein contains N-terminal β-strands, three moderately hydrophobic regions (H1, H2, and H3), and an acidic region (129–136 in MPL1) before H2. Also like Per A, MPL1 has multiple phosphorylation sites, including a consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site at position 96 in a region conserved with Per A (Fig. 1, A and B).MPL1 shows homology to a reputed CAP20 protein (Fig. 1B) expressed during appressorial formation by the plant pathogen C. gloeosporioides and critical for virulence (10Hwang C.S. Flaishman M.A. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). However, our blast searches (Blastp or tBlastn) revealed no similarities between CAP proteins and either MPL1 or the protein from C. gloeosporioides. No evidence is provided by Hwang et al. (10Hwang C.S. Flaishman M.A. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar) as to why the Colletotrichum sequence is a CAP protein. Aside from the animal perilipins, homologs (E < 10-5) of MPL1 are only present in pezizomycotinal fungi of the order Ascomycota, and are absent in yeasts and other fungi. Each pezizomycotinal fungus has only a single perilipin-like gene in contrast to animals encoding three perilipin genes (A, B, and C) (19Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C.

RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression of Mpl1 when the fungus was grown in nutrient-rich media (insect hemolymph or SDB) as compared with nutrient-poor media (Fig. 2A). The addition of fatty acids to mammalian cells stimulates lipid accumulation and increases intracellular levels of perilipin (21Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Likewise, transcription of Mpl1 by M. anisopliae germlings was up-regulated within 30 min following the addition of oleic acid to minimal medium (MM) (Fig. 2B). Conidia contained many large LDs (Fig. 3A) and demonstrated a strong enrichment of Mpl1 transcripts. Transcription levels decreased during germination (Fig. 2C), and LD numbers dropped by 40% between 6 and 12 h (Fig. S2) as lipid stores are mobilized during germ tube elongation (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results suggest that Mpl1 regulation parallels lipid storage.FIGURE 2Mpl1 gene expression and protein localization.

We also determined whether LD localization is a general quality of MPL1 by expressing it with the Gal1-inducible promoter in the yeast S. cerevisiae, which is a system that lacks endogenous perilipin-like proteins. Consistent with GFP fusions of mammalian PAT proteins, i.e. perilipin A (22Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), TIP47 (23Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15998-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), N-terminal fusion of MPL1 with GFP did not disrupt the ability of the protein to localize to lipid vesicles. Transformed yeast and Metarhizium cells treated with the neutral lipid stain NR co-localized with the GFP signal confirming that MPL1 is binding to LDs (Fig. 2, D–F). No additional diffuse cytoplasmic signal was seen with either GFP or NR. The expression patterns and the intracellular localization of MPL1 are therefore consistent with the proposal that the protein plays a regulatory role in global triacylglycerol (TAG) storage by acting at the level of LDs.Loss of Function Mutants Confirm That MPL1 Plays an Important Role in Lipid Homeostasis—Mpl1 null mutants were generated by homologous replacement (Fig. S1). The conidia of wild type (WT) M. anisopliae have multiple LDs (mean per cell = 19.4 ± 3.76) that mostly cluster at the poles of the cell (Fig. 3A). ΔMpl1 conidia have ∼2.4-fold fewer LDs than WT (p < 0.05) indicating that knock-out of Mpl1 impairs, but does not abolish, the ability of M. anisopliae to store lipid (Fig. 3B). During germination of WT conidia in minimal medium, the total number of LDs diminishes by 62% indicative of lipid degradation, and the remaining LDs migrate into the germ tube apexes (mean per apex = 3.6 ± 1.1). This distribution of LDs is explainable by fungi being tip growers; the tip is the area of greatest metabolism and where new membranes are being laid down. Relative to the WT, the ΔMpl1 germ tubes are thinner and apparently analogous to the “lean” phenotype of perilipin-deficient mice (3Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). Approximately 50% of ΔMpl1 germ tubes lack visible LDs. The remaining germ tubes have up to three LDs. The aggregated, albeit small, clusters of LDs at the poles of ΔMpl1 conidia (Fig. 3B) and the successful transportation of residual LDs to their hyphal tips (Fig. 3D) indicate that Mpl1 is not crucially involved in mediating the positioning of droplets in Metarhizium. This contrasts with Drosophila where perilipin regulates transportation of LDs (25Welte M.A. Cermelli S. Griner J. Viera A. Guo Y. Kim D.H. Gindhart J.G. Gross S.P. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1266-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The pattern of LD distribution was also studied during formation of appressoria on locust hind wings. LDs moved into the differentiating hyphal tip so the WT appressoria were enriched in LDs. ΔMpl1 appressoria frequently contained no LDs at all (Fig. 3, E and F).After breaching the insect cuticle, Metarhizium produces variably shaped hyphal bodies for dispersal in the hemocoele (11Wang C. St. Leger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The distribution of LDs in these was also examined. Unlike conidia, LDs are dispersed throughout hyphal body cells, but as with other cell types, the ΔMpl1 mutants have fewer (Fig. 3, G and H).Because ΔMpl1 cell types contain relatively few, if any, LDs, the regulation of lipid homeostasis by MPL1 in Metarhizium was also studied by assaying total levels of intracellular lipids (Fig. 4A). Consistent with an elevated number of LDs, there was >2-fold more lipid in WT conidia relative to ΔMpl1 conidia irrespective of whether they were harvested from insect cadavers, PDA, or PDA plus OA. A more dramatic difference in lipid levels (>7-fold) was observed when germinating the WT and ΔMpl1 conidia in a minimal medium (Fig. 4A), indicative of rapid depletion of residual stored lipid in the mutant. As OA up-regulates Mpl1 expression (Fig. 2B), Mpl1 activity might adjust storage of lipids when nutrients are available to ensure extended survival when food supply is limiting. However, the 8% increase in lipid content in conidia harvested from PDA plus OA as compared with PDA alone was not statistically significantly (p > 0.05).FIGURE 4Quantification of lipids from Metarhizium conidia and yeast (S. cerevisiae) cells. A, wild type and ΔMpl1 conidia harvested from mycosed M. sexta cadavers, PDA, and PDA plus OA. B, yeast cells transformed with Mpl1 under the control of the GAL1 promoter were grown overnight in noninductive (YPD or 2% raffinose (Raf)) or inductive media (2% galactose (Gal)) with or without OA and then starved (S) in sterile water for 20 h before lipid assay. Mean lipid content for columns labeled with the same letter are not significantly different (α = 0.01, Duncan’s analysis of variance analysis).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also quantified lipids in yeast transformed with Mpl1 cDNA under the control of the Gal1 promoter (Fig. 4B). No significant differences in lipid content were observed between cells grown in noninductive media (YPD and 2% raffinose) or inductive medium (2% galactose) with or without the addition of OA. However, yeast cells that had not produced MPL1 rapidly reduced their lipid content during starvation. In contrast, cells previously induced to produce MPL1 failed to utilize their stored lipid when deprived of nutrients showing that MPL1 blocks the access (Fig. 4B).MPL1 Affects Appressorial Differentiation and Fungal Virulence—The “Cap20” transcript of the Mpl1 homolog in the plant pathogen C. gloeosporioides is present in conidia, expressed during formation of appressoria, and null mutants are not pathogenic to tomatoes (10Hwang C.S. Flaishman M.A. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Mpl1 on appressorium formation/function in M. anisopliae, we induced appressorial differentiation on locust hind wings. WT appressorial differentiation typically occurs after nuclear division with a septum being formed between the appressorium and conidial mother cell (Fig. 5A). However, this compartmentalization of germ tubes occurred in only 10% of the mutant germlings (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5MPL1 affects appressorial differentiation and turgor pressure. The appressoria produced by conidia germinating on locust hind wings were visualized by staining with Calcofluor white to show the formation of septa (indicated by an arrow) between the appressoria (AP) and conidia (CO) in wild type (A) but not ΔMpl1 germlings (B). Relatively higher levels of ΔMpl1 appressoria collapse when infected locust wings are immersed in serial solutions of PEG-8000 (PEG) for 10 min (C). The insets show collapsed appressoria. Bar = 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of appressorial collapse rates in M. anisopliae using serial concentrations of PEG-8000 shows that the loss of Mpl1 results in a dramatic reduction of turgor pressure (Fig. 5C). This suggests that lipolysis of LDs and consequent production of solutes produce turgor in the wild type. Virulence tests using 5th instar larvae of M. sexta revealed a significant reduction of mortality and speed of kill by ΔMpl1 as compared with the WT. The mutant failed to achieve 50% mortality before the insects pupated (Fig. 6A). However, when the cuticle was bypassed by injecting spores directly into the hemocoele, the speed of kill by the WT (LT50 = 4.42 days) and the mutant (LT50 = 4.72 days) were not significantly different (p = 1.58, t = 0.13) (Fig. 6B). The results indicate that the lack of Mpl1 affects fungal virulence by reducing mechanical penetration of the host cuticle.FIGURE 6The survival of M. sexta larvae after infection with wild type or ΔMpl1 conidia.

https://openalex.org/W2061869453,"Sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i has been implicated in many cellular events. We previously reported that α subunits of G12 family G proteins (Gα12/13) participate in sustained Ca2+ influx required for the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a Ca2+-responsive transcriptional factor, in rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. Here, we demonstrate that Gα12/13-mediated up-regulation of canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels participates in sustained Ca2+ influx and NFAT activation by endothelin (ET)-1 treatment. Expression of constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13 increased the expression of TRPC6 proteins and basal Ca2+ influx activity. The treatment with ET-1 increased TRPC6 protein levels through Gα12/13, reactive oxygen species, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent pathways. NFAT is activated by sustained increase in [Ca2+]i through up-regulated TRPC6. A Gα12/13-inhibitory polypeptide derived from the regulator of the G-protein signaling domain of p115-Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor and a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, suppressed the ET-1-induced increase in expression of marker proteins of myofibroblast formation through a Gα12/13-reactive oxygen species-JNK pathway. The ET-1-induced myofibroblast formation was suppressed by overexpression of TRPC6 and CA NFAT, whereas it was enhanced by TRPC6 small interfering RNAs and cyclosporine A. These results suggest two opposite roles of Gα12/13 in cardiac fibroblasts. First, Gα12/13 mediate ET-1-induced myofibroblast formation. Second, Gα12/13 mediate TRPC6 up-regulation and NFAT activation that negatively regulates ET-1-induced myofibroblast formation. Furthermore, TRPC6 mediates hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes but suppresses fibrotic responses in cardiac fibroblasts.

Sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, induced by increased Ca2+ influx, is important for the regulation of diverse cellular processes, such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In the heart, a Ca2+-responsive serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin is activated by sustained [Ca2+]i increase, and calcineurin activation has been implicated in hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes (11Wilkins B.J.

Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcriptional factor NFAT, facilitating translocation of NFAT from cytosol to the nucleus, where it acts synergistically with other partners to mediate the expression of prohypertrophic genes. However, the physiological and pathological roles of calcineurin-NFAT signaling in cardiac fibroblasts are still controversial when the roles of the signaling pathway are analyzed by CysA, a calcineurin inhibitor. It has been reported that treatment with CysA inhibits pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (13Shimoyama M. Hayashi D. Takimoto E. Zou Y. Oka T. Uozumi H. Kudoh S. Shibasaki F.

To understand fibrotic pathways, it is essential to examine mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy individually.

However, it is still unknown whether TRPC channels participate in Gα12/13-mediated NFAT activation and agonist-induced myofibroblast formation in cardiac fibroblasts. In this study, we investigate how the expression of TRPC channels is regulated and whether TRPC channels are involved in the Gα12/13-mediated increase in basal Ca2+ influx required for NFAT activation.

The peak changes (ΔF/F0) of DCF fluorescence intensity were identified as values obtained by subtracting the basal fluorescence intensity (F0) from the maximal intensity during 5-min ET-1 treatment. Expression Analysis of TRPC mRNAs—The RT-PCR protocol used for the expression analysis and the PCR primers used in this study were as described previously (26Inoue R. Jensen L.J. Shi J. Morita H.

For α-SMA expression, cells were harvested with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, and protease inhibitor mixture (6Swaney J.S. Roth D.M. Olson E.R.

Briefly, 24 h after infection, cardiomyocytes were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm) for 48 h. The cells were washed, fixed, incubated with anti-α-SMA antibody, and then stained with Alexa Fluor 546 goat antimouse IgG. Morphological changes and α-SMA expression of cardiac fibroblasts were visualized with confocal microscopy. For the measurement of collagen synthesis, cells were harvested with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai, Japan). Production of ECM components was assessed by [3H]proline incorporation. After cells were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm)for 2 h,[3H]proline (1 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium and further incubated for 6 h. The incorporated [3H]proline was extracted by 1 n NaOH overnight and measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Measurement of Hypertrophic Responses of Cardiomyocytes—Preparation of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and measurement of hypertrophic responses were performed as described (12Onohara N. Nishida M. Inoue R. Kobayashi H. Sumimoto H. Sato Y. Mori Y. Nagao T. Kurose H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5305-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after siRNA treatment, cardiomyocytes were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm) for 24 h. The cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-phalloidin to visualize actin filament. Protein synthesis was measured by [3H]leucine incorporation. After cells were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm)for 2 h,[3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) was added and further incubated for 6 h. Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as mean ± S.E. The data were accumulated under each condition from at least three independent experiments. For the measurements of [Ca2+]i, representative data of time course experiments were plotted from one of three similar experiments that were performed with more than 30 cells. Mean values were compared with control by Student’s t test. Up-regulation of TRPC6 Proteins by Gα13 Activation—We previously demonstrated that the expression of GTPase-defective mutants of Gα12 (Q229L; CA Gα12) and Gα13 (Q226L; CA Gα13) increases [Ca2+]i and NFAT activity through an SK&F96365-sensitve Ca2+ influx pathway (17Fujii T. Onohara N. Maruyama Y. Tanabe S. Kobayashi H. Fukutomi M. Nagamatsu Y. Nishihara N. Inoue R. Sumimoto H. Shibasaki F. Nagao T. Nishida M. Kurose H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 101: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TRPC channels are thought to be molecular candidates for RACCs. Thus, we examined which TRPC channels are expressed in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Among TRPC1 to -7 channels, TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 mRNAs were detected (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, only TRPC6 mRNA expression was increased 2.5-fold by the expression of CA Gα13. The expression of TRPC6 proteins was also increased by CA Gα12 (Fig. 1B). Expression of CA Gαq (R183C) and WT Gαi2 did not increase TRPC6 protein levels, although both mutants significantly increased ERK activity (supplemental Fig. 1). Treatment with forskolin (50 μm) rather decreased basal expression of TRPC6 proteins. These results indicate that Gα12/13 specifically up-regulate TRPC6 proteins in cardiac fibroblasts. In order to examine whether up-regulation of TRPC6 participates in CA Gα12/13-induced enhancement of Ca2+ responses, knockdown experiments of TRPC6 proteins were performed by using TRPC6 siRNAs (12Onohara N. Nishida M. Inoue R. Kobayashi H. Sumimoto H. Sato Y. Mori Y. Nagao T. Kurose H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5305-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Since the extent of NFAT activation induced by CA Gα13 was larger than that by CA Gα12,CAGα13-expressing cells were used to examine the involvement of TRPC6 in Gα12/13-mediated Ca2+ responses. Treatment with TRPC6 siRNAs completely suppressed CA Gα13-induced up-regulation of TRPC6 protein expression (Fig. 1C). We confirmed that TRPC6 siRNAs did not affect the expression levels of TRPC3 and TRPC7 proteins (data not shown). The basal Ca2+ influx activity was determined by the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the addition of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ to cells in Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution (18Nagamatsu Y. Nishida M. Onohara N. Fukutomi M. Maruyama Y. Kobayashi H. Sato Y. Kurose H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 101: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This basal Ca2+ influx activity was enhanced by the expression of CA Gα13 and CA Gα12 (Fig. 1D). The CA Gα13-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was completely suppressed by the treatment with TRPC6 siRNAs (Fig. 1, C–E). The sustained increase in [Ca2+]i activated NFAT activity, and the treatment with TRPC6 siRNAs inhibited CA Gα13-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that up-regulation of TRPC6 by Gα13 activation enhances Ca2+ influx and NFAT activation in cardiac fibroblasts. Involvement of Tyrosine Kinase in TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ Influx by Gα12/13 Activation—We next examined whether the channel activity of TRPC6 proteins is actually enhanced by Gα13 activation. WT TRPC6 or two DN mutants of TRPC6 (C6-3A and C6-ΔN) were overexpressed in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The expression of DN TRPC6 significantly suppressed the sustained [Ca2+]i increase of CA Gα13-expressing cells induced by the addition of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i of CA Gα13-expressing cells is enhanced by Ca2+ influx through TRPC6 channels. It has been reported that TRPC6 activity is regulated by DAG (28Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G.

https://openalex.org/W2038888441,"Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins play important roles in constitutive and alternative splicing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism. We have previously isolated a unique plant SR protein (SR45) with atypical domain organization. However, the biological and molecular functions of this novel SR protein are not known. Here, we report biological and molecular functions of this protein. Using an in vitro splicing complementation assay, we showed that SR45 functions as an essential splicing factor. Furthermore, the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts of several other SR genes was altered in a mutant, sr45-1, suggesting that the observed phenotypic abnormalities in sr45-1 are likely due to altered levels of SR protein isoforms, which in turn modulate splicing of other pre-mRNAs. sr45-1 exhibited developmental abnormalities, including delayed flowering, narrow leaves and altered number of petals and stamens. The late flowering phenotype was observed under both long days and short days and was rescued by vernalization. FLC, a key flowering repressor, is up-regulated in sr45-1 demonstrating that SR45 influences the autonomous flowering pathway. Changes in the alternative splicing of SR genes and the phenotypic defects in the mutant were rescued by SR45 cDNA, further confirming that the observed defects in the mutant are due to the lack of SR45. These results indicate that SR45 is a novel plant-specific splicing factor that plays a crucial role in regulating developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2114184294,"Background Kinetochores are large multiprotein complexes indispensable for proper chromosome segregation. Although Drosophila is a classical model organism for studies of chromosome segregation, little is known about the organization of its kinetochores. Methodology/Principal Findings We employed bioinformatics, proteomics and cell biology methods to identify and analyze the interaction network of Drosophila kinetochore proteins. We have shown that three Drosophila proteins highly diverged from human and yeast Ndc80, Nuf2 and Mis12 are indeed their orthologues. Affinity purification of these proteins from cultured Drosophila cells identified a further five interacting proteins with weak similarity to subunits of the SPC105/KNL-1, MIND/MIS12 and NDC80 kinetochore complexes together with known kinetochore associated proteins such as dynein/dynactin, spindle assembly checkpoint components and heterochromatin proteins. All eight kinetochore complex proteins were present at the kinetochore during mitosis and MIND/MIS12 complex proteins were also centromeric during interphase. Their down-regulation led to dramatic defects in chromosome congression/segregation frequently accompanied by mitotic spindle elongation. The systematic depletion of each individual protein allowed us to establish dependency relationships for their recruitment onto the kinetochore. This revealed the sequential recruitment of individual members of first, the MIND/MIS12 and then, NDC80 complex. Conclusions/Significance The Drosophila MIND/MIS12 and NDC80 complexes and the Spc105 protein, like their counterparts from other eukaryotic species, are essential for chromosome congression and segregation, but are highly diverged in sequence. Hierarchical dependence relationships of individual proteins regulate the assembly of Drosophila kinetochore complexes in a manner similar, but not identical, to other organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2033607990,"The Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. The ER is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidative protein folding. This study examined the role of BI-1 in the regulation of ER stress-induced accumulation of ROS and expression of unfolded protein response-associated proteins. BI-1 reduced the expression levels of glucose response protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, IRE1α, XBP-1, and phospho-JNK and inhibited the cleavage of ATF-6α p-90, leading to the inhibition of ROS. Although ROS scavengers offer some protection against ER stress-induced apoptosis, the expression of pro-apoptotic ER stress proteins was not affected. This study shows that the response of unfolded proteins is followed by ROS accumulation under ER stress, which is regulated in BI-1 cells. The mechanism for these BI-1-associated functions involves the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. In BI-1 cells, the transfection of HO-1 small interfering RNA completely abolished the BI-1-induced protection. The endogenous expression of HO-1 through ER stress-initiated ROS is believed to be as a protection signal. In conclusion, these observations suggest that BI-1 can inhibit the ER stress proteins as well as the accumulation of ROS, thereby protecting the cells.

The activation of the UPR causes the up-regulation of the genes that encode ER chaperone proteins such as GRP78, which increases the protein folding activity and prevents protein aggregation (5Paz Gavilan M. Vela J. Castano A. Ramos B. Del Rio J.C. Vitorica J. Ruano D. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, it was reported that the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the lumen of the ER can lead to prolonged UPR activation, which in turn causes oxidative stress, resulting eventually in cell death (6Haynes C.M. Titus E.A. Cooper A.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 7Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an anti-apoptotic protein that contains several transmembrane domains that have a protective function on ER stress (8Chae H.J. Kim H.R. Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Banares S. Cui J. Digicaylioglu M. Ke N. Kitada S. Monosov E. Thomas M. Kress C.L. Babendure J.R. Tsien R.Y. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). BI-1 is conserved in both animal and plant species (9Chae H.J. Ke N. Kim H.R. Chen S. Godzik A. Dickman M. Reed J.C. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 323: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The cytoprotective function of BI-1 was originally discovered during cDNA library screens for human proteins that suppress the death of yeast caused by the ectopic expression of the mammalian Bax protein (10Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Although BI-1 has a regulatory effect on ER stress-related apoptosis, the roles of this protein during ER stress and the resulting signal pathways are only now beginning to emerge. This study examined whether or not BI-1 regulates ER stress-associated ROS accumulation and explored the mechanism by which BI-1 inhibits the accumulation of ROS and resultant cell death. Thapsigargin and tunicamycin were supplied by Calbiochem. DiOC6 (3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide) and DCF-DA were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The antibodies against actin, HO-1, GRP78, JNK, IRE-1, XBP-1, CHOP, and Nrf-2 siRNA were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ATF-6 antibody was obtained from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). The antibodies against phospho-JNK, eIF-2α, and phospho-eIF-2α were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and other tissue culture reagents were supplied by Invitrogen. Bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce. All other chemicals were at least of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. The human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm Hepes, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. HT1080 cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3 (Neo), pcDNA3-BI-1-HA, or CΔ-BI-1-HA (C-terminal-deleted) plasmids using the superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were then cultured for 3 weeks in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The tetracycline-inducible BI-1-transfected HeLa cells were cultured in complete DMEM containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 100 μg/ml G418 (hygromycin B from Sigma; G418 from Fisher). BI-1 was induced by adding doxycycline (1 μg/ml; Sigma) to the medium. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion technique and was calculated by dividing the number of nonstained (viable) cells by the total cell count. Annexin V and Propidium Iodide Double Staining Assay— HT1080 cells (Neo, BI-1, and CΔ-BI-1) were plated in 100 × 20-mm plates at cell densities ranging from 1 × 107 to 2 × 107 cells/plate. After treatment, the cells were removed from the plate using trypsin and analyzed for the level of phosphatidylserine externalization using an annexin V and propidium iodide apoptosis kit (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, as well as a PAS Flow Cytometer equipped with Partec software (Partec, Germany). Morphological Detection of Apoptosis—The cells were fixed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% paraformaldehyde. After air drying, the cells were stained for 10 min in Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/liter), mounted in 50% glycerol containing 20 mmol/liter citric acid and 50 mmol/liter orthophosphate, and stored at–20 °C before analysis. Nuclear morphology was evaluated using a Zeiss IM 35 fluorescence microscope. Genomic DNA Fragmentation Assay—The level of DNA fragmentation was measured using gel electrophoresis as described elsewhere (11Chae H.J. Chae S.W. Kang J.S. Bang B.G. Cho S.B. Park R.K. So H.S. Kim Y.K. Kim H.M. Kim H.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2904-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated at a density of 1 × 107 cells/plate and treated with various agents. 1 × 107 cells/ml were pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). The cell lysates were treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 0.5 mg/ml RNase A was added to the lysates, and the mixture was heated to 70 °C for 5 min. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol, mixed with a loading dye (10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40% sucrose, 0.25% bromphenol blue), and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gel images were captured using an Alpha Innotech digital camera equipped with a transilluminator and Alpha Ease 5.5 software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The intracellular ROS level was measured as described elsewhere (12Kim D.S. Kim H.R. Woo E.R. Hong S.T. Chae H.J. Chae S.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1066-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 1 μm DCF-DA at 37 °C for 30 min and treated with various agents at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. After cooling on ice, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plate, and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. The fluorescence intensity of the 2,7′-dichlorofluorescein formed by a reaction between DCF-DA and the intracellular ROS of more than 10,000 viable cells from each sample was analyzed by PAS flow cytometry (Partec, Münster, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. The data were collected and analyzed using Partec software. The experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. The data were expressed as representative histograms from three independent experiments. The stock solution of DiOC6 (4 mmol/liter) was prepared in ethanol and stored in small lots at–20 °C; working solution (dilution 1:2000 for DiOC6) was made up in experimental medium (DMEM) immediately before use. A total of 5 × 105 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 100 nm DiOC6 at 37 °C and analyzed using a PAS cytofluorometer (Partec) equipped with Partec software. Forward and side scatters were gated for the major population of normally sized cells, and a minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed. The fluorescent probe DiOC6 was excited using a 488-nm argon laser, and emissions were collected through an FL1 detector fitted with a 525 ± 5-nm band pass filter. HT1080 cells (1 × 105) suspended in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum were seeded into each well of a 12-well plate. After incubating at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the ARE-luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the β-galactosidase plasmid in DMEM without fetal bovine serum and antibiotics using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system with a reporter lysis buffer from Promega. Briefly, the cells were harvested by scraping in 200 μl of a reporter lysis buffer into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, vortex-mixed for 15 s, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant of the cell lysates was then collected. Luciferase activity was determined using 60 μl of cell lysate and 20 μl of substrate using a monolight luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (12Kim D.S. Kim H.R. Woo E.R. Hong S.T. Chae H.J. Chae S.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1066-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitor complex (Roche Applied Science)) on ice for 30 min as described (13Oakes S.A. Scorrano L. Opferman J.T. Bassik M.C. Nishino M. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and the lysates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the nonlysed cells and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was saved as a light membrane (LM; ER/microsome) fraction. The LM fraction was examined for its HO-1 activity. HO-1 activity was measured by determining the level of bilirubin generated in isolated microsomes (14Nath K.A. Balla G. Vercellotti G.M. Balla J. Jacob H.S. Levitt Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mm MgCl2 and designated the microsome fraction. An aliquot of the microsomal fraction was then added to a reaction mixture containing cytosol of the cells (2 mg of cytosolic protein), hemin (20 μm), glucose-6-phosphate (2 mm), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (0.2 units), and NADPH (0.8 mm), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the dark. The bilirubin formed during incubation was extracted using chloroform. The change in optical density at 464–530 nm was measured by Beer's law using extinction coefficient for bilirubin of 40 mm–1 ·cm–1. HO activity was expressed as picomoles of bilirubin formed per h/mg of protein. The cell lysates were prepared, and the level of protein expression was measured as described elsewhere (15Ahmad A. Kikuchi H. Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32090-32100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The total protein from the tissue lysates (four independent tissue lysates from the kidney, liver, and testis of BI-1+/+ and BI-1–/– littermates) was resolved in precast 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels. Immunoblotting was performed using the indicated antibodies. The ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize the signals. The siRNAs were synthesized in duplex and purified forms using Bioneer technology (Daejon, South Korea). The sense and antisense strands of the human HO-1 siRNA and human BI-1 are as follows: HO-1, 5′-CCAGUGCCAAGUUCAA-3′ (sense) and 5UUGAACUUGGUGCACUGG-3′ (antisense); BI-1, 5′-GUGGAAGGCCUUCUUUCUA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAGAAAGAAGGCCUUCCAC-3′ (antisense). The sense and antisense strands of the nonspecific siRNA duplex are as follows: CUGAACAACCAAUGCAAAU-3′ (sense), and 5′-AUUUGCAUUGGUUGUUCAG-3′ (antisense). The siRNAs were transfected into the HT-1080 cells using an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Five μg of the plasmid DNA was mixed with 0.1 ml of a cell suspension, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and nucleofected using an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA quantity, cell concentration, and buffer volume were kept constant throughout the experiments. After electroporation, the cells were transferred immediately to 2.0 ml of complete medium and cultured in six-well plates at 37 °C until needed. The data were analyzed by an analysis of variance in the dose-response experiments as well as by two-tailed Student's t tests. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. In each case, the statistical test used is indicated, and the number of experiments is stated individually in the legend of each figure. ROS Are Associated with ER Stress-induced Apoptosis, Which Is Regulated by BI-1—Recent studies have investigated ER stress-associated accumulation of endogenous ROS and their effect on the apoptotic process (7Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 8Chae H.J. Kim H.R. Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Banares S. Cui J. Digicaylioglu M. Ke N. Kitada S. Monosov E. Thomas M. Kress C.L. Babendure J.R. Tsien R.Y. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To examine association of ER stress with ROS generation, HT-1080 cells were transfected with pcDNA-3 vector and HA-BI-1. Neo resistant cells (Neo) or BI-1 stable overexpressing cells (BI-1) (Fig. 1A, inset) were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. The cells were treated with thapsigargin, an ER-Ca-ATPase inhibitor, or tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, and cell death was evaluated. A thiol agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and a precursor of l-cysteine, GSH, were also used to determine whether thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-induced cell death is the result of ROS generation. As shown Fig. 1A, treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin decreased cell viability of Neo cells significantly, whereas the BI-1 cells were significantly resistant to the cell death induced by these agents. Pretreatment with an antioxidant, NAC or GSH (1 mm), increased the number of viable cells by 64 ± 1.25 and 67 ± 1.21% for thapsigargin and by 65 ± 1.59 and 65.1 ± 2.2% for tunicamycin, respectively (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the antioxidant had no effect on the viability of BI-1 cells. These observations were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of the cells stained with annexin V (Fig. 1B). In the thapsigargintreated cells, 57.01 ± 3.01% of the cells (63.66 ± 1.85% of the tunicamycin-treated cells) were annexin V-positive. However, in the presence of either NAC or GSH, only 35.23 ± 3.46 or 35.4 ± 1.76% of the total cell population in the thapsigargintreated cells were annexin V-positive (37.01 ± 1.45% or 35.24 ± 2.49% in the tunicamycin-treated cells). The number of annexin V-positive BI-1 cells was not changed by a pretreatment with antioxidants. Although the overall number of propidium iodide-positive stained cells was relatively low compared with the annexin V-stained cells, the protective effect of BI-1 and that of NAC and GSH in Neo cells were similar to the result of annexin V staining (supplemental Table S1). These results suggest that BI-1 overexpression protects the cells against ER stress through the regulation of ROS. BI-1 Inhibits Accumulation of ROS in ER Stress-exposed Cells— ROS levels in Neo and BI-1 cells were measured after treatment with an ER stress inducer, thapsigargin or tunicamycin. Basal levels of ROS in BI-1 cells were much lower than that in the Neo, control cells (Fig. 2). Moreover, thapsigargin treatment increased significantly the levels of ROS in Neo cells (∼40% increment), whereas the level of ROS in BI-1 cells was increased only slightly (∼12%). Tunicamycin also increased the level of ROS in the Neo cells more than in BI-1 cells. Pretreatment with NAC or GSH completely inhibited the accumulation of ROS in the Neo cells treated with the ER stress agent. In parallel with ROS analysis, we measured mitochondria membrane potential using DiO6. Fig. 2 shows that the mitochondrial membrane potential remained intact during the period of exposure to ER stress, which suggests that ER stress-induced accumulation of ROS precedes collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. To confirm that DiOC6 dye had correctly stained the mitochondria, the cells were incubated with carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupling agent that abolishes mitochondria membrane potential (16Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17Rottenberg H. Wu S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As expected, mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed in carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that ER stress-induced generation of ROS is not a by-product of the apoptotic phenomena but is an upstream component of ER stress-associated cell death. Unfolded Protein Response Is Followed by the Release of ROS during ER Stress—Because BI-1 expression reduced the level of ER stress-associated ROS accumulation and/or the generation (Fig. 2), we examined expression of several ER stress-inducible UPR proteins. ER stress-related proteins include GRP78, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), phospho-eIF-2 α, eIF-2α, phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), 1 and 2 (p54 and p46), JNK1, IRE-1α, and CHOP expression-related transcription factors, XBP-1 and ATF-6. During ER stress, increases occur in the expression of protective intra-ER molecular chaperone GRP78, which is intended to compensate for damage (4Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To determine whether the protection afforded by BI-1 is upstream or downstream of these events, expression of GRP78 was monitored by immunoblotting in the presence of thapsigargin or tunicamycin. ER stress induced comparable increases in the GRP78 protein levels in Neo cells, which is indicative of ER stress. However, the expression of GRP78 in BI-1 cells tended to be somewhat lower (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3BI-1 regulates the expression of ER stress-associated proteins. Neo and BI-1 cells were subjected to 5 μM thapsigargin or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h, and total proteins were extracted. SDS-PAGE was performed, and the expression of GRP78, CHOP, p-eIF-2α, eIF-2α, p-JNK (p54 and p46), JNK1, IRE1, XBP-1 ATF-6, and β-actin was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative blots for thapsigargin and tunicamycin are shown in A (upper panel) and B (upper panel), respectively. C, Neo and BI-1 cells were pretreated with 1 mm NAC or GSH and then exposed to 5 μM thapsigargin or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 6 h. The total proteins were extracted. The expression of the ER stress proteins was measured as shown A and B (upper panels). A–C, lower panels, the expression of GRP78, CHOP, IRE1, XBP-1, and ATF-6 was normalized to that of β-actin, the expression of p-eIF-2α was normalized to eIF-2α, and the expression of p-JNK was normalized to JNK1 as a relative ratio. The data shown represent the means ± S.E. (n = 4). A–C,*, p < 0.05, significantly different from the amount of expressed proteins in the Neo cells under each of the indicated conditions. THAP, thapsigargin; TUN, tunicamycin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CHOP is a transcription factor whose expression is induced during ER stress and that participates in ER-mediated apoptosis (18Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Deregulated CHOP activity compromises cell viability, whereas cells lacking CHOP are significantly protected from the lethal consequences of ER stress (19Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). When assessed by immunoblot analysis in Neo and BI-1 cells, the CHOP protein became elevated in the Neo cells but was barely detectable in the BI-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Recently, inhibitors of tunicamycin-induced neuronal death were shown to suppress protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of eIF-2α on serine 51, thereby increasing the accumulation of phospho-eIF-2α and providing protection from apoptosis induced by several inducers of ER stress (20Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phospho-eIF-2α was strongly expressed in the Neo cells but was only slightly detectable in the BI-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In ER stress, JNK phosphorylates and enhances CHOP transcription and pro-apoptotic activity (21Bailly-Maitre B. Fondevila C. Kaldas F. Droin N. Luciano F. Ricci J.E. Croxton R. Krajewska M. Zapata J. Kupiec-Weglinski J. Farmer D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2809-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, the status of JNK in Neo and BI-1 cells before and after ER stress was examined using the phospho-specific JNK antibody. After ER stress, the level of phospho-JNK increased significantly in Neo cells, whereas little phospho-JNK was detected in the BI-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The Neo and BI-1 cells showed no change in the total levels of the JNK protein, as revealed by the phospho-independent antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). Additional ER stress-related proteins are IRE1 protein kinase and ATF-6 (21Bailly-Maitre B. Fondevila C. Kaldas F. Droin N. Luciano F. Ricci J.E. Croxton R. Krajewska M. Zapata J. Kupiec-Weglinski J. Farmer D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2809-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Activated IRE1 protein kinase is essential for splicing the XBP-1 mRNA (22Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar), and the spliced variant is a potent transcriptional activator. ATF-6 is also cleaved during ER stress, and its cytosolic domain (ATF-6(N)) translocates to the nucleus. Therefore, the changes in IRE1α, XBP-1, and ATF-6 in the Neo and BI-1 cells were examined before and after ER stress. After treating the cells with thapsigargin or tunicamycin, the expression of IRE1α and the resulting XBP-1 spliced form were increased in the Neo cells. The expression of IRE1α was also induced in BI-1-overexpressing cells, although not quite as much. However, expression of XBP-1 spliced isoform was markedly reduced in BI-1 cells compared with Neo cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The level of uncleaved ATF-6 (p90) was also lower in the Neo cells but levels of full-length ATF-6 remained unchanged in the BI-1 cells under ER stress (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, these results suggest that BI-1 modulates the activity of all three major pathways for ER stress signaling in HT-1080 cells, including PERK, IRE-1α, and ATF-6. The above-mentioned UPR proteins were also analyzed in HT1080 cells that had been preincubated with either 1 mm NAC or GSH. These pretreatments had no effect on the expression of CHOP and the other UPR proteins (Fig. 3C), indicating that the release of ROS may be a product of ER stress-induced UPR but not an initiating messenger of UPR. The time course of ROS accumulation was examined. The ROS was delayed relating to UPR markers (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, ROS appears to be a down-stream consequence of UPR. The BI-1 Increases the Expression of Heme Oxygenase-1 through Nrf-2—The level of ROS accumulation/generation is lower in the cells overexpressing BI-1 (Fig. 2). Therefore, we considered whether BI-1 could regulate the expression of the ROS scavenging protein. First, the activity of a transcription factor, Nrf-2 was determined. Nrf-2 is known to be a redox-sensitive transcription factor ("

The factors mediating EE effects on visual cortical development and plasticity are still unclear. We have investigated whether IGF-1 is involved in mediating EE effects on the developing visual cortex. We show that EE increases the number of IGF-1 positive neurons in the visual cortex at P18. Increasing IGF-1 in the visual cortex of non-EE rats by means of osmotic minipumps implanted at P18 mimics EE effects, accelerating visual acuity development, assessed with Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs). Blocking IGF-1 action in the visual cortex of EE rats by means of the IGF-1 receptor antagonist JB1 from P18 completely blocks EE action on visual acuity development. These results show that IGF-1 is a key factor mediating EE effects on visual cortical development. We then show that IGF-1 affects GAD65 immunoreactivity in perisomatic innervation and the condensation of Chondroitin Sulphate Proteoglycans (CSPGs) in perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the visual cortex. This suggests that IGF-1 action in mediating EE effects could be exerted through the modulation of intracortical inhibitory circuitry and PNN development."

Thus, selenoprotein H is a redox-responsive DNA-binding protein of the AT-hook family and functions in regulating expression levels of genes involved in de novo glutathione synthesis and phase II detoxification in response to redox status. Selenium has long been known for its antioxidant properties, and accumulated evidence indicates that many of the beneficial effects of this trace element in our diet are attributable to selenoenzymes. The functions of selenoenzymes include protecting cell membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids from cumulative oxidative damage and maintaining cellular redox balance. Selenium is highly retained in neuronal tissue during selenium deficiency (1Behne D. Hilmert H. Scheid S. Gessner H. Elger W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 996: 12-21Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the functions of selenoproteins in the brain are highlighted by the development of neurological defects in mice that underwent targeted disruption of selenoprotein P, a selenium transport protein whose functions may also include antioxidant defense and heavy metal chelation (2Schomburg L.

To date, 25 selenoprotein genes have been identified in the human genome (4Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), but the functions of many of them are yet to be fully defined.

In previous studies we and others showed that D. melanogaster SelH is required for viability, and overexpression of the protein increased antioxidant capacity in Drosophila embryo-derived Schneider S2 cells when exposed to homocysteic acid-induced GSH depletion (5Morozova N.

Two recent studies have begun to investigate the functions of human SelH. We reported that overexpression of human SelH protects against UV-induced cell death via a decrease in superoxide levels (7Ben Jilani K.E. Panee J. He Q. Berry M.J. Li P.A. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2007; 3: 198-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A study employing bioinformatic analysis and gene silencing identified a thioredoxin-fold motif in SelH and demonstrated a protective role for the protein against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (8Novoselov S.V. Kryukov G.V. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11960-11968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the function of SelH in neuronal cells against oxidative stress induced by GSH depletion. Murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were engineered to stably overexpress human SelH and subjected to l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) treatment to inactivate γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis. The effects of BSO treatment on antioxidant parameters and gene expression were assessed in SelH-overexpressing and vector control HT22 cells. These studies revealed that expression of SelH protected intracellular GSH and antioxidant levels and increased expression of key enzymes in GSH biosynthesis and in phase II detoxification. To gain insight into how SelH might up-regulate expression of these genes, the deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed using ExPASy analysis tools. The SelH sequence contains multiple nuclear localization signals, and we show that the protein localizes predominantly to the nucleus. Alignment with known members of the high mobility group (HMG) family of DNA-binding proteins revealed the presence of an AT-hook DNA-binding motif. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using a GFP-SelH fusion protein and antibodies to GFP revealed binding to sequences containing multiple heat shock or stress response elements. These findings identify SelH as a redox-sensing DNA-binding protein that up-regulates transcription of genes involved in antioxidant defense and phase II detoxification. Cell Maintenance and Sample Harvesting—All of the cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, with 4 mml-glutamine supplement at 5% CO2 and ∼50% relative humidity. The selenium concentration in the serum-supplemented medium used in this study was ∼56 nm, as determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of the serum. Cells in 100 mm cell culture dishes were subjected to BSO treatment when the optical confluency reached ∼90%. After treatment, the dishes were transferred onto ice, and the medium was aspirated. The cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized, and then suspended in 2 ml of fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. 10 μl of cell suspension was taken out in duplicate for counting cell numbers, and 1900 μlof cell suspension were transferred into centrifuge tubes. The cell pellets were harvested by centrifuging at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After the supernatant was removed, suitable amounts of cold PBS were added to pellets to give a concentration of 5.0 × 107 cells/ml. The samples were then sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and stored at –80 °C until assay. The samples were used for assays of total intracellular GSH, total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant enzyme activity. For reverse transcription real time PCR assays, HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cells were maintained in normal cell culture conditions until 80–90% optical confluency and then either harvested for RNA extraction or treated with BSO before RNA harvesting. RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) were used for RNA extraction. hSelH Transfection—The hSelH clone was purchased from Invitrogen and subcloned into pMSCVpuro retroviral vector purchased from BD Biosciences. Packaging cells (RetroPack PT67, BD Biosciences) were plated in 60-mm dishes at 70% optical confluency 12 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) mixed with 2 μg of hSelH-MSCV retroviral vector or empty MSCV vector. Culture medium was aspirated 4 h after transfection. PT67 cells were washed twice with PBS and allowed to grow for 24 h in 3 ml of complete medium. The cells were selected in puromycin, with the concentration of puromycin optimized to kill the nontransfected control PT67 cells in 7–10 days. Transfected PT67 cells that survived the puromycin selection stably produced virus. For viral infection of target cells, HT22 cells were plated 12 h before infection at ∼70% optical confluency. The medium from transfected PT67 cells containing virus was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and added to the HT22 cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Virus-containing medium was replaced after 24 h of incubation. After infection for 48 h, the target cells were subjected to puromycin selection, with uninfected cells as selection control. Selection lasted for ∼10 days, until all of the uninfected control cells were killed. The cells that survived the selection made up the HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cell lines. 75Se Labeling of SelH—HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cell lines were labeled by the addition of neutralized [75Se]selenious acid (3 μCi/ml; specific activity, 1,000 Ci/mmol), followed by incubation for 36 h. The cells were harvested, and nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates were prepared using a compartment protein extraction kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins were separated on a 10–14.5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose Hybond C-extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences), followed by phosphorimaging using a CycloneTM Storage phosphor screen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reverse Transcription Real Time PCR—cDNAs were synthesized from RNA extracts using SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Sequences of forward and reverse primers for real time PCR of the housekeeping genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGAPDH) and hypoxanthine phosphoribsyl-transferase (mHPRT) and for target genes are given in Table 1. All of the PCRs were performed in 10-μl reaction volumes using a Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit from Invitrogen. Amplification and detection were carried out using a LightCycler 2.0 real time PCR machine (Roche Applied Science).TABLE 1Reverse transcription real time-PCR primers used for cDNA amplificationmGAPDH forward5′-TGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′mGAPDH reverse5′-CCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTC-3′mHPRT1 forward5′-TCCTCCTCAGACCGCTTTT-3′mHPRT1 reverse5′-CCTGGTTCATCATCGCTAATC-3′hSelH forward5′-GCTTCCAGTAAAGGTGAACCCG-3′hSelH reverse5′-ACCCAAATCTCCCTACGACAGG-3′mSelH forward5′-GGAAGAAAGCGTAAGGCGGG-3′mSelH reverse5′-GGTTTGGACGGGTTCACTTGC-3′mGCS-HC forward5′-ATGATAGAACACGGGAGGAGAG-3′mGCS-HC reverse5′-TGATCCTAAAGCGATTGTTCTTC-3′mGCS-LC forward5′-TGACTCACAATGACCCGAAA-3′mGCS-LC reverse5′-GATGCTTTCTTGAAGAGCTTCCT-3′mGSTo1 forward5′-CAGCGATGTCGGGAGAAT-3′mGSTo1 reverse5′-GGCAGAACCTCATGCTGTAGA-3′mGSTa2 forward5′-TCTGACCCCTTTCCCTCTG-3′mGSTa2 reverse5′-GCTGCCAGGATGTAGGAACT-3′mGSTa4 forward5′-CCCCTGTACTGTCCGACTTC-3′mGSTa4 reverse5′-GGAATGTTGCTGATTCTTGTCTT-3′ Open table in a new tab GSH and Total Antioxidant Capacity Measurements—Total intracellular GSH assays were carried out using the GSH/GSSG-412 TM assay kit from Oxis following the instructions of the manufacturer. The Fe3+-reducing ability was measured by the ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) procedure with modification (9Benzie I.F.F. Strain J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14582) Google Scholar). The reagent contained 0.83 mm TPTZ (2, 4, 6-tri-pyridyl-s-triazine) and 1.67 mm ferric chloride in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 3.6). A 30-μl volume of sample was mixed with 370 μl of reagent and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Reduction of Fe3+-TPTZ to Fe2+-TPTZ was monitored by the absorbance increase at 595 nm by spectrophotometry. Trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue, was used as standard. The results are expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). The 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging ability was measured by the ABTS method described by Pellegrini et al. (10Pellegrini N. Re R. Yang M. Rice-Evans C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 379-389Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). To prepare the ABTS radical, an ABTS solution was oxidized in water by potassium persulfate (molar ratio = 1:0.35) for 12–16 h in the dark and then diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) prior to assay, giving an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 730 nm. A 2-μl volume of sample was added to 398 μl of reagent, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Scavenging of the ABTS radical was then monitored by the absorbance decrease at 730 nm. Trolox was used as standard, and the results were expressed as TEAC. The Cu2+-reducing ability of samples was measured using an antioxidant potential (AOP) assay kit (Oxis). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed except that Trolox was used as standard, and the results were expressed as TEAC. Antioxidant Enzyme Activity Assays—GPx activity assay was based on the classical principle (11Paglia D. Valentine W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar) with optimization to the HT22 cell lysate. The peroxide used in this study was t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.32 mm), the concentration of GSH was reduced to 1.88 mm, and the pH of the assay was increased to 7.6. The unit of GPx activity was defined as 1 milliunit = 1 nmol of NADPH oxidized per min. Glutathione reductase (GR) activity assay measured the GR-catalyzed reduction of GSSG to GSH, using NADPH as the electron donor. A 390-μl volume of reagent containing GSSG in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA buffer at pH 7.4 was mixed with 10 μl of sample and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and then NADPH was added to initiate the reaction. The final concentrations of GSSG and NADPH were 0.94 and 0.25 mm, respectively. The decrease of absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 3 min, and the slope was calculated. The unit of GR activity was defined as that of GPx. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells on slides were mounted in mounting medium containing 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) to visualize nuclei and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to visualize filamentous actin. Epifluorescence was performed using an Olympus IX71 micro-scope with an Olympus U-CMAD3 camera and MicroFire 1.0 software (Optronics). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using an adaptation of the method of Kuo and Allis (12Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). SelH was fused to GFP in the pEGFP-C3 vector (BD Biosciences). GFP-SelH or GFP-vector was expressed in HEK-293 cells by transient transfection using Trans IT-LT1 reagent (Mirus-Bio Company). Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were cross-linked with 1% formamide at 37 °C for 10–15 min, and the reactions were terminated with 0.125 m glycine buffer at room temperature for 5 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were harvested and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were incubated for 10–15 min on ice with pipetting to aid in release of nuclei. The pelleted nuclear fraction was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) plus complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclear lysates were sonicated for four pulses of 10 s and 40% amplitude, resulting in fragmentation of DNA to a size range of ∼100–500 bp. Nuclear extract was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes; catalogue number 11122) using 0.2 μgof antibody/pull-down. For negative antibody control, an aliquot of cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum instead of a specific antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and used for cloning in pJET vector (Fermentas). Statistical Work—GraphPad Prism 4 software was used for t test and two-way ANOVA assay. A p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. Expression Level of hSelH in Stably Transformed Cells after Retroviral Infection—The expression levels of hSelH and mSelH were monitored by reverse transcription real time PCR in HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cells growing in normal culture conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 1A. The hSelH gene was highly expressed following stable transfection, with expression levels ∼34-fold higher than the expression levels of endogenous mSelH. As expected, the mRNA level of hSelH in HT22-vector cells was not detectable. The mRNA level of endogenous mSelH is ∼10% higher in HT22-hSelH cells than in HT22-vector cells. Protein expression as detected by labeling with [75Se]selenious acid is shown in Fig. 1B. Total Intracellular GSH Level—When cells were maintained in normal culture conditions at optical confluency of 80–90%, the total intracellular GSH level of HT22-hSelH was 7.76 ± 0.23 nmol/million cells, and that of HT22-vector cells was 9.06 ± 0.82 nmol/million cells (average ± S.D. from three independent experiments). No significant difference was detected. However, after treatment with concentrations of BSO ranging from 0.03 to 10 mm for 15 h, the GSH level was better maintained in the HT22-hSelH cells than in the HT22-vector cells (Fig. 2A). Antioxidant Enzyme Activities—GPxs are selenoproteins that reduce peroxides using GSH as the electron donor, whereas GR is an enzyme that reduces GSSG to GSH. The influence of SelH expression level on the activities of these two GSH-related enzymes was investigated. Reverse transcription real time PCR analysis indicates that the mRNAs for Gpx1 and Gpx4 are abundant in HT22 cells, whereas the mRNAs for GPx2, GPx3, and GPx6 are below the limits of detection (data not shown). Thus, the majority of the GPx activity measured in the present study likely derives from GPx1 and GPx4. The baseline GPx activities in HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cells did not significantly differ from one another. After treatment with BSO for 15 h, the GPx activity in hSelH-HT22 increased to 109.7 ± 1.3% of the untreated control at 0.03 mm BSO, whereas that in vector-HT22 cells decreased to 89.3 ± 9.4% (average ± S.D. from three independent experiments, p value = 0.0204). GPx activities in the hSelH-HT22 versus vector-HT22 cells were not significantly different after treatment with higher BSO concentrations (data not shown). However, when the incubation time was decreased to 4, 8, or 12 h, 0.1 mm BSO treatment resulted in higher GPx activities in HT22-hSelH cells than in HT22-vector cells (Fig. 2B). GR is the enzyme that reduces GSSG to GSH, the reducing substrate for GPx. Similar to GPx, the base-line activities of GR were comparable in the two cell lines. After treatment with 0.03 mm BSO for 15 h, the GR activity in hSelH-HT22 cells increased to 111.7 ± 3.7% of the untreated control, whereas that in the vector-HT22 cells was 99.1 ± 6.5% of the untreated control (average ± S.D., three independent experiments, p = 0.0432). Total Antioxidant Capacities—The FRAP method measures the ferric-reducing ability of samples at pH 3.6, when GSH and other thiol compounds are inactivated as antioxidants, and most proteins are precipitated. Thus, the FRAP value reflects the total antioxidant capacity from nonthiol, low molecular weight compounds. Under normal cell culture conditions, the FRAP values of HT22-hSelH and HT22-vector cells were not significantly different. However, when the cells were challenged with 0.03, 0.1, 1, or 10 mm BSO for 15 h, the FRAP values of the hSelH-HT22 increased to 125, 108, 106, and 106% of the untreated control level, whereas those of the HT22-vector cells decreased to 99, 89, 90, and 80% of the untreated control level (data not shown). The ABTS assay reflects the potential of a sample to scavenge ABTS radicals. When cultured in the absence of BSO, no significant difference in the ABTS values of the two cell lines was observed. When GSH synthesis was blocked with 0.03–10 mm BSO for 15 h, the ABTS value gradually decreased as the BSO concentration increased and maintained slightly (∼5%) but consistently higher in HT22-hSelH cells in comparison with the vector control (data not shown). AOP value is a measure of Cu2+-reducing ability of cell lysates. In the absence of BSO, no difference in AOP value was detected between the two cell lines. After treatment with 0.03–10 mm BSO for 15 h, the AOP value of the HT22-hSelH cells was decreased to ∼80% of the untreated control level throughout the dosage range, whereas that of HT22-vector was decreased to the range of 74–67% when the BSO concentration was increased from 0.03 to 10 mm (Fig. 3A). Treatment with 0.1 mm BSO for 4–15 h produced a decrease in AOP value in the HT22-hSelH cells to the range of 86–76% of untreated control, whereas that of the HT22-vector cells was maintained at ∼70% of the control level (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of SelH Induced the Expression Levels of Other Genes—GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in de novo GSH synthesis. It consists of GCS-HC and GCS-LC, the catalytic and regulatory subunits, respectively. GCS-HC and -LC mRNA levels were measured in the HT22-SelH and HT22-vector cell lines after treatment with varying concentrations of BSO for 15 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Overexpression of SelH resulted in increases in the mRNA levels for both subunits throughout the range of BSO concentrations. GSTs are important enzymes involved in phase II detoxification. We examined the influence of SelH overexpression on the mRNA levels of GST Alpha and Omega subfamilies. GSTo1 expression levels in HT22-hSelH cells were more than twice the levels in HT22-vector cells but were not influenced by treatment with 0–1 mm BSO (Fig. 4C). The mRNAs for GSTα2 and α4 were ∼20–40% higher in HT22-SelH cells than in HT22-vector cells (data not shown). After treatment with 0–10 mm BSO for 15 h, endogenous mSelH expression was quantitated in the two cell lines (Fig. 4D). In the absence of BSO, the mSelH mRNA expression level was slightly higher in the HT22-hSelH cells than in the control cells. Low concentration of BSO reduced mSelH mRNA levels in HT22-hSelH cells to the same levels as in the HT22-vector cells. With higher concentrations of BSO, HT22-hSelH cells exhibited 40–60% higher mSelH expression levels than HT22-vector cells. Selenoprotein H Contains an HMG-type DNA-binding Domain—The increased levels of the mRNAs for the GCS subunits, GSTs, and murine SelH in HT22-SelH versus HT22-vector cells led us to examine the deduced amino acid sequences of SelH genes for domains that might explain these results. The alignment of seven sequences and predicted secondary structures are shown in Fig. 5A. Four putative nuclear localization signals, beginning at amino acids 3, 7, 71, and 101 in the human sequence, were identified using the PSORT II algorithm and found to be conserved among all species examined. Transient expression of a GFP-SelH fusion protein resulted in predominantly nuclear localization (Fig. 5B). Using ExPASy analysis tools and alignment with the ∼380 known members of the HMG family of DNA-binding proteins, we identified an AT-hook motif that exhibits high conservation among the mammalian and avian SelH sequences (Fig. 5C). The AT-hook is a small DNA-binding protein motif consisting of a semi-conserved 9 amino acid sequence. Because of the small size of the semi-conserved region, AT-hook motifs are difficult to detect by conventional sequence similarity searches (13Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the predicted DNA-binding domain of SelH exhibited specificity in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using a GFP-SelH fusion protein and antibodies to GFP. Following transient transfection of HEK-293 cells, GFP-SelH and GFP-vector transfected cells were formamide cross-linked, and the nuclei were prepared. The nuclear lysates were sonicated to shear DNA, and DNA-protein complexes immunoprecipitated. DNA fragments were subcloned for further characterization. After pull-down with GFP-SelH, 192 clones were obtained. Of these, 34 were characterized, and five were found to contain no insert. Of the remaining 29 clones, 20 had one or more heat shock elements (HSEs) or stress response elements (STREs). Thirteen had multiple HSEs, two had multiple STREs, and seven had both HREs and STREs. The remaining nine clones containing neither HSEs nor STREs were all small in size, ranging from 10 to 28 bp (results summarized in Table 2). Thus, more than two-thirds of the immunoprecipitated fragments had HSEs or STREs, and the remaining third that did not consisted of small DNA fragments. The control pull-down with GFP-vector resulted in 32 clones, of which 10 were characterized. One contained a single HSE, one contained two HSEs, and the remaining eight contained no insert. Pull-down with preimmune antisera immunoprecipitated no colonies.TABLE 2Chromatin immunoprecipitation of heat shock and stress response elements with selenoprotein HNo. of clonesHSESTREFragment sizesBinding proteinbp310220, 50, 50GFP-SelH320190, 100, 30530290, 195, 145, 140, 70140150101190311145, 75, 7012315514114017111017219090028, 20, 12, 10 (six clones)5No insert11060GFP-vector120658No insert Open table in a new tab The GCS-HC is well known to be regulated by HSE and STRE elements in its promoter (14Takamura Y. Fatma N. Kubo E. Singh D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (–C566): C554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and alignment of these sequences with the HSE and STRE sequences pulled down by GFP-SelH revealed significant conservation in these elements (Fig. 6), supporting a direct role for SelH in regulating expression of GCS-HC via these elements. HT22 is a neuronal cell line that is highly sensitive to GSH depletion (15Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The expression level of endogenous mSelH was relatively low in HT22 cells; thus, introducing the hSelH gene resulted in significant overexpression of SelH. In the absence of induced oxidative stress, no significant differences in total intracellular GSH, total antioxidant capacity, and GPx and GR activities were observed between SelH-overexpressing and vector control cells, possibly because of homeostatic control of critical factors that influence the redox status of the cells, such as GSH. Regulation of the enzymatic activity of GCS, the key enzyme involved in GSH synthesis, occurs through multiple mechanisms. The heavy chain is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including post-translational regulation (16Lu S.C. FASEB. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Build-up of GSH also acts to feedback-inhibit the enzymatic activity of GCS, thereby helping to ensure homeostatic control over GSH synthesis (17Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular antioxidants consist of a large variety of molecules. Assessing total antioxidant capacity requires evaluating multiple contributing compounds in the system. Therefore, we used multidimensional assays (18Prior R.L. Wu X. Schaich K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005; 53: 4290-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar). SelH overexpression maintained higher total antioxidant capacity values during BSO treatment, but the profiles of the change of total antioxidant capacity differed, indicating that SelH overexpression had a different influence on different categories of antioxidant under BSO-induced oxidative stress. This study reveals that SelH exerts profound gene regulatory function and that this function is influenced by cellular redox status, i.e. BSO-mediated GSH depletion. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), the expression levels of GCS-HC and -LC are influenced by both SelH overexpression and BSO-induced oxidative stress. The transcriptional regulation of GCS-HC occurs via several response elements, including AP-1, NF-κB, HSE, STRE, xenobiotic response element, and antioxidant response elements, also termed electrophile response elements (ARE/EpRE) (19Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Similarly, GCS-LC is also regulated by AP-1 and ARE/EpRE (20Wild A.C. Mulcahy R.T. Free Rad. Res. 1999; 32: 281-301Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The identification of an AT-hook in SelH, and the demonstration via chromatin immunoprecipitation that SelH pulls down HSE and STRE-containing sequences, in conjunction with the up-regulation of GCS-HC and LC by SelH in response to BSO, supports a function for SelH as a redox-responsive DNA-binding protein of the HMG family. The AT-hook motif binds to the minor groove of DNA via a semi-conserved 9-amino acid sequence. Proteins containing this motif are implicated in chromatin structure and as transcription accessory factors. Thus, SelH may potentially serve as a cellular redox sensor that functions in conjunction with some of the many transcription factors that respond to changes in redox status. GSH depletion and general oxidative stress have been widely reported in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson disease, and cancers. Selenium supplementation was found to sustain the GSH levels in the striatum in mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (21Zafar K.S. Siddiqui A. Sayeed I. Ahmad M. Salim S. Islam F. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our unpublished data show that the mRNA levels of mSelH in HT22 cells are highly up-regulated by selenium supplementation; therefore, a possible contribution of the gene regulatory function of SelH should be considered in interpreting potential beneficial effects of selenium supplementation in chronic diseases of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2068687827,"This study reports the effect of loading four different charged designer lipid-like short anionic and cationic peptide surfactants on the fully hydrated monoolein (MO)-based Pn3m phase (Q(224)). The studied peptide surfactants comprise seven amino acid residues, namely A(6)D, DA(6), A(6)K, and KA(6). D (aspartic acid) bears two negative charges, K (lysine) bears one positive charge, and A (alanine) constitutes the hydrophobic tail. To elucidate the impact of these peptide surfactants, the ternary MO/peptide/water system has been investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), within a certain range of peptide concentrations (R<or=0.2) and temperatures (25 to 70 degrees C). We demonstrate that the bilayer curvature and the stability are modulated by: i) the peptide/lipid molar ratio, ii) the peptide molecular structure (the degree of hydrophobicity, the type of the hydrophilic amino acid, and the headgroup location), and iii) the temperature. The anionic peptide surfactants, A(6)D and DA(6), exhibit the strongest surface activity. At low peptide concentrations (R = 0.01), the Pn3m structure is still preserved, but its lattice increases due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged peptide molecules, which are incorporated into the interface. This means that the anionic peptides have the effect of enlarging the water channels and thus they serve to enhance the accommodation of positively charged water-soluble active molecules in the Pn3m phase. At higher peptide concentration (R = 0.10), the lipid bilayers are destabilized and the structural transition from the Pn3m to the inverted hexagonal phase (H(2)) is induced. For the cationic peptides, our study illustrates how even minor modifications, such as changing the location of the headgroup (A(6)K vs. KA(6)), affects significantly the peptide's effectiveness. Only KA(6) displays a propensity to promote the formation of H(2), which suggests that KA(6) molecules have a higher degree of incorporation in the interface than those of A(6)K."

HDL generation is also responsible for release of cellular cholesterol. In peripheral cells ABCA1 is up-regulated by the liver X receptor (LXR) system when cell cholesterol increases. However, cholesterol feeding has failed to show a significant increase in hepatic ABCA1 gene expression, and its expression is up-regulated by statins (3-hydroy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), suggesting distinct regulation. In this study we investigated the mechanism of regulation of the rat hepatic ABCA1 gene and identified two major ABCA1 transcripts and two corresponding promoter regions. Compactin activated the novel liver-type promoter in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells by binding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). In contrast, compactin repressed the previously identified peripheral-type promoter in an LXR-responsive element-dependent but not E-box-dependent manner. Thus, compactin increased the liver-type transcript and decreased the peripheral-type transcript. The same two transcripts were also dominant in human and mouse livers, whereas the intestine contains only the peripheral-type transcript. Treatment of rats with pravastatin and a bile acid binding resin (colestimide), which is known to activate SREBP-2 in the liver, caused a reduction in the hepatic cholesterol level and the same differential responses in vivo, leading to increases in hepatic ABCA1 mRNA and protein and plasma HDL levels. We conclude that the dual promoter system driven by SREBP-2 and LXR regulates hepatic ABCA1 expression and may mediate the unique response of hepatic ABCA1 gene expression to cellular cholesterol status.

Our preliminary experiments showed that ABCA1 mRNA expression in the rat liver was increased by the treatment with a statin (pravastatin) and a bile acid binding resin (colestimide). The combination of a statin and bile acid binding resin has been shown to potently deplete hepatic cholesterol and increase the amount of mature nuclear SREBP-2 but not of SREBP-1c (27Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12354-12359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is a transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake in response to cellular cholesterol levels. Rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells have been shown to mimic the behavior of SREBPs in the liver, and they have been used an in vitro model (29DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because our preliminary data also showed that ABCA1 mRNA expression was decreased by sterols in McARH7777 cells, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying these unique responses. As a result, we succeeded in identifying a novel promoter region that mediates the liver-specific cholesterol response of ABCA1. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—The 5′ RACE was carried out with the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen), which amplifies only full-length transcripts via elimination of truncated messages, and total RNAs from rat liver and intestine, McARH7777 cells, mouse liver, or human liver (Clontech, #64022-1) were used as templates. The double-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed with random primers. To obtain 5′ ends, the first-strand cDNA was amplified using the GeneRacer™ 5′ primer and a reverse gene-specific primer, which is located at exon 4/5 (gagaataggcgggacacaatggactt for rat ABCA1, gagaacaggcgagacacgatggacttg for mouse ABCA1, or gagaacaggcgagccacaatggatttg for human ABCA1). The amplified products were subcloned and sequenced. Plasmid—The type P (–1040/+18) and type L (–950/+123) ABCA1 promoter fragments were amplified by using rat tail genomic DNA as a template. The primers for the PCR amplifications were designed based on the nucleotide sequences (type P forward, aaacgcgtccatctctccgcaactgta; type P reverse, ctaagatcttcgctcgctctcggaatta; type L forward, aaacgcgtctcctattccaaagccac; type L reverse, caaagcttcttaactgagaccaacaagccat). The amplicons were subcloned into the firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Deletional mutants of the type L promoter (–726,–429,–224/+125) were prepared by enzymatic digestion. Site-directed mutagenesis of the construct was accomplished by using the QuikChange™ sitedirect mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and two pairs of oligonucleotides containing mutations (mut-SREa, accagGCggCCgCtagag; mut-SREb, ggtgtGCggCCGCagggt; mut-LXRE, gtttgTGTggtagtaacTAcggcg; mut-Ebox, ctccaAAtgctt) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A luciferase-reporter plasmid driven by four tandem repeats of the LXR response element (LXRE) (LXREx4-Luc) has been described previously (30Nishimaki-Mogami T. Une M. Fujino T. Sato Y. Tamehiro N. Kawahara Y. Shudo K. Inoue K. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1538-1545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression vector of the nuclear form of SREBP-2, pSREBP-2 (1–481), was generated as described elsewhere (31Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and mRNA Analysis—The rat hepatoma cell line McARH7777 and the rat fibroblast cell line Rat2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. To evaluate the effect of various reagents on mRNA expression, cells were treated in medium containing 10% delipidated serum and the appropriate additions for 16 h. Gene-specific mRNA quantitation was performed by realtime PCR on an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) or from the liver with the RNeasy Lipid Tissue mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase to eliminate genomic DNA contamination according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The relative expression levels of mRNA were determined with the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagent Kit. The primer/probe sequences used were: rat total ABCA1 forward (cccggcggagtagaaagg), reverse (agggcgatgcaaacaaagac), probe (6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-tctttgctcagattgtcctgccggc-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)); rat type P ABCA1 forward (tctgctccctgtccccac), reverse (ccaacccctacacaaaccct), probe (FAM-ccctacttttttctcccggtttctgg-TAMRA); rat HMG-CoA synthase forward (gtagatgctggaaagtataccattgg), reverse (tcgcgatccgtgcagaa), probe (FAM-tgggccaggccaggatggg-TAMRA), rat SREBP-1c forward (ggagccatggattgcacatt), reverse (cctgtctcacccccagcata), probe (FAM-cagctcatcaacaaccaagacagtgacttcc-TAMRA). To determine the relative abundance of total and type P ABCA1, we used a standard curve based on serial dilution of an ABCA1 cDNA containing two target sequences for the TaqMan primer probe. The 4447-bp standard cDNA was prepared by PCR amplification using the RT transcripts of rat mRNA as a template. The primer sequences were designed based on exon 1 (forward, gagcccacttctgtctctgcggctca) and exon 29 (reverse, actgctcgttatacatccagggttgaag). Cell Fractionation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis of ABCA1 was performed on the membrane fraction prepared from cells or tissues as described previously (19Suzuki S. Nishimaki-Mogami T.

The anti-ABCA1 antibodies used were gifts from Dr. Shinji Yokoyama (Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences) or Dr. Michael L. Fitzgerald and Dr. Mason W. Freeman (Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School). The membranes were reprobed with anti-transferrin receptor antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-calnexin antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies) for the loading controls. For analysis of SREBPs, cells were fractionated into nuclear extract and membrane pellet fractions as described (29DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Aliquots of extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody against SREBP-1 (2A4, MBL, Japan) or SREBP-2 (1D2, MBL, Japan). The signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and SupserSugnal West Femto substrate system (Pierce), and the intensities were quantified with a chemiluminescent image analyzer LAS3000 (Fujifilm). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—McARH7777 cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. For basal promoter assays, cells were transfected with 61 ng of firefly luciferase reporter DNA and 6.1 ng of Renilla luciferase vector (phRL-TK) (Promega) with Effectene (Qiagen). Six hours after transfection, cells were exposed for 16 h to the appropriate reagents in the medium containing 10% delipidated serum. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity in each well. RNA Interference against SREBP-2—McARH7777 cells were transiently transfected with the mixture of three different StealthRNAi (Invitrogen) specific for rat SREBP-2 gene (sence1 (ccauucugaccacaaugccgguaau), antisence1 (auuaccggcauuguggucagaaugg); sence2 (ggcuucuuggcuagcuacuucuuaa), anti-sence2 (uuaagaaugagcuagccaagaagcc); sence3 (gguccugguucagccucagauuauu), antisence3; (aauaaucugaggcugaaccaggacc)) or StealthRNAi negative control medium GC(Invitrogen) by using lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and they were incubated for 24 h. Transfection efficiency was monitored with a fluorescent oligonucleotide (BLOCK-IT fluorescent oligo; Invitrogen) and estimated to be 80–90%. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with the DIG Gel Shift Kit 2nd Generation (Roche Applied Science). The DIG-3′-end-labeled ABCA1 SRE fragment (ggtgtctggtgagagg) or human low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) SRE fragment (aaaatcaccccactgc) was incubated with the nuclear form of human SREBP-2 protein (1–418). The recombinant SREBP-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli with the pET-28b/SREBP-2 vector and purified as described previously (32Misawa K. Horiba T. Arimura N. Hirano Y. Inoue J. Emoto N. Shimano H.

In competition experiments, a 30- or 300-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides, such as intact or mutated (ggtgtGCggCCGCagg) ABCA1-SRE or LDLR-SRE, was added to the reaction mixture. SREBP-2-DNA complex was separated from free probe by 4% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences). The shifted bands were visualized with AP-conjugated DIG antibody by using the chemiluminescence substrate. Animals and Lipoprotein Analysis—Male Wistar rats (8 weeks of age, Charles River, Japan) were fed either standard rodent chow (MF diet; Oriental Yeast) or the same diet containing powdered 0.1% pravastatin (Sankyo Co., Japan) plus 0.4% cholestimide, a bile-acid-sequestering resin, (Mitsubishi Pharma Co.) for 8 days. Rats in the pravastatin/colestimide-supplemented group were given pravastatin (10 mg/kg) orally 6 h before the end of the treatment period. Rats had free access to diet and water throughout the period of the experiment. All animals were treated in accordance with the laboratory animal care guidelines of the National Institute of Health Sciences at Tokyo. Other Procedures and Statistics—The cholesterol content of plasma lipoproteins was analyzed with a dual detection HPLC system consisting of two tandem connected TSKgel Lipopropak XL columns (300 × 7.8-mm; Tosoh, Japan) at Skylight Biotech Inc (Akita, Japan). Cholesterol in the liver was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and total cholesterol was quantitatively determined by an enzymatic method (33Abe-Dohmae S. Ikeda Y. Matsuo M. Hayashi M.

However, compactin did not alter the ABCA1 mRNA level in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells (Fig. 1A, top). Notably, sterols (1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol) reduced the ABCA1 mRNA level (by 40%) in this cell line, but a synthetic LXR agonist, TO901317, increased it. Immunoblot analysis shows that ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression were similarly affected by these treatments (Fig. 1B). Liver Contains Two Types of ABCA1 mRNA—To investigate the mechanism of the unexpected response of hepatic ABCA1 mRNA expression to cellular cholesterol status, we performed 5′ RACE on the total RNA extracted from rat liver, intestine, and McARH7777 cells. The single major transcript present in rat intestine (Fig. 2A, left) contained a first exon of 222 bp followed by a second exon of 166 bp (Fig. 2, B and C), and they were 91% identical to mouse exon 1 and 2 (NM_013454). This also corresponded to a previously described ABCA1 transcript in human fibroblasts and macrophages (13Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

One transcript was identical to the intestinal transcript (type P). The second transcript (liver type; type L) lacked exon 1 but contained all of exon 2. The third transcript (type L′) in rat liver and McARH7777 cells also lacked exon 1 but contained a truncated 95 bp exon 2 that included the ATG translation start site (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 1, A and D). Two minor bands were detected in addition to these major bands. Mouse and human liver RNAs also contained two major ABCA1 transcripts corresponding to type P and type L, respectively (Fig. 2A, middle and right) (supplemental Fig. 1, B–D). The mouse L type transcript was identical to the previously described mouse transcript mExon 1b (34Singaraja R.R. James E.R. Crim J. Visscher H. Chatterjee A. Hayden M.R. J.

We used a real-time RT-PCR to quantitatively determine the relative expression levels of the two transcripts in different rat tissues (Fig. 2D). Total and type P ABCA1 transcripts were quantitated using two sets of specific TaqMan primer-probe targeting sequences in exons 28 and 29 (for total ABCA1 mRNA) and in exon 1 (for type P ABCA1 mRNA) (Fig. 2C), respectively, and a standard ABCA1 cDNA containing two target sequences. Type P transcript was present in all tissues but in relatively smaller amounts compared with the total ABCA1 transcript in the liver and kidney, suggesting an abundance of transcript(s) other than type P in these tissues. Based on the assumption that RT-PCR efficiencies were the same for the two sets of primer probes, the ratio of type P to total ABCA1 mRNA in the liver was calculated as 0.27. Compactin Diminishes Peripheral-type but Increases Liver-type ABCA1 mRNA Expression—5′ RACE PCR revealed that the treatment of McARH7777 cells with compactin diminished the type P transcript and increased the type L transcript (Fig. 2A, right). We used real-time RT-PCR to confirm these changes and to analyze the levels of the two transcripts quantitatively. As shown in Fig. 3A, compactin reduced the type P ABCA1 mRNA level by 97% but did not affect the total ABCA1 mRNA level. The ratio of type P to total transcripts in the control cells was 0.25 ± 0.05, and the increase in type L mRNA was assumed to be 30 ± 9%. Compactin treatment of McARH7777 cells also led to an increase in the mRNA level of the SREBP-2 target gene HMG-CoA synthase. SREBP-2 is a transcriptional factor that is cleaved to an active form in response to depletion of cellular cholesterol (35Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Bo"
https://openalex.org/W2024531852,"Identifying genes, whose expression is consistently altered by chromosomal gains or losses, is an important step in defining genes of biological relevance in a wide variety of tumour types. However, additional criteria are needed to discriminate further among the large number of candidate genes identified. This is particularly true for neuroblastoma, where multiple genomic copy number changes of proven prognostic value exist. We have used Affymetrix microarrays and a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to establish expression profiles and delineate copy number alterations in 30 primary neuroblastomas. Correlation of microarray data with patient survival and analysis of expression within rodent neuroblastoma cell lines were then used to define further genes likely to be involved in the disease process. Using this approach, we identify >1000 genes within eight recurrent genomic alterations (loss of 1p, 3p, 4p, 10q and 11q, 2p gain, 17q gain, and the MYCN amplicon) whose expression is consistently altered by copy number change. Of these, 84 correlate with patient survival, with the minimal regions of 17q gain and 4p loss being enriched significantly for such genes. These include genes involved in RNA and DNA metabolism, and apoptosis. Orthologues of all but one of these genes on 17q are overexpressed in rodent neuroblastoma cell lines. A significant excess of SNPs whose copy number correlates with survival is also observed on proximal 4p in stage 4 tumours, and we find that deletion of 4p is associated with improved outcome in an extended cohort of tumours. These results define the major impact of genomic copy number alterations upon transcription within neuroblastoma, and highlight genes on distal 17q and proximal 4p for downstream analyses. They also suggest that integration of discriminators, such as survival and comparative gene expression, with microarray data may be useful in the identification of critical genes within regions of loss or gain in many human cancers."

The potentiation of NR2B cleavage by Fyn is limited to cell surface receptors and is associated with calpain translocation to plasma membranes during NMDA receptor activation. Finally, reducing full-length NR2B by calpain does not decrease extrasynaptic NMDA receptor function, and truncated NR1/2B receptors similar to those generated by calpain have electrophysiological properties matching those of wild-type receptors.

The NR2B subunit is essential for both neonatal and mature NMDA receptors and is highly expressed in the entire embryonic brain and the adult forebrain (9Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. NeuroReport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, the major neonatal receptor is believed to contain two NR1 and two NR2B subunits, whereas the major receptor in more mature synapses probably contains two NR1 subunits, an NR2A subunit, and an NR2B subunit. Analysis of NR2B-null mice has suggested the physiological importance of NR2B, since the absence of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in NR2B–/– mice leads to perinatal death, whereas mice lacking NR2A, NR2C, and NR2D subtypes are viable (10Kutsuwada T.

Fyn, a Src family tyrosine kinase, phosphorylates Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 in the C-terminal domain of NR2B subunit in vitro, with Tyr-1336 and Tyr-1472 being the most readily phosphorylated sites in cell culture systems (23Nakazawa T.

A previous study limited to in vitro experiments suggested that Fyn and Src might regulate cleavage of NR2 subunits in opposing manners. Here, using in situ approaches in transfected cells and neurons, we have used molecular biological, physiological, and receptor trafficking approaches to show that phosphorylation of tyrosine residue Tyr-1336 by Fyn controls calpain-mediated proteolysis of NR2B without revealing any evidence for involvement of Src in situ. In addition, the effects of Fyn are modulated by NMDA receptor activation. This provides a novel mechanism through which Fyn regulates the NMDA receptor as part of a feedback loop. Materials—Glutamate and glycine were obtained from Sigma; dizocilpine (MK-801) was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Phe-aldehyde (MDL 28170), calpain inhibitor III (CalI3), calpain I, and 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-NR2B antibody (made to the N-terminal 251 amino acids) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA).

Anti-Fyn antibody, anti-Src antibody, and antibody to NR2B phospho-Tyr-1336, as well as pKD-Fyn-v6 and pKD-NegCon-v1, were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The following full-length cDNA constructs were gifts: Fyn Y531F from Dr. Tohru Tezuka (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP-102) from Dr. Richard L. Huganir (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), PSD-95 from Dr. David S. Bredt (University of California, San Francisco, CA), and SrcY527F from Dr. Michael W. Salter (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Site-directed Mutagenesis of NR2B—A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method was employed to generate the single amino acid mutants NR2BY1336F and NR2BY1472F. Wild-type NR2B in pRK7 was used as a template, and PCR was carried out for each mutant with a set of sense and antisense mutagenic primers (using the Stratagene QuikChange kit). PCR products were treated with DpnI restriction enzyme and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli (DH5α), and transformants harboring mutant constructs were identified. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing in the Molecular Biology Core of the Mental Retardation Research Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Truncated NR2B (designated NR2Bdel1036) was constructed using PCR by replacing the CelII fragment (bases 3102–4116) with a modified corresponding fragment in which the 5′ end contained two stop codons at base 3109 (amino acid 1037). NR2B in pRK7 was primed with 5′-AACACAGCCAGCTCAGCTAGTAGTACGGCAAGTTCTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGGTAGAGGGACTTGCTGAGCATGTAGCCGCTGCC-3′ to create this construct. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation and Transfection—An siRNA plasmid, pKD-Fyn-v6, specific for Fyn protein silencing, and a negative control plasmid for the siRNA, pKD-NegCon-v1, were amplified in DH5α cells and purified. HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate, and neurons were transfected via siIMPORTER™ transfection reagent (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instruction. We transfected 10 or 11 DIV neurons in 12-well plates with 500 ng of corresponding siRNA plasmid (pKD-Fyn-v6 or pKD-NegCon-v1), and Fyn protein expression was assessed 96 h after transfection (15–16 DIV) by immunoblotting. The species of the target for pKD-Fyn-V6 is human, but pKD-Fyn-V6 has a ∼95% sequence homology to Rat Fyn and has no homology to other known rodent genes (based on BLAST searches). In Vitro Phosphorylation and Proteolysis of NR2B by Purified Calpain I—Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK293 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into phosphorylation buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.4 μm Na2VO4, 500 μm ATP, 0.8 mm EGTA). Samples were briefly sonicated on ice, incubated at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate endogenous kinases and phosphatases, and then incubated with recombinant active Fyn protein (100 ng/ml) for 40 min at 30 °C. After phosphorylation, samples were incubated with 2 units/ml calpain I (Calbiochem) for 2 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing final concentrations of 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The reaction was stopped by an addition of SDS sample buffer, and the reaction mixtures were then loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Whole-cell Recording—Experiments were performed with standard whole-cell voltage clamp techniques using transfected HEK293 cells 12–24 h after transfection and rat embryonic hippocampal neurons maintained in culture for 17–21 days DIV. NMDA-evoked currents were recorded at room temperature using NMDA (100 μm) along with glycine (10 μm) in a Mg2+-free extracellular recording medium containing 500 nm tetrodotoxin, 155 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35. To examine NMDA receptor function, cells were voltage-clamped at –50 mV using an intrapipette solution containing 100 mm Trizma phosphate (dibasic), 28 mm Trizma base, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Mg-ATP, pH 7.35, 290 mosm/kg H2O. Each application was 2 s, and the interval between applications was more than 1 min to prevent current desensitization. Solution switching was carried out using an SF-77B fast step solution delivery device (Warner Instrument Co., Hamden, CT). Recording signals were amplified using an Axopatch-1D amplifier, filtered at 5 kHz, and then saved using an IBM PC running pCLAMP 8.01 software (Axon Instruments, Inc. Foster City, CA) for off-line analysis. NMDA, glutamate, and CalI3 were dissolved in extracellular solution. Some aliquots of CalI3 were solubilized in Me2SO; final Me2SO concentration was 0.001% (v/v). This concentration had no effect on whole-cell NMDA currents (data not shown). In order to observe the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated effects, synaptic NMDA receptors in hippocampal culture neurons were blocked with 50 μm bicuculline and 10 μm MK801 for 10 min. In addition, ifenprodil (10 μm) was used to confirm that NMDA receptor-mediated current in bicuculline/MK801-pretreated neurons was primarily from extrasynaptic NMDA receptor (since they contain primarily NR1/2B). To examine the pharmacological effect of ifenprodil on NMDA receptors, ifenprodil was preadministered to the recorded neurons alone for more than 30 s before neurons were co-applied with NMDA/glycine and ifenprodil. Since the effect of ifenprodil could not be washed away within 30 min (data not shown), only one neuron per culture dish was recorded during these experiments. Neuronal Cultures—Primary cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons from embryonic day 17–19 Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were prepared as described previously (16Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dong Y.N. Waxman E.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11035-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were dissected, gently minced, trypsinized (0.027%, 37 °C; 7% CO2 for 20 min), and then washed with 1× HBSS. Neurons were seeded to a density of 6 × 105 viable cells/35-mm culture dish or similar relative density onto 12-well plates or 60-mm culture dishes. All plates and culture dishes were coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml) prior to seeding neurons. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2, fed with neurobasal medium with B27 supplement, and the cultures were used at 17–21 DIV. Western Blotting Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described previously (16Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dong Y.N. Waxman E.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11035-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein content was estimated using BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein (15–20 μg/lane) were resolved on denaturing 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed; bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Reaction product levels were quantified by scanning densitometry using NIH Image 1.62 (available on the World Wide Web). Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were grown on tissue culture dishes in minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transfection was performed using calcium phosphate as previously described (25Grant E.R. Basckai B.J. Gallagher M.J. Kendrick S.L. Pritchett D.B. Kricka L. Pleasure D.P. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatments were performed 18–24 h following transfection. Ketamine (500 μm) was included in the media during transfection to prevent NMDA receptor activation as previously described (25Grant E.R. Basckai B.J. Gallagher M.J. Kendrick S.L. Pritchett D.B. Kricka L. Pleasure D.P. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Calcium Imaging—HEK293 cells were cotransfected with NR1, SAP-102, and GFP with NR2B wild type, NR2BY1336F, NR2BY1472F, or NR2Bdel1036 (NR2B truncated at amino acid 1036) each with or without FynY531F. Eighteen to twenty hours later, transfected cells were identified via green fluorescence protein fluorescence and selected for measurement of intracellular calcium responses. After loading with 5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution twice. Intracellular calcium was measured by a dual excitation wavelength method (340/380 nm) using a Nikon microscope in conjunction with Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) (26Lynch D.R. Shim S.S. Seifert K.M. Kurapathi S. Mutel V. Gallagher M.J. Guttmann R.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 416: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Biotinylation Assays—Surface biotinylation was used to assess receptor expression on the cell surface. HEK293 cells, grown in 60-mm dishes, were transfected with various cDNA combinations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin and isolated (16Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with cold rinsing solution (phosphate-buffered saline with Ca/Mg (1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.35)) (27Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5228-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and incubated in rinsing solution containing 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with quenching solution (rinsing solution with 100 mm glycine added), incubated in quenching solution for 20 min, and solubilized at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer ((150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm iodoacetamide). Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 16,300 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. A small sample of cleared lysates was saved for analysis (designated the lysate fraction); the remaining portion of lysates was incubated with avidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. After overnight incubation, samples were centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was saved as the intracellular fraction. The beads were washed once in radioimmune precipitation buffer, twice in cold high salt buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and once in low salt buffer (50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 30 min. The remainder of the procedure followed standard Western blotting protocols. To confirm that biotin only labeled surface proteins, the integrity of the cell membrane during biotinylation was tested by immunoblotting with an anti-actin antibody. Actin immunoreactivity in the biotinylated fraction was 9 ± 2% (n = 24) of that in the whole cell lysate. In selected experiments, biotinylations were performed under nondenaturing conditions by solubilizing cell membranes in radioimmune precipitation buffer (lysis buffer) lacking SDS. Without SDS in the radioimmune precipitation buffer, integral membrane proteins exposed to the extracellular space and thus labeled by biotin are not dissociated from membrane-associated proteins bound to such integral membrane proteins by noncovalent interactions. This allows us to possibly detect the changes in association of nonintegral membrane proteins (such as calpain) with biotinylated, cell surface-exposed proteins in different experimental conditions. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Experiments were analyzed using Student's t test (paired) to compare two conditions or ANOVA followed by planned comparisons of multiple conditions (28Anegawa N.J. Lynch D.R. Verdoorn T.A. Pritchett D.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For most comparisons, nonnormalized OD values were used. Significance was set at p < 0.05. All electrophysiology data, such as current amplitude, current desensitization, and time constant (fitted with a single exponential component function using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm), were calculated using Clampfit software (pCLAMP 8.01; Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). We have designated “n” to refer to independent experiments in biochemical studies and independent single cells in electrophysiological studies. Reduction of Calpain-mediated Proteolysis of NR2B by Inhibition of Src Family Kinase (SFK) Activity in Neurons—SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and calpain-mediated proteolysis occur in the NR2B C terminus (23Nakazawa T.

Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that phosphorylation of NR2B by SFK changes its sensitivity to calpain, we investigated the effect of PP2, a specific inhibitor of SFK (32Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 33Yaka R. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3623-3632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on calpain-mediated cleavage of NR2B. In primary hippocampal cultures (Fig. 1A), neurons pretreated with or without 10 μm PP2 for 30 min had similar levels of full-length NR2B (180 kDa, detected by an N-terminal antibody), showing that inhibition of SFK activity did not acutely change NR2B protein expression. Exposure of cultured neurons to 100 μm glutamate and 100 μm glycine for 30 min in the absence of PP2 preapplication decreased full-length NR2B levels and generated a 115–120-kDa N-terminal breakdown product (previously shown to be generated by calpain) (16Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). In parallel cultures, the application of 10 μm PP2 30 min before glutamate and glycine stimulation decreased the loss of full-length NR2B and production of the breakdown product (Fig. 1, A–C; full-length NR2B, without PP2, 48 ± 10%; with PP2, 82 ± 4%; p = 0.0069; NR2B breakdown product, without PP2, 53 ± 6%; with PP2, 30 ± 4%; p = 0.0068; n = 6). To control for the possibility that PP2 application globally decreased calpain activity, we examined calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown. Glutamate treatment produced similar levels of a 150-kDa calpain-generated spectrin breakdown product in neurons with or without PP2, showing that PP2 application did not decrease calpain activity toward all substrates (Fig. 1, A and D). Taken together, these results show that blocking SFK activity slows calpain-mediated cleavage of NR2B specifically and suggest that SFK activity controls NR2B subunit levels in hippocampal neurons in response to glutamatergic stimulation. NR2B Is Phosphorylated at Tyrosine 1336 during NMDA Receptor Activation in Neurons—NR2B can be phosphorylated at Tyr-1336 and Tyr-1472 by Fyn, an SFK directly implicated in tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors in the brain (23Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 34Sala C. Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since Fyn may change NR2 cleavage by calpain in vitro (35Rong Y. Lu X. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we first tested whether Fyn mediated phosphorylation of NR2B at Tyr-1336, Tyr-1472, or both sites during NMDA receptor activation. Cultures were treated with glutamate and glycine, and the time course of Tyr-1336 and Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was determined using NR2B phosphospecific anti-Tyr-1336 or anti-Tyr-1472 antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). Levels of phosphorylation of Tyr-1472 were similar over the period of 30 min of glutamate stimulation (Fig. 2A). However, increased phosphorylation of Tyr-1336 was noted rapidly (by 7.5 min after NMDA receptor activation) and increased 2.2-fold by 30 min (0 min, 100 ± 2%; 7.5 min, 151 ± 22%; 30 min, 219 ± 14%, p = 0.0095 at 7.5 min and p = 0.0004 at 30 min both versus 0 min, n = 5 each) (Fig. 2B). The progressive phosphorylation of NR2B at Tyr-1336 was associated with a gradual reduction of full-length NR2B and generation of the NR2B breakdown product (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, whereas the level of full-length NR2B declined with NMDA receptor activation, the immunoreactivity of phospho-Tyr-1336 NR2B increased. In addition, phosphorylation of Tyr-1336 in this condition is mediated by SFK, since PP2 (10 μm) eliminated phospho-Tyr-1336 immunoreactivity at all of the indicated time points (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, PP2 slowed both the reduction of full-length NR2B and the generation of NR2B-derived breakdown products over a time course that generally resembled that for phosphorylation of NR2B-Tyr-1336 (Fig. 2, A, C, and D).

https://openalex.org/W1981022448,"The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is required for mediating the S-phase checkpoint following UV treatment, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here we demonstrate that at least two mechanisms are involved in regulating the S-phase checkpoint in an MRN-dependent manner following UV treatment. First, when replication forks are stalled, MRN is required upstream of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3related protein (ATR) to facilitate ATR activation in a substrate and dosage-dependent manner. In particular, MRN is required for ATR-directed phosphorylation of RPA2, a critical event in mediating the S-phase checkpoint following UV treatment. Second, MRN is a downstream substrate of ATR. Nbs1 is phosphorylated by ATR at Ser-343 when replication forks are stalled, and this phosphorylation event is also important for down-regulating DNA replication following UV treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate that MRN and ATR/ATR-interacting protein (TRIP) interact with each other, and the forkhead-associated/breast cancer C-terminal domains (FHA/BRCT) of Nbs1 play a significant role in mediating this interaction. Mutations in the FHA/BRCT domains do not prevent ATR activation but specifically impair ATR-mediated Nbs1 phosphorylation at Ser-343, which results in a defect in the S-phase checkpoint. These data suggest that MRN plays critical roles both upstream and downstream of ATR to regulate the S-phase checkpoint when replication forks are stalled.

Mutations in the NBS1 and MRE11 genes lead to two human recessive disorders, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), respectively (3Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev.

Mutant cells from patients with these disorders are extremely sensitive to radiation, fail to suppress DNA replication following ionizing radiation (IR), and exhibit a high degree of genome instability. The Mre11 complex is involved in both DNA repair and checkpoint activation, which provides a molecular basis for the genome instability observed in NBS and ATLD patients. Substantial evidence suggests that the Mre11 complex plays a key role in the cellular responses to double strand breaks (DSBs) (5Matsuura S. Kobayashi J. Tauchi H. Komatsu K. Adv.

It has been demonstrated that MRN directly participates in DSB repair by participating in homologous recombination pathways (22Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat.

Although MRN plays a critical role in the damage responses that are initiated when DNA DSBs are detected, a connection between MRN and the ATR pathway recently emerged. The primary function of ATR is to monitor DNA replication (25Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). It is activated by single-stranded DNA arising when replication forks are stalled or generated when DNA ends are processed. ATR stably interacts with ATRIP, and through this interaction ATR is recruited to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA at damage sites (27Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 28Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that following HU-induced replication arrest, Nbs deficiency leads to an impaired G2/M checkpoint and a failure to restart DNA synthesis, similar to the defects observed in ATR-deficient cells (29Stiff T. Reis C. Alderton G.K. Woodbine L. O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Rad50 depletion also causes hypersensitivity to UV treatment, a damage-induced pathway that requires functional ATR (30Zhong H. Bryson A. Eckersdorff M. Ferguson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2685-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Co-purification of MRN and ATR was also recently reported (31Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In some cases, MRN facilitates ATR-mediated phosphorylation (29Stiff T. Reis C. Alderton G.K. Woodbine L. O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Zhong H. Bryson A. Eckersdorff M. Ferguson D.O. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), although it was also reported that UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation is MRN-independent (31Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that MRN acts both upstream and downstream of ATR activation to mediate the UV-induced S-phase checkpoint. We show that the requirement of MRN to facilitate ATR-mediated phosphorylation following UV and HU treatment is both dose- and substrate-dependent. Although phosphorylation of several ATR substrates is impaired in Mre11- and Nbs1-deficient cells after a low dose of UV or HU treatment, MRN is dispensable for the phosphorylation of these substrates when relatively high doses of UV light or HU are used. Interestingly, unlike other ATR substrates, ATR-mediated RPA2 phosphorylation depends on MRN even when cells are treated with relatively high doses of UV light or HU. This MRN-dependent phosphorylation of RPA2 by ATR contributes to the MRN-mediated S-phase checkpoint regulation. In addition, we show that Ser-343 of Nbs1 is directly phosphorylated by ATR when replication forks are stalled. ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-343 represents another pathway distinct from RPA2 phosphorylation in S-phase checkpoint control. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATR interacts with MRN through the FHA/BRCT domains of Nbs1, and this interaction is not only required for Nbs1 phosphorylation at Ser-343 but is also important for mediating the S-phase checkpoint following UV treatment.

Wild-type Nbs1 or Mre11 was introduced into the GM07166 or the ATLD cell lines, respectively, by infection of retroviruses followed by selection of puromycin-, G418-, or hygromycin-resistant cells. T98G cells were synchronized by culturing in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 48 h and then releasing by adding 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was accomplished using a standard calcium phosphate-mediated transfection procedure and 2× BES-buffered saline. Silencing of endogenous Mre11 or Nbs1 in U2OS cells was accomplished by two rounds of retroviral infection using pMKO vector (37Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B.

For silencing of Mre11, the shRNA target sequences used were GAUGAGAACUCUUGGUUUAAC and GAGUAUAGAUUUAGCAGAACA. The target sequences used for Nbs1 silencing were GGAGGAAGAUGUCAAUGUUAG and GAAGAAACGUGAACUCAAGGA. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Fragments of Nbs1 were made by PCR using full-length Nbs1 as a template with primers containing a nuclear localization sequence and restriction sites at the ends. Using these sites, the fragments of Nbs1 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, containing the sequence encoding the Myc epitope (38Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B.

GST-Nbs1 (amino acids 332-363) was constructed by cloning a PCR product into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Serine 343 was mutated to alanine in this construct using mutagenic primers and site-directed mutagenesis. Full-length ATRIP (generously provided by D. Cortez) was used as a template for PCR to construct the ATRIP-(108-791) mutant, which disrupts the in vivo binding between ATRIP and RPA, and the ATRIP internal deletion of amino acids 656-684, which disrupts the in vivo binding between ATRIP and ATR as described previously (39Ball H.L.

Mre11 and Nbs1 shRNAs were cloned by ligating the annealed phosphorylated oligonucleotides into pMKO cut with AgeI and EcoRI. GST Fusion Protein Purification—GST-Nbs1 (amino acids 332-363) wild-type and GST-Nbs1-S343A (amino acids 332-363) fusion proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Protein fragments were eluted with 15 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Immunoprecipitation, Chromatin Isolation, and Immunostaining—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in NETN (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) or NET-Tween (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Tween 20) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by incubation with secondary antibody and protein A-agarose for 1 additional h. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed in lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled. Western blot analysis was performed by separating proteins by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight in primary antibodies followed by 1 h of incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For detecting the endogenous interaction of MRN with ATR, nuclear extracts were prepared. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation, nuclear pellets were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) and homogenized. Subsequently, high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.2 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) was added dropwise, and nuclear debris were removed by centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed into buffer BC100 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). Nuclear extracts were diluted in NETN, and immunoprecipitation was performed using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Nbs1. Chromatin isolation from U2OS cells was performed as described previously (40Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For chromatin isolation from GM07166 or ATLD cells, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, collected, resuspended in a small volume of CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 2 min. Cytoplasmic proteins were separated by centrifugation, and isolated nuclei were lysed in solution B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and protease inhibitors. Soluble nuclear proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in CSK buffer and boiled after adding 2× SDS loading buffer. To detect damage foci after UV treatment in NIH3T3 cells that were reconstituted with human Nbs1, cells were treated with 70% methanol and 30% acetone at -20 °C for 20 h, followed by immunostaining analysis as described (41Wu X. Petrini J.H. Heine W.F. Weaver D.T. Livingston D.M. Chen J. Science. 2000; 289: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ATR in Vitro Kinase Assay—FLAG-tagged ATR (a generous gift from R. T. Abraham) was transiently transfected into 293T cells. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in NET-Tween lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Tween 20) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. FLAG-tagged ATR was immunoprecipitated by incubating cell lysates with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals) and protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) for 1 additional h. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed (3× in NET-Tween, 2× in kinase buffer) and then incubated with glutathione-eluted GST fusion proteins in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in ATR kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE; gels were dried and exposed to film. Coomassie-stained gels confirmed that equal amounts of substrate proteins were added to the kinase reactions. UV-resistant DNA Synthesis—Inhibition of DNA synthesis following exposure to UV light was performed as described previously (40Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, U2OS cells were grown in the presence of 0.02 μCi per ml of [14C]thymidine for 24 h. Two hours after the removal of [14C]thymidine, cells were either mock-treated or irradiated with 10 J/m2 of UV light. Cells were allowed to recover 1 h and were then labeled with 2.5 μCi per ml of [3H]thymidine for 15 min. Cells were spotted onto Whatman microfiber filters, washed extensively with trichloroacetic acid and 100% ethanol, and vacuum-dried. Radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter and a dual energy program. Antibodies—Antibodies used in this study were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Smc1-S966p), Cell Signaling (Nbs1-S343p), Oncogene (Mre11, RPA1, and RPA2), R&D Systems (Chk1-S317p), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Chk1 and Ku70), Sigma (M2), and Upstate (Rad50).

Mre11 and Nbs1 Are Required for Mediating the S-phase Checkpoint in Response to UV Radiation—In response to IR when DSBs are generated, ATM is activated, and MRN is involved in one of the ATM-dependent pathways required for mediating the S-phase checkpoint (43Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). When replication forks are stalled, the S-phase checkpoint is also activated (44Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms have not been extensively studied. To test if MRN is required for mediating the S-phase checkpoint in response to UV-induced DNA damage, we silenced endogenous Mre11 or Nbs1 in U2OS cells by retroviral infection of two shRNAs directed against different sites in the Mre11 or Nbs1 mRNA. Silencing Mre11 or Nbs1 by this method resulted in a significant reduction in the detectable protein levels of Mre11 and Nbs1 as compared with the control cells that were infected with empty vector (Fig. 1, bottom). Notably, inhibition of Mre11 expression also reduced the protein levels of Rad50 and Nbs1, consistent with the previous findings that the expression of Nbs1 and Rad50 was low in the Mre11-deficient ATLD cells (45Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This is likely because of a critical role of Mre11 to stabilize the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex. In addition to this reduction in protein levels, there was also a reduction in Chk2 phosphorylation following IR when Mre11 or Nbs1 was silenced (data not shown), as well as a defect in the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint response (data not shown), confirming that the shRNAs used to silence Mre11 and Nbs1 were acting effectively. The rate of DNA synthesis following exposure to UV radiation was determined in these cells, with the vector-infected cells serving as a control. Although the rate of DNA synthesis was down-regulated following UV treatment in the cells infected with vector alone, silencing endogenous Mre11 or Nbs1 inhibited this down-regulation (Fig. 1, top). This result suggests that MRN is required for mediating the replication checkpoint in response to UV-induced DNA damage. These data are also consistent with the finding that inhibition of Rad50 expression impairs the down-regulation of DNA synthesis in response to a low dose of UV treatment (30Zhong H. Bryson A. Eckersdorff M. Ferguson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2685-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Upon UV and HU Treatment, Chk1 and SMC1 Phosphorylation Depends on Mre11 and Nbs1 Only at Low Doses, whereas RPA2 Phosphorylation Requires Mre11 and Nbs1 Even at High Doses—MRN is required to activate ATM in response to IR (10Lee J.H.

Recently, some reports suggest that MRN is also required for activating ATR to phosphorylate its substrates (29Stiff T. Reis C. Alderton G.K. Woodbine L. O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Zhong H. Bryson A. Eckersdorff M. Ferguson D.O. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), although other reports demonstrate that MRN is dispensable for ATR activation (31Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Because silencing Mre11 or Nbs1 resulted in a defect in the inhibition of DNA synthesis in response to UV radiation, we investigated in detail whether MRN is required to activate ATR following UV- or HU-induced DNA damage, and thereby involved in the regulation of the S-phase checkpoint. Nbs1-deficient cells (GM07166) or Mre11-deficient cells (ATLD), immortalized by the expression of hTERT, were reconstituted with Nbs1 or Mre11, respectively, or with vector alone (Fig. 2A). To examine the effect of Nbs1 or Mre11 deficiency on the activation of ATR, phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 was monitored after mock-treatment (-), exposure to UV light, or treatment with HU. Chk1 phosphorylation at serine 317 and SMC1 phosphorylation at serine 966 were both reduced in the Nbs1- and the Mre11-deficient cells after exposure to a low dose of UV radiation (2 J/m2; Fig. 2B, top) in comparison with Nbs1 and Mre11 reconstituted cell lines. However, at a higher dose of UV radiation (10 J/m2), the absence of Nbs1 did not have any obvious effect on either of these phosphorylation events, whereas partial dependence on Nbs1 was observed at an intermediate dose (5 J/m2) (Fig. 2B, bottom). Similar results were obtained when the expression of Mre11 or Nbs1 was silenced in U2OS cells by shRNAs. Phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 significantly decreased after low doses of UV (2 J/m2) and HU (0.1 mm for 2 h) treatment, when compared with the vector-infected control cells (Fig. 2C, top panels). However, there was no significant difference when higher doses of UV light (10 or 30 J/m2) or HU (1 mm for 24 h) were used (Fig. 2C, bottom, and data not shown). These data suggest that the requirement of MRN to facilitate ATR-mediated Chk1 and SMC1 phosphorylation is dependent upon the dose of UV light or HU. At higher doses of UV light and HU, redundant pathways may be activated, and MRN becomes dispensable for ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1. When replication forks are stalled, RPA2 is phosphorylated on chromatin by ATR (40Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, contrary to Chk1 and SMC1 phosphorylation, optimal phosphorylation of RPA2 by ATR requires MRN even at high doses of UV light and HU. RPA2 phosphorylation was impaired in the Nbs1-deficient cell line (GM07166) after a high dose of UV treatment (30 J/m2), and the defect was corrected when Nbs1 was reconstituted (Fig. 3A).

Cytoplasmic p27 exerts its effect on migration by binding to and inhibiting the activation of the small GTPase and cytoskeletal organizer RhoA, consequentially loosening cell substrate grip and enhancing movement. Using DNA damage as a p27 nuclear import signal, we found that the E7 oncoprotein from human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16), the etiological agent of cervical cancer, enhanced both the cytoplasmic retention of p27 and the migration of human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) in a phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent manner using a standard wound assay. Increased migration in E7-expressing HFKs correlated with an Akt-regulated downregulation of RhoA activity through p27 binding under conditions where a p27 nuclear import signal is given (that is, DNA damage). Under these conditions, inhibition of the downstream RhoA effector ROCK enhanced control cell migration, whereas relatively unaffecting E7-expressing cells, further implicating that the inhibitory effect of E7 on RhoA positively regulates migration. We believe that the E7 protein from HPV-16 can modulate the cytoplasmic localization of p27 and may in turn regulate tumor metastasis/aggressiveness through the PI3K/Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2129170976,"Endostatin, a fragment of the basement membrane component collagen XVIII, exhibits antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo when high doses are administered. It is not known whether endogenous endostatin at physiological levels has a protective role as an inhibitor of pathological angiogenesis, such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration. Using a laser injury model, we induced CNV in mice lacking collagen XVIII/endostatin and in control mice. CNV lesions in mutant mice were approximately 3-fold larger than in control mice and showed increased vascular leakage. These differences were independent of age-related changes at the choroid-retina interface. Ultrastructural analysis of the choroidal vasculature in mutant mice excluded morphological vascular abnormalities as a cause for the larger CNV lesions. When recombinant endostatin was administered to collagen XVIII/endostatin-deficient mice, CNV lesions were similar to those seen in control mice. In control mice treated with recombinant endostatin, CNV lesions were almost undetectable. These findings demonstrate that endogenous endostatin is an inhibitor of induced angiogenesis and that administration of endostatin potently inhibits CNV growth and vascular leakage. Endostatin may have a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of CNV and could be used therapeutically to inhibit growth and leakage of CNV lesions."

https://openalex.org/W1981976777,"The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src has been implicated in signal transduction induced by growth factors and integrins. Src also shows oncogenic activity when deregulated. Accumulating evidence indicates that the tyrosine kinase Abl is an important substrate for Src signalling in normal cells. Here we show that Abl is also required for Src-induced transformation of mouse fibroblasts. Abl does not mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and Shc, two important regulators of Src oncogenic activity. In contrast, Abl controls the activation of the small GTPase Rac for oncogenic signalling and active Rac partly rescued Src transformation in cells with inactive Abl. Moreover, Abl mediates Src-induced extracellular regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) activation to drive cell transformation. Finally, we find that Abl/Rac and Abl/ERK5 pathways also operate in human MCF7 and BT549 breast cancer cells, where neoplastic transformation depends on Src-like activities. Therefore, Abl is an important regulator of Src oncogenic activity both in mouse fibroblasts and in human cancer cells. Targeting these Abl-dependent signalling cascades may be of therapeutic value in breast cancers where Src-like function is important."
https://openalex.org/W2066285199,"Indirubin-3′-monoxime is a derivative of the bis-indole alkaloid indirubin, an active ingredient of a traditional Chinese medical preparation that exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-leukemic activities. Indirubin-3′-monoxime is mainly recognized as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3. It inhibits proliferation of cultured cells, mainly through arresting the cells in the G1/S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Here, we report that indirubin-3′-monoxime is able to inhibit proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells by specifically inhibiting autophosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), blocking in this way the receptor-mediated cell signaling. Indirubin-3′-monoxime inhibits the activity of FGFR1 at a concentration lower than that required for inhibition of phosphorylation of CDK2 and retinoblastoma protein and cell proliferation stimulated by fetal calf serum. The ability of indirubin-3′-monoxime to inhibit FGFR1 signaling was similar to that of the FGFR1 inhibitor SU5402. In addition, we found that indirubin-3′-monoxime activates long-term p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in a way unrelated to the activity of FGFR1. Furthermore, we show that indirubin-3′-monoxime can inhibit proliferation of the myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a through inhibition of the activity of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase. The data presented here demonstrate previously unknown activities of indirubin-3′-monoxime that may have clinical implications."

We developed a pharmacophore based on a carbonyloxime (OXIM) scaffold for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a protein involved in the pathology of sepsis, to validate that inhibition of a catalytic site could produce therapeutic benefits. We studied the crystal structures of MIF·OXIM-based inhibitors and found two opposite orientations for binding to the active site that were dependent on the chemical structures of an R-group. One orientation was completely unexpected based on previous studies with hydroxyphenylpyruvate and (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1). We further confirmed that the unexpected binding mode targets MIF in cellular studies by showing that one compound, OXIM-11, abolished the counter-regulatory activity of MIF on anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid action. OXIM-11 treatment of mice, initiated 24 h after the onset of cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis, significantly improved survival when compared with vehicle-treated controls, confirming that inhibition of the MIF catalytic site could produce therapeutic effects. The crystal structures of the MIF inhibitor complexes provide insight for further structure-based drug design efforts."

https://openalex.org/W1963769227,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) plays a crucial role in establishing metaphase and has also been shown to prevent DNA re-replication. Cyclins B1 and B2 are two known activators of CDK1 operating during mitosis in human cells. Little is known about the specific roles of each of these cyclins in CDK1 activation, but cyclin B2 is thought to play a minor role and to be unable to replace cyclin B1 for mitosis completion. In our study, we found that severe reduction by separate RNA interference of either cyclin B1 or cyclin B2 protein levels results in little or no alteration of the cell cycle and, more specifically, of mitosis progression. In contrast, simultaneous depletion of both B-type cyclins leads to massive accumulation of 4N cells, mitotic failure, premature mitosis exit and DNA re-replication. These defects can be corrected by the ectopic expression of a cyclin B2 resistant to the short hairpin RNA. Altogether, these data show that, in cycling human cells, cyclin B2 can compensate for the downregulation of cyclin B1 during mitosis. They also clearly implicate cyclins B1 and B2 as crucial activators of CDK1 in its biological function of DNA re-replication prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2070334729,"Multiple genome screens have been performed to identify regions in linkage or association with Multiple Sclerosis (MS, OMIM 126200), but little overlap has been found among them. This may be, in part, due to a low statistical power to detect small genetic effects and to genetic heterogeneity within and among the studied populations. Motivated by these considerations, we studied a very special population, namely that of Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy. This is an isolated, old, and genetically homogeneous population with high prevalence of MS. Our study sample includes both nuclear families and unrelated cases and controls. A multi-stage study design was adopted. In the first stage, microsatellites were typed in the 17q11.2 region, previously independently found to be in linkage with MS. One significant association was found at microsatellite D17S798. Next, a bioinformatic screening of the region surrounding this marker highlighted an interesting candidate MS susceptibility gene: the Amiloride-sensitive Cation Channel Neuronal 1 (ACCN1) gene. In the second stage of the study, we resequenced the exons and the 3' untranslated (UTR) region of ACCN1, and investigated the MS association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in that region. For this purpose, we developed a method of analysis where complete, phase-solved, posterior-weighted haplotype assignments are imputed for each study individual from incomplete, multi-locus, genotyping data. The imputed assignments provide an input to a number of proposed procedures for testing association at a microsatellite level or of a sequence of SNPs. These include a Mantel-Haenszel type test based on expected frequencies of pseudocase/pseudocontrol haplotypes, as well as permutation based tests, including a combination of permutation and weighted logistic regression analysis. Application of these methods allowed us to find a significant association between MS and the SNP rs28936 located in the 3' UTR segment of ACCN1 with p = 0.0004 (p = 0.002, after adjusting for multiple testing). This result is in tune with several recent experimental findings which suggest that ACCN1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2041009167,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria is brought about by the asexual stages of the parasite residing in human red blood cells (RBC). Contact between the erythrocyte surface and the merozoite is the first step for successful invasion and proliferation of the parasite. A number of different pathways utilised by the parasite to adhere and invade the host RBC have been characterized, but the complete biology of this process remains elusive. We here report the identification of an open reading frame (ORF) representing a hitherto unknown second exon of the Pf332 gene that encodes a cysteine-rich polypeptide with a high degree of similarity to the Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domain of the erythrocyte-binding-ligand (EBL) family. The sequence of this DBL-domain is conserved and expressed in all parasite clones/strains investigated. In addition, the expression level of Pf332 correlates with proliferation efficiency of the parasites in vitro. Antibodies raised against the DBL-domain are able to reduce the invasion efficiency of different parasite clones/strains. Analysis of the DBL-domain revealed its ability to bind to uninfected human RBC, and moreover demonstrated association with the iRBC surface. Thus, Pf332 is a molecule with a potential role to support merozoite invasion. Due to the high level of conservation in sequence, the novel DBL-domain of Pf332 is of possible importance for development of novel anti-malaria drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2063790479,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a key modulator of the cellular stress response, inducing cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and cell differentiation. To evaluate further the molecular mechanism underlying p53 function, the transcriptional profiles of proliferating and senescent WI-38 cells, both wild-type p53 expressers and counterparts with an inactivated p53, were compared by DNA microarray analysis. In particular, the amyloid-beta precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) is induced in senescent cells in a p53-dependent manner. APLP1 was confirmed to be a novel transcriptional target of p53 by in vivo and in vitro characterization of a p53 responsive element found in the first intron of the APLP1 gene locus. APLP1 knockdown experiments demonstrate that APLP1 is required for the proliferation of fibroblastic and epithelial cells. Moreover, depletion of APLP1 expression diminishes stress-induced apoptosis of neural cells, whereas ectopic APLP1 expression augments apoptosis. Based on these data, a mechanism is proposed whereby p53-dependent induction of APLP1 is involved in neural cell death, and which may exacerbate neuronal cell loss in some acute or chronic neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2029115795,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe serves as a model system for studying role of actin cytoskeleton, since it has simple actin cytoskeletons and is genetically tractable. In contrast, biochemical approaches using this organism are still developing; fission yeast actin has so far not been isolated in its native form and characterized, and therefore, biochemical assays of fission yeast actin-binding proteins (ABPs) or myosin have been performed using rabbit skeletal muscle actin that may interact with the fission yeast ABPs in a manner different from fission yeast actin. Here, we report a novel method for isolating functionally active actin from fission yeast cells. The highly purified fission yeast actin polymerized with kinetics somewhat different from those of muscle actin and forms filaments that are structurally indistinguishable from skeletal muscle actin filaments. The fission yeast actin was a significantly weaker activator of Mg2+-ATPase of HMM of skeletal muscle myosin than muscle actin. The fission yeast profilin Cdc3 suppressed polymerization of fission yeast actin more effectively than that of muscle actin and showed an affinity for fission yeast actin higher than for muscle actin. The establishment of purification of fission yeast actin will enable reconstruction of physiologically relevant interactions between the actin and fission yeast ABPs or myosins and contribute to clarification of function of actin cytoskeleton in various cellular activities.

The establishment of purification of fission yeast actin will enable reconstruction of physiologically relevant interactions between the actin and fission yeast ABPs or myosins and contribute to clarification of function of actin cytoskeleton in various cellular activities. The actin cytoskeleton is involved in many cellular motile processes, such as muscle contraction, migration of the cell, cytoplasmic streaming, organelle positioning, cell morphogenesis, and cytokinesis. In many cases, the actin cytoskeleton is dynamic and is constructed and destroyed during the cell cycle or in response to extracellular stimuli. The dynamic nature is important for functions of the actin cytoskeleton; many actin cytoskeletons are formed only when they are necessary for specific cellular activities to be exercised. For example, the contractile ring forms in the equatorial cortex of the cell only during cytokinesis, constricts the cell into two, and is no longer present when cytokinesis is completed. The dynamic nature is mainly attributed to a couple of factors. One is the intrinsic feature of actin itself (i.e. it polymerizes into filaments and depolymerizes responding to environmental conditions). The others are regulation of the assembly feature of actin by actin-modulating proteins and formation of three-dimensional structures of actin filaments by various actin-cross-linking proteins, activities of both of which may be further controlled by upstream signaling pathways. Therefore, analyses of both assembly properties of actin and actions of various actin-binding proteins are requisite for understanding the dynamic nature of each actin cytoskeleton. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe serves as a good model system for studying the actin cytoskeletal organization, since the cells have only three distinct F-actin structures: cortical patches located mainly at the growing cell tip; cables running longitudinally along the cell; and the contractile ring, which forms during mitosis (1Marks J. Hyams J.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar, 2Arai R. Mabuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 887-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These structures are constructed and destroyed during the cell cycle. Specific actin-binding proteins are necessary for formation and maintenance of these structures and localized to these structures, which are known by genetic studies using mutant cells and by localization studies. Besides these studies, rigorous biochemical and biophysical analyses of properties of actin and interaction of ABPs with actin are necessary in order to elucidate physiological functions of these proteins. However, there has been no report on the isolation of functionally active fission yeast actin. Skeletal muscle actin has instead been used to investigate properties of fission yeast ABPs (3Nakano K. Satoh K. Morimatsu A. Ohnuma M. Mabuchi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3515-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), since it is easy to purify. Fission yeast actin is 88–90% identical to skeletal muscle actin, nonmuscle β-actin, and budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin over the whole deduced amino acid sequences. However, the differences among these actins, although they are small, may be significant in interaction of the actin with other proteins. For example, fission yeast actin has three serial negative charges (MEEEI–) like β-actin (MDDDI–), whereas skeletal muscle actin has four (MDEDET–) and budding yeast actin has only two (MDSEV–) in the N-terminal residues that are supposed to be involved in interaction with myosin and several ABPs (8Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3654-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9Sutoh K. Hatano S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Sutoh K. Mabuchi I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Actually, some nonmuscle ABPs have been reported to show significant species specificity to actin. Acanthamoeba or budding yeast profilin prevents polymerization of amoeba or yeast actin, respectively, but does not suppress polymerization of muscle actin at all (11Tseng P.C. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Nefsky B. Bretscher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ezrin, one of the band 4.1 family proteins, has also been reported to interact specifically with β-actin but not with α (skeletal muscle)-actin filaments (13Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Actophorin, an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) 2The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; ABPs, actin-binding proteins; DTT, dithiothreitol; ϵATP, 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate; HMM, heavy meromyosin; Lat-A, latrunculin A; HSS, high speed supernatant. family protein of Acanthamoeba, depolymerizes muscle actin filaments more efficiently than Acanthamoeba actin (14Mossakowska M. Korn E.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate properties of fission yeast ABPs using fission yeast actin for correct understanding of interactions between actin and ABPs in fission yeast. Pancreatic DNase I affinity chromatography, which exploits the stable and specific binding of DNase I to monomeric actin, may be the first choice to isolate nonmuscle actins, since it allows one to obtain actin with a high purity and a high yield by a single step purification (15Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, we could not obtain polymerization-competent actin from fission yeast by this method. 3I. Mabuchi, unpublished observation. Here, we report a procedure for purification of fully functional actin from fission yeast and basic biochemical characterizations of the purified actin. We also report that the fission yeast profilin Cdc3 showed a higher affinity for fission yeast actin than for muscle actin and reduced the extent of polymerization of fission yeast actin more potently than that of muscle actin. Strains and Cell Growth—Cells of S. pombe strain JY1 h– (wild type) were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose) or YES (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 225 mg/liter adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine hydrochloride) medium at 30 °C to give a density of 0.5–1 × 108 cells/ml. Purification of Fission Yeast Actin—Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 710 × g for 5 min. Two and a half liters of culture usually yielded about 25 ml of packed cells. The packed cells were washed once with deionized and distilled water and once with 1 × T-buffer (0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The following procedures were performed at temperatures between 0 and 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The cells were resuspended with the half-volume of 3 × T-buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted with glass beads using a Braun MSK homogenizer (Braun Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The homogenate was centrifuged successively at 12,000 × g for 30 min and at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The high speed supernatant (HSS) was sometimes frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protamine sulfate was added to HSS to give 0.1% (w/v) to precipitate DNA and RNA, and then HSS was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove them. Solid ammonium sulfate was dissolved in HSS to give 35% saturation. After 30 min, precipitates formed were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in 0.15 m KCl-T-buffer. The suspension was swirled for 30 min and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (AS fraction) was applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 40 ml of 0.15 m KCl-T-buffer and eluted with 240 ml of a linear KCl gradient of 0.15–0.35 m in T-buffer at 2 ml/min. Actin was eluted at around 0.25 m KCl. Actin-containing fractions (MQ fraction) were pooled and concentrated at least 10-fold by ultrafiltration through a Centriflo CF 25 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentrated MQ fraction was supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The solution was kept on ice overnight and then centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet containing polymerized actin was resuspended in a small volume of G-buffer (0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5) and homogenized with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. After a brief sonication, the suspension was dialyzed overnight against G-buffer. The dialyzed actin was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (crude G-actin) was applied to a Sephadex G-150 (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.3 × 31 cm) and eluted with G-buffer at a rate of 2.4 ml/h. Fractions containing actin were pooled (GF fraction) and concentrated. The concentrated actin was again polymerized with 30 mm KCl and 3 mm MgCl2 and depolymerized as above. The final supernatant was used as purified fission yeast G-actin within 4 days after purification. Preparation of Muscle and Recombinant Proteins—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared by the method of Spudich and Watt (17Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-150 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The purified G-actin was concentrated and stored on ice. Chymotryptic HMM was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin as described by Okamoto et al. (18Okamoto Y. Sekine T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recombinant Cdc3 was expressed in bacteria and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. E. coli strain BL21 (Novagen) was transformed with pGEX-4T1-cdc3 (a gift from Dr. K. Nakano) and grown in LB medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5) at 30 °C. Expression of glutathione S-transferase-Cdc3 was induced for 5 h at 25 °C by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) on ice. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle swirling. The beads were washed with and resuspended in Tb buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) The suspension was supplemented with 5 units/ml of thrombin (Sigma) and gently swirled for 16 h at 4 °C. After thrombin was removed by benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences), the eluted proteins were concentrated using a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) and then applied to a Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.4 × 28 cm) equilibrated with G-buffer. Purified Cdc3 was concentrated up to about 200 μm and stored on ice or at –80 °C. Electron Microscopy and Optical Diffraction—Samples were negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate on carbon-coated Formvar grids and observed with a JEM1200EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Actin filaments were decorated with HMM according to Craig et al. (19Craig R. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Beese L. Flicker P. Vibert P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Optical diffraction patterns of magnesium-paracrystals of actins were obtained as described previously (20Mabuchi I. Nonomura Y. Biomed. Res. 1981; 1: 417-426Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Polymerization of Actins—Actins were stored on ice as concentrated (about 30 μm) Ca2+-G-actin. If necessary, they were converted to Mg2+-G-actin either by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10 × ME (1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA) or by dilution with 1 × MEI (0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5), followed by preincubation for at least 2 min. The Mg2+-G-actin was subjected to polymerization within 20 min after the dilution. Polymerization was induced by the addition of salts to a G-actin solution in a cuvette followed by quick pipettings. It was monitored usually at 22 °C by light scattering measurement at 450 nm as previously described (21Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Kobayashi T. Hosoya H. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using an RF-540 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Analytical Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Amounts of proteins in Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were estimated by densitometric analysis using Image J software (available on the World Wide Web; National Institutes of Health). Isoelectric focusing of proteins was performed as described by O'Farrell (24O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Anti-fission yeast actin, anti-fission yeast Arp3 (actin-related protein 3), and anti-Myo1 (fission yeast myosin-I) antibodies were those previously described (25Arai R. Nakano K. Mabuchi I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Toya M. Motegi F. Nakano K. Mabuchi I. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations of crude samples were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Concentrations of purified proteins were determined spectrometrically using extinction coefficients as follows: muscle or fission yeast actin, A290 = 0.633 mg–1 ml cm–1 (28Houk T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); HMM, A280 = 0.647 mg–1 ml cm–1 (29Young D.M. Himmelfarb S. Harrington W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2822-2829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Cdc3, A280 = 1.63 mg–1 ml cm–1 (30Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Concentration of purified fission yeast actin on an SDS-gel was also estimated by densitometry using muscle actin as a standard, which usually gave almost the same value as that obtained spectrometrically. Conditions for ATPase assay of HMM were those described by Mabuchi (31Mabuchi I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The inorganic phosphate was determined by a modified malachite green method according to Kodama et al. (32Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) of profilin (Cdc3) for fission yeast or muscle G-actin was determined according to Perelroizen et al. (33Perelroizen I. Marchand J.B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). G-actin (0–0.96 μm) in K buffer (0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was titrated with Cdc3 (200–290 μm) in K buffer. Increase in volume by successive addition of Cdc3 was always kept at less than 1.2%. Fluorescence of the solution was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and at an emission wavelength of 330 nm. Data were fitted to the equation, ΔF = Fobs – fA[A]tot – fP[P]tot = (fPA – fA – fP)[PA] using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), where Fobs is total observed fluorescence; fA, fP, and fPA are intrinsic fluorescence coefficients of free G-actin, free profilin, and profilin-actin complex, respectively; and [A]tot, [P]tot, and [PA] are concentrations of actin, profilin, and profilin-actin complex, respectively. ATP Exchange Analysis—1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ϵATP; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR)-bound Ca2+-G-actin was prepared according to Lu and Pollard (30Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, G-actin (1 μm) in TG-buffer (0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was treated with Dowex-1 (X8 resin; Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI) for 5 min on ice to remove free nucleotides. The Dowex-1 was pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant (ATP-bound G-actin) was supplemented with 0.2 mm ϵATP and incubated for at least 4 h on ice. Immediately before measurements, free ϵATP was removed with Dowex-1 as above, and the ϵATP-bound Ca2+-G-actin was diluted to 0.5 μm with TG0-buffer (TG-buffer without ATP) containing various concentrations of Cdc3 (0–5 μm). After the addition of 0.2 mm ATP to the solution, the release of ϵATP from G-actin was monitored at 25 °C by the decrease in fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and at an emission wavelength of 410 nm using an RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Corp.). The rate constant for dissociation of ϵATP from actin was determined by fitting the data to a single exponential function using a KaleidaGraph software. Cosedimentation Assay—The binding affinity of HMM to actin was estimated by a cosedimentation experiment. HMM (0.5 μm) in assay buffer (25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5) was mixed with various concentrations of actin-phalloidin complex (0–3.2 μm actin supplemented with a 1.1-fold molar excess of phalloidin (Sigma)), and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. F-actin and bound HMM were pelleted by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a Hitachi RP100AT3 rotor. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Amounts of HMM heavy chain remaining in the supernatants were determined by densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels and expressed as percentages of the amount of HMM in the control supernatant without F-actin. The cosedimentation assay was also used to examine the effect of Cdc3 on the extent of actin polymerization. G-actin (3 μm) was mixed with various concentrations of Cdc3 (0–9 μm) and polymerized at least for 16 h at 25 °C in 50 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2. The mixtures were centrifuged as above, and protein concentrations of the supernatants and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Fluorescence Microscopy of Actin Filaments—Actin (3 μm) was polymerized at least for 16 h at 25 °C in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Cdc3 and diluted to 0.6 μm in FM buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% methylcellulose, 10 mm 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma), 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.8 μm BODIPY-FL-phallacidin (Molecular Probes). After incubation for 1 min, the solution was further diluted to 1:500 to 1:50 with FM buffer and applied to a coverslip coated with 0.01% (w/v) poly-l-lysine. Fluorescent images were acquired with a SPOT cooled charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc., Rockville, MD) on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 63× oil lens (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Three to five images were analyzed for each Cdc3 concentration using Image J software, which allowed us to measure length of more than 800 filaments. The protein composition of each fraction during purification of actin from the fission yeast S. pombe is shown in Fig. 1A. Actin was identified with anti-actin antibodies in these fractions as a 42-kDa component (Fig. 1B). The content of actin in the total protein in HSS was about 1%, as estimated by densitometry of the gel. Fission yeast actin was finally purified to 96–99% homogeneity, and typically 0.3–0.5 mg of actin was obtained from 25 ml of packed cells (Table S1). Using quantitative immunoblotting, we estimated that wild-type cells had 8.7 μm actin/cytoplasm or 0.54 million molecules of actin/cell in midlog phase in YES medium (Fig. S1). By this estimation, the procedure described in this paper yielded as the purified actin about one-tenth of the whole actin in fission yeast cells. Fission yeast actin showed an isoelectric point slightly more basic than that of muscle actin (Fig. 1C). We found that several proteins were reproducibly co-purified with actin even after the polymerization-depolymerization step (Fig. 1A, lane 4). On the following gel filtration column chromatography, however, 10 species of proteins eluted reproducibly as major components at the void volume (Fig. 1D, bands 1–10), which enabled effective separation of these proteins from G-actin. Apparent molecular weights of band 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 components were close to the deduced molecular weights of seven subunits of fission yeast Arp2/3 complex (i.e. 47,000 (Arp3), 44,000 (Arp2), 42,000 (p41-Arc), 37,000 (p34-Arc), 20,000 (p21-Arc), 20,000 (p20-Arc), and 17,000 (p16-Arc). This protein composition agreed well with that of immunoprecipitated or affinity-purified fission yeast Arp2/3 complex (6Sirotkin V. Beltzner C.C. Marchand J.B. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Arai R. Nakano K. Mabuchi I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analyses revealed that bands 1, 3, and 4 corresponded to fission yeast myosin I Myo1, Arp3, and actin, respectively (Fig. 1E). Fission yeast actin filaments polymerized in the presence of the flow-through fraction showed branches at an average angle of 70 ± 8° (n = 34; Fig. 1F). Such branches were rarely observed in filaments polymerized from the purified actin as described below. These results suggested that the flow-through fraction contained the Arp2/3 complex as a major component, since the Arp2/3 complex forms branches of actin filaments (34Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Properties of Fission Yeast Actin—Actin polymerization was monitored by light scattering measurements. In the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, fission yeast G-actin polymerized in a kinetics basically similar to that of muscle G-actin (Fig. 2A). However, the initial lag phase which has been considered to represent a nucleation phase was scarcely seen, and light scattering increased almost linearly and a little faster than muscle actin. Then the increase was slowed down but still continued at a slow rate (Fig. 2A, from 10 to 40 min). It took more than 3 h for light scattering from 4 μm polymerizing fission yeast actin to reach a plateau level (data not shown). On the other hand, muscle actin soon reached a steady state level. The characteristic polymerization kinetics of fission yeast actin was also observed for polymerization of Mg2+-G-actin induced by 2 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). In 0.1 m KCl, fission yeast Mg2+-G-actin polymerized as muscle Mg2+-G-actin did, but the polymerization took a longer time to reach a steady state (Fig. 2B, Mg). On the other hand, light scattering from fission yeast Ca2+-actin increased much more slowly than that from muscle Ca2+-actin, and the typical sigmoidal time course was not seen (Fig. 2B, Ca). Even after 16 h of incubation, the level of light scattering from the actin in 0.1 m KCl was about 70% of that of fission yeast Mg2+-actin polymerized with KCl (Fig. 2B, >12 h). The addition of 2 mm MgCl2 during the slow polymerization accelerated the rate (Fig. 2B, Ca to Mg), and the final level of polymerization was the same as that of the Mg2+-actin. Similarly, the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 to fission yeast Ca2+-actin, which had been incubated for 16 h in 0.1 m KCl, increased its light scattering level to that of the fission yeast Mg2+-actin (data not shown). Polymerization of both fission yeast and muscle actins induced by the simultaneous addition of 0.1 m KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 gave a similar kinetics to that by 2 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). To compare the speed of depolymerization of fission yeast and muscle actins, a molar excess of Lat-A, an actin monomer-sequestering agent (35Coué M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), was added, and decrease in polymer concentration was monitored by light scattering. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, both actins depolymerized gradually in the presence of Lat-A, although fission yeast actin depolymerized slightly more slowly than muscle actin. These actins should have depolymerized from both ends under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the observed rate should be proportional to the sum of the dissociation rate constants (k–) at the two ends. Me2SO, the solvent for Lat-A, did not affect the level of light scattering of the F-actin solutions (data not shown). The rates of depolymerization of both actins were the same in the presence of cytochalasin D, which caps the barbed end (36Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9982-9985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the k– values at the pointed end of these actins were the same. Muscle actin was more sensitive to Lat-A at lower concentrations than fission yeast actin (Fig. 2D). To determine critical concentration (CC) of these actins for polymerization, we plotted steady state levels of light scattering in the presence of both 0.1 m KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 against total actin concentrations and extrapolated the line to zero (Fig. 2E). The average CC for fission yeast actin was 0.57 ± 0.06 μm (n = 3) under our experimental conditions, which was similar to that for muscle actin, 0.46 ± 0.08 μm under the same conditions, and to sea urchin egg actin, 0.52–0.60 μm under similar conditions (37Mabuchi I. Spudich J.A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 785-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic examination showed that polymerized fission yeast actin in 0.1 m KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 fo"

In this study we focus on human ClC-6, which is structurally most related to the late endosomal/lysomal ClC-7.Using a polyclonal affinity-purified antibody directed against a unique epitope in the ClC-6 COOH-terminal tail, we show that human ClC-6, when transfected in COS-1 cells, is N-glycosylated in a region that is evolutionary poorly conserved between mammalian CLC proteins and that is located between the predicted helices K and M. Three asparagine residues (N410, N422 and N432) have been defined by mutagenesis as acceptor sites for N-glycosylation, but only two of the three sites seem to be simultaneously N-glycosylated. In a differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), endogenous ClC-6 colocalizes with LAMP-1, a late endosomal/lysosomal marker, but not with early/recycling endosomal markers such as EEA-1 and transferrin receptor. In contrast, when transiently expressed in COS-1 or HeLa cells, human ClC-6 mainly overlaps with markers for early/recycling endosomes (transferrin receptor, EEA-1, Rab5, Rab4) and not with late endosomal/lysosomal markers (LAMP-1, Rab7). Analogously, overexpression of human ClC-6 in SH-SY5Y cells also leads to an early/recycling endosomal localization of the exogenously expressed ClC-6 protein. Finally, in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, ClC-6 copurifies with detergent-resistant membrane fractions, suggesting its partitioning in lipid rafts. Mutating a juxtamembrane string of basic amino acids (amino acids 71-75: KKGRR) disturbs the association with detergent-resistant membrane fractions and also affects the segregation of ClC-6 and ClC-7 when cotransfected in COS-1 cells.We conclude that human ClC-6 is an endosomal glycoprotein that partitions in detergent resistant lipid domains. The differential sorting of endogenous (late endosomal) versus overexpressed (early and recycling endosomal) ClC-6 is reminiscent of that of other late endosomal/lysosomal membrane proteins (e.g. LIMP II), and is consistent with a rate-limiting sorting step for ClC-6 between early endosomes and its final destination in late endosomes."

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the manner in which the correct substrate is selected, and these differ in their predictions as to how far the downstream DNA is melted.

Using fluorescence quenching experiments, we provide evidence that cellular RNA polymerases from bacteria and yeast melt only one DNA base pair downstream from the active site. These data argue against a model in which multiple NTPs are lined up downstream of the active site. Cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerases; EC, elongation complex; pC, pyrrolo-cytosine; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; T, template; NT, non-template.2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerases; EC, elongation complex; pC, pyrrolo-cytosine; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; T, template; NT, non-template. are multisubunit enzymes that share high structural and sequence homology from bacteria to eukaryotes. Based upon structural studies, it has been proposed that substrate NTPs might gain access to the active (insertion) site of these enzymes through two alternative routes. The first route is a relatively small opening (10 × 10 Å) called the secondary channel (the “pore” in eukaryotic RNAPs) that leads directly to the active site and is a place where various transcription factors and inhibitors have been shown to bind. An alternative route may direct substrates through the main channel in the RNAP (formed by the two largest subunits), which binds the downstream DNA duplex. The differences in these substrate entry routes and the mechanisms of substrate loading are reflected in three major models. In the first model, the substrate NTP is believed to be loaded through the secondary channel into the insertion site either directly or following initial binding in the E-site, without preselection for the correct substrate base before its movement into the active site (1Batada N.N.

Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2006; 127: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Another model suggests that the incoming substrate forms an incipient base pair with the templating base (n) in a preinsertion site before its movement to the insertion site. This scenario was demonstrated for T7 RNAP and a number of other nucleotide polymerases (3Thompson A.A. Albertini R.A. Peersen O.B. J. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Finally, the third model (the NTP lineup model) suggests that several (up to four) substrate NTPs may bind to the template DNA in the main channel before movement of the template base and its cognate substrate into the active site (7Gong X.Q. Zhang C. Feig M. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 461-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The latter model would require that the downstream DNA be melted to provide an opportunity for base pairing with the substrate; however, the structural information available so far for the cellular RNAP ECs does not provide an unambiguous answer as to the extent of the downstream melting (2Wang D.

In this work, we took advantage of nucleotide analogs whose fluorescence is sensitive to the local DNA environment (9Martin C.T. Ujvari A. Liu C.

Our data demonstrate that cellular RNAPs melt only one DNA base pair down-stream from the active site, a finding that is not consistent with the NTP lineup model, but favors a mechanism of substrate loading through the secondary channel one nucleotide at a time. Purification of RNAPs and Activity Assays—His-tagged wild type T7 RNAP (pBH161) was purified as described previously (12Temiakov D. Tahirov T.H. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Wild type Escherichia coli core polymerase was purified from cell biomass obtained from MRE600 strain as described (13Nudler E. Gusarov I. Bar-Nahum G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Yeast RNAP II was prepared as described (14Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Polymerase activity was measured by the ability to extend a 32P-labeled RNA primer by one nucleotide in a reaction where the concentrations of nucleic acid scaffold (R8/TS35/NT35) and RNAP were equimolar (see transcription conditions below). RNA and DNA Oligonucleotides—The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used (all sequences are 5′ to 3′). RNA oligomers (Dharmacon) are as follows: R8, GCGGCGAU; R9, GCGGCGAUA; R9m, CCGGCGAUA; R9N2, CGCGGCGAU; R9N3, GCGCGGCGA. DNA oligomers (Integrated DNA Technologies) are as follows: TS35, CCTGTCTGAATCGATATCGCCGC; NT42U2, GATAGTCAGACAGG; NTC1, AGATAGTCAGACAGG; NTC2, AAGATAGTCAGACAGG; NTC3, TAAGATAGTCAGACAGG; NT491, TGCGATTCAGACAGG; NT38, ATCGATTCAGACAGG; NTF1, AGTGATTCAGACAGG; NTF2, GCTATTCAGACAGG; NT35, TCGATTCAGACAGG. The following DNA oligomers containing fluorescent analogs were custom synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies: TS42pC, CCTGTCTGACTATCpTATCGCCGG; TSC1, CCTGTCTGACTATCPTTATCGCCGCGCTCGGACAGGG (Cp indicates pyrrolo-deoxycytosine); TS352F, CCTGTCTGAATCGCApATCGCCGC; TS35F, CCTGTCTGAATCGApTATCGCCGC; TSF1, CCTGTCTGAATCApCTATCGCCGC; TSF2, CCTGTCTGAATApGCTATCGCCGC (Ap indicates 2-aminopurine). Assembly of ECs and Transcription Conditions—Nucleic acid scaffolds were assembled by annealing equimolar concentrations of complementary RNA and DNA oligomers as described previously (15Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test the efficiency of complex formation and NTP incorporation, RNA oligomers were labeled at their 5′ ends using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) prior to assembly. To assemble elongation complexes, RNAP (0.2–1 μm) was incubated with an equimolar concentration of scaffold for 5 min at room temperature in 10 μl of transcription buffer containing: 20 mm Tris ·HCl, (pH 7.9 at 25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for E. coli RNAP); 20 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.9 at 25 °C), 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for yeast RNAP II); 20 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.9 at 25 °C), 10 mm MgCl2,5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for T7 RNAP). Primer extension was achieved by incubation of complexes with substrate NTPs (500 μm) for 2 min at 37 °C (T7 and E. coli RNAP) or 30 °C (yeast RNAP II). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA solution, and products were resolved in 20% PAGE in the presence of 6 m urea and visualized by PhosphorImager™ (GE Health). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) equipped with a F-3004 thermostated sample holder and a LFI-3751 temperature controller (Wavelength Electronics). Quartz cells (30 μl) with 1.5 × 1.5-mm optical length paths (Hellma) were used. Samples containing pyrrolocytosine were excited at 350 nm, and fluorescence emission was monitored at 450 nm with both excitation and emission slits set at 5 nm. The nucleic acid scaffolds carrying a fluorescent probe were prepared as described above by annealing together RNA and DNA oligonucleotides. The ECs were prepared by preincubating 200 nm scaffold with 300 nm yeast RNAP II, T7, or E. coli RNAP in a corresponding transcription buffer (see above) for 10 min at 23 °C. When needed, the resulting fluorescent complexes were incubated with or without cognate NTP (0.5 mm) for 5 min at 23 °C, and emission was averaged over 10 min with a 1-s interval. All measurements were performed at 23 °C and repeated at least three times for each EC in independent experiments. The effect of protein and NTP absorption on the emission of the pyrrolo-cytosine was determined to be negligible. Fluorescence emission of NTP analogs such as 2-aminopurine and pyrrolo-cytosine (pC) is sensitive to the local environment of the nucleic acid polymer in which they are incorporated (9Martin C.T. Ujvari A. Liu C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Mandal S.S. Fidalgo da Silva E. Reha-Krantz L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4399-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Purohit V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10200-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is thought that quenching of fluorescence is due to base stacking interactions with the adjacent bases, which is increased in the case of double-stranded DNA (9Martin C.T. Ujvari A. Liu C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in fluorescence emission can be used to monitor the transition from double-stranded (ds) DNA to single-stranded (ss) DNA, for example, during promoter melting (17Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this work, we took advantage of pC probes incorporated at specific positions into the template (T) strand of the nucleic acid scaf-fold used to assemble transcription elongation complexes. Two types of scaffolds were used: scaffolds with a ds-DNA duplex (ds-scaffolds) having both T and non-template (NT) strands in the downstream region or scaffolds that contained only RNA and T DNA strand (ss-scaffolds). To find out whether and how far bases in the downstream DNA region of EC are melted, we placed the fluorescent probe in the T strand at different positions in immediate proximity to the active site (i.e. at positions n, n+1, n+2, and n+3). The principle of this experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1A. In a scaffold prepared by annealing together only T DNA strand and an RNA primer, relatively high emission of the pC probe is detected (supplemental Fig. S1). As expected (9Martin C.T. Ujvari A. Liu C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the addition of an NT strand results in quenching of fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1). Incubation of RNAP with ss- or ds-scaffolds results in the formation of an EC (18Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of an ss-scaffold EC, the fluorescence emission of the probe is expected to remain high since a complementary DNA region is not present. When an EC is formed using a ds-scaffold, two possibilities exist. In one scenario, RNAP melts open the G:pC base pair, and an increase in emission up to the level of the ss-scaffold EC would be expected (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, if the G:pC pair remains intact (is not melted), no changes in fluorescence emission should be registered. To test our experimental setup, we employed T7 RNAP elongation complexes assembled on scaffolds containing a pC probe at different positions downstream from the active site. Scaffold ECs of T7 RNAP having a fully complementary downstream region starting from base n–1 or n were previously crystallized, and the crystal structures showed that the DNA is melted only one base pair downstream from the active site in these complexes (5Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When we compared the fluorescence emission of pC probes positioned at n, n+1, n+2, or n+3 in ss- and ds-scaffold ECs formed with this enzyme, we found that the quantum yield was reduced 1.6–1.8-fold in all positions except for base n (Fig. 1, B and C). This indicates that, in agreement with the structural data and prior fluorescence data obtained with the promoteroriginated ECs having 2-amino purine (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), T7 RNAP melts open only one base pair ahead of the active site (Fig. 1C). Also consistent with the structural data and prior observations (20Datta K. Johnson N.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the absolute value of fluorescence intensity of the probe placed at position n in the ss-scaffold EC was significantly higher as compared with the unbound scaffold, reflecting a 90° kink in the DNA in this region (Fig. 1, B and D). We next used the same approach to examine melting of the downstream region in bacterial RNAP ECs. Previously, we demonstrated that depending upon the length of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the scaffolds used for their assembly, bacterial ECs may exist in either the pretranslocated or the post-translocated states (18Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized scaf-folds having a 9-bp RNA:DNA hybrid, which results in the formation of E. coli RNAP EC that is in the post-translocated state and therefore should have a similar location of the 3′ end of the RNA relative to the insertion site as in T7 RNAP EC. We found that, as in the case with T7, the pC probe placed at base n had the highest fluorescence emission in both ss-scaffold and ds-scaffold ECs (Fig. 2A), suggesting a similar kink in the DNA strand in this complex, as has been observed for other RNAPs (19Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Also, as in the case with T7 RNAP, we observed 1.8–2-fold reduction of the fluorescence emission in ds-scaffold ECs as compared with ss-scaf-fold ECs at positions n+1, n+2, and n+3 (Fig. 2B) but not at position n. The same data were obtained when 2-aminopurine was used at position n, n+1, and n+2 in the template strand of bacterial EC (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that the quenching was sequence-independent. Prior to fluorescence measurements with yeast RNAP II, we analyzed the conformation of ECs formed on scaffolds having different lengths of RNA:DNA hybrid in a pyrophosphate sensitivity assay (supplemental Fig. S3). We found that RNAP II ECs having a 9-bp RNA:DNA hybrid were resistant to PPi, and were thus in the post-translocated state (18Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fluorescence emission of the pC probe in RNAP II ECs revealed the same pattern of downstream DNA melting as in bacterial RNAPs, i.e. melting of the n base pair only (supplemental Fig. S4). To confirm that multisubunit RNAPs melt only a single base pair downstream of the active site, we performed “walking” experiments in which the RNAP II active site was shifted one base pair at a time downstream by providing the ds-scaffold ECs with the next incoming NTP (Fig. 2C). As expected, incorporation of GMP into the RNA in a ds-RNAP II EC having pC at position n resulted in the quench of fluorescence emission due to inclusion of the probe into the RNA:DNA hybrid (n–1 position). In a scaffold EC where the pC probe was at position n+1, the fluorescence emission is low. Upon primer extension, following the addition of ATP, the probe moves to position n, where it becomes unpaired, causing an increase in the fluorescence quantum yield. At the same time, no changes in fluorescence emission were observed when ECs containing the pC probe at position n+2 and n+3 were incubated with the cognate substrates, confirming that no DNA melting occur at this region. In a separate experiment, we examined whether the addition of several cognate NTPs results in stabilization of a possible transient melting of the downstream DNA in RNAP EC. For this, we incubated the ds-scaffold E. coli EC (R9/TSC1/NTC1) having pC at the n+1 base with AMPCPP (n and n+2 NTP) and GTP (n+1 NTP). No changes in fluorescence emission were detected, indicating that the presence of the substrate NTPs does not affect melting of the downstream DNA (data not shown). The mechanism by which substrate NTPs are selected and loaded into the RNAP active site is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the transcription process (and indeed to all template-directed nucleotide polymerization reactions) (22Landick R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In view of the different models that have been proposed for this step, it is important to establish the extent of melting of the downstream DNA duplex and the availability of the template strand bases for substrate binding and formation of incipient base pairs. Structural analysis for multisubunit RNAP ECs may eventually provide an answer to this question, as they did in the case of T7 RNAP (19Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T.

Biochemical approaches to probe melting of the DNA duplex have included endonuclease and permanganate footprinting; however, these assays are not usually able to provide single-base resolution (24Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As fluorescence quenching assays have successfully been applied to questions involving the topology of nucleic acids in a number of protein complexes (4Hariharan C. Bloom L.B. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T.

Cell. 2006; 24: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we utilized this approach in this work. Our choice of pC as a fluorescent analog was determined by the emission spectra of the probe, which is far (450 nm) from the protein emission, which thus brings little if any interference into the experimental data. This probe is sensitive to the local DNA environment and was successfully used in promoter melting experiments with T7 RNAP (17Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With regard to RNAP studies, the structural picture of substrate binding is the most complete for T7 RNAP as high resolution structures are available for both initiating and elongation complexes. Importantly, in all post-translocated T7 RNAP ECs, the downstream DNA region was formed with fully complementary DNA oligonucleotides, and melting of that region observed in the crystal structure is therefore the result of RNAP binding. Our experimental data with T7 RNAP EC are in agreement with the structural data and indicate that melting of only one base pair in the downstream DNA region is necessary for elongation. Prior to the analysis of the down-stream DNA melting in structurally unrelated multisubunit RNAPs from bacteria and yeast, it was important to establish whether the assembled complexes are in the pre-translocated (the 3′ end of the RNA occupies the insertion site) or post-translocated (the 3′ end of the RNA is in the product site) conformation as this may affect availability of unpaired DNA in the downstream region. Thus, in the crystal structure of the pretranslocated T7 RNAP EC, in contrast to the post-translocated EC, the base closest to the RNA: DNA hybrid is paired (26Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We therefore used only post-translocated complexes in measurements of fluorescence emission (18Kashkina E. Anikin M. Tahirov T.H. Kochetkov S.N. Vassylyev D.G. Temiakov D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Importantly, the level of fluorescence emission of pC at positions n+1, n+2, and n+3 for each RNAP (Figs. 1 and 2 and supplemental Fig. S4) is similar and well below the level of fluorescence observed at position n, indicating that there are no significant changes in the topology of the downstream DNA (such as a kink at base n). Therefore, the observed difference in fluorescence emission between ss- and ds-scaffold ECs clearly represents melting of the DNA duplex. The results of the fluorescence quenching assay with both bacterial and yeast RNAP indicate that these RNAPs, similar to T7 RNAP, melt only the base pair closest to the active site, whereas the rest of the down-stream duplex remains intact. It thus appears that not only the length of the RNA:DNA hybrid but also the size of the transcription bubble may be conserved between single and multisubunit RNAPs. The data obtained in our fluorescence experiments apparently contradict the NTP lineup model, which requires the availability of several unpaired template bases downstream from the active site (7Gong X.Q. Zhang C. Feig M. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 461-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although diffusion of substrate NTP into the RNAP active site through the main channel remains possible, loading through the secondary channel should be direct and sufficient for the delivery of the cognate substrate to the place of its base paring with an acceptor DNA base. The extent of melting of the downstream DNA duplex has implications with regard to transcription fidelity. We have recently demonstrated that a number of misincorporation errors in cellular RNAPs can be generated by an NTP-stabilized template strand misalignment mechanism (25Kashkina E. Anikin M. Brueckner F. Pomerantz R.T. McAllister W.T. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, the rate of misincorporation by misalignment is significantly increased when the n+1 base pair is melted (by means of an abasic or non-complementary site in the non-template strand) (25Kashkina E. Anikin M. Brueckner F. Pomerantz R.T. McAllister W.T. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Pomerantz R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2167985599,"In eukaryotes, short RNAs guide a variety of enzymatic activities that range from RNA editing to translation repression. It is hypothesized that pre-existing proteins evolved to bind and use guide RNA during evolution. However, the capacity of modern proteins to adopt new RNA guides has never been demonstrated. Here we show that Rnt1p, the yeast orthologue of the bacterial dsRNA-specific RNase III, can bind short RNA transcripts and use them as guides for sequence-specific cleavage. Target cleavage occurred at a constant distance from the Rnt1p binding site, leaving the guide RNA intact for subsequent cleavage. Our results indicate that RNase III may trigger sequence-specific RNA degradation independent of the RNAi machinery, and they open the road for a new generation of precise RNA silencing tools that do not trigger a dsRNA-mediated immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2018525356,"Separate conserved copies of suffix, a short interspersed Drosophila retroelement (SINE), and also divergent copies in the 3′ untranslated regions of the three genes, have already been described. Suffix has also been identified on the 3′ end of the Drosophila non-LTR F element, where it forms the last conserved domain of the reverse transcriptase (RT). In our current study, we show that the separate copies of suffix are far more actively transcribed than their counterparts on the F element. Transcripts from both strands of suffix are present in RNA preparations during all stages of Drosophila development, providing the potential for the formation of double-stranded RNA and the initiation of RNA interference (RNAi). Using in situ RNA hybridization analysis, we have detected the expression of both sense and antisense suffix transcripts in germinal cells. These sense and antisense transcripts are colocalized in the primary spermatocytes and in the cytoplasm of the nurse cells, suggesting that they form double-stranded RNA. We performed further analyses of suffix-specific small RNAs using northern blotting and SI nuclease protection assays. Among the total RNA preparations isolated from embryos, larvae, pupae and flies, suffix-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were detected only in pupae. In wild type ovaries, both the siRNAs and longer suffix-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were observed, whereas in ovaries of the Dicer-2 mutant, only piRNAs were detected. We further found by 3′ RACE that in pupae and ovaries, F element transcripts lacking the suffix sequence are also present. Our data provide direct evidence that suffix-specific RNAi leads to the silencing of the relative LINE (long interspersed element), F element, and suggests that SINE-specific RNA interference could potentially downregulate a set of genes possessing SINE stretches in their 5′ or 3′ non-coding regions. These data also suggest that double stranded RNAs possessing suffix are processed by both RNAi and an additional silencing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2138696088,"The ability to manage the constantly growing clinically relevant information in genetics available on the internet is becoming crucial in medical practice. Therefore, training students in teaching environments that develop bioinformatics skills is a particular challenge to medical schools. We present here an instructional approach that potentiates learning of hormone/vitamin mechanisms of action in gene regulation with the acquisition and practice of bioinformatics skills. The activity is integrated within the study of the Endocrine System module. Given a nucleotide sequence of a hormone or vitamin-response element, students use internet databases and tools to find the gene to which it belongs. Subsequently, students search how the corresponding hormone/vitamin influences the expression of that particular gene and how a dysfunctional interaction might cause disease. This activity was presented for four consecutive years to cohorts of 50-60 students/year enrolled in the 2(nd) year of the medical degree. 90% of the students developed a better understanding of the usefulness of bioinformatics and 98% intend to use web-based resources in the future. Since hormones and vitamins regulate genes of all body organ systems, this activity successfully integrates the whole body physiology of the medical curriculum."
