https://openalex.org/W2028450255,"IN a previous paper from this Institute1 it was shown, by using the isotope technique, that hyphæ of Boletus variegatus (Sw.) Fr. in mycorrhizal connexion with pine seedlings transfer nitrogen from a solution of an ammonium salt to the roots. The labelled nitrogen was added as ammonium nitrate containing the stable isotope nitrogen-15 in the ammonium group. By a special arrangement, only the mycelium was exposed to the isotope, and then the amounts of nitrogen-15 were measured in different parts of the seedlings."

https://openalex.org/W2004219508,"CYTOLOGICAL studies of the Desmidiaceæ now in progress in this department have shown that the chromosomes of Cosmarium botrytis and Pleurotœnium kallis have a polycentric or diffuse centromere type of organization, which results in the parallel separation of the chromatids at anaphase (Fig. 1). This type of organization has been previously described in Spirogyra1, and among the higher plants in Luzula2 and Carex3."

https://openalex.org/W1994192870,"MACMUNN in 18861 extracted the integument of A. rubens (then known as Uraster rubens) with ethyl alcohol containing sulphuric acid. The extracts were red-fluorescent to ultra-violet light, and MacMunn reported the presence of hæmatoporphyrin in them— the only porphyrin then known, having been discovered by Hoppe-Seyler in 1871 2. So far as we know, there is no further mention of hæmatoporphyrin in Asterias in the literature."

He suggested1,2 that the ‘soluble’ antigen was an intracellular form of the virus or a virus precursor. Henle and Henle3 and Fulton4, working on similar lines, concluded that ‘soluble’ antigen and virus antigens appeared together ; and Cairns5 has shown that Hoyle's interpretation of his own results is not necessarily correct, since there are differences in the sensitivity of the experimental methods in this particular situation."

https://openalex.org/W2057242269,"THE clove crop of the Zanzibar Protectorate, on which the economy of the islands is largely based, and which provides nine-tenths of the world's supplies, is seriously threatened by the sudden-death disease. In 1950, it was estimated that at least half of the clove trees in Zanzibar Island had already been killed by this disease, and that in the island of Pemba there were more than two thousand separate outbreaks1. The disease has made rapid progress since that date."

In the second, growth is diminished, but axon formation occurs. In the third phase, growth is again intensive and associated with continued axon formation. The resulting peripheral axon can, in the adult, be regenerated by a ‘revival’ of this stage."
