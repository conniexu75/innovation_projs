https://openalex.org/W1485462441,"Heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides, (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and NaB3H4 reduction. The structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, and alpha-mannosidase digestion. Based on the results, the whole structures of the major components of (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn were elucidated as Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3[Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to GlcNAc leads to Asn, respectively. Since endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamini dase D hydrolyzes (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but not (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, the presence of the unsubstituted alpha-mannosyl residue linked at the C-3 position of the terminal mannose of Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcAsn core must be essential for the action of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1491329611,"The obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium, Rickettsia prowazeki, has a carrier-mediated transport system for ADP and ATP. The transport of nucleotides was measured by membrane filtration assays; the assay was shown not to harm the relatively labile rickettsiae. The nucleotide transport system was shown to reside in the rickettsiae, not in the contaminating yolk sac mitochondria of the preparation. The influx of nucleotide had an activation energy of 12 to 13 kcal above 22 deg-rees (an apparent transition temperature), and 30 kcal below this value. The uptake of nucleotide was independent of the Mg2+ concentration, but was markedly stimulated by the phosphate concentration. The pH optimum of the influx of nucleotide was pH 7. The specificity of the transport system was remarkable in that it required a specific moiety in each portion of the nucleotide, i.e. an adenine base, a ribose sugar, and two or three, but not one, phosphates. Of the wide variety of compounds tested, the system could transport only ADP, ATP, and (beta, gamma-methylene) adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The influx of nucleotide was a saturable process; half-maximum velocity was achieved at a nucleotide concentration of about 75 muM. ADP and ATP were competitive inhibitors of each other's transport. Although at least 95% of the labeled intracellular nucleotide was exchangeable, efflux of labeled nucleotide was observed only in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide in the medium. Half-maximum efflux was achieved at a concentration of about 75 muM. A large intracellular to extracellular concentration gradient of labeled nucleotide was maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers, which completely abolished rickettsial hemolysis. While having no effect on the steady state, KCN and DNP accelerated both influx and efflux. Measurements of the endogenous pool of adenine nucleotides in isolated rickettsiae show that is was large (5 mM), and that these unlabeled nucleotides exchanged, on approximately a 1/1 basis, with exogenously added nucleotide. These studies support the proposal that rickettsiae are not leaky to adenine nucleotides or to small molecules in general, and that they have a carrier-mediated transport system which allows an exchange of host and parasite ADP and ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1908273278,"We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane."

Strychnine, an antagonist of glycine, does not produce this effect. Other receptive field types are affected by strychnine but not picrotoxin. Inhibitory transmitters therefore have specific functions in information processing in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1560923640,"Reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex III) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin could be used. Oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following energy-coupling phenomena. 1. Protons were translocated outward with a coupling ratio, H+/2e, of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. Proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction. 2. Potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin in a reaction coupled to electron transfer. The coupling ratio for K+ uptake, K+/2e, was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria. 3. The rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. Addition of valinomycin alone in a K+ medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1550519918,"Three homogeneous preparations of D-alanine carboxypeptidases I have been obtained from Escherichia coli strain H2143, termed enzymes IA, IB, and IC. Enzyme IA purified from the membrane after extraction with Triton X-100 appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be a polypeptide doublet whose monomer molecular weights were about 32,000 and 34,000. In addition to D-alanine carboxypeptidase activity, it catalyzed a transpeptidase reaction with several substrates, bound [14C]penicillin G, had a weak penicillinase activity, but was devoid of endopeptidase activity. Enzyme IB obtained from the membrane after LiCl extraction and enzyme IC obtained from the supernatant solution were either identical or extremely similar. They were composed of a single polypeptide whose monomer molecular weight was about 41,000. In addition to carboxypeptidase activity, they catalyzed an endopeptidase reaction, had weak penicillinase activity, and had very poor transpeptidase activity, but did not bind [14C]penicillin G. Some data relating to the mechanism of catalysis by these enzymes are described. Their possible physiological role is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526566805,"NSILA-s (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, soluble in acid ethanol) is a serum peptide that has insulin-like and growth-promoting activities. We have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail. In the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue. Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees. The pH optimum for NSILA-s binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to 8.0) for insulin binding. Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity. With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin. Furthermore, six preparations of NSILA-s which varied 70-fold in biological activity competed for 125I-NSILA-s binding in order of their potencies. NSILA-s which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation. Purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other receptors. In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing for the NSILA-s receptor. Analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor."

The results support the concept that the nervous system is an important regulator of blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1556420131,"Cell-free extracts of rat brain catalyze the reactions of the purine nucleotide cycle. Ammonia is formed during the deamination but not the amination phase of the cycle. The activity of adenylate deaminase in brain is sufficient to account for the maximum rates of ammonia production that have been reported. The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is not sufficient to account for these rates of ammonia production. The activities of adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinase are nearly sufficient to account for the steady state rates of ammonia production observed in brain. Demonstration of the cycle in extracts of brain is complicated by the occurrence of side reactions, in particular those catalyzed by phosphomonoesterase, nucleoside phosphorylase, and guanase."
https://openalex.org/W1604112638,"Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. ATP, originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules. Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization. Arginine kinase was not detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1521271267,"A monolayer reaction system employing tripropionin and siliconized glass beads was used to study the effects of taurodeoxycholate and colipase on the catalytic activity, interfacial stability, and interfacial affinity of porcine pancreatic lipase B (EC 3.1.1.3) The stability and catalytic activity of lipase at the bead-water interface are governed by the same two ionizable groups with pKa values (in the absence of cofactors) of 5.6 and 9.3. Colipase alone or with bile salt caused only a slight perturbation of these values. At low concentrations, 0 to 0.3mM, taurodeoxycholate increases the stability of lipase by 5-fold. At higher concentrations, 0.3 to 0.8 mM, but still below its critical micelle concentration, taurodeoxycholate prevents the adsorption of lipase to the bead-water interface. This appears to be the major mechanism by which this bile salt inhibits lipolysis. Colipase exerts small positive effects on lipase stability and catalytic activity. More importantly, colipase enables the adsorption of lipase in the presence of bile salt, thereby reversing the inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W96743316,"NADH-coenzyme Q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex I) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were required. Oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q1 catalyzed by the reconstituted vesicles was coupled to proton translocation, directed inward, with an H+/2e ratio greater than 1.4. Similar experiments measuring proton translocation in submitochondrial particles gave an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. The proton translocation in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme Q1 by NADH. Electron transfer in the reconstituted vesicles also caused the uptake of the permeant anion tetraphenylboron. The rate of electron transfer by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about 3-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated NADH-coenzyme Q reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1570985935,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form, carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of GDP or IDP, as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of GTP or ITP. The pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein. However, the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species. This reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents. These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate. Although the pyruvate-forming reaction is inhibited by added metal ions, the reaction is also inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline, suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion. It has not been possible, however, to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1611729581,"Large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, with the barbels having an especially high density. L-Alanine, as well as certain other amino acids, are taste stimuli in this animal. Epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation. A sedimentable fraction (P2) was prepared that was enriched in L[OH]alanine binding activity, the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase, but not the microsomal marker NADH cytochrome c redu.ctase. Binding of L-[OH]alanine was measured using a Millipore filter method in which correction for non-specific binding was also determined. Time, temperature, and pH for measuring binding activity were established. At the optimal pH of 7.8, the KD for L-alanine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. The first order dissociation rate constant at 6 degrees is 3.8 X 10(-4) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 X 10(-4) s-1. The second order rate constant for association is between 10(2) and 10(3) M-1 S-1. Reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound L-[3H]alanine by a large excess of unlabeled L-alanine. That the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of puromycin. The amounts bound of several other chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined."
https://openalex.org/W1601438336,"The apoprotein of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with 5-deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide (5-deazaFAD) to yield a protein which contains 1.5 mol of 5-deazaFAD/mol of enzyme. The deazaFAD-containing enzyme forms complexes with benzoate, 2-amino benzoate, and 4-aminobenzoate which are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme. The complex with 2-aminobenzoate exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band characteristic of a flavin charge-transfer complex. The reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by D-alanine oxidation. However, the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, and valine, but not by glutamate or aspartate, indicating the deazaFAD enzyme retains the substrate specificity of the native enzyme. Reduction of the enzyme by D-alanine exhibits a 1.6-fold deuterium isotope effect. Reoxidation of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia, but not with pyruvate alone or ammonia alone. beta-Phenylpyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, but not alpha-ketoglutarate could replace pyruvate. Reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with [alpha-3H]alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of tritium/mol of deazaFADH2. After denaturation of the tritium-labeled enzyme, the radioactivity was identified as deazaFADH2. Reaction of the reduced tritium-labeled enzyme with pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [alpha-3H]alanine and unlabeled deazaFAD. These results suggest that reduction and reoxidation of enzyme-bound deazaFAD involves the stereo-specific transfer of alpha-hydrogen from substrate to deazaFAD."
https://openalex.org/W1552718881,"Abstract A sialytransferase activity which catalyzes the synthesis of sialosylgalactosylceramide (G7) from added galactocerebroside and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid has been demonstrated in mouse brain microsomes. The enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents. Both Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mg2+ had no effect. The apparent Km for galactocerebroside leading to G7 was estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same microsomal preparation also synthesized hematoside when ceramide lactoside was the glycolipid acceptor. The apparent Km for ceramide lactoside was about one-tenth that for galactocerebroside. When the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and of hematoside was reduced at approximately the same rate. Liver appeared to have the highest activity for G7 synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed by brain. The synthesis of B7 by mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531275116,"Treatment of submitochondrial particles (ETP) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed NADPH leads to NAD (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, AcPyAD) transhydrogenase activity. NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10%. When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes. Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme. Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees. The above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are independent reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1507504822,"Location of electron transport chain components in chloroplast membranes of chlamydomonas reinhardi, y-1 was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or insolubilized trypsin. Digestion of intact membrane vesicles with soluble trypsin inactivates the water-splitting system, the 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibition site of Photosystem II, the electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Reduction of NADP with artificial electron donors for Photosystem I could be restored, however, by addition of purified reductase to trypsin-digested membranes. Electron transfer activities of Photosystems I and II reaction centers were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside. In the latter case, the water-splitting system was also found to be resistant to digestion. Polyacrylamide-bound insolubilized trypsin inactivated only the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Photosynthetically active membranes obtained at different stages of development showed a basically similar behavior toward trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1509679583,"Beef kidney 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase has been purified to homogeneity. It is a single subunit protein of Mr = 34,000 +/- 2,000 with a frictional coefficient (f/f0) of about 1.1. The enzyme readily aggregates to form, apparently inactive, higher molecular weight oligomers. The very rapid loss of enzyme activity during the assay was analyzed extensively. It was found to be due to inactivation of the enzyme by the substrate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, and unrelated to enzyme turnover or oxidation of bound iron. The loss of activity was shown to be a first order decay process, and methods are given for obtaining accurate initial reaction rates under all conditions. Evidence was presented that the enzyme assumes a catalytically inactive conformation at pH 3.4, which only relatively slowly rearranges to an active form at pH 6.5; the rearrangement can be blocked by the presence of substrate. We have found that Fe2+, which is required for enzymatic activity, can equilibrate freely, albeit slowly, with the enzyme during the course of the enzyme reaction even in the presence of saturating 3-hydroxanthranilate. Under assay conditons, the Fe2+ has an apparent dissociation constant of 0.04 mM. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were found to be dramatically different in beta,beta-dimethylglutarate buffer and collidine buffer; both the rate of loss of activity during the assay and the substrate Km and Vmax were affected."

The molecular weights of the resultant proteins equal 260 +/- 23 X 10(3) and 205 +/- 10(3); they contain seven and six different polypeptide subunits, respectively, all in equimolar amounts, with apparent molecular weights of 42.4, 34.1, 24.7, 14.6, 14.6, 12.3, 10.6 X 10(3), and 47.5, 20.4, 14.5, 14.5, 13.0, 11.0 X 10(3), respectively. By means of apolar chromatography on L-leucine coupled to agarose these enzymes can be stripped of their largest subunit(s) resulting in preparations with molecular weights of 170 +/- 17 X 10(3) and 124 +/- 20 X 10(3), and containing only five polypeptides, with the largest remaining one (molecular weight congruent to 20 X 10(3)) present in less than stoichiometric amounts. This interconversion and subunit removal has been monitored by exclusion chromatography, four systems of acrylamide gel electrophoresis--some with the protein labeled with 125I under denaturing conditions--isoelectric focusing, and hydrodynamic methods. It has virtually no effect on heme a and copper content and on the catalytic parameters of the enzymes. We conclude that subunits I and II in enzymes from fungal, and subunit I in those from animal, sources are dispensable for the catalysis of the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by, and are probably not essential for the attatchment of prosthetic groups to, these proteins."

The highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation analyses, and immunochemical determinations. The weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000. Amino acid analyses indicated a minimum of 110 amino acid residues per molecule. By determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation from the amino acid analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for the polypeptide was 12,200. Carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f equimolar amounts of amnnose, galactose, and glucosamine, and the carbohydrate portion constituted 7.5% of the total weight. The amino acid analyses suggested that thyroxine-binding globulin is composed of 4 subunits. Molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights 52,000, 25,000, and 13,500, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1484192443,"The interactions of cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated. Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The complex was stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a 1-65 heme peptide from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices. All results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c1 was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the methionine-80 side of the heme crevice."
https://openalex.org/W1921800821,"Rabbit liver purine nucleoside phosphorylase (purine nucleoside: orthophosphate ribosyltransferase EC 2.4.2.1.) was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Homogeneity was established by disc gel electrophoresis in presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and isoelectric focusing. Molecular weights of 46,000 and 39,000 were determined, respectively, by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Product inhibition was observed with guanine and hypoxanthine as strong competitive inhibitors for the enzymatic phosphorolysis of guanosine. Respective Kis calculated were 1.25 x 10(-5) M for guanine and 2.5 x 10(-5) M for hypoxanthine. Ribose 1-phosphate, another product of the reaction, gave noncompetitive inhibition with guanosine as variable substrate, and an inhibition constant of 3.61 x 10(-4) M was calculated. The protection of essential --SH groups on the enzyme, by 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, was necessary for the maintenance of enzyme activity. Noncompetitive inhibition was observed for p-chloromercuribenzoate with an inhibition constant of 5.68 x 10(-6)M. Complete reversal of this inhibition by an excess of 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol was demonstrated. In the presence of methylene blue, the enzyme showed a high sensitivity to photooxidation and a dependence of photoinactivation on pH, strongly implicating histidine as the susceptible group at the active site of the enzyme. The pKa values determined for ionizable groups of the active site of the enzyme were near pH 5.5 and pH 8.5 The chemical and kinetic evidences suggest that histidine and cysteine may be essential for catalysis. Inorganic orthophosphate (Km 1.54 x 10(-2) M) was an obligatory anion requirement, and arsenate substituted for phosphate with comparable results. Guanosine (Km 5.00 x 10(-5) M), deoxyguanosine (Km 1.00 x 10(-4)M) and inosine (Km 1.33 x 10(-4)M), were substrates for enzymatic phosphorolysis. Xanthosine was an extremely poor substrate, and adenosine was not phosphorylyzed at 20-fold excess of the homogeneous enzyme. Guanine (Km 1.82 x 10(-5)M),ribose 1-phosphate (Km 1.34 x 10(-4) M) and hypoxanthine were substrates for the reverse reaction, namely, the enzymatic synthesis of nucleosides. The initial velocity studies of the saturation of the enzyme with guanosine, at various fixed concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate, suggest a sequential bireactant catalytic mechanism for the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1572798553,"Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit. The ratio of the apparent association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14. The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+ concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration. When corrections are made for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800. From the effect of pH on the relative binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X 10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees. Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1521226608,"Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the phase without greatly affecting the phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that fast and slow phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate."
https://openalex.org/W1605731203,"The principal component of normal adult human hemoglobin Ao, was equilibrated under various conditions with 13CO2. In addition, derivatives containing specifically carbamylated NH2-terinal groups in alpha or beta chains, or both, were prepared by treatment with cyanate, and equilibrated likewise to allow the identification of specific resonances observed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. In deoxyhemoglobin, a resonanance at 29.2 ppm upfield of external CS2 was assigned to the alpha chain terminal adduct, and one at 29.8 ppm to the beta chain terminal adduct. In the liganded state as the CO derivative, the terminal adduct on both chains showed a common resonance position at 29.8 ppm. Small effects of pH on the resonance positions were observed. Under certain conditions, a resonance was observed at 33.4 ppm, probably not ascribable to a carbamino compound. A carbamino resonance that became prominent at higher pH was found at 28.4 ppm, and is tentatively ascribed to one or more adducts on epsilon amino groups. The beta chain resonances in particular are minimized by the presence of inositol hexaphosphate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Quantitative analysis of the resonance intensities shows that the effects of conversion from the deoxy to the liganded state in reducing the degree of carbamino adduct is much more pronounced for the beta than for the alpha chains."
https://openalex.org/W1536525577,"The observed static difference spectrum produced by inositol hexaphosphate binding to methemoglobin is the sum of a very fast and a slow spectral transition. The more rapid absorbance change is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques, whereas the slow change exhibits a half-time in the range 1 to 6 s. From the pH dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies, the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol hexaphosphate binding and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups. In contrast, the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion (less than 10%) of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin. While the rapid spectral transition cannot be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous deoxyhemoglobin, the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a deoxyhemoglobin A-like conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1509707135,"Cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight: 850,000 (protein 16), of one-half (protein 8), and of one-quarter of this value (protein 4). The forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting cholesterol to 3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (side chain cleavage) (Shikita, M., and Hall, P.F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5606). To determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Regardless of the form of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16. No activity was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4. These findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e. the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria. Forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1543387421,"The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone. A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol. Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to 50%. This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Other chelators, e.g. o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect. The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA treatment and dialysis against buffer. Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1 mM could restore the binding to normal levels. Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels. The triiodothyronine cytosol binding activity was nondialyzable, heat-labile. pH-dependent, pronase-digestible, but unaffected by incubation with trypsin, RNase, and DNase, suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins. Scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine binding by the cytosol of different tissues, revealed Kassoc of 7.1 x 10(6) M(-1), 11.6 x 10(6) M(-1), 3.6 X 10(6) M(-1), and 68.0 x 10(6) M(-1) for tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1499039064,"A method is described for the extensive purification of acid deoxyribonuclease (acid DNase) and its specific inhibitor from beef liver, the existence of which had been only supported by indirect evidence. By the use of insolubilized acid deoxyribonuclease, eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been detected. One of them (molecular weight, 59,000) was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of DNase preparations. Acid DNase (free of phosphodiesterase) and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of acid DNase and its inhibitor are, respectively, 26,500 and 21,500; those of other proteins range from 17,000 to 112,000. The properties of beef liver acid DNase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources. The same alteration of DNase kinetics by this inhibitor, as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed; the sigmoidal shape observed at pH 5 for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing pH. We have also demonstrated that RNA, which inhibits the acid DNase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site, is able, like the substrate, to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme."

Only limited , nonlinear glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives are employed as acyl substrate. With oleyl-ACP as substrate, maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees, over a broad pH range (6.0 to 8.5) and did not require a divalent metal cation. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated enzyme-activity 15 to 20%. When oleyl-ACP or palmityl-ACP was employed as sole acyl group donor, the major products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and monoglyceride.

However, there was a marked increase in NADH, but no change in NADPH with onset of acid secretion. The increase in the lactate to pyruvate ratio showed that the increased NADH level occurred in the cytoplasm and these data are discussed with reference to change in cell pH."

The decrease in the rate of active sites shows a linear dependence on the square of the concentration of active sites remaining at equilibrium. The kinetic data of the reaction have been correlated with equilibrium measurements. Rate constants for formation and dissociation of dimer are 9.45 X 10(3) M(-1)S(-1) and 1.9 S(-1)., respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1516511969,"Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1529443786,"Two new double-headed protease inhibitors from black-eyed peas have amino acid compositions typical of the low molecular weight protease inhibitors from legume seeds. Black-eyed pea chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor (BEPCI) contains no tryptophan, 1 tyrosine, and 14 half-cystines out of 83 amino acid residues per monomer. Black-eyed pea trypsin inhibitor (BEPTI) contains no tryptophan, 1 tyrosine, and 14 half-cystines out of 75 residues per monomer. The molar extinctions at 280 nm are 2770 for BEPCI and 3440 for BEPTI. The single tyrosyl residue is very inaccessible to solvent in native BEPCI and BEPTI at neutral pH and titrates anomalously with an apparent pK = 12. Ionization of tyrosine is complete in 13 hours above pH 12. No heterogeneity of the local environment of the tyrosyl residues in different subunits can be detected spectrophotometrically. The large number of cystine residues leads to an intense and complex near-ultraviolet CD spectrum with cystine contributions in the regions of 248 and 280 nm and tyrosine contributions at 233 and 280 nm. An intact disulfide structure is required for appearance of the tyrosyl CD bands. The inhibitors are unusually resistant to denaturation when compared with similar low molecular weight proteins of high disulfide content. All observations are consistent with a far more rigid structure for BEPCI and BEPTI than for a typical protein."
https://openalex.org/W1578878634,"The binding of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to human methemoglobin causes a perturbation of the visible heme abosrption spectrum which is expressed by an increase in absorbance in the high spin band regions, 480 to 510 nm and 590 to 640 nm, concomitant with a decrease in absorbance in the alpha- and beta-band absorption regions. The pH dependence of the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-induced difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a 5% shift toward higher spin of the aquo form of methemoglobin, a 15% shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form, and a shift in the apparent pKa for the water to hydroxide transition from 7.92 to 8.04 when mercurial is bound. The rate of these heme abosrbance changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the beta93 cysteine, mercury-mercaptide bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers, even though the latter, slow process does follow mercurial binding. The observation of an increase in spin produced by the binding of a reagent which also promotes dimer formation argues strongly against any direct correlation between an increase in spin and the appearance of deoxyhemoglobin-like conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2090661160,"Abstract We described earlier the facilitated purifications of the trypsin and aminopeptidase components present in Pronase (Vosbeck, K. D., Chow, K. -F., and Awad, W. M., Jr. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6029-6034). A partially resolved protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column. By this means, a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases. Further purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by refiltration through the same Sephadex column and by CM-cellulose chromatography. A single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis; analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular weight of 30,300. This enzyme demonstrates activity against Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-L-leucine and hippuryl-D,L-phenyllactate; no activity was found against Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, Nalpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, or L-leuckne-p-nitroanilide. The maximum activity lies between pH values of 7 and 8; the enzyme is stable between pH values of 6 and 10. At room temperature 1,10-phenanthroline inactivates the enzyme completely whereas EDTA has no effect. Of the many cations tested, only Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ restores activity to the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme; Co2+ provided 3 times the native activity. The metal in the native protein was found to be zinc. These findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein, as in previously noted examples of homology of three Pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine enzymes."
