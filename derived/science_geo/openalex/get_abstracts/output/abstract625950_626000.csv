https://openalex.org/W2908695599,"Phage therapy is drawing more interest as antibiotic resistance becomes an ever more serious threat to public health. Bacterial biofilms represent a major obstacle in the fight against bacterial infections as they are inherently refractory to many types of antibiotics. Treating biofilms with phage has shown promise in a handful of experimental and case studies. However, quantification of the effect of phage combined with antibiotics is needed to pave the way for larger clinical trials. Here we explore the effect of using phage in combination with a total of nine antibiotics, applied simultaneously or as a pretreatment before antibiotics are applied to in vitro biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Most antibiotics alone were ineffective at low concentration (2×MIC), but the addition of phage to treatment regimens led to substantial improvements in efficacy. At high concentration (10×MIC), antibiotics alone were effective, and in most cases the addition of phage to treatment regimens did not improve efficacy. Using phage with rifampin was also very effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant strains during the course of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2909960869,"Recent studies have revealed the mutational signatures underlying the somatic evolution of cancer, and the prevalences of associated somatic genetic variants. Here we estimate the intensity of positive selection that drives mutations to high frequency in tumors, yielding higher prevalences than expected on the basis of mutation and neutral drift alone. We apply this approach to a sample of 525 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma exomes, producing a rank-ordered list of gene variants by selection intensity. Our results illustrate the complementarity of calculating the intensity of selection on mutations along with tallying the prevalence of individual substitutions in cancer: while many of the most prevalently-altered genes were heavily selected, their relative importance to the cancer phenotype differs from their prevalence and from their P value, with some infrequent variants exhibiting evidence of strong positive selection. Furthermore, we extend our analysis of effect size by quantifying the degree to which mutational processes (such as APOBEC mutagenesis) contributes mutations that are highly selected, driving head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We calculate the substitutions caused by APOBEC mutagenesis that make the greatest contribution to cancer phenotype among patients. Lastly, we demonstrate via in vitro biochemical experiments that the APOBEC3B protein can deaminate the cytosine bases at two sites whose mutant states are subject to high net realized selection intensities-PIK3CA E545K and E542K. By quantifying the effects of mutations, we deepen the molecular understanding of carcinogenesis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2909386406,"The grammar, or syntax, of human language is typically understood in terms of abstract hierarchical structures. However, theories of language processing that emphasize sequential information, not hierarchy, successfully model diverse phenomena. Recent work probing brain signals has shown mixed evidence for hierarchical information in some tasks. We ask whether sequential or hierarchical information guides the expectations that a human listener forms about a word's part-of-speech when simply listening to every-day language. We compare the predictions of three computational models against electroencephalography signals recorded from human participants who listen passively to an audiobook story. We find that predictions based on hierarchical structure correlate with the human brain response above-and-beyond predictions based only on sequential information. This establishes a link between hierarchical linguistic structure and neural signals that generalizes across the range of syntactic structures found in every-day language."

Analysing such data comes with several challenges that are largely shared across acquisition platform and paradigms. Here, we present rethomics, a set of R packages that unifies the analysis of behavioural datasets in an efficient and flexible manner. rethomics offers a computational solution to storing, manipulating and visualising large amounts of behavioural data. We propose it as a tool to bridge the gap between behavioural biology and data sciences, thus connecting computational and behavioural scientists. rethomics comes with a extensive documentation as well as a set of both practical and theoretical tutorials (available at https://rethomics.github.io)."
https://openalex.org/W2909045101,"There is increasing concern about online communities that promote eating disorder (ED) behaviors through messages and/or images that encourage a “thin ideal” (i.e., promotion of thinness as attractive) and harmful weight loss/weight control practices. The purpose of this paper is to assess the content of body image and ED-related content on Twitter and provide a deeper understanding of EDs that may be used for future studies and online-based interventions. Tweets containing ED or body image-related keywords were collected from January 1-January 31, 2015 (N = 28,642). A random sample (n = 3000) was assessed for expressions of behaviors that align with subscales of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) 16.0. Demographic characteristics were inferred using a social media analytics company. The comprehensive research that we conducted indicated that 2,584 of the 3,000 tweets were ED-related; 65% expressed a preoccupation with body shape, 13% displayed issues related to food/eating/calories, and 4% expressed placing a high level of importance on body weight. Most tweets were sent by girls (90%) who were ≤19 years old (77%). Our findings stress a need to better understand if and how ED-related content on social media can be used for targeting prevention and intervention messages towards those who are in-need and could potentially benefit from these efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2910722456,"Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2), a protein belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is overexpressed in multiple cancers and promotes angiogenesis to drive cancer progression. The mechanisms controlling AGR2 abundance in cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we observed that AGR2 expression is significantly suppressed by proteasome inhibitor MG132/bortezomib at mRNA and protein levels in lung cancer cells. MG132-mediated repression of AGR2 transcription was independent of ROS generation and ER stress induction, but partially resulted from the downregulated E2F1. Further investigation revealed that MG132 facilitated polyubiquitinated AGR2 degradation through activation of autophagy, as evidenced by predominant restoration of AGR2 level in cells genetic depletion of Atg5 and Atg7, or by autophagy inhibitors. Activation of autophagy by rapamycin noticeably reduced the AGR2 protein in cells and in the mouse tissue samples administrated with bortezomib. We also provided evidence identifying the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugating onto K89 of AGR2 by an E3 ligase UBR5. In addition, an autophagy receptor NBR1 was demonstrated to be important in polyubiquitinated AGR2 clearance in response to MG132 or bortezomib. Importantly, downregulation of AGR2 by proteasome inhibition significantly enhanced antitumor activity of bevacizumab, highlighting the importance of AGR2 as a predictive marker for selection of subgroup patients in chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2803779552,"Authorship is the currency of an academic career for which the number of papers researchers publish demonstrates creativity, productivity, and impact. To discourage coercive authorship practices and inflated publication records, journals require authors to affirm and detail their intellectual contributions but this strategy has been unsuccessful as authorship lists continue to grow. Here, we surveyed close to 6000 of the top cited authors in all science categories with a list of 25 research activities that we adapted from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) authorship guidelines. Responses varied widely from individuals in the same discipline, same level of experience, and same geographic region. Most researchers agreed with the NIH criteria and grant authorship to individuals who draft the manuscript, analyze and interpret data, and propose ideas. However, thousands of the researchers also value supervision and contributing comments to the manuscript, whereas the NIH recommends discounting these activities when attributing authorship. People value the minutiae of research beyond writing and data reduction: researchers in the humanities value it less than those in pure and applied sciences; individuals from Far East Asia and Middle East and Northern Africa value these activities more than anglophones and northern Europeans. While developing national and international collaborations, researchers must recognize differences in peoples values while assigning authorship."
https://openalex.org/W2909805239,"People who avoid eating animals tend to share their homes with animal companions, and moral dilemma may arise when they are faced with feeding animal products to their omnivorous dogs and carnivorous cats. One option to alleviate this conflict is to feed pets a diet devoid of animal ingredients-a 'plant-based' or 'vegan' diet. The number of pet owners who avoid animal products, either in their own or in their pets' diet, is not currently known. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of meat-avoiding pet owners, identify concerns regarding conventional animal- and plant-based pet food, and estimate the number of pets fed a plant-based diet. A questionnaire was disseminated online to English-speaking pet owners (n = 3,673) to collect data regarding pet owner demographics, diet, pet type, pet diet, and concerns regarding pet foods. Results found that pet owners were more likely to be vegetarian (6.2%; 229/3,673) or vegan (5.8%; 212/3,673) than previously reported for members of the general population. With the exception of one dog owned by a vegetarian, vegans were the only pet owners who fed plant-based diets to their pets (1.6%; 59/3,673). Of the pet owners who did not currently feed plant-based diets but expressed interest in doing so, a large proportion (45%; 269/599) desired more information demonstrating the nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets. Amongst all pet owners, the concern most commonly reported regarding meat-based pet foods was for the welfare of farm animals (39%; 1,275/3,231). The most common concern regarding strictly plant-based pet foods was regarding the nutritional completeness of the diet (74%; 2,439/3,318). Amongst vegans, factors which predicted the feeding of plant-based diets to their pets were concern regarding the cost of plant-based diets, a lack of concern regarding plant-based diets being unnatural, and reporting no concern at all regarding plant-based diets for pets. Given these findings, further research is warranted to investigate plant-based nutrition for domestic dogs and cats."

Pregnenolone has previously been considered an inactive steroid without any biological function by itself other than serving as the precursor for other steroid hormones. However, its anti-inflammatory and anti-fatigability properties were already recognized in the 1930s (10Henderson E. Weinberg M. Wright W.A. Pregnenolone.J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Pregnenolone has been in use as an anti-inflammatory agent and as a steroid for well-being for several decades (12Pincus G. Hoagland H.

However, the mechanism by which pregnenolone exerts its anti-inflammatory property remains unknown. In general, steroids exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by binding to their intracellular receptors. Subsequently, these receptors translocate to the nucleus to negatively regulate genes associated with the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (14Rhen T. Cidlowski J.A. Antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids: new mechanisms for old drugs.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353 (16236742): 1711-172310.1056/NEJMra050541Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Progesterone, which is the metabolic derivative of pregnenolone, has been reported to exert its effects through progesterone receptors (15Brinton R.D. Thompson R.F. Foy M.R. Baudry M. Wang J.

However, a specific receptor for the genomic action of pregnenolone has so far not been identified. Studies have revealed some of the nongenomic targets of pregnenolone, such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP170) (17Fontaine-Lenoir V. Chambraud B. Fellous A. David S. Duchossoy Y. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) is a neurosteroid receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pregnenolone interacts with MAP-2, which enhances microtubule polymerization and facilitates neural growth and plasticity (17Fontaine-Lenoir V. Chambraud B. Fellous A. David S. Duchossoy Y. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) is a neurosteroid receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CLIP170 is a microtubule plus end–tracking protein involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of microtubule dynamics, cell migration, mitosis, and intracellular transport. Pregnenolone has been reported to activate autoinhibited CLIP170, which promotes microtubule polymerization and cell migration in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells (18Weng J.H. Liang M.R. Chen C.H. Tong S.K. Huang T.C. Lee S.P. Chen Y.R. Chen C.T. Chung B.C. Pregnenolone activates CLIP-170 to promote microtubule growth and cell migration.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 (23955365): 636-64210.1038/nchembio.1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although limited experimental data are available regarding how pregnenolone modulates microtubule dynamics, the targets of its anti-inflammatory properties remain obscure. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial components of innate immunity, and their aberrant activation leads to various inflammatory disorders. TLR2 and TLR4, which detect a wide range of pathogen-associated molecular patters and endogenous ligands, play a crucial role in various inflammatory diseases. Here we report that pregnenolone promotes the degradation of key proteins in the TLR signaling pathway. Pregnenolone induced targeted ubiquitination and degradation of the TLR2/4 adaptor protein TIRAP and also of TLR2. TIRAP functions as the bridging adaptor that recruits MyD88 to TLR2/4 receptors. Pregnenolone-induced degradation of TIRAP and TLR2 resulted in attenuation of LPS or Pam3CysSerLys4 (Pam3CSK4) mediated secretion of TNFα in macrophages and microglial cells. We previously reported that CLIP170 induces ubiquitination and degradation of TIRAP (19Jakka P. Bhargavi B. Namani S. Murugan S. Splitter G. Radhakrishnan G. Cytoplasmic linker protein CLIP170 negatively regulates TLR4 signaling by targeting the TLR adaptor protein TIRAP.J. Immunol. 2018; 200 (29222167): 704-71410.4049/jimmunol.1601559Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone induced activation of CLIP170, which enhanced its ubiquitin ligase–like property toward TIRAP and suppression of LPS-induced TLR4 signaling. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which pregnenolone suppresses activated macrophages to curb the aberrant inflammatory responses in various conditions. Pregnenolone is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties other than modulating microtubule dynamics. We investigated the effect of pregnenolone and its metabolic derivatives, such as pregnenolone sulfate, allopregnanolone, and progesterone, on secretion of TNFα by mouse and human macrophages and mouse microglial cells. RAW264.7 cells, bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs), THP1 cells, or N9 microglial cells were treated with pregnenolone or its metabolites, followed by induction with LPS or Pam3CSK4 and quantification of TNFα by ELISA and quantitative PCR. Pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, and progesterone significantly suppressed LPS- or Pam3CSK4-induced TNFα in macrophages as well as in microglial cells (Fig. 1, A–D, and Fig. S1, A and B). Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with increasing concentrations of pregnenolone suppressed TNFα secretion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, E and F). Pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, and progesterone could also suppress IL-6 in LPS- or Pam3CSK4-induced RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1, G and H). We did not observe suppression of LPS-induced IFN-β in RAW264.7 cells, which indicates that pregnenolone or it metabolites do not affect the MyD88-independent pathway of TLR4 signaling (Fig. S2A). Next we analyzed the expression levels of TIRAP and MyD88 in RAW264.7 cells treated with pregnenolone or its metabolites. We observed down-regulation of TIRAP expression in cells treated with allopregnenolone or progesterone (Fig. S2B). Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators by progesterone has been reported upon stimulation with LPS (16Lei B. Mace B. Dawson H.N. Warner D.S. Laskowitz D.T. James M.L. Anti-inflammatory effects of progesterone in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV-2 microglia.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25080336)e10396910.1371/journal.pone.0103969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Other compounds did not affect the expression of TIRAP or MyD88 (Fig. S2, B and C). Taken together, our experimental data suggest that pregnenolone and its metabolites can efficiently suppress TLR2- and TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling. TIRAP serves as the bridging adaptor that recruits myD88 to membrane-bound TLR2 and TLR4 to initiate the signaling cascade (20Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125 (16751103): 943-95510.1016/j.cell.2006.03.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Targeted degradation of TIRAP is reported to occur in immune cells, which negatively regulates TLR2/4 signaling to maintain cellular homeostasis after their stimulation. The suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 protein has been reported to play a key role in this process; it induces targeted ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of TIRAP (21Mansell A. Smith R. Doyle S.L. Gray P. Fenner J.E. Crack P.J. Nicholson S.E. Hilton D.J. O'Neill L.A. Hertzog P.J. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 negatively regulates Toll-like receptor signaling by mediating Mal degradation.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7 (16415872): 148-15510.1038/ni1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Recently, our studies have revealed that the microtubule plus end–binding protein CLIP170 also promotes enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of TIRAP, which negatively regulates TLR2/4 signaling. CLIP170 has been shown to exist in a circular autoinhibited conformation to prevent its nonproductive interaction with other proteins (22Lansbergen G. Komarova Y. Modesti M. Wyman C. Hoogenraad C.C. Goodson H.V. Lemaitre R.P. Drechsel D.N. van Munster E. Gadella Jr., T.W. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Borisy G.G. Akhmanova A. Conformational changes in CLIP-170 regulate its binding to microtubules and dynactin localization.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166 (15381688): 1003-101410.1083/jcb.200402082Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone has been reported to interact with CLIP170, which relieves its autoinhibition and promotes its activity. Therefore, we sought to examine whether treatment of cells with pregnenolone induces degradation of TIRAP. We overexpressed FLAG-TIRAP in HEK293T cells by transient transfection, followed by treatment of cells with various concentrations of pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, allopregnenolone, progesterone, and the precursor of pregnenolone, cholesterol, for 1 h. Next, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting to detect the levels of FLAG-TIRAP. We observed enhanced degradation of FLAG-TIRAP with increasing concentrations of pregnenolone (Fig. 2A). Treatment with pregnenolone sulfate or allopregnenolone induced slight degradation, whereas progesterone or cholesterol did not affect the level of FLAG-TIRAP (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we analyzed the degradation of TIRAP in the presence of pregnenolone in vitro. The lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-TIRAP were mixed with pregnenolone, followed by analysis of the levels of FLAG-TIRAP at various time points. We observed enhanced degradation of FLAG-TIRAP with increasing time in the presence of pregnenolone (Fig. 2C). Degradation of FLAG-TIRAP was not observed in cells co-treated with pregnenolone and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2D). To examine whether pregnenolone-induced degradation is specific for TIRAP, we examined the degradation of MyD88, which serves as the sorting adaptor for TLR2/4 signaling. HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-MyD88 were treated with various concentrations of pregnenolone or its derivatives. We did not observe degradation of FLAG-MyD88 in the presence of pregnenolone or its metabolic derivatives (Fig. 2, E and F). To further confirm the pregnenolone-induced degradation of TIRAP, we analyzed the endogenous level of TIRAP in RAW264.7, mouse primary peritoneal macrophages and microglial cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of pregnenolone or pregnenolone sulfate, followed by detection of endogenous levels of TIRAP and MyD88 by immunoblotting. Pregnenolone promoted the degradation of endogenous TIRAP in both macrophages and microglial cells, whereas it did not affect the level of MyD88 (Fig. 2, G and H, and Fig. S3). As observed before, pregnenolone sulfate induced slight degradation of TIRAP (Fig. 2, G and H). The experimental data clearly indicate that pregnenolone promotes enhanced degradation of TIRAP in mammalian cells. Pregnenolone attenuated LPS or Pam3CSK-induced signaling, which are mediated by TLR4 and TLR2 receptors, respectively. Next, we analyzed whether pregnenolone promotes degradation of TLRs. HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged TLR2, TLR4, or TLR9 were treated with pregnenolone, followed by detection of FLAG-tagged proteins. Pregnenolone induced degradation of FLAG-TLR2, but it did not affect the level of FLAG-TLR4 or FLAG-TLR9 (Fig. 3A). To further examine the degradation of TLR2, HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-TLR2 were treated with pregnenolone or its metabolic derivatives, followed by detection of FLAG-tagged proteins by immunoblotting. We observed enhanced degradation of FLAG-TLR2 with pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate, and allopregnanolone, whereas progesterone or cholesterol did not affect the level of FLAG-TLR2 (Fig. 3, B and C). Further, we analyzed the degradation of FLAG-TLR2 in vitro, which indicated enhanced degradation of FLAG-TLR2 in pregnenolone-treated samples (Fig. 3D). Next, we examined the degradation of endogenous TLR2 in macrophages and microglial cells. RAW264.7 or N9 microglial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of pregnenolone, followed by detection of TLR2 by immunoblotting. Enhanced degradation of TLR2 was observed with pregnenolone, especially at the higher concentration (Fig. 3, E and F). These studies indicate that, in addition to TIRAP, pregnenolone also targets TLR2 for degradation. In eukaryotes, ubiquitination of substrate protein is a prerequisite for proteasome-mediated degradation. Therefore, we analyzed whether pregnenolone enhances the ubiquitination TIRAP or TLR2. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged TIRAP or TLR2 and HA-ubiquitin, followed by treatment of cells with pregnenolone. Next, FLAG-TIRAP or FLAG-TLR2 were immunoprecipitated, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody to detect the ubiquitin-conjugated substrates. We observed enhanced ubiquitination of FLAG-TIRAP and FLAG-TLR2 in the presence of pregnenolone (Fig. 3, G and H). The experimental data indicate that pregnenolone promotes ubiquitination of TIRAP and TLR2 to induce its degradation. Pregnenolone has been shown to interact with the coiled-coil domain of CLIP170, which relieves its autoinhibition and enhances its interaction with microtubule resulting CLIP170-dependent microtubule polymerization and microtubule abundance in zebrafish embryos (18Weng J.H. Liang M.R. Chen C.H. Tong S.K. Huang T.C. Lee S.P. Chen Y.R. Chen C.T. Chung B.C. Pregnenolone activates CLIP-170 to promote microtubule growth and cell migration.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 (23955365): 636-64210.1038/nchembio.1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We examined the pregnenolone-induced activation of CLIP170 by FRET analysis. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids harboring YFP-CLIP170-CFP, YFP-CLIP170-K1-CFP, or CFP-YFP tandem. A plasmid harboring YFP-CLIP170-K1-CFP served as the negative control, where a mutation in the first zinc knuckle of CLIP170 abolished the interaction between NH2 and C termini, whereas CFP-YFP served as the positive control. Next, the cell lysates were incubated with pregnenolone or vehicle, followed by analysis of fluorescent spectra of the lysates. The samples were excited at 425 nm, where the CFP acted as a donor, and YFP served as an acceptor. The cell lysate that expressed CFP-YFP tandem exhibited marked acceptor emission after donor excitation because of FRET (Table S1). The cell extract that contained the YFP-CLIP170-CFP fusion exhibited a higher ratio of fluorescence at acceptor emission compared with YFP-CLIP-170-K1-CFP. The ratio of YFP to CFP fluorescence emission was decreased upon treatment of the YFP-CLIP170-CFP lysate with pregnenolone compared with the lysates treated with DMSO vehicle control (Table S1). The experimental data suggest that pregnenolone relieves the folded-back state of CLIP170 that separates the NH2 and C termini, thereby decreasing the ratio of YFP to CFP fluorescence emission. We previously reported that CLIP170 promotes enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of TIRAP, which attenuated TLR2/4-mediated signaling (19Jakka P. Bhargavi B. Namani S. Murugan S. Splitter G. Radhakrishnan G. Cytoplasmic linker protein CLIP170 negatively regulates TLR4 signaling by targeting the TLR adaptor protein TIRAP.J. Immunol. 2018; 200 (29222167): 704-71410.4049/jimmunol.1601559Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because pregnenolone induces activation of CLIP170, we sought to analyze whether pregnenolone enhances the TIRAP degradation and TLR suppression properties of CLIP170. RAW264.7 macrophages overexpressing FLAG-TIRAP and MYC-CLIP170 were treated with pregnenolone or DMSO followed by immunoblotting to detect the level of FLAG-TIRAP. The degradation of FLAG-TIRAP appeared to be enhanced further in the presence of pregnenolone in MYC-CLIP170- and FLAG-TIRAP–overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A). We observed that pregnenolone promoted enhanced ubiquitination of TIRAP (Fig. 3G). CLIP170 has been reported to exhibit a ubiquitin ligase–like property toward TIRAP (19Jakka P. Bhargavi B. Namani S. Murugan S. Splitter G. Radhakrishnan G. Cytoplasmic linker protein CLIP170 negatively regulates TLR4 signaling by targeting the TLR adaptor protein TIRAP.J. Immunol. 2018; 200 (29222167): 704-71410.4049/jimmunol.1601559Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because pregnenolone activates CLIP170, we wished to examine whether pregnenolone enhances the ubiquitin ligase property of CLIP170. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-TIRAP, MYC-CLIP170, and HA-ubiquitin in various combinations, followed by treatment of cells with pregnenolone. Cells overexpressing CLIP170, which was treated with pregnenolone, exhibited more FLAG-TIRAP ubiquitination compared with DMSO-treated samples (Fig. 4B). This suggests that pregnenolone-induced activation of CLIP170 enhances its ubiquitin ligase property toward TIRAP. Next, we analyzed CLIP170-induced suppression of TLR4 signaling in the presence of pregnenolone. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the CLIP170 expression plasmid or CLIP170 endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA (esiRNA), followed by treatment with pregnenolone. Cells were then induced with LPS, and we quantified the secreted TNFα. An enhanced level of TNFα suppression was observed by CLIP170 in the presence of pregnenolone (Fig. 4C). The effect of pregnenolone was reduced in CLIP170-silenced macrophages, as an elevated level of TNFα was observed in CLIP170-silenced macrophages compared with the nontargeting control (Fig. 4D). The experimental data suggest that pregnenolone enhances the TLR4 suppression property of CLIP170 by promoting its activation. In addition to acting as the precursor of other hormones, pregnenolone has its own biological effects. Pregnenolone has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and its role in preventing neuroinflammation and enhancing neuroprotection has been well documented (4Vallée M. Mayo W. Le Moal M. Role of pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and their sulfate esters on learning and memory in cognitive aging.Brain Res.

Metabolites of pregnenolone, such as pregnenolone sulfate and allopregnanolone, have also been reported to modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuroprotection. Preclinical studies have shown that pregnenolone exhibits antidepressant properties, improves memory and cognitive functions, controls pain and stress, and relieves symptoms of mood disorder. However, the molecular mechanism behind the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions of pregnenolone remains largely unknown. Glucocorticoids exert their immunosuppressive effect by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (23Lázár Jr, G. Duda E. Lázár G. Effect of RU 38486 on TNF production and toxicity.FEBS Lett. 1992; 308 (1499722): 137-14010.1016/0014-5793(92)81261-JCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, pregnenolone is believed to use a glucocorticoid receptor–independent mechanism to suppress the inflammatory response, as mifepristone, which antagonizes the glucocorticoid receptor, did not affect the immunosuppressive property of pregnenolone (24Di Santo E. Sironi M. Mennini T. Zinetti M. Savoldi G. Di Lorenzo D. Ghezzi P. A glucocorticoid receptor-independent mechanism for neurosteroid inhibition of tumor necrosis factor production.Eur. J.

In contrast, mifepristone, which also blocks the progesterone receptor, has been shown to neutralize the anti-inflammatory property of progesterone in BV2 microglial cells (16Lei B. Mace B. Dawson H.N. Warner D.S. Laskowitz D.T. James M.L. Anti-inflammatory effects of progesterone in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV-2 microglia.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25080336)e10396910.1371/journal.pone.0103969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CLIP170 has been identified as one of the subcellular targets of pregnenolone (18Weng J.H. Liang M.R. Chen C.H. Tong S.K. Huang T.C. Lee S.P. Chen Y.R. Chen C.T. Chung B.C.

The membrane stabilization of Fpn is also stimulated by its interaction with a 22-amino acid synthetic peptide based on a short sequence in the extracellular E2 domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, whether APP family members interact with Fpn in vivo is unclear. Here, using cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged Fpn in conjunction with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions of Heph and APP family members APP, APLP1, and APLP2 in HEK293T cells we used fluorescence and surface biotinylation to quantify Fpn membrane occupancy and also measured 59Fe efflux. We demonstrate that Fpn and Heph co-localize, and FRET analysis indicated that the two proteins form an iron-efflux complex. In contrast, none of the full-length, cellular APP proteins exhibited Fpn co-localization or FRET. Moreover, iron supplementation increased surface expression of the iron-efflux complex, and copper depletion knocked down Heph activity and decreased Fpn membrane localization. Whereas cellular APP species had no effects on Fpn and Heph localization, addition of soluble E2 elements derived from APP and APLP2, but not APLP1, increased Fpn membrane occupancy.

https://openalex.org/W2910062398,"The role of parasitic sea lice (Siphonostomatoida; Caligidae), especially Lepeophtheirus salmonis, in the epidemiology of Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAv) has long been suspected. The epidemiological studies conducted during the 1998 major Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) outbreak in Scotland demonstrated a strong correlation between sea lice presence and ISAv positive sites or subsequent clinical outbreaks of ISA. The question posed from this observation was “do sea lice infestations on Atlantic salmon make them more susceptible to viral infections?” This study investigated the role that sea lice infestations have on the severity of ISAv infections and disease mortality in experimental populations of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A series of experiments was carried out that investigated the potential of sea lice to modify the outcome of an ISAv infection. Experimental populations of Atlantic salmon were established that had: no lice and no ISAv, a single infection with either ISAv or lice and a co-infection with lice then ISAV. The results were quite clear, the process of infestation by the parasite prior to ISAv exposure significantly increased the mortality and death rates of Atlantic salmon, when compared to uninfected controls and ISAv infected groups only. This was consistent over two source strains of Atlantic salmon (Pennobscot and Saint John River), but the severity and timing was altered. Immunological responses were also consistent in that pro-inflammatory genes were induced in lice only and co-infected fish, whereas the anti-viral response, Mx, MH class I β, Galectin 9 and TRIM 16, 25 genes were down-regulated by lice infection prior to and shortly after co-infection with ISAv. It is concluded that the sea lice settlement on Atlantic salmon and the parasite’s subsequent manipulation of the host’s immune system, which increases parasite settlement success, also increased susceptibility to ISAv."
https://openalex.org/W2908020403,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating disorder characterized by diffuse inflammation and edema formation. The main management strategy, low tidal volume ventilation, can be associated with the development of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic candidate currently in early-phase clinical trials. The effects of HCA on the alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium are not well established. The therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has never been reported in HCA. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of HCA on inflammatory response and reparative potential of the primary human small airway epithelial and lung microvasculature endothelial cells as well as on the capacity of bone marrow–derived MSCs to promote wound healing in vitro. We demonstrate that HCA attenuates the inflammatory response and reparative potential of primary human small airway epithelium and capillary endothelium and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. It was found that MSCs promote lung epithelial wound repair via the transfer of functional mitochondria; however, this proreparative effect of MSCs was lost in the setting of HCA. Therefore, HCA may adversely impact recovery from ARDS at the cellular level, whereas MSCs may not be therapeutically beneficial in patients with ARDS who develop HCA.—Fergie, N., Todd, N., McClements, L., McAuley, D., O'Kane, C., Krasnodembskaya, A.

https://openalex.org/W2910109864,"Long-term exposure to elevated levels of manganese (Mn) causes manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder with Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like symptoms. Increasing evidence suggests that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which is highly expressed in microglia and macrophages, contributes to the inflammation and neurotoxicity seen in autosomal dominant and sporadic PD. As gene-environment interactions have emerged as important modulators of PD-associated toxicity, LRRK2 may also mediate Mn-induced inflammation and pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of LRRK2 in Mn-induced toxicity using human microglial cells (HMC3), LRRK2-wild-type (WT) and LRRK2-knockout (KO) RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Results showed that Mn activated LRRK2 kinase by phosphorylation of its serine residue at the 1292 position (S1292) as a marker of its kinase activity in macrophage and microglia, while inhibition with GSK2578215A (GSK) and MLi-2 abolished Mn-induced LRRK2 activation. LRRK2 deletion and its pharmacological inhibition attenuated Mn-induced apoptosis in macrophages and microglia, along with concomitant decreases in the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein. LRRK2 deletion also attenuated Mn-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Mn-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and ERK signaling proteins was significantly attenuated in LRRK2 KO cells and GSK-treated cells. Moreover, inhibition of MAPK p38 and ERK as well as LRRK2 attenuated Mn-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity plays a critical role in Mn-induced toxicity via downstream activation of MAPK signaling in macrophage and microglia. Collectively, these results suggest that LRRK2 could be a potential molecular target for developing therapeutics to treat Mn-related neurodegenerative disorders."

Six distinct classifiers with prediction accuracies ranging from 87% to 95% are considered for the task. The proposed method of combining them takes into account the probabilities of the individual classifiers for each sample to be assigned to any of the four classes, optimizes weights for each technique by differential evolution and attains an accuracy that is significantly better than the individual results. Moreover, a degree of confidence is defined that would allow the pathologists to separate the data into two distinct sets, one that is correctly classified with a high level of confidence and the rest that would need their further attention. The tandem is also validated on other benchmark data sets. The proposed methodology proves to be efficient in improving the classification accuracy of each algorithm taken separately and performs reasonably well on other data sets, even with default weights. In addition, by establishing a degree of confidence the method becomes more viable for use by actual practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W2909647557,"The prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve individuals remains stable in most developed countries despite a decrease in the prevalence of acquired drug resistance. This suggests that persistence and further transmission of HIV-1 that encodes transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) is occurring in ART-naïve individuals. In this study, we analysed the prevalence and persistence of TDRMs in the protease and reverse transcriptase-sequences of ART-naïve patients within the German HIV-1 Seroconverter Study Cohort who were infected between 1996 and 2017. The prevalence of TDRMs and baseline susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs were assessed using the Stanford HIVdb list and algorithm. Mean survival times of TDRMs were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The overall prevalence of TDR was 17.2% (95% CI 15.7-18.6, N = 466/2715). Transmitted NNRTI resistance was observed most frequently with 7.8% (95% CI 6.8-8.8), followed by NRTI resistance (5.0%, 95% CI 4.2-5.9) and PI resistance (2.8%, 95% CI 2.2-3.4). Total TDR (OR = 0.89, p = 0.034) and transmitted NRTI resistance (OR = 0.65, p = 0.000) decreased between 1996 and 2017 but has remained stable during the last decade. Viral susceptibility to NNRTIs (6.5%-6.9% for individual drugs) was mainly reduced, while <3% of the recommended NRTIs and PIs were affected. The longest mean survival times were calculated for the NNRTI mutations K103N (5.3 years, 95% CI 4.2-5.6) and E138A/G/K (8.0 years, 95% CI 5.8-10.2 / 7.9 years, 95% CI 5.4-10.3 / 6.7 years, 95% CI 6.7-6.7) and for the NRTI mutation M41L (6.4 years, 95% CI 6.0-6.7).The long persistence of single TDRMs indicates that onward transmission from ART-naïve individuals is the main cause for TDR in Germany. Transmitted NNRTI resistance was the most frequent TDR, showing simultaneously the highest impact on baseline ART susceptibility and on TDRMs with prolonged persistence. These results give cause for concern regarding the use of NNRTI in first-line regimens."

The regulatory mechanism of PTEN protein is still not completely understood. Here, we found that Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) interacts with PTEN and regulates its stability. Overexpression of SIRT4 in cells causes down-regulation of PTEN. This regulation is independent of PTEN acetylation and ubiquitination. We further found that SIRT4 degrades PTEN through lysosome pathway mediated by insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). SIRT4 bridges PTEN and IDE for degradation in response to nutritional starvation stresses. Our results suggest that when cells were exposed to nutritional starvation, SIRT4 was induced and cooperated with IDE to degrade PTEN; low levels of PTEN promote cells to survive from cellular stress.

https://openalex.org/W2909469464,"Whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic testing of 104 strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus paralicheniformis from a variety of sources and time periods was used to characterize the genetic background and evolution of (putative) antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Core proteins were identified in draft genomes and a phylogenetic analysis based on single amino acid polymorphisms allowed the species to be separated into two phylogenetically distinct clades with one outlier. Putative antimicrobial resistance genes were identified and mapped. A chromosomal ermD gene was found at the same location in all B. paralichenformis and in 27% of B. licheniformis genomes. Erythromycin resistance correlated very well with the presence of ermD. The putative streptomycin resistance genes, aph and aadK, were found in the chromosome of all strains as adjacent loci. Variations in amino acid sequence did not correlate with streptomycin susceptibility although the species were less susceptible than other Bacillus species. A putative chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat), encoding a novel chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein was also found in the chromosome of all strains. Strains encoding a truncated CAT protein were sensitive to chloramphenicol. For all four resistance genes, the diversity and genetic context followed the overall phylogenetic relationship. No potentially mobile genetic elements were detected in their vicinity. Moreover, the genes were only distantly related to previously-described cat, aph, aad and erm genes present on mobile genetic elements or in other species. Thus, these genes are suggested to be intrinsic to B. licheniformis and B. paralicheniformis and part of their ancient resistomes. Since there is no evidence supporting horizontal transmission, these genes are not expected to add to the pool of antibiotic resistance elements considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Whole-genome based phylogenetic and sequence analysis, combined with phenotypic testing, is proposed to be suitable for determining intrinsic resistance and evolutionary relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2909991121,"Unrelenting poaching to feed the illegal trafficking of rhinoceros (rhino) horn remains the principle threat to the persistence of south-central black and southern white rhino that live in the Kruger National Park (Kruger), South Africa. Other global environmental change drivers, such as unpredictable climatic conditions, impose additional uncertainties on the management and persistence of these species. The drought experienced in Kruger over the 2015/2016 rainy season may have affected rhino population growth and thus added an additional population pressure to the poaching pressure already occurring. Under drought conditions, reduced grass biomass predicts increased natural deaths and a subsequent decrease in birth rate for the grazing white rhino. Such variance in natural death and birth rates for the browsing black rhino are not expected under these conditions. We evaluated these predictions using rhino population survey data from 2013 to 2017. Comparisons of natural deaths and birth rates between pre- (2013/2014 and 2014/15), during- (2015/2016) and post-drought (2016/2017) periods in Kruger showed increased natural mortality and decreased births for white rhino, but no significant changes for black rhino, supporting our predictions. As a result, despite reduced poaching rates, the total mortality rate of white rhino remains significantly higher than the birth rate. Decreased poaching, decreased natural deaths and no apparent drought effects in black rhino resulted in a lower total mortality rate than the estimated birth rate in 2017. Active biological management and traditional anti-poaching initiatives together therefore represent the most likely way to buffer the impacts of decreased population growth through climate change and wildlife crime on the persistence of rhinos."

In addition, we intend to provide important insights into the biology of invasion by comparing the reproductive traits of this shrimp with some of the predictions about aquatic invasive species. We used experimental and laboratory observations to evaluate the functionality of protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism (PSH), the macro and microscopic development of the ovarian portion of the ovotestes, the reproductive cycle, and the embryonic development of L. vittata. We confirm the functionality of PSH in L. vittata. This shrimp has a rapid reproductive cycle; the ovarian portion of the ovotestes develops (mean ± SD) 6.28 ± 1.61 days after spawning. Embryonic development also occurs over a short time, with a mean (± SD) of 8.37 ± 0.85 days. The larvae hatch without macroscopically visible yolk reserves. Our study provides evidence that the invasive shrimp L. vittata has reproductive and embryonic developmental characteristics (i.e., short generation time and high reproductive capacity) that may be favorable to the establishment of populations during invasive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2910602421,"A disturbance of glucose homeostasis leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the severe side effects that may occur during a prolonged use of many drugs currently available on the market. In this manuscript we describe the most common cases of drug-induced T2DM, discuss available pharmacotherapies and propose new ones. Among various pharmacotherapies of T2DM, incretin therapies have recently focused attention due to the newly determined crystal structure of incretin hormone receptor GLP1R. Incretin hormone receptors: GLP1R and GIPR together with the glucagon receptor GCGR regulate food intake and insulin and glucose secretion. Our study showed that incretin hormone receptors, named also gut hormone receptors as they are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, could potentially act as unintended targets (off-targets) for orally administrated drugs. Such off-target interactions, depending on their effect on the receptor (stimulation or inhibition), could be beneficial, like in the case of incretin mimetics, or unwanted if they cause, e.g., decreased insulin secretion. In this in silico study we examined which well-known pharmaceuticals could potentially interact with gut hormone receptors in the off-target way. We observed that drugs with the strongest binding affinity for gut hormone receptors were also reported in the medical information resources as the least disturbing the glucose homeostasis among all drugs in their class. We suggested that those strongly binding molecules could potentially stimulate GIPR and GLP1R and/or inhibit GCGR which could lead to increased insulin secretion and decreased hepatic glucose production. Such positive effect on the glucose homeostasis could compensate for other, adverse effects of pharmacotherapy which lead to drug-induced T2DM. In addition, we also described several top hits as potential substitutes of peptidic incretin mimetics which were discovered in the drug repositioning screen using gut hormone receptors structures against the ZINC15 compounds subset."
https://openalex.org/W2910367515,"Question addressed by the study The value of induction therapy in lung transplantation is controversial. According to the ISHLT, only about 50% of patients transplanted within the last 10 years received induction therapy. We reviewed our institutional experience to investigate the impact of induction therapy on short- and long-term outcomes. Materials/Patients and methods Between 2007 and 2015, 446 patients with a complete follow-up were included in this retrospective analysis. Analysis comprised long-term kidney function, infectious complications, incidence of rejection and overall survival. Results A total of 231 patients received alemtuzumab, 50 patients antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and 165 patients did not receive induction therapy (NI). The alemtuzumab group revealed the lowest rate of chronic kidney insufficiency (NI: 52.2%; ATG: 60%; alemtuzumab: 36.6%; p = 0.001). Both, the NI group (p<0.001) and the ATG group (p = 0.010) showed a significant increase of serum creatinine during follow-up compared to alemtuzumab patients. Furthermore, alemtuzumab group experienced the lowest rate of infection in the first year after transplantation. Finally, improved survival, low rates of acute cellular rejection (ACR), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) were found in patients treated either with alemtuzumab or ATG. Conclusion Alemtuzumab induction therapy followed by reduced maintenance immunosuppression is associated with a better kidney function compared to no induction and ATG. Survival rate as well as freedom from ACR and CLAD were comparable between alemtuzumab and ATG."
https://openalex.org/W2908819870,"As the sport of outdoor rock climbing rapidly grows, there is increasing pressure to understand how it can affect communities of organisms in cliff habitats. To that end, we surveyed 32 cliff sites in Boulder, Colorado, USA, and assessed the relative roles of human recreation and natural habitat features as drivers of bird diversity and activity. We detected only native avian species during our observations. Whereas avian abundance was not affected by climbing, avian species diversity and community conservation value were higher at low-use climbing formations. Models indicated that climber presence and cliff aspect were important predictors of both avian diversity and avian cliff use within our study area, while long-term climbing use frequency has a smaller, but still negative association with conservation value and cliff use by birds in the area. In contrast, the diversity of species on the cliff itself was not affected by any of our measured factors. To assess additional community dynamics, we surveyed vegetation and arthropods at ten site pairs. Climbing negatively affected lichen communities, but did not significantly affect other vegetation metrics or arthropods. We found no correlations between avian diversity and diversity of either vegetation or arthropods. Avian cliff use rate was positively correlated with arthropod biomass. We conclude that while rock climbing is associated with lower community diversity at cliffs, some common cliff-dwelling birds, arthropods and plants appear to be tolerant of climbing activity. An abiotic factor, cliff aspect strongly affected patterns of both avian diversity and cliff use, suggesting that the negative effects of rock climbing may be mitigated by informed management of cliff habitat that considers multiple site features."
https://openalex.org/W2908982806,"Norovirus infections are a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis and a significant burden on global human health. A vital process for norovirus replication is the processing of the nonstructural polyprotein by a viral protease into the viral components required to form the viral replication complex. This cleavage occurs at different rates, resulting in the accumulation of stable precursor forms. Here, we characterized how precursor forms of the norovirus protease accumulate during infection. Using stable forms of the protease precursors, we demonstrated that all of them are proteolytically active in vitro, but that when expressed in cells, their activities are determined by both substrate and protease localization. Although all precursors could cleave a replication complex-associated substrate, only a subset of precursors lacking the NS4 protein were capable of efficiently cleaving a cytoplasmic substrate. By mapping the full range of protein-protein interactions among murine and human norovirus proteins with the LUMIER assay, we uncovered conserved interactions between replication complex members that modify the localization of a protease precursor subset. Finally, we demonstrate that fusion to the membrane-bound replication complex components permits efficient cleavage of a fused substrate when active polyprotein-derived protease is provided in trans These findings offer a model for how norovirus can regulate the timing of substrate cleavage throughout the replication cycle. Because the norovirus protease represents a key target in antiviral therapies, an improved understanding of its function and regulation, as well as identification of interactions among the other nonstructural proteins, offers new avenues for antiviral drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2910014126,"Centrins (CETN1–4) are ubiquitous and conserved EF-hand–family Ca2+-binding proteins associated with the centrosome, basal body, and transition zone. Deletion of CETN1 or CETN2 in mice causes male infertility or dysosmia, respectively, without affecting photoreceptor function. However, it remains unclear to what extent centrins are redundant with each other in photoreceptors. Here, to explore centrin redundancy, we generated Cetn3GT/GT single-knockout and Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT double-knockout mice. Whereas the Cetn3 deletion alone did not affect photoreceptor function, simultaneous ablation of Cetn2 and Cetn3 resulted in attenuated scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) responses in mice at 3 months of age, with nearly complete retina degeneration at 1 year. Removal of CETN2 and CETN3 activity from the lumen of the connecting cilium (CC) destabilized the photoreceptor axoneme and reduced the CC length as early as postnatal day 22 (P22). In Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT double-knockout mice, spermatogenesis-associated 7 (SPATA7), a key organizer of the photoreceptor-specific distal CC, was depleted gradually, and CETN1 was condensed to the mid-segment of the CC. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that in this double knockout, the axoneme of the CC expanded radially at the distal end, with vertically misaligned outer segment discs and membrane whorls.

Knockout of Cetn2 in mouse also leads to dysosmia and hydrocephalus as a result of impaired olfactory ciliary trafficking of adenylate cyclase III (ACIII) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel α2 (CNGA2) and disrupted planar polarity of ependymal cilia, respectively (23Ying G.

Each connecting cilium is an elongated TZ of ∼1.1 μm length (compared with 0.2–0.5 μm in primary cilia) consisting of an array of nine microtubule doublets emanating from the basal body. It was recently found that the CC can be divided into two domains, a proximal CC corresponding to the TZ of primary cilia and a distal photoreceptor-specific CC that supports the very large photosensitive OS (26Dharmat R.

Our results show that removal of both CETN2 and CETN3 from the CC lumen leads to a widening of the distal CC microtubule doublet array similar to observations in a Spata7 knockout (26Dharmat R.

CETN1 accumulates at the mutant CC center, presumably stabilizing the proximal CC. Weakening of the distal CC axoneme leads to misalignment of discs, formation of membrane whorls, OS malformation, and progressive photoreceptors degeneration. The mouse Cetn3 gene consists of 5 exons. We generated gene-trapped Cetn3 mice (Cetn3GT/GT) in which FRT sites flanked the gene trap cassette inserted into intron 2 and LoxP sites flanked exon 3 (Fig. 1A). The presence of the gene trap truncates CETN3 after amino acid 52, producing a nonfunctional N-terminal fragment containing the first EF-hand motif (EF1). Correct gene targeting was confirmed by PCR amplification of 5′ and 3′ recombination arms, in addition to FRT and LoxP sites and DNA sequencing (Fig. 1, B and C). Cetn3GT/GT mice (Fig. 1D) were crossed with Flp mice to remove the GT cassette, generating floxed mice (Cetn3f/f), which were subsequently mated with a CMV-Cre line to delete exon 3 (Fig. 1E), thus truncating CETN3 in exon 4 in a different frame. Both the Cetn3GT/GT and Cetn3−/− mice were born in a Mendelian ratio (29 knockouts of 116 total pups (Table 1)), were viable and fertile and did not reveal syndromic ciliopathy. As reported (24Giessl A. Pulvermüller A. Trojan P. Park J.H. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U.

Eight-month-old (8m) Cetn3+/+, Cetn3GT/+, and Cetn3GT/GT mice displayed comparable scotopic a-wave (Fig. 2A), scotopic b-wave (Fig. 2B), and photopic b-wave (Fig. 2C) amplitudes at every light intensity tested. In the 1-year-old (12m) Cetn3GT/GT retina, all examined rod and cone OS proteins (including rhodopsin, guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1), PDE6, CNGA1/A3, ROM1, and S- and M-opsins) were localized correctly, the same as in the heterozygous controls (Fig. 2D). The ONL thickness and cone density of 26m Cetn3−/− and Cetn3+/+ retina cryosections were comparable and exhibited no signs of degeneration (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that, as found in Cetn1−/− and Cetn2−/− single knockouts, CETN3 is dispensable for mouse photoreceptor development and function. Mouse CETN3 and CETN2 belong to two distinct centrin subfamilies (6Salisbury J.L. A mechanistic view on the evolutionary origin for centrin-based control of centriole duplication.J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213 (17694534): 420-42810.1002/jcp.21226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but are highly similar in amino acid sequence (51% identity and 81% similarity). To investigate the functional redundancy between these two centrins, we generated Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT double knockout mice (see “Experimental procedures”). In our breeding scheme of Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT females mated with Cetn3GT/GT males, we noticed that the ratio of Cetn2−/Y;Cetn3GT/GT (29.2%, 38 of 130 total male pups) was below the expected Mendelian ratio of 50% (Table 1), indicating that some Cetn2−/Y;Cetn3GT/GT male embryos did not survive prenatal development. We reported previously that Cetn2−/− pups were born at a Mendelian ratio (23Ying G. Avasthi P. Irwin M. Gerstner C.D. Frederick J.M. Lucero M.T. Baehr W. Centrin 2 is required for mouse olfactory ciliary trafficking and development of ependymal cilia planar polarity.J.

The average litter size of the Cetn2−/Y;Cetn3GT/GT line (5.5) was smaller than observed in either the Cetn3GT/GT (6.8) or Cetn2−/− (6.7) line. Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT pups survived to adulthood and showed syndromic ciliopathy, as observed in Cetn2−/− mice, including dysosmia and hydrocephalus (not shown). To identify a retina phenotype, we examined Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT retina morphology at 1, 3, and 13 months with anti-GC1 mAb (an OS marker) and DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as a nuclear marker (Fig. 3). We found that at 1 month, the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT ONL thickness and OS length were comparable with that of WT controls in dorsal and ventral retina (Fig. 3A, first and second column). By 3 months of age, the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT ONL thickness and OS length were greatly reduced, and the phenotype was more severe in the dorsal retina than in the ventral retina (Fig. 3A, third column). By 13 months, only one layer of ONL nuclei remained at the dorsal retina with residual OS/IS, as compared with 4–5 layers of nuclei at the ventral ONL. The ventral retina was much more stable, displaying OS of half-normal length (Fig. 3A, fourth column). We found a consistent reduction of ONL thickness and OS lengths across 3 month-old Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT retinas (Fig. 3, B and C). The Cetn3GT/GT central retina displayed about 10 rows of nuclei (45–50-μm thickness) at either the dorsal or ventral areas, whereas the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT retina had 6–7 rows of nuclei (30–35 μm) at the ventral retina and 4–5 rows of nuclei (20–25 μm) at the dorsal retina (Fig. 3B). Cetn3GT/GT central retinas had an average OS length of 15–25 μm (both dorsal and ventral), whereas the OS length of the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT ventral retina was reduced to 10–15 μm and the dorsal peripheral retina to 5–10 μm (Fig. 3C). At 1 month, the ONL thickness and OS length of Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT was comparable with the Cetn3GT/GT control at both the dorsal and ventral retina (Fig. 3, D and E). These results show that lack of CETN2 and CETN3 caused a slow photoreceptor degeneration beginning after ∼1 month of age and nearing completion in the dorsal retina at 1 year. Consistently, 3-month-old Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice had a significantly reduced scotopic ERG response compared with littermate Cetn3GT/GT controls, whereas Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT littermates showed an intermediate ERG response at multiple light intensities (Fig. 4A). Quantification of scotopic ERG a-waves revealed that Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice produced significantly smaller amplitudes compared with Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT littermates (Fig. 4B). Scotopic b-wave amplitudes showed a similar reduction in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice compared with Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT, Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT, and Cetn3GT/GT mice at all light intensities (Fig. 4C). Although both scotopic a-wave and b-wave amplitudes were reduced in Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT compared with Cetn3GT/GT, the reductions were statistically insignificant (p > 0.1) except for the b-wave amplitude at 1.4 log cd s/m2 (p < 0.05), probably because of the small group number (n = 5) and relatively large data variation among samples. We observed similar cone photopic ERG reduction in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice (Fig. 4D). In quantification, Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice had significantly smaller photopic b-wave amplitudes compared with Cetn2+/−;Cetn3GT/GT and Cetn3GT/GT (Fig. 4E). A small but insignificant (p > 0.5) reduction of scotopic and photopic ERG in 1-month-old Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice relative to Cetn3GT/GT littermate controls was observed (Fig. 4F and not shown). Immunolabeling with antibodies directed against phototransduction proteins showed normal localizations of rod or cone OS proteins (rhodopsin, GC1, PDE6, CNGA1/A3, and S- and M-opsins) in 3-month-old Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT retinas despite ongoing photoreceptor degeneration (Fig. 5, A and B). A notable observation was the enlargement of cone OS in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice (arrows in Fig. 5B); WT cone outer segments labeled with anti-cone arrestin taper distally (Fig. 5C), whereas a fraction of the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT cone OS was swollen to triple diameter (Fig. 5D). The swelling (up to 3 μm in diameter) was even more obvious when sections were immunolabeled with anti-M–opsin (Fig. 5E). To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptor degeneration, we immunolabeled predegenerate retina sections with antibodies directed against axoneme and ciliary markers. The length of proximal axonemes labeled by RP1 (retinitis pigmentosa 1 protein), a microtubule-associated protein (27Liu Q. Zuo J. Pierce E.A. The retinitis pigmentosa 1 protein is a photoreceptor microtubule-associated protein.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24 (15269252): 6427-643610.1523/JNEUROSCI.1335-04.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was slightly but significantly reduced in P22 Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors compared with those of the Cetn3GT/GT littermate controls (Fig. 6, A–D). The average length of the RP1-responsive Cetn3GT/GT proximal axoneme was 4.58 ± 0.92 μm and for the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT axoneme 3.92 ± 0.87 μm (Fig. 6G). By 3 months, the reduction was more obvious (Fig. 6, E and F), with the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT RP1 length measured as 2.49 ± 0.55 μm, 56% of the Cetn3GT/GT controls (4.41 ± 0.67 μm) (Fig. 6G). These observations indicate that loss of CETN2 and -3 progressively reduced RP1 decoration of the proximal axoneme microtubules. Double immunolabeling with anti-CEP290 and anti-CETN1 antibodies showed a nearly full overlap of CEP290 and CETN1 along the entire P25 WT CC (98%, Fig. 6, H–J and T). In P25 Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors, CEP290 labels the full-length CC, but CETN1 appears to accumulate at the CC center with variable depletion occurring at the proximal and distal ends. We observed CC showing 36% CETN1 overlap with CEP290, CC showing 40% CETN1 depletion from the distal end (arrows), and CC showing 23% depletion from both the distal and proximal ends (arrowheads) (Fig. 6, K–M and T). By 3 months of age, CEP290 and CETN1 similarly overlap at the WT CC (98%, Fig. 6, N–P and T), whereas in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT CC, 67 and 28% of the CC were nonresponsive for CETN1 at the distal end (arrows) or from both the distal and proximal ends (arrowheads), respectively (Fig. 6, Q–S and T). Accordingly, the length of the CETN1-positive CC fragment is reduced to 78.5% in P25 (0.84 ± 0.13) and 56.3% (0.58 ± 0.14 μm) in 3m Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice compared with WT controls (1.07 ± 0.18 at P25 and 1.03 ± 0.18 μm at 3m) (Fig. 6U). Further, CETN1 signal is stronger in both the P25 and 3m Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT retina compared with controls (compare Fig. 6, I and L, with O and R); quantification of the fluorescence intensity revealed that the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT CETN1 signal is 1.25- and 1.67-fold of control at P25 and 3m, respectively (Fig. 6V). The photoreceptor CEP290 length is similar between Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT and WT at P25 but slightly reduced in 3m Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT mice (0.99 ± 0.16 μm) compared with WT (1.16 ± 0.21 μm) (Fig. 6W). These results indicate that in the absence of both CETN2 and CETN3, CETN1 is gradually depleted from the CC distal and proximal ends and accumulates in the center, concurrent with a slight shortening of the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT CC. Co-immunolabeling of P25 cryosections with anti-CEP290 and anti-acetylated α-tubulin (Ac-tubulin) identified WT CC (Fig. 7, A–C, arrowheads). The response concentrates at the proximal OS axoneme base (arrows) in both the P25 WT (Fig. 7, A–C) and Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors (Fig. 7, D–F). At 3 months of age, the CEP290 and Ac-tubulin pattern of the WT was similar to that of P25 (Fig. 7, G–I), whereas in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors, the Ac-tubulin signal was concentrated primarily at the proximal axoneme (arrows) but greatly reduced from CEP290-positive CC (arrowheads, Fig. 7, J–L). We profiled the CEP290 and Ac-tubulin fluorescence along the CC and axoneme starting from the CC proximal end at the basal body (Fig. 7, M and N). The pattern was similar between P25 WT and Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors with an Ac-tubulin signal peak and sharp CEP290 drop at the OS proximal axoneme (1.2–1.4 μm from the CC proximal end at the basal body) (Fig. 7M). By 3 months of age, the pattern was unchanged in the WT, but the Ac-tubulin signal was greatly increased at the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT OS axoneme base and reduced along the CC (Fig. 7N). The quantification results reveal comparable Ac-tubulin signal ratios (CC midpoint signal versus peak axoneme base signal) between P25 WT (62.7 ± 10.8%) and Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT (58.2 ± 13.5%) (Fig. 7O). At 3 months, the ratio was significantly reduced in Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors (47.9 ± 7.9%) compared with WT (62.2 ± 11.8%) (Fig. 7O), indicating a gradual deacetylation of CC microtubules but hyperacetylation of proximal OS axoneme microtubules. Ultrastructure of 2.5-month-old Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors revealed normal, densely packed, vertically oriented rods with horizontally stacked OS discs (Fig. 8A). By contrast, the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT littermate OS structure was highly disorganized, as judged by overgrown and longitudinally aligned discs, membrane whorls, and expanded OS diameters (Fig. 8, B–D), resembling the phenotype seen in Rp1−/− or Rp1 knockin mouse retinas (28Liu Q. Lyubarsky A. Skalet J.H. Pugh Jr, E.N. Pierce E.A. RP1 is required for the correct stacking of outer segment discs.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Control Cetn3GT/GT CC and axonemes had a normal diameter of ∼250 nm (Fig. 8E). However, ∼20–30% of the Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors (depending on the mouse), of >60 CC that were examined from three samples, showed variable dilation at the distal CC (Fig. 8, E–H, yellow double arrows) and OS proximal axoneme (Fig. 8I, red arrowheads) not seen in WT controls. This phenotype ranged from a minor, slight expansion (Fig. 8G) to severe, extreme dilation with invasion of vertically aligned disc membranes (Fig. 8H) and loss of microtubule doublet integrity (not shown). Consistent with CEP290 immunolabeling (Fig. 6, N–S and W), the CC average length (Fig. 8, E and F, red double arrows) was slightly but significantly reduced in 2.5-month-old Cetn2−/−;Cetn3GT/GT photoreceptors (0.87 ± 0.14 μm) compared with Cetn3GT/GT controls (1.01 ± 0.15 μm) (Fig. 8J). These observations suggest that CETN2 and CETN3 are required for CC length and structural maintenance, which direct photoreceptor OS disc assembly. The photoreceptor-specific distal CC is maintained by SPATA7 (spermatogenesis-associated protein 7), knockout of which in the mouse leads to radial expansion of the distal CC microtubular array (26Dharmat R.

We developed a whole-cell phenotypic screen which can be used to identify inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. We used recombinant strains of virulent M. tuberculosis which express far-red fluorescent reporters and used fluorescence to monitor growth in vitro. We optimized our high throughput assays using both 96-well and 384-well plates; both formats gave assays which met stringent reproducibility and robustness tests. We screened a compound set of 1105 chemically diverse compounds previously shown to be active against M. tuberculosis and identified primary hits which showed ≥ 90% growth inhibition. We ranked hits and identified three chemical classes of interest-the phenoxyalkylbenzamidazoles, the benzothiophene 1-1 dioxides, and the piperidinamines. These new compound classes may serve as starting points for the development of new series of inhibitors that prevent the growth of M. tuberculosis. This assay can be used for further screening, or could easily be adapted to other strains of M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2908790520,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are able to enhance angiogenesis and regulate inflammation that is especially important in wound healing under ischemic conditions. Thus, we evaluated the effect of local EET application on ischemic wounds in mice.Ischemia was induced by cautherization of two of the three supplying vessels to the mouse ear. Wounding was performed on the ear three days later. Wounds were treated either with 11,12 or 14,15 EET and compared to untreated control and normal wounds. Epithelialization was measured every second day. VEGF, TNF-α, TGF-β, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), Ki67, and SDF-1α were evaluated immunohistochemically in wounds on day 3, 6, and 9.Ischemia delayed wound closure (12.8 days ± 1.9 standard deviation (SD) for ischemia and 8.0 days ± 0.94 SD for control). 11,12 and14,15 EET application ameliorated deteriorated wound healing on ischemic ears (7.6 ± 1.3 SD for 11,12 EET and 9.2 ± 1.4 SD for 14,15 EET). Ischemia did not change VEGF, TNF-α, TGF-β, SDF-1α, TIMP, MMP7 or MMP9 level significantly compared to control. Local application of 11,12 as well as 14,15 EET induced a significant elevation of VEGF, TGF-β, and SDF-1α expression as well as proliferation during the whole phase of wound healing compared to control and ischemia alone.In summary, EET improve impaired wound healing caused by ischemia as they enhance neovascularization and alter inflammatory response in wounds. Thus elevating lipid mediator level as 11,12 and 14,15 EET in wounds might be a successful strategy for amelioration of deranged wound healing under ischemia."

This study examines the contextual factors that influence the use of long acting reversible and permanent contraception among married and fecund women in Ethiopia. Method We use data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey to examine the contextual factors that influence choice of long acting reversible and permanent contraception among married, non-pregnant and fecund women. The DHS collects detailed information on individual and household characteristics, contraception, and related reproductive behaviors from women of reproductive age. In addition, we created cluster level variables by aggregating individual level data to the cluster level. Analysis was done using a two-level multilevel logistic regression with data from 6994 married (weighted = 7352) women residing in 642 clusters (communities). Results In 2016, 12% of married, non-pregnant and ‘fecund’ women were using long-acting reversible and permanent methods of contraception in Ethiopia. A higher proportion of women with secondary and above education (17.6%), urban residents (19.7%), in the richest wealth quintile (18.3%) and in paid employment (18.3%) were using LARP methods compared to their counterparts. Regression analysis showed that community level variables such as women’s empowerment, access to family planning information and services, region of residence and knowledge of methods were significantly associated with use of LARP methods. Age, wealth status, employment status and women’s fertility preferences were among the individual and household level variables associated with choice of LARP methods. With regards to age, the odds of using LARP methods was significantly lower among adolescents (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.85) and women over the age of 40 (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44–0.90) compared to women in their 20’s. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that the demand for long-acting reversible and permanent contraception is influenced not only by women’s individual and household characteristics but also by the community’s level of women’s empowerment, socio-economic development, as well as access and exposure to family planning information and services. Thus, improving knowledge of long-acting reversible and permanent methods, improving women’s decision making autonomy and upgrading the capacity and skills of health workers particularly the midlevel providers and community health extension workers on the provision of LARP methods and rights-based approach is important to improve the uptake of LARP methods."
https://openalex.org/W2910314537,"Multicellular organisms balance oxygen delivery and toxicity by having oxygen pass through several barriers before cellular delivery. In human cell culture, these physiologic barriers are removed, exposing cells to higher oxygen levels. Human cells cultured in ambient air may appear normal, but this is difficult to assess without a comparison at physiologic oxygen. Here, we examined the effects of culturing human cells throughout the spectrum of oxygen availability on oxidative damage to macromolecules, viability, proliferation, the antioxidant and DNA damage responses, metabolism, and mitochondrial fusion and morphology. We surveyed 4 human cell lines cultured for 3 d at 7 oxygen conditions between 1 and 21% O2. We show that oxygen levels and cellular benefit are not inversely proportional, but the benefit peaks within the physioxic range. Normoxic cells are in a perpetual state of responding to damaged macromolecules and mitochondrial networks relative to physioxic cells, which could compromise an investigation. These data contribute to the concept of an optimal oxygen availability for cell culture in the physioxic range where the oxygen is not too high to reduce oxidative damage, and not too low for efficient oxidative metabolism, but just right: the Goldiloxygen zone.—Timpano, S., Guild, B.

https://openalex.org/W2910568720,"Due to marked reductions in morbidity and mortality, antiretroviral (ARV) adherence monitoring is of high interest. Researchers and clinicians often resort to the most feasible and cost-effective adherence methods possible, which may result in biased or inaccurate estimates and require the physical presence of a participant at a research or clinic site. The objective of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of three objective, innovative, and remote methods to estimate ARV adherence which may be conducted with less time and financial resources in a wide range of clinic and research settings. These three methods included: (a) text-messaged photographs of pharmacy refill dates to measure refill-based adherence, (b) text-messaged photographs of ARV medications to estimate pill-count-based adherence, and (c) home-collected hair samples for the measurement of ARV concentration to determine pharmacologic-based adherence. We conducted a pilot study from March through October 2017 to examine the feasibility and acceptability of these three adherence measures and the remotely conducted study procedures in 93 adults living with HIV nationwide. From our diverse national sample of participants, 95.7% were retained until the end of the study, 89.9% sent all text messages, and 84.3% sent all hair samples. Approximately 74.2% of participants reported excellent overall experience with the study, 60.2% were very or extremely satisfied with participating in a hair collection study, and 76.3% noted extremely high likelihood of participating in a similar study including text messaging pictures of medications or refill dates. We noted high levels of feasibility and acceptability with the remote study methodology, collection of photographed and text messaged pharmacy refill dates and pill counts, and home-collected hair samples. Here we describe the feasibility and acceptability metrics, results from the exit qualitative interviews with the participants, and lessons learned. These adherence measures represent innovative approaches to expand monitoring tools for HIV treatment and prevention adherence in future research."

We found that this communication bridge is essential for glycogen phosphorylase (PYG) activation through the canonical pathway because this enzyme is inactive in the absence of adenylyl cyclase type 6 (ADCY6). PYG activation required stimulation of both exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) and RAP1 via RAS and ADCY6 phosphorylation, with the latter being mediated by Raf-1 proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (RAF1). Consistent with this model, PYG activation was EGFR-dependent and may be initiated by the constitutively active form of RAS. Consequently, PYG activation in Kit 225 T cells could be blocked with specific inhibitors of RAS, EPAC, RAP1, RAF1, ADCY6, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

Despite the identification of a growing number of substrates of USP7, the molecular mechanism by which USP7 removes ubiquitin chains from polyubiquitinated substrates remains unexplored. The present study investigated the mechanism underlying the deubiquitination of Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that USP7 efficiently removes polyubiquitin chains from polyubiquitinated PCNA by preferential cleavage of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage. This property was largely attributed to the poor activity toward Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains.

Ubiquitination regulates a wide variety of cellular processes such as proteasome-dependent proteolysis, autophagy, immune responses, DNA damage responses, and gene expression.

Each E3 specifically modifies target protein(s) by catalyzing their monoubiquitination or polyubiquitination with differently linked ubiquitin chains, which determine the fate of the modified proteins (1Komander D.

However, the results of biochemical analyses of USP7 to determine its substrate specificity are controversial.

The recruitment of translesion DNA polymerases is a double-edged sword because of their extremely low fidelity of DNA synthesis, which causes mutagenesis. The tight regulation of translesion DNA polymerases is achieved through the combined action of USP7 and USP1, another deubiquitinase for PCNA, which reverse monoubiquitination and minimize the risk of mutagenesis (33Huang T.T.

However, their role in the modulation of polyubiquitinated PCNA remains to be examined. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism underlying the deubiquitination of Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA. The results demonstrated that USP7 removes Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by catalyzing the preferential digestion of PCNA-ubiquitin linkages. USP7 also showed preferential activity against substrate-ubiquitin linkages of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitinated p53. This property of USP7 could be beneficial to suppress polyubiquitin signals. The biochemical activity of USP7 against Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA was analyzed using a mixture of polyubiquitinated PCNA generated in vitro. Because Lys164 of PCNA is the sole target of ubiquitination, a single Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain is attached to each subunit of the PCNA homotrimer (Fig. 1A) (35Masuda Y. Suzuki M. Kawai H. Hishiki A. Hashimoto H. Masutani C. Hishida T. Suzuki F. Kamiya K. En bloc transfer of polyubiquitin chains to PCNA in vitro is mediated by two different human E2-E3 pairs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22904075): 10394-1040710.1093/nar/gks763Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most of the polyubiquitinated PCNA monomer had single ubiquitin or ∼7 mer Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains as determined by Western blotting with an anti-PCNA mAb (Fig. 1A, upper panels, lanes 1 and 6, and Fig. S1B). An anti-ubiquitin mAb (P4D1) detected polyubiquitinated PCNA molecules with long ubiquitin chains as higher-molecular-weight signals (Fig. 1A, lower panels, lanes 1 and 6, and Fig. S1, A and B), suggesting that a small fraction of PCNA monomer has long ubiquitin chains. Because the anti-ubiquitin antibody detected all ubiquitin molecules in the chains, the PCNA molecules with longer ubiquitin chains were more sensitive to the anti-ubiquitin antibody. We confirmed that the slower migrating molecules were not aggregates of ubiquitinated PCNA, which were detected by treatment with 4 m urea before electrophoresis (Fig. S1B). The monoubiquitinated PCNA substrate (8 nm as a trimer) was subjected to deubiquitination assays with histidine-tagged recombinant USP7 (hisUSP7) (Fig. S2). A histidine-tagged truncated ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) consisting of the 258–605 amino acid catalytic domain (hisUSP2CD) (36Renatus M. Parrado S.G. D'Arcy A. Eidhoff U. Gerhartz B.

Structural basis of ubiquitin recognition by the deubiquitinating protease USP2.Structure. 2006; 14 (16905103): 1293-130210.1016/j.str.2006.06.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used as a control for the deubiquitination assay. The time course of the reaction of 7.7 nm hisUSP7 or 8.2 nm hisUSP2CD is shown in Fig. 1A. Deubiquitinating activity was quantified by measuring the signal intensity from gel images of Western blotting with the anti-PCNA antibody (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Polyubiquitinated PCNA with short chains (1–4 mer ubiquitin) and long chains (more than 5 mer ubiquitin) relative to that of unmodified PCNA were quantified from gel images (Fig. 1, B–D). As shown in Fig. 1B, 7.7 nm hisUSP7 and 8.2 nm hisUSP2CD generated equal amounts of unmodified PCNA during the 40 min incubation, indicating that the two enzymes have equivalent activities in terms of generating unmodified PCNA from Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA. The catalytic rate for generation of unmodified PCNA was 0.11 (± 0.013) min−1 for hisUSP7 and 0.092 (± 0.026) min−1 for hisUSP2CD under the same reaction conditions (see Fig. 7A and Table S1). However, the pattern of reduction of Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA differed between hisUSP7 and hisUSP2CD. Polyubiquitinated PCNA substrates with shorter and longer ubiquitin chains were similarly reduced in the presence of hisUSP7 (Fig. 1C), whereas polyubiquitinated PCNA substrates with longer ubiquitin chains were rapidly reduced in the presence of hisUSP2CD (Fig. 1D). This result suggested that USP7 preferentially digests the isopeptide linkage between PCNA and ubiquitin rather than the Lys63 linkages between ubiquitin molecules. However, this result does not exclude the possibility that USP7 digested Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains from the distal end of the chain with extreme processivity. We assumed that the preferential digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage would generate unanchored Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, whereas digestion of the Lys63 linkage from the distal end of the chain would not generate detectable unanchored ubiquitin chains. To clarify the action of USP7, the reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-ubiquitin antibody. It is noteworthy that this antibody is poor at detecting monoubiquitinated PCNA and ubiquitin monomers, probably because of its lower affinity for the single ubiquitin moiety and free ubiquitin. The results demonstrated that incubation with hisUSP7 generated unanchored ubiquitin chains (Fig. 1A, bottom left panel). This result could exclude the possibility of preferential digestion from the distal end of the chain with extreme processivity. Strikingly, the higher-molecular-weight signals were relatively resistant to hisUSP7 (Fig. 1A, bottom left panel), whereas they were more sensitive to hisUSP2CD (Fig. 1A, bottom right panel). These results suggested that USP7 preferentially digested PCNA-ubiquitin linkages, but not Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. In the following experiments, we analyzed the molecular mechanism underlying the preferential digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkages of Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA. First, we tested the possibility that USP7 has higher activity toward the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage than toward the Lys63-linked ubiquitin linkage. To this end, we individually measured isopeptidase activities for the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage and the Lys63 linkage between ubiquitin molecules. The digestion of isopeptide linkages between PCNA and ubiquitin was examined using 8 nm monoubiquitinated PCNA trimer as the substrate (Fig. 1, E and F). The time course of the reaction with 7.7 nm hisUSP7 or 8.2 nm hisUSP2CD demonstrated that both enzymes released the same amount of unmodified PCNA from monoubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. 1F). The catalytic rate for the generation of unmodified PCNA was 0.068 (± 0.0059) min−1 for hisUSP7 and 0.067 (± 0.0067) min−1 for hisUSP2CD under the same reaction conditions (see Fig. 7A and Table S1). Second, the isopeptidase activity against the Lys63-linkage was examined using 24 nm Lys63-linked diubiquitin as the substrate. The time course reactions were performed with different concentrations of hisUSP7 (Fig. 2B) or hisUSP2CD (Fig. 2C). Representative gel images are shown in Fig. 2A. Because the anti-ubiquitin antibody used in this study detects ubiquitin monomers and diubiquitin chains with different efficacy (Fig. 2A), the deubiquitination activity was quantified by determining the amount of diubiquitin relative to that at time 0 (Fig. 2, B and C). The data at 10 min in the reaction with different amounts of hisUSP7 or hisUSP2CD obtained from the time course (Fig. 2, B and C) were replotted against enzyme concentration (Fig. 2D). At 10 min in the absence of enzyme, the substrate was reduced to ∼80% (∼200 fmol) of the initial amount at time 0 (Fig. 2D). The formation of aggregates or absorption to the tube walls may account for ∼20% of the lost substrate. The catalytic rate for digestion of Lys63-linked diubiquitin was 0.011 (± 0.0018) min−1 for hisUSP7 and 0.031 (± 0.0030) min−1 for hisUSP2CD under the same reaction conditions (see Fig. 7, A and B, and Table S1), which was 6.2- and 2.2-fold lower than that measured for the digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage of monoubiquitinated PCNA, respectively. These results were consistent with the results of that USP7, but not USP2CD, preferentially digested the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage of the Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA. To determine whether the interaction between USP7 and PCNA is required for the preferential digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage, we first investigated the direct interaction between USP7 and PCNA in in vitro binding assays. However, no interaction was detected (Fig. S3). Nonetheless, low-affinity or undetectable binding mediated by the substrate-binding domains, N-terminal TRAF or Ubl2, may play a role in the preferential digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage. Regarding the interaction with PCNA, a PIP boxlike sequence (PIPL1) in the TRAF domain and a second PIP boxlike sequence (PIPL2) in the USP7 catalytic domain (7CD) (Fig. 3A) were detected and considered as candidates for the low-affinity interaction with PCNA. To examine whether these sequences are involved in the preferential digestion of the PCNA-ubiquitin linkage, we generated a PIPL1 mutant F118A/L119A (designated hisPL1), a TRAF-truncated mutant (designated hisΔN), a construct with an additional mutation in PIPL2 (F436A/L437A, designated hisΔN/PL2) or in the target protein-binding motif of Ubl2 (12Pfoh R.

The catalytic rate for the generation of unmodified PCNA was 0.092 (±0.0065) min−1 for hisPL1, 0.25 (± 0.027) min−1 for hisΔN, 0.086 (± 0.0039) min−1 for hisΔN/PL2, and 0.36 (± 0.025) min−1 for hisΔN/UL2 (see Fig. 7A and Table S1). The pattern of reduction of Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA in the mutants was similar to that in WT hisUSP7 (Fig. 3, H–L). Polyubiquitinated PCNA substrates with shorter and longer ubiquitin chains were similarly reduced in the reactions with all mutants (Fig. 3, H–L). These results showed that the preferential digestion of the isopeptide linkage between PCNA and ubiquitin was retained in all mutants, suggesting that this property is not a consequence of the specific interaction with PCNA, but rather intrinsic to the 7CD. However, when the same products were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-ubiquitin antibody, significant digestion of ubiquitin chains was detected in the ΔN, ΔN/PL2, and 7CD and less efficiently in ΔN/UL2,"

The aim of this study was to assess the socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors associated with primary caregivers' decisions to disclose HIV to children living with HIV aged 6 to 12 years in Malawi. A cross-sectional study of 429 primary caregivers of children living with HIV were systematically recruited from all regions of the country. Information on HIV disclosure, family and child socio-demographic characteristics, child clinical characteristics, and child and family psychosocial characteristics was collected using validated instruments. Logistic regression was used to analyse data. The prevalence of non-disclosure of HIV status to children was 64 per cent. Concerns about the child's inability to cope with the news (29%), a lack of knowledge on how to disclose HIV status (19%), and fear of stigma and discrimination (17%) were the main reasons for non-disclosure. On multivariate analysis, the odds of non-disclosure were higher among primary caregivers who were farmers (aOR 3.0; 95% CI: 1.1-8.4), in younger children (6-8 years) (aOR 4.1; 95% CI: 2.3-7.4), in children who were in WHO HIV clinical stage one (aOR 3.8; 95% CI: 1.4-10.2), and in children who were not asking why they were taking ARVs (aOR 2.9; 95% CI: 1.8-4.8). On the other hand, nondisclosure of HIV status was less likely in underweight children (aOR 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). Many children living with HIV in Malawi are unaware of their HIV status. Non-disclosure is associated with a number of clinical and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight the need to provide guidance and support to primary caregivers to help them to effectively disclose HIV status to their children."
https://openalex.org/W2910983410,"Construction waste is a serious problem that should be addressed to protect environment and save resources, some of which have a high recovery value. To efficiently recover construction waste, an online classification system is developed using an industrial near-infrared hyperspectral camera. This system uses the industrial camera to capture a region of interest and a hyperspectral camera to obtain the spectral information about objects corresponding to the region of interest. The spectral information is then used to build classification models based on extreme learning machine and resemblance discriminant analysis. To further improve this system, an online particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine is developed. The results indicate that if a near-infrared hyperspectral camera is used in conjunction with an industrial camera, construction waste can be efficiently classified. Therefore, extreme learning machine and resemblance discriminant analysis can be used to classify construction waste. Particle swarm optimization can be used to further enhance the proposed system."
https://openalex.org/W2908718349,"Background Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of mortality and has a high burden in morbidity. In Portugal, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) was used since 2001 and PCV10/13 since 2009, being the last introduced into the National Immunization Program in 2015. Methods We conducted an ecological study to evaluate the impact of PCV7 and PCV13 on pneumococcal pneumonia (PP) hospitalizations in adults aged 65 years or more in Portugal. National hospital discharge registry data from 1998/99 to 2015/16 were used, and PP hospitalization was defined as any hospitalization coded in primary diagnosis as 481 (ICD-9-CM) or J18 (ICD-10-CM). Poisson regression models adjusted for seasonality, influenza-like illness and allowing for overdispersion was used to estimate annual average change of PP hospitalization rate. To assess PP hospitalization trends before and after PCV7 and PCV13 introduction interrupted time series analysis was performed. Results In 1998/99 PP hospitalization rate was 7.0 per 10,000 inhabitants, varying between 3.2 (females, 65–74 years) to 20.7 (males, +85 years), and annually increasing by 16% during the pre-PCV7 period. Statistically significant reduction of 14% per year in PP hospitalization rate was observed after PCV7 introduction. Between 2004/05 and 2009/10 PP hospitalization rate decreased annually by 4% and after PCV13 introduction by 11% per year. In 2015/16 we found an overall reduction of 2.9 (CI 95%: 2.7; 3.1) PP hospitalizations per 10,000 inhabitants (598 hospitalizations) attributable to PCV13, varying from 2.2 (CI 95%: 1.3; 3.1) (female, 65–74 years) to 5.6 (CI 95%: 3.8; 7.5) (female, +85 years). Conclusions Our results suggest that introduction of both PCV7 and PCV13 vaccines resulted in the reduction of PP hospitalizations rates among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2910556100,"Introduction DNA testing for autosomal recessive disease mutations in many dog breeds is now relatively commonplace. There have, however, been few efforts made to determine changes in the frequency of disease causing mutations as a result of probable selection based on the results of DNA testing. This study makes use of genotype data from both DNA test results reported to the UK Kennel Club and where known from a ‘hereditary status’ (where a definitive genotype may be inferred and ascribed based on known parental genotypes) to do so. Results The results, using all known genotype data, show a general and sizeable decline in disease causing mutation frequency across eight diseases in eight breeds (by between 12–86% in dogs born 2–4 years after publication of the mutation, and by nearly 90% or more in those born 8–10 years after). In contrast, data from test results only, while revealing an almost complete and immediate end to the production of affected individuals, show little general decline in either the derived mutation frequency or the proportion of heterozygote carriers. It appears that the numerical size of the breed is an important determinant on the rate of uptake of a DNA test (as judged by the proportion of a breed born four years after publication of the disease-causing mutation with a known genotype). Conclusion These results show that dog breeders appear to be incorporating the results of DNA testing into their selection strategies to successfully decrease the frequency of the mutation. It is shown that use of DNA test result data alone does not reveal such trends, possibly as some breeders undertake testing to determine clear stock which can then be used to produce future disease-free generations in the knowledge they are not carrying the disease causing mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2909110331,"Employing message endorser is a popular strategy in encouraging consumers to protect the environment. This research explores how the social status of endorsers and the forms of normative messages can influence the effectiveness of endorsement for pro-environmental behaviors. Drawing on the focus theory of normative conduct and the match-up hypothesis, the authors propose that the effects of endorser social status on consumers' responses to green advertising are contingent on whether the normative messages is framed as injunctive norms or descriptive norms. In three experiments, the results indicate that participants show more positive attitudes toward the advertisement and higher intentions to act environmentally friendly when endorsers with high social status are presented in combination with injunctive norm appeals. In contrast, ordinary consumer endorsers produce stronger impact on attitudes and behavioral intentions when descriptive norm appeals are used. These findings show that marketers using endorsers to promote pro-environmental behaviors should develop normative message accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2887574495,"Saccades can either be elicited automatically by salient peripheral stimuli or can additionally depend on explicit cognitive goals. Similarly, it is thought that motor adaptation is driven by the combination of a more automatic, implicit process and a more explicit, cognitive process. However, the degree to which such implicit and explicit learning contribute to the adaptation of more reactive and voluntary saccades remains elusive. To study this question, we employed a global saccadic adaptation paradigm with both increasing and decreasing saccade amplitudes. We assessed the resulting adaptation using a dual state model of motor adaptation. This model decomposes learning into a fast and slow process, which are thought to constitute explicit and implicit learning, respectively. Our results show that adaptation of reactive saccades is equally driven by fast and slow learning, while fast learning is nearly absent when adapting voluntary (i.e. scanning) saccades. This pattern of results was present both when saccade gain was increased or decreased. Our results suggest that the increased cognitive demands associated with voluntary compared to reactive saccade planning interfere specifically with explicit learning."
https://openalex.org/W2910258489,"Introduction The proportion of older persons in developing countries is increasing with no clear evidence of improvement in physical health. The aim of this paper was to examine the factors associated with older persons’ physical health in rural Uganda. Methods This paper is based on a cross-sectional study of 912 older persons age 60 years and older across four major regions of Uganda. The study was conceptualized basing on World Health Organization quality of life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). Analysis was done at three levels, that is, frequency distributions were generated to describe background characteristics of respondents and cross-tabulations were done to determine associations between dependent and each of the independent variables. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of physical health. Results The likelihood of good physical health is high among older persons (Ops) who controlled their household assets (OR = 3.64; CI = 1.81–7.30) or the household assets controlled by their spouses (OR = 4.44; CI = 1.91–10.32) relative to those whose household assets were controlled by their children. There is high likelihood of good physical health among those who engage in physical activities (OR = 2.28; CI = 1.52–3.43) compared to those who do not. Conclusion The findings have various policy implications, including creating an enabling environment and building capacities of older persons to remain in control of their household assets. Interventions focusing on deepening sensitization of older persons about importance of physical exercises could be a viable strategy for improving physical health of older persons."

AEFI reporting is important to post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance and has the potential to identify new or rare AEFIs, show increases in known AEFIs, and help to maintain public confidence in vaccine programs. Knowledge of the expected incidence (i.e. background rate) of a possible AEFI is essential to the investigation of vaccine safety signals. We selected three rarely reported AEFIs representing the spectrum of causal association with vaccines, from proven (immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]) to questioned (Kawasaki disease [KD]) to unsubstantiated (multiple sclerosis [MS]) and determined their background rates.We extracted data on hospitalizations (CIHI Discharge Abstract Database) for ITP, KD, and MS among Ontario children for the period 2005 to 2014 from IntelliHEALTH. As ITP can be managed without hospitalization, we also extracted emergency department (ED) visits from the CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. For all conditions, we only counted the first visit and if the same child had both an ED visit and a hospitalization for ITP, only the hospitalization was included. We calculated rates by year, age group and sex using population estimates from 2005-2014, focusing on age groups within the Ontario immunization schedule around vaccine(s) of interest.Per 100,000 population, annual age-specific incidence of ITP in children age 1 to 7 years ranged from 8.9 to 12.2 and annual incidence of KD in children less than 5 years ranged from 19.1 to 32.1. Average annualized incidence of adolescent (11-17 years) MS across the study period was 0.8 per 100,000.Despite limitations, including lack of clinical validation, this study provides an example of how health administrative data can be used to determine background rates which may assist with interpretation of passive vaccine safety surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2910593530,"The Snf2 proteins, comprising 53 different enzymes in humans, belong to the SF2 family. Many Snf2 enzymes possess chromatin-remodeling activity, requiring a functional ATPase domain consisting of conserved motifs named Q and I–VII. These motifs form two recA-like domains, creating an ATP-binding pocket. Little is known about the function of the conserved motifs in chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Here, we characterized the function of the Q and I (Walker I) motifs in hBRG1 (SMARCA4). The motifs are in close proximity to the bound ATP, suggesting a role in nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis. Unexpectedly, when substituting the conserved residues Gln758 (Q motif) or Lys785 (I motif) of both motifs, all variants still bound ATP and exhibited basal ATPase activity similar to that of wildtype BRG1 (wtBRG1). However, all mutants lost the nucleosome-dependent stimulation of the ATPase domain. Their chromatin-remodeling rates were impaired accordingly, but nucleosome binding was retained and still comparable with that of wtBRG1. Interestingly, a cancer-relevant substitution, L754F (Q motif), displayed defects similar to the Gln758 variant(s), arguing for a comparable loss of function. Because we excluded a mutual interference of ATP and nucleosome binding, we postulate that both motifs stimulate the ATPase and chromatin-remodeling activities upon binding of BRG1 to nucleosomes, probably via allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, mutations of both motifs similarly affect the enzymatic functionality of BRG1 in vitro and in living cells. Of note, in BRG1-deficient H1299 cells, exogenously expressed wtBRG1, but not BRG1 Q758A and BRG1 K785R, exhibited a tumor suppressor–like function.

https://openalex.org/W2909188370,"Background and aim The development and use of experimental models using lymphatic cannulation techniques have been hampered by the lack of high-quality colour imaging of lymphatic vessels in situ. Most descriptions of lymphatic anatomy in sheep have historically depended on schematic diagrams due to limitations in the ability to publish colour images of the lymphatic vessels with decent resolution. The aim of this work was to encourage more widespread use of the ovine cannulation model by providing clear photographic images identifying the location and anatomical layout of some major lymphatic ducts and their in situ relationship to surrounding tissues. Methods The cadavers of the sheep were collected after they had been euthanized at the end of animal trials not associated with this study. The lymphatics were dissected and exposed to show their appearance in the surrounding tissues and their relationship to other organs. Patent Blue was used to locate lymphatic vessels in exploratory preparations. However, in order to present the natural appearance of the vessels, we used minimal dissection and dye was not used for the photographed examples. Instead, we have indicated the course of the vessels with lines where their position is less clear. Results and conclusion In this paper, we have used sheep specimens as examples to show characteristic images of lymphatic vessels. The images of in situ lymphatics and lymph nodes combined with schematic summaries provide a concise illustration of the lymphatic drainage scheme in sheep."

https://openalex.org/W2910556401,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a precursor of end stage renal disease (ESRD), face an increasing burden of hospitalizations. Although mortality on dialysis is highest during the first year, the impact of pre-dialysis acute hospitalizations on clinical outcomes in dialysis patients remains unknown.We evaluated 170,897 adult patients who initiated dialysis between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2014 with linked Medicare claims from the United States Renal Data System. Using logistic regression models, we examined the association of 2-year pre-dialysis hospitalization on the primary outcome of 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, type of initial dialysis modality and type of vascular access at hemodialysis initiation.Mean age was 72.7 ± 11.0 years. In the study sample, 76.0% of patients had at least one pre-dialysis hospitalization. Compared to patients with no pre-dialysis hospitalization, the adjusted 1-year mortality was higher with pre-dialysis cardiovascular related hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-1.68), infection related hospitalization (OR, 1.51; CI, 1.45-1.57), both cardiovascular and infection hospitalization (OR, 1.91; CI, 1.83-1.99), and neither-cardiovascular nor-infection hospitalization (OR, 1.23; CI, 1.19-1.27). Additionally, the adjusted odds of hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis as the initial dialysis modality were higher, whereas adjusted odds to initiate hemodialysis with an arteriovenous access vs. central venous catheter were lower in patients with any type of hospitalization.Pre-dialysis hospitalization is an independent predictor of 1-year mortality in dialysis patients. Reducing the risk of pre-dialysis hospitalization may provide opportunities to improve quality of care in ESRD."
https://openalex.org/W2910775984,"The formation of hemostatic plugs at sites of vascular injury crucially involves the multimeric glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF multimers are linear chains of N-terminally linked dimers. The latter are formed from monomers via formation of the C-terminal disulfide bonds Cys2771-Cys2773', Cys2773-Cys2771', and Cys2811-Cys2811'. Mutations in VWF that impair multimerization can lead to subtype 2A of the bleeding disorder von Willebrand Disease (VWD). Commonly, the multimer size distribution of VWF is assessed by electrophoretic multimer analysis. Here, we present atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging as a method to determine the size distribution of VWF variants by direct visualization at the single-molecule level. We first validated our approach by investigating recombinant wildtype VWF and a previously studied mutant (p.Cys1099Tyr) that impairs N-terminal multimerization. We obtained excellent quantitative agreement with results from earlier studies and with electrophoretic multimer analysis. We then imaged specific mutants that are known to exhibit disturbed C-terminal dimerization. For the mutants p.Cys2771Arg and p.Cys2773Arg, we found the majority of monomers (87 ± 5% and 73 ± 4%, respectively) not to be C-terminally dimerized. While these results confirm that Cys2771 and Cys2773 are crucial for dimerization, they additionally provide quantitative information on the mutants' different abilities to form alternative C-terminal disulfides for residual dimerization. We further mutated Cys2811 to Ala and found that only 23 ± 3% of monomers are not C-terminally dimerized, indicating that Cys2811 is structurally less important for dimerization. Furthermore, for mutants p.Cys2771Arg, p.Cys2773Arg, and p.Cys2811Ala we found 'even-numbered' non-native multimers, i.e. multimers with monomers attached on both termini; a multimer species that cannot be distinguished from native multimers by conventional multimer analysis. Summarizing, we demonstrate that AFM imaging can provide unique insights into VWF processing defects at the single-molecule level that cannot be gained from established methods of multimer analysis."

A broad list of potential KPIs was compiled. A multidisciplinary group composed of 21 experts rated the potential KPIs. A face-to-face meeting was held following the first rating exercise to discuss each potential KPI individually. The expert panel undertook a final rating of KPIs. The final set of KPIs were those indicators where at least 80 percent of experts rated the indicator highly i.e. rating of ≥ 7 on a scale from 1 to 9.292 KPIs were identified from the published literature. After removing duplicates and combining similar indicators 71 KPIs were included. The final ranking resulted in six indicators being ranked 7 or higher by 80% of the respondents and an additional seven indicators being ranked 7 or higher by ≥70 but ≤80% of respondents. The six selected indicators include four specific disease areas, measure structural and process aspects of health service delivery, and assessed three of the domains of healthcare quality: efficiency, effectiveness, and safety.These indicators are recommended as a starting point to assess the current performance of prescription medication systems. Consideration should be given to developing indicators in additional disease areas as well as indicators that measure the domains of timeliness and patient-centeredness. Future work should focus on the feasibility of measuring these indicators."

https://openalex.org/W2909827834,"This study aimed to elucidate spatial characteristics for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cardiogenic cerebral embolism, to determine imaging biomarkers predicting patient outcome and cerebral herniation in cardioembolic stroke. This retrospective study assessed 90 patients with cardiogenic cerebral embolism. All images from MRI were normalized using a voxel-based symptom lesion mapping technique. Patients were categorized into two subgroups based on the outcome and presence of cerebral herniation. Each subgroup was assessed individually. The distribution map of all analyzed patients revealed accumulated ischemic lesions in bilateral middle cerebral artery areas. Ischemic lesions for the poor outcome group accumulated at the corona radiata on the right side and throughout the entire left hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested that a normalized ischemic volume of 62.8 mL allowed optimal differentiation between good and poor outcomes (sensitivity, 0.923; specificity, 0.923; area under the curve (AUC), 0.91) for left-side-dominant infarction. The distribution map for the cerebral herniation group revealed large ischemic areas in the left hemisphere. The analysis of differential involvement map with random permutation analysis showed that left anterior circulation infarcts were associated with midline shift. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a normalized infarction volume of 192.9 mL was highly predictive of cerebral herniation (sensitivity, 0.929; specificity, 0.750; AUC, 0.895). The medial frontal and occipital lobes, caudate head and basal ganglia were significantly involved in those patients who developed cerebral herniation. Ischemic volume contributed to outcomes and cerebral herniation. Ischemic lesions of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries and basal ganglia in addition to middle cerebral artery area were identified as differences on MRI images between with and without cerebral herniation patients."
