Three chromatographically and enzymatically distinct forms of acid phosphatase have been separated from extracts of human placental villus tissue by gel filtration. 2. These enzymes, termed I, II, and III, have molecular weights of g200,000, 105,000, and 35,000, respectively; and pH optima for p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis of 5.5, 4, and 5.5. 3. Enzyme II, which is probably of lysosomal origin, is 90% inhibited by 20 mm l-(+)tartrate. Enzyme III is insensitive to tartrate but is completely inhibited by 10 µm p-chloromercuribenzoate, and I displays an intermediate sensitivity to tartrate. Both I and II, but not III, are also inhibited by molybdate and fluoride. 4. Whereas enzymes I and II appear to be typical nonspecific acid phosphohydrolases, enzyme III is atypical in that most of the common phosphate esters are poor substrates. It is further distinguished by a stimulatory response to purines and an apparent allosteric type inhibition by pyridoxine 5-phosphate."

NH4+ uptake approached a maximum with increasing NH4Cl concentration, and was associated with a parallel inhibition of the light-induced pH change. Maximal values for rate and extent of NH4+ uptake did not vary greatly with pH. However, below pH 7 the apparent Km for NH4Cl rose markedly with decreasing pH, and this reflected a calculated Km for NH3 which did not change greatly. Above pH 7, the Km for NH3 increased with increasing pH, and this was associated with a loss of coupling between electron flow and energy conservation. It has been concluded that NH3 is the active species in NH4+ uptake. NH4+ and H+ uptake accompanying ferricyanide reduction in the Hill reaction have been compared with uptake linked to N-methylphenazonium methosulfate-catalyzed electron flow. It was found that between 2 and 3 H+ or NH4+ ions were taken up into the chloroplast per electron transported to ferricyanide. Competitive inhibition of NH4+ uptake under conditions of photophosphorylation has been found. Phlorizin at a concentration which completely inhibited photophosphorylation had little effect on the rate of H+ or NH4+ uptake, but partially reduced the extent of NH4+ uptake. A mechanism for NH4+ uptake has been proposed. It has been suggested that, on acidification of the chloroplast interior following H+ uptake, the equilibration of NH3 across the chloroplast membrane is displaced, and that more NH3 enters to replace that lost by association with H+. The net accumulation of NH4+ leads to an uptake of Cl- by diffusion, and the increased osmolarity within the chloroplasts leads to water movement and swelling. The mechanism proposed also provides a general mechanism for uncoupling by amines."

This enzyme has been purified from the liver of adult rats by acid and heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on Sephadex G-200 and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The enzyme preparation has a specific activity of 15 to 30 units per mg of protein at 25° and has been purified 450-fold from an acid-treated homogenate (approximately 1,000-fold from the 100,000 x g supernatant). Purified liver fructokinase has a Km of 0.2 to 0.5 mm for fructose and 1 to 2 mm for magnesium adenosine triphosphate, and the enzyme reaction produces equimolar amounts of fructose 1-phosphate and ADP. The enzyme phosphorylated d-fructose with ATP, 2'-dATP, or 3'-dATP and also phosphorylated l-sorbose, d-xylulose, and l-galactoheptulose with ATP. It is stimulated by cysteine and other thiols, inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, and has an activation energy of about 11 kcal per mole and a Q10 of 2."

One possibility is that they bind to and stabilize those parts of the DNA helix which are not covered by histones. This reduces both primary and secondary damage, and the DNA replication rate is decreased so that repair processes can act before alterations are replicated."

Koch, Kanungo1,2 used a saline solution containing 0.65 g sodium chloride, 0.03 g potassium chloride and 0.03 g calcium chloride in 100 ml. of distilled water and adjusted the pH of the saline to 6.3 with phosphate buffer, according to Maluf3. He also studied the effect of pH and temperature on the heart beat of the scorpion and he has shown that the heart remained active between pH 6.1 and 6.5 and the maximum rate of heart beat was observed at 42° C."
https://openalex.org/W188726779,"The carbamyl phosphate synthetase of frog liver particles catalyzes the synthesis of 1 mole of carbamyl phosphate, 1 mole of orthophosphate, and 2 moles of adenosine diphosphate from ammonia, bicarbonate, and 2 moles of ATP. It can produce orthophosphate from ATP if ammonia is replaced by either hydroxylamine or hydrazine. Both hydroxylamine and hydrazine are competitive inhibitors of carbamyl phosphate synthesis and, therefore, presumably replace ammonia or decompose the activated carbonate which is a precursor of carbamyl phosphate. Hydrazine replaces ammonia because it is incorporated into a labile phosphate which appears to be N-aminocarbamyl phosphate. It can be shown that the new derivative contains hydrazine, 14C from 14C-bicarbonate, and phosphate, the latter two in equal amounts. N-Aminocarbamyl phosphate migrates more slowly toward the anode at pH 6 in an electrical field than carbamyl phosphate. It is a markedly more acid-labile and base-stable phosphate than carbamyl phosphate. N-Aminocarbamyl phosphate cannot serve as a substrate for ornithine transcarbamylase. Hydroxylamine, however, does not appear to yield a carbamyl phosphate or hydroxylamine phosphate. It can be shown that hydroxylamine can act catalytically, and it is therefore suggested that it decomposes the activated carbonate which is the product of the first mole of ATP utilized by the enzyme. If 1 or 2 of the hydrogen atoms of hydrazine or hydroxylamine are replaced with methyl groups, the derivatives are not substrates. Glutamine will not serve as a substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2043097348,"MOUSE adapted scrapie, a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system, appears to be unusually resistant to heat and exposure to formalin. In view of this, it was decided to attempt to kill the experimental scrapie infectious agent by treating with some disinfectants, such as alcohol, a hypochlorite, a surface-active agent, and the agent was also boiled for 60 min. A 1 : 10 w/v suspension of mouse brain infected with scrapie was mixed with an equal volume of the suitably diluted disinfectant and the mixtures were kept overnight at + 4° C before female mice (18–20 g) were inoculated by the subcutaneous route. Each 0.5 ml. dose of the mixture contained 0.25 ml. of the infective material. Controls were inoculated with disinfectants and scrapie suspension. An additional control group was inoculated with 0.03 ml. of scrapie intracerebrally to give an early indication of the pathogenicity of the scrapie agent; the incubation period in mice was considerably shorter by this route1."
