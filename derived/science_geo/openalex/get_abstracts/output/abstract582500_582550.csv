This might change in a future world of precision medicine, where biomarkers will match specific drugs to the patients most likely to respond. Han et al. identified the mechanism of action of a cancer drug called indisulam, a sulfonamide tested previously in patients with solid tumors. Indisulam and related sulfonamides killed cells by disrupting precursor mRNA splicing. The drugs targeted a specific RNA splicing factor for degradation by “gluing” it to the CUL4-DCAF15 ubiquitin ligase. Experiments with cancer cell lines suggest that future clinical trials of these drugs should focus on leukemias and lymphomas with high DCAF15 expression levels. Science , this issue p. eaal3755"

Various strategies to mitigate hydrogen embrittlement, such as adding carbides into the steel, are hard to validate because we are unable to map the hydrogen atoms. Chen et al. combined fluxing steel samples with deuterium and a cryogenic transfer protocol to minimize hydrogen diffusion, allowing for detailed structural analysis (see the Perspective by Cairney). Their findings revealed hydrogen trapped in the cores of the carbide precipitates. The technique will be applicable to a wide range of problems, including corrosion, catalysis, and hydrogen storage.

For silenced genes, heterochromatin domains are associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications, and these histone marks are maintained during DNA replication and chromosome duplication (see the Perspective by De and Kassis). Laprell et al. show that parental methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) nucleosomes in Drosophila are inherited in daughter cells after replication and can repress transcription, but that they are not sufficient to propagate the mark. Trimethylation of newly incorporated nucleosomes requires recruitment of the methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to neighboring cis-regulatory DNA elements. Coleman and Struhl demonstrate that H3K27 trimethylated nucleosomes play a causal role in transmitting epigenetic memory at a Drosophila HOX gene through anchoring of PRC2 at the Polycomb response element binding site. Wang and Moazed examine fission yeast and show that both sequence-dependent and chromodomain sequence-independent mechanisms are required for stable epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications and the epigenetic maintenance of silencing.

Its role in whole-animal physiology has received comparatively little attention. In mammals, plasma uridine levels are tightly regulated, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Studying mouse models, Deng et al. show that plasma uridine levels are controlled by feeding behavior (see the Perspective by Jastroch and Tschöp). Fasting causes an adipocyte-mediated rise in plasma uridine, which triggers a lowering of body temperature. Feeding causes a bile-mediated drop in plasma uridine, which enhances insulin sensitivity in a leptin-dependent manner. Thus, uridine is part of a complex regulatory loop that affects energy balance and potentially contributes to metabolic disease. Science , this issue p. aaf5375 ; see also p. 1124"

https://openalex.org/W2595778161,"Daily, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) ingests a bolus of lipid and protein in the form of phagocytized photoreceptor outer segments (OS). The RPE, like the liver, expresses enzymes required for fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. This suggests that these pathways play a role in the disposal of lipids from ingested OS, as well as providing a mechanism for recycling metabolic intermediates back to the outer retina. In this study, we examined whether OS phagocytosis was linked to ketogenesis. We found increased levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) in the apical medium following ingestion of OS by human fetal RPE and ARPE19 cells cultured on Transwell inserts. No increase in ketogenesis was observed following ingestion of oxidized OS or latex beads. Our studies further defined the connection between OS phagocytosis and ketogenesis in wild-type mice and mice with defects in phagosome maturation using a mouse RPE explant model. In explant studies, the levels of β-HB released were temporally correlated with OS phagocytic burst after light onset. In the Mreg−/− mouse where phagosome maturation is delayed, there was a temporal shift in the release of β-HB. An even more pronounced shift in maximal β-HB production was observed in the Abca4−/− RPE, in which loss of the ATP-binding cassette A4 transporter results in defective phagosome processing and accumulation of lipid debris. These studies suggest that FAO and ketogenesis are key to supporting the metabolism of the RPE and preventing the accumulation of lipids that lead to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Glucose, the primary energy substrate utilized by the outer retina is transported to the outer retina by the RPE. The glucose transporter (GLUT1) is expressed in the basal and apical membrane of the RPE and facilitates transport of glucose from the choroid circulation into the outer retina. Additionally, the RPE supports photoreceptor activity and outer-segment (OS) renewal through the retinoid visual cycle and ingestion of shed photoreceptor outer segments (1Strauss O. The retinal pigment epithelium in visual function.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 845-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). On a daily basis, photoreceptors shed ˜10% of their lipid and protein-rich OS, for uptake and degradation by the RPE (3Young R.W. The renewal of photoreceptor cell outer segments.J.

Individual RPE cells phagocytose numerous OS daily; in the central mouse retina, each RPE cell digests the contents of over 200 photoreceptor outer segment tips daily (5Volland S. Esteve-Rudd J.

The complex mix of saturated and highly unsaturated fatty acids, which make up 50% of ingested OS (by weight), provides the RPE with substrates for mitochondrial and peroxisomal FAO (6Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Chemistry and metabolism of lipids in the vertebrate retina.Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar).

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1943-1955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our own in vitro studies have demonstrated that human RPE cells can use palmitate (16:0), a major lipid component of OS for FAO (15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B. Philp N.J. The retinal pigment epithelium utilizes fatty acids for ketogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20570-20582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Use of these nutrients as metabolic substrates requires enzymes essential for FAO, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A and the trifunctional protein complex, both of which are expressed in mouse and human RPE (16Tyni T. Paetau A. Strauss A.W. Middleton B. Kivelä T.

Res. 2004; 56: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in the long-chain 3-hydroxyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activity of the trifunctional protein leads to progressive pigment retinopathy, characterized by lipid accumulation, RPE atrophy, and pigment deposits (17Polinati P.P. Ilmarinen T. Trokovic R. Hyotylainen T. Otonkoski T. Suomalainen A. Skottman H. Tyni T. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells: understanding the pathogenesis of retinopathy in long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2015; 56: 3371-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, lipid accumulation is found in the liver and kidney when FAO is slowed because of mutations or metabolic reprogramming and is often associated with fibrosis (18Kang H.M. Ahn S.H. Choi P. Ko Y.A. Han S.H. Chinga F. Park A.S. Tao J. Sharma K. Pullman J. Bottinger E.P. Goldberg I.J. Susztak K. Defective fatty acid oxidation in renal tubular epithelial cells has a key role in kidney fibrosis development.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). We predict that in the RPE, mitochondrial dysfunction would not only lead to metabolic reprograming but would also disrupt the normal flow of nutrients to the outer retina. A fate of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA derived from FAO is the formation of ketone bodies: acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB). The liver synthesizes ketones during fasting and lactation, providing a source of energy for peripheral tissues (19Cotter D.G. Ercal B. Huang X. Leid J.M. d'Avignon D.A. Graham M.J. Dietzen D.J. Brunt E.M. Patti G.J. Crawford P.A. Ketogenesis prevents diet-induced fatty liver injury and hyperglycemia.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 5175-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the RPE expresses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme required for ketogenesis. We showed in vitro that the RPE can generate β-HB from palmitate, a saturated fatty acid that makes up 15% of all lipids in the OS (6Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Chemistry and metabolism of lipids in the vertebrate retina.Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B.

In the current study we tested the hypothesis that ingested OS serve as a substrate for RPE ketogenesis. Ketone body release was found to depend on diurnal phagocytosis of OS with defects in phagosome maturation contributing to metabolic delay as demonstrated in our mouse RPE explant models. The RPE has a daily diet of fatty acid rich OS that could provide substrates for FAO and ketogenesis. HMGCS2, the rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme in ketogenesis, converts acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA as illustrated in Fig. 1A. HMGCS2 protein was expressed in polarized hfRPE cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether human fetal RPE (hfRPE) uses lipids from OS as substrates for FAO and ketogenesis, polarized hfRPE in culture were fed purified OS, and β-HB released into the apical and basal media was quantified. The cells were incubated with Ringer's containing: 1) no substrate; 2) glucose (5 mm); 3) purified OS (200 μm, total phospholipid); or 4) glucose (5 mm) and purified OS (200 μm). β-HB levels in the apical and basal chambers were determined after 2- and 3-h incubations. As shown in Fig. 1C, hfRPE fed glucose alone produced little β-HB (0.83 ± 0.10 nmol in 3 h), whereas cells fed OS in the presence of 5 mm glucose released significantly more β-HB into the apical chamber (3.48 ± 0.11 nmol in 3 h). β-HB released with glucose + OS was time-dependent with an increase from 2.27 ± 0.03 nmol in 2 h to 3.48 ± 0.11 nmol in 3 h (Fig. 1C). β-HB levels in the basal chamber were below the limit of detection as reported previously with palmitate as the substrate for β-oxidation (15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B. Philp N.J. The retinal pigment epithelium utilizes fatty acids for ketogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20570-20582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of mammalian OS is unique with a relatively high concentration of DHA (7Bazan N.G. The metabolism of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the eye: the possible role of docosahexaenoic acid and docosanoids in retinal physiology and ocular pathology.Prog. Clin. Biol.

Pharmacological manipulation of docosahexaenoic-phospholipid biosynthesis in photoreceptor cells: implications in retinal degeneration.J. Ocular Pharmacol. 1994; 10: 591-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When hfRPE cells were incubated with DHA conjugated to BSA (200 μm DHA + 5 mm glucose), a 237 ± 14.7% increase in β-HB secretion was observed as compared with Ringer's solution alone (Fig. 1D). To provide further evidence that the ingested OS lipids provided substrate for FAO and β-HB generation, OS were photo-oxidized under UV light. Oxidized fatty acids do not serve as substrates for FAO and β-HB generation; instead they are detoxified via a glutathione peroxidase (22van Kuijk F.J. Dratz E.A. Detection of phospholipid peroxides in biological samples.Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There was no increase in β-HB levels when hfRPE were incubated with photo-oxidized OS (oxOS) (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, latex beads were used as a control to determine whether non-lipid-containing phagocytosed particles provide a substrate for β-HB production. There was no increase in β-HB levels when hfRPE were incubated with latex beads (Fig. 1D). The human RPE cell line, ARPE-19, expressed HMGCS2 (Fig. 2A) and released similar amounts of β-HB into the apical medium (3.10 ± 0.04 nmol) as hfRPE upon OS challenge in 5 mm glucose for 3 h (Fig. 2B). Little β-HB was released when OS were added in the absence of glucose. β-HB secretion was dose-dependent; as the concentration of ingested OSs increased from 25 to 250 μm, β-HB secretion increased 13-fold from 0.22 ± 0.08 to 1.66 ± 0.15 nmol (Fig. 2C). This dose-dependent increase in β-HB mirrored the extent of OS phagocytosed as reflected in the levels of rhodopsin in the RPE after 3 h (Fig. 2D). Moreover, 3 h after OS addition, the free-fatty-acid content of the RPE more than doubled from 10.3 ± 1.92 to 25.5 ± 1.13 μm. When only purified OS lipids in the form of liposomes were provided as substrates, there was a dose-dependent increase in β-HB released up to ˜200 μm total phospholipid (Fig. 2E). Similar levels of β-HB were released into the apical chamber with OS and purified lipids, suggesting that protein-derived metabolic intermediates were not the source of ketones. Analogous to hfRPE, no increase in β-HB was detected when ARPE19 was incubated with oxOS or latex beads (Fig. 2F). DHA was also a substrate for ketogenesis in ARPE19. Melanoregulin (MREG) is an intracellular cargo-sorting protein required for the degradation of OS disks (21Bazan N.G. Rodriguez de Turco E.B.

Med. 1987; 3: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is a LC3-binding partner that is critical for complete degradation of OS through LC3-associated phagocytosis (35Jiang M.

To determine whether delayed phagosome degradation correlated with diminished β-HB secretion, MREG-deficient ARPE19 cells (MREG KD, designated M5) were fed OS (Fig. 3). In M5 cells, β-HB release decreased by ˜50% at the 3-h time point (Fig. 3B). This decrease was not due to diminished OS uptake because loss of MREG did not affect OS uptake in vitro or in vivo (23Damek-Poprawa M. Diemer T. Lopes V.S. Lillo C. Harper D.C. Marks M.S. Wu Y.

In the mouse retina, Hmgcs2 was detected in RPE but was not detected in the neural retina as determined by in situ hybridization with an Hmgcs2-specific probe (Fig. 4A). The HMGCS2 protein was expressed in mouse RPE where it co-localized with the mitochondrial enzyme COXIV (Fig. 4B). To determine whether in vivo ketogenesis is linked to FAO of ingested OS lipids, we developed an ex vivo assay. Eyes were isolated at different times in the light-dark cycle, and β-HB release was measured from mouse RPE explants as illustrated schematically in Fig. 4C. The number of phagosomes in mouse RPE peaks within an hour after light onset (Refs. 25LaVail M.M. Rod outer segment disc shedding in relation to cyclic lighting.Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 23: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 26LaVail M.M. Circadian nature of rod outer segment disc shedding in the rat.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1980; 19: 407-411PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5A). We reasoned that if RPE cells utilize ingested OS as substrate for ketogenesis, β-HB production should increase following ingestion and degradation of outer segments. Therefore, we measured the release of β-HB from isolated RPE choroid explants isolated at different times after light onset. In these experiments, posterior eyecups were prepared and immediately incubated in Ringer's solution as detailed previously (15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B. Philp N.J. The retinal pigment epithelium utilizes fatty acids for ketogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20570-20582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amount of β-HB released was measured 2 h after explant harvest. As shown in Fig. 4D, the highest levels of β-HB were correlated with RPE harvest at 7 a.m. (lights on), a point at which the RPE generally ingests the largest percentage of OS; β-HB levels subsequently decreased with no other statistically significant changes. HMGCS2 levels were highest at 7 a.m. harvest time (9 a.m. assay time), with no significant change in RPE HMGCS2 levels over the remaining 12-h time analyzed.Figure 5β-HB secretion is delayed coincident with slowed phagosome maturation in mouse RPE.

The Mreg−/− mouse exhibits a phagocytic burst at light onset; however, phagosome levels remain elevated for up to 8 h when compared with control C57Bl6/J RPE (Fig. 5A). HMGCs2 was expressed in Mreg−/− RPE mitochondria (Fig. 5B) with protein levels following a time-dependent distribution profile similar to that observed in wild-type C57Bl6/J mice (Fig. 5C), with a peak at 7 a.m. harvest time (9 a.m. assay time). β-HB release, however, did not follow the same temporal profile as seen in wild-type mice; delayed phagosome maturation resulted in a shift in peak time of β-HB production from 7 a.m. harvest and 9 a.m. assay to 10 a.m. harvest time corresponding to 12 p.m. assay time (Fig. 5D). This was a 3-h delay in maximal β-HB released. An even more pronounced shift in maximal β-HB production was observed in the Abca4−/−, in which loss of the ABCA4 transmembrane transporter (27Quazi F. Lenevich S. Molday R.S. ABCA4 is an N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine importer.Nat.

Maximal β-HB release in the Abca4−/− was observed 6 h after light onset (Table 1). In addition to a temporal shift in the maximal release of β-HB, the amount of β-HB released was less in the Abca4−/−, than control C57Bl6/J (Table 1). Collectively, these results suggest that phagosome maturation and processing by the RPE are integral to ketogenesis and transport of β-HB to the outer retina.Table 1Peak of maximal β-HB release varies with phagosome degradation efficiencyStrainPeak of β-HB release (time after light onset)β-HB in mediahμmC57Bl6/J215.0 ± 1.89Mreg−/−513.3 ± 0.94Abca4−/−69.52 ± 2.04aStatistical significance with p value < 0.050.a Statistical significance with p value < 0.050. Open table in a new tab The participation of the RPE in photoreceptor renewal has been known for almost 50 years. Bok and Young (3Young R.W. The renewal of photoreceptor cell outer segments.J.

Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) showed that the RPE was involved in the disposal phase of shed OS. In their 1969 paper, they noted that further work was needed to understand how the phagocytized OS material was “destroyed” (4Young R.W. Bok D. Participation of the retinal pigment epithelium in the rod outer segment renewal process.J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). We propose that the daily fat intake of the RPE through OS ingestion is similar to the lipid load of the hepatocyte. Individuals consuming a standard Western diet metabolize ˜100 g of fat daily or 0.4 nmol of fatty acids, with individual hepatocytes responsible for the metabolism of 0.1 pmol of fatty acid per day. Human RPE cells ingest and process 30 OS daily, which is equivalent to 0.1–0.15 pmol of fatty acid per cell (5Volland S. Esteve-Rudd J. Hoo J. Yee C. Williams D.S. A comparison of some organizational characteristics of the mouse central retina and the human macula.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0125631Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Herein we present the novel observation that the phagocytic function of the RPE provides metabolic substrates for RPE FAO and ketogenesis. These processes allow the RPE to spare glucose for the outer retina and prevents the accumulation of lipid debris (9Randle P.J. Regulatory interactions between lipids and carbohydrates: the glucose fatty acid cycle after 35 years.Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that hfRPE utilize the 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate as a substrate for FAO and ketogenesis (15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B. Philp N.J. The retinal pigment epithelium utilizes fatty acids for ketogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20570-20582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Herein we extended those studies to show that after ingestion of OS, the RPE produces β-HB. The relationship between OS degradation and the apical release of β-HB was firmly established in our in vitro models: hfRPE and ARPE19. Dysregulated phagosome processing, which occurs in the Mreg-KD M5 ARPE19 cells, resulted in decreased β-HB released. Given that OS uptake is not reduced in the Mreg-KD, the decreased β-HB is likely due to the delay in phagosome maturation documented in these cells (23Damek-Poprawa M. Diemer T. Lopes V.S. Lillo C. Harper D.C. Marks M.S. Wu Y. Sparrow J.R. Rachel R.A. Williams D.S. Boesze-Battaglia K. Melanoregulin (MREG) modulates lysosome function in pigment epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10877-10889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Collectively, our in vitro studies show that human RPEs express HMGCS2, the rate-limiting enzyme in ketogenesis, and generate β-HB upon OS digestion. These studies are the first to link ketogenesis with phagosome maturation in the RPE. Furthermore, DHA, like ingested OS, provides substrate for ketogenesis, whereas photo-oxidized OS does not. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that FAO plays an important role in facilitating the disposal of ingested OS, suggesting that FAO may be the primary pathway used by the RPE for energy production. Our previous studies suggest that RPE cells used ≈50% of acetyl-CoA derived from palmitate to produce β-HB (15Adijanto J. Du J. Moffat C. Seifert E.L. Hurle J.B. Philp N.J. The retinal pigment epithelium utilizes fatty acids for ketogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 20570-20582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these studies, feeding hfRPE cells 200 μm total phospholipid equivalent to ≈100 nmol of fatty acid substrate resulted in the release of 15 nmol of β-HB into the apical medium. The glucose requirement in the cultured model system Fig. 2B is likely 2-fold, glucose is required for phagosome maturation and is likely the source of reducing equivalents. In differentiated RPE, as is the case here, analysis of a panel of metabolites demonstrated that RPE cells produce NADH more rapidly from glucose than oxidative substrates (38Adijanto J. Philp N.J. Cultured primary human fetal retinal pigment epithelium (hfRPE) as a model for evaluating RPE metabolism.Exp. Eye Res. 2014; 126: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

We present a computer vision-based framework for the automatic localization and diagnosis of slit-lamp images by identifying the lens region of interest (ROI) and employing a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). First, three grading degrees for slit-lamp images are proposed in conjunction with three leading ophthalmologists. The lens ROI is located in an automated manner in the original image using two successive applications of Candy detection and the Hough transform, which are cropped, resized to a fixed size and used to form pediatric cataract datasets. These datasets are fed into the CNN to extract high-level features and implement automatic classification and grading. To demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the deep features extracted in the CNN, we investigate the features combined with support vector machine (SVM) and softmax classifier and compare these with the traditional representative methods. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method offers exceptional mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity: classification (97.07%, 97.28%, and 96.83%) and a three-degree grading area (89.02%, 86.63%, and 90.75%), density (92.68%, 91.05%, and 93.94%) and location (89.28%, 82.70%, and 93.08%).

Reduced activity of the histone deactylase Sir2 and consequent alteration of chromatin at mating loci have been implicated in the decreased sensitivity of old cells. However, Schlissel et al. found a different mechanism in the yeast strains that they studied (see the Perspective by Gitler and Jarosz). Proper response to mating pheromone requires arrest of the cell cycle mediated by an RNA-binding protein, Whi3. If aggregation of Whi3 in old cells was inhibited by deletion of a glutamine-rich region that promotes aggregation, loss of sensitivity to mating pheromone was partially prevented, and replicative life span was slightly increased.

In this study, we highlight novel post-transcriptional mechanisms that can modulate NLRP3 expression.

TTP targets AU-rich elements in the NLRP3 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and represses NLRP3 expression. Knocking down TTP in primary macrophages leads to an increased induction of NLRP3 by LPS, which is also accompanied by increased Caspase-1 and IL-1β cleavage upon NLRP3, but not AIM2 or NLRC4 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we found that human NLRP3 can be alternatively polyadenylated, producing a short 3′-UTR isoform that excludes regulatory elements, including the TTP- and miRNA-223-binding sites.

Using in vitro and ex vivo models, we found that AβOs transiently inhibit neuronal AMPK phosphorylation via an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated mechanism. We further found that AβOs instigate removal of glucose transporters 3 and 4 (GLUT3 and GLUT4, respectively) from the plasma membrane in hippocampal neurons via impaired AMPK activity. AβO-induced AMPK inhibition is accompanied by depletion of intracellular ATP in neurons. Significantly, the metabolic impact initiated by oligomers could be prevented by application of insulin. Current findings demonstrate a deleterious impact of AβOs on AMPK activity that may contribute to initial brain metabolic dysfunction, and suggest that maintaining physiological AMPK activity may be a useful approach to prevent neuronal damage in AD. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme comprised of a catalytic (α1 or α2) and two regulatory (β1 or β2, and γ1, γ2, or γ3) subunits. Binding of AMP to the γ subunit leads to AMPK activation by the obligatory phosphorylation at Thr172 (AMPK-Thr(P)172) (2Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G.

We initially investigated the impact of ΑβOs on AMPK-Thr(P)172 by immunocytochemistry in mature hippocampal neuronal cultures. AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels were significantly decreased in neurons exposed to 500 nm AβOs for 3 h (Fig. 1, A–C). Scrambled Aβ peptide had no effect on AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels (Fig. 1C). Total AMPK levels were not affected by 3-h exposure to AβOs (Fig. 1, D–F). We further investigated the impact of AβOs on neuronal AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels by Western immunoblotting. Results confirmed that AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels were reduced in cultures exposed to AβOs for 3 or 12 h (Fig. 1, G and H). Decreased AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels were further verified in ex vivo human cortical slices exposed to AβOs for 12 h (Fig. 1I). Results indicate that short-term AβO exposure inhibits AMPK in neurons. Deregulation of AMPK activity is often followed by metabolic defects. To investigate whether this might take place in an AD context, we measured levels of adenine nucleotides in neurons exposed to 500 nm AβOs. Significant decreases in ATP levels, in line with our previous results (21Saraiva L.M. Seixas da Silva G.S. Galina A. da-Silva W.S. Klein W.L. Ferreira S.T. De Felice F.G. Amyloid-β triggers the release of neuronal hexokinase 1 from mitochondria.PloS One. 2010; 5: e15230Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but not in AMP levels, were detected in both cultured cortical neurons and ex vivo human cortical slices exposed to AβOs for 12 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the ATPase activity of F0F1-ATP synthase was inhibited in neuronal cultures exposed to AβOs for 3 or 12 h (Fig. 2, C and D), the ATP synthase activity of isolated brain mitochondria was not affected by direct AβO exposure (Fig. 2E). This rules out a direct action on mitochondria and suggests that inhibition of neuronal ATP synthase was due to aberrant intracellular signaling triggered by AβOs. Besides impaired mitochondrial synthesis of ATP, its extracellular release and catabolism to adenosine could also contribute to decreased ATP levels in cultured neurons under stress (22Duarte A.I. Proença T. Oliveira C.R. Santos M.S. Rego A.C. Insulin restores metabolic function in cultured cortical neurons subjected to oxidative stress.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2863-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, significant increases in extracellular adenosine were detected in neuronal cultures exposed to AβOs for 3 or 12 h (Fig. 2, F and G). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction measurements showed no inhibition of cellular redox activity in cultures exposed to AβOs for 12 h (Fig. 2H), ruling out the possibility that increased extracellular adenosine levels were due to release from dead or damaged cells. These results indicate that AβO-exposed neurons undergo disturbances in energy homeostasis that include inhibition of mitochondrial synthesis of ATP and stimulation of its extracellular release. In previous works, we have demonstrated that AβOs cause activation of neuronal NMDARs leading to a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels and causing abnormal neuronal accumulation of reactive oxygen species, among other pathological consequences (23De Felice F.G.

Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that activation of NMDARs and calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B could mediate the impact of AβOs on AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels. To test this possibility, hippocampal cultures were pre-treated with the NMDAR blocker, MK801, or the calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, prior to the 3-h exposure to AβOs. Results indicate that MK801 prevented the impact of oligomers on AMPK-Thr(P)172, whereas no effect was observed with FK506 (Fig. 3, A and B). These observations suggest that NMDARs, but not calcineurin, are implicated in oligomer-induced AMPK inhibition. If AβO-induced reductions in AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels indeed mirror alterations in its activity, one might expect that pharmacological agents known to stimulate AMPK activity should be able to counteract AβO actions. In line with this hypothesis, pre-treatment with AICAR, an AMP-mimicking riboside, or with metformin, a known AMPK activator, prevented the decrease in AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels caused by exposure to AβOs in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4). AMPK plays a central role in cellular glucose uptake by facilitating the translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (27Thong F.S. Bilan P.J. Klip A.

J. 2004; 384: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because levels of GLUT3 and GLUT4 are decreased in AD brains (29Liu Y. Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Gong C.-X. Decreased glucose transporters correlate to abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer disease.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Simpson I.A. Chundu K.R. Davies-Hill T. Honer W.G. Davies P. Decreased concentrations of GLUT1 and GLUT3 glucose transporters in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we investigated the impact of AβOs on surface levels of these transporters in hippocampal cultures. Neurons targeted by AβOs exhibited markedly decreased surface levels of dendritic GLUT3 (Fig. 5, A–G) and GLUT4 (Fig. 5, H–N). As expected, compound C, a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK, decreased dendritic surface GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels (Fig. 5, E and L). Interestingly, AICAR blocked the decrease in surface levels of GLUTs induced by AβOs (Fig. 5, E and L). Results indicate that AβO-induced decreases in surface levels of glucose transporters are mediated by AMPK inhibition in neurons. Because prolonged inhibition of AMPK and sustained reductions in ATP and surface GLUT levels could lead to decreased cell viability and cell death, we investigated whether the impact of AβOs on neuronal metabolism would persist upon longer term exposures. We found that levels of AMPK-Thr(P)172 (Fig. 6A), total AMPK (Fig. 6B), and intracellular ATP (Fig. 6C) in neurons exposed to AβOs for 24 h were similar to those in vehicle-treated cultures. To examine the possibility that restoration of AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels after 24 h of exposure to oligomers was due to reduced levels of AβOs in the culture medium, we aimed to determine whether extracellular AβO levels were maintained for the duration of the 24-h incubation period. We exposed neuronal cultures to 500 nm AβOs for 3 or 24 h. Culture medium from 3 independent cultures was then collected, and immunoblot dot analysis was carried out using the NU4 anti-oligomer monoclonal antibody (31Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Chang L. Viola K.L. Fernandez S. Lacor P.N. Khuon D. Gong Y. Bigio E.H. Shaw P. De Felice F.G. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Monoclonal antibodies that target pathological assemblies of Aβ.J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Similar AβO immunoreactivities were observed at 3 or 24 h (compared with 500 nm AβOs in Neurobasal medium alone, used as a control), suggesting that restored levels of AMPK-Thr(P)172 were not related to depletion of AβOs from the medium upon longer (24 h) incubation with neuronal cultures (Fig. 6D). We further found that oligomers remain bound to neuronal processes 24 h after addition of AβOs to cultures (Fig. 6E), with a binding pattern identical to that observed at 3 h (Fig. 5, D and K). Furthermore, no significant impact on surface levels of GLUT3 (Fig. 6, F and G) was verified after 24 h of exposure of neurons to AβOs. A nonstatistically significant (p = 0.08) trend of decrease in surface levels of GLUT4 was observed after 24 h of exposure to AβOs (Fig. 6, H and I). Control experiments showed that exposure to 500 nm AβOs for 12, 24, or 48 h had no effect on MTT reduction in hippocampal cultures (Fig. 6J, see also Ref. 32De Felice F.G. Wu D. Lambert M.P. Fernandez S.J. Velasco P.T. Lacor P.N. Bigio E.H. Jerecic J. Acton P.J. Shughrue P.J. Chen-Dodson E. Kinney G.G. Klein W.L. Alzheimer's disease-type neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation induced by Aβ oligomers.Neurobiol. Aging. 2008; 29: 1334-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), indicating preserved cellular redox activity under these conditions. No reduction in cell viability was further detected in hippocampal neurons exposed to AβOs or scrambled Aβ for 24 or 48 h, as measured using a live/dead assay (Fig. 6K). Collectively, results indicate that AβOs trigger transient inhibition of AMPK with early deleterious consequences in terms of neuronal energy metabolism (decreased ATP and surface levels of GLUTs), and that compensatory mechanisms operate to re-establish homeostasis and prevent further metabolic damage and cell death upon longer term exposure to AβOs. Stimulation of brain insulin signaling has been suggested as a promising therapeutic approach in AD (33Reger M.A. Watson G.S. Green P.S. Wilkinson C.W. Baker L.D. Cholerton B.

We thus hypothesized that bolstering insulin signaling might protect neurons from the inhibition of AMPK by AβOs. We found that pre-treatment of hippocampal cultures with insulin prevented the decrease in neuronal AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels (Fig. 7, A and B) induced by a 3-h exposure to AβOs. Insulin alone had no effect on neuronal AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels (Fig. 7B). Insulin further prevented the increase in extracellular adenosine levels induced by 3- or 12-h exposure of hippocampal cultures to AβOs (Fig. 7, C and D). Results indicate that insulin prevents the inhibition of AMPK and metabolic deregulation induced by AβOs, thereby extending the grounds toward the translational potential of insulin in AD. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of AD, we have found that AβOs transiently inhibit neuronal AMPK through a NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism, and decrease ATP and glucose transporter levels. Previous observations indicate that AβOs are implicated in different processes leading to neuronal dysfunction, including oxidative stress, abnormal Tau phosphorylation, and synapse loss (32De Felice F.G.

The discovery that AβOs interfere with AMPK activity indicates a new mechanism contributing to neuronal metabolic defects that are germane to AD.

Here, we use limited proteolysis to investigate the role of the N and C termini in ATP hydrolysis and auto-inhibition of the yeast flippase Drs2p-Cdc50p. We show that limited proteolysis of the detergent-solubilized and purified yeast flippase may result in more than 1 order of magnitude increase of its ATPase activity, which remains dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a regulator of this lipid flippase, and specific to a phosphatidylserine substrate. Using thrombin as the protease, Cdc50p remains intact and in complex with Drs2p, which is cleaved at two positions, namely after Arg104 and after Arg 1290, resulting in a homogeneous sample lacking 104 and 65 residues from its N and C termini, respectively. Removal of the 1291–1302-amino acid region of the C-terminal extension is critical for relieving the auto-inhibition of full-length Drs2p, whereas the 1–104 N-terminal residues have an additional but more modest significance for activity. The present results therefore reveal that trimming off appropriate regions of the terminal extensions of Drs2p can greatly increase its ATPase activity in the presence of PI4P and demonstrate that relief of such auto-inhibition remains compatible with subsequent regulation by PI4P. These experiments suggest that activation of the Drs2p-Cdc50p flippase follows a multistep mechanism, with preliminary release of a number of constraints, possibly through the binding of regulatory proteins in the trans-Golgi network, followed by full activation by PI4P.

Energy-independent lipid transporters generally referred to as phospholipid “scramblases” fulfill this activity (2Menon I. Huber T. Sanyal S. Banerjee S. Barré P. Canis S. Warren J.D. Hwa J.

In contrast to these phospholipid scramblases, which equilibrate lipid concentrations in a relatively nonspecific manner over the two leaflets of biological membranes, active transporters termed “flippases” use the chemical energy of ATP to catalyze uphill transport of specific lipids, thereby creating and maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in the membranes in which they are embedded. One of the most prominent lipids actively transported by flippases is phosphatidylserine (PS), which is enriched in the cytosolic leaflet of membranes from the late secretory/endocytic pathways. PS asymmetry is critical for cell life as signaling proteins that contain stretches of basic residues, such as K-Ras, use the negatively charged headgroup of PS lipids as a docking site (5Zhou Y.

Also, PS is the target of C2 domain-containing proteins like protein kinase C and synaptotagmin, respectively involved in protein phosphorylation and membrane fusion. Conversely, dissipation of PS asymmetry at the plasma membrane is an early and very potent apoptotic signal that triggers recognition by macrophages (7Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J.

Phospholipid flippases belong to the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) (8Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P.

For instance, mutations in ATP8B1 are directly linked to intrahepatic cholestasis, a liver disease that in severe forms may progress toward liver failure and death before adulthood (9van der Mark V.A.

Although the molecular mechanism of phospholipid transport through P4-ATPases has drawn much attention in the recent years (11López-Marqués R.L. Poulsen L.R. Bailly A. Geisler M. Pomorski T.G.

Recent studies with a yeast flippase suggested that lipids flip across the membrane through a peripheral pathway, along the protein/lipid interface (13Baldridge R.D. Graham T.R.

However, this view was challenged by studies on another phospholipid-translocating P4-ATPase, the mammalian ATP8A2-CDC50A complex, suggesting that the lipid headgroup-binding site might be more deeply buried into the ATPase helix bundle (15Vestergaard A.L.

Drs2p specifically interacts with Cdc50p, a glycosylated membrane protein that is required for ER exit of the flippase complex (16Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K.

When embedded in TGN membranes, Drs2p has been shown to translocate fluorescently labeled PS (i.e. PS bearing an NBD fluorescent moiety on one of its acyl chains) at the energetic expense of ATP hydrolysis (20Natarajan P.

Such NBD-PS transport activity has been further demonstrated after purification and reconstitution into proteoliposomes (22Zhou X. Graham T.R.

This activity was found to be strictly dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) (23Azouaoui H. Montigny C. Ash M.-R. Fijalkowski F. Jacquot A. Grønberg C. López-Marqués R.L. Palmgren M.G.

P4-ATPases are predicted to contain 10 transmembrane spans and a large cytosolic region. The cytosolic region is made of three distinct pieces as follows: the nucleotide-binding (N) domain binds ATP; the phosphorylation (P) domain is phosphorylated from ATP during the transport cycle; and the actuator (N) domain contains a strongly conserved motif involved in the dephosphorylation of the P domain (Fig. 1A). Compared with ATP8A2 and with most P2-ATPases, Drs2p contains relatively long N- and C-terminal extensions of up to ˜190–200 amino acids on the N-side and ˜130–140 amino acids on the C-side (Fig. 1A), to which various regulators of Drs2p are known to bind. The Arf-like protein Arl1p interacts with the N terminus of Drs2p, stimulating Drs2p ATPase activity in purified TGN membranes (25Tsai P.-C. Hsu J.-W. Liu Y.-W. Chen K.-Y. Lee F.-J. Arl1p regulates spatial membrane organization at the trans-Golgi network through interaction with Arf-GEF Gea2p and flippase Drs2p.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E668-E677Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein Gea2p and PI4P regulate the activity of Drs2p upon binding to its C terminus (26Chantalat S. Park S.-K. Hua Z. Liu K. Gobin R. Peyroche A. Rambourg A. Graham T.R. Jackson C.L. The Arf activator Gea2p and the P-type ATPase Drs2p interact at the Golgi in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J.

Regulation of a Golgi flippase by phosphoinositides and an ArfGEF.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a recent study suggested that the C-terminal tail of Drs2p exerts an auto-inhibitory effect on Drs2p activity, an auto-inhibition that would be relieved by binding of PI4P (28Zhou X. Sebastian T.T. Graham T.R. Auto-inhibition of Drs2p, a yeast phospholipid flippase, by its carboxyl-terminal tail.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31807-31815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, a relatively common feature of a number of P-type ATPases (e.g. plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases and H+-ATPases) is that N- and/or C-terminal extensions of a central core structure contribute significant auto-inhibition to the full-length protein activity, with regulators often releasing such auto-inhibition by binding to these peripheral extensions and thereby relieving their impact on binding events and domain movements required for catalytic activity (29Curran A.C.

Chem. 2010; 285: 7344-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We earlier attempted 3H. Azouaoui, A. Jacquot, C. Montigny, P. Champeil, and G. Lenoir, unpublished results. to overexpress, together with Cdc50p, a number of truncated variants of Drs2p, in which portions of the Drs2p N or C terminus had been deliberately deleted. However, C-terminally truncated variants of Drs2p were poorly expressed and solubilized from yeast membranes, and the glycosylation pattern of the co-expressed Cdc50p was altered, suggesting that C-terminal truncation of Drs2p has a deleterious impact on Drs2p-Cdc50p association. Obviously, such attempts may suffer from the possibility that one does not necessarily guess correctly at which exact point truncation should be performed for relieving auto-inhibition without inducing collateral effects. As an alternative approach, we submitted the purified full-length Drs2p-Cdc50p complex to limited proteolysis, anticipating that the presumably poorly structured Drs2p extensions would be more susceptible to proteolysis than the well organized domains of its central core and that limited proteolysis under appropriate conditions would allow us to investigate the functional properties of a complex devoid of its regulatory extensions. Here, we show that thrombin treatment of the purified Drs2p-Cdc50p complex in the presence of PI4P results in the formation of a polypeptide devoid of the first 104 N-terminal residues and of the last 65 C-terminal residues. We found that such truncation of Drs2p stimulates ATPase activity to a very large and previously unrecognized extent, namely by 10–20-fold (30–50-fold when trypsin is used as the protease). Remarkably, stimulation of ATPase activity remains strongly dependent on PI4P, even though truncation of the C-terminal region occurred in the vicinity of the predicted PI4P-binding site. Our data demonstrate that full activation of Drs2p-Cdc50p by PI4P is not mediated through a simple PI4P-induced displacement of the whole C-terminal tail. Instead, we propose a multistep mechanism where the C-terminal tail of Drs2p, in cooperation with the N terminus, must be displaced before PI4P can exert its full stimulatory role. Because secondary structure predictions suggest that the N and C termini of Drs2p are intrinsically disordered, our rationale was that limited proteolysis might be a convenient tool to remove these possible auto-inhibitory extensions. Therefore, we subjected the purified Drs2p-Cdc50p complex to such proteolysis and monitored its ATPase activity using a continuous assay based on NADH oxidation by a regenerating system (33Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. Enzyme kinetics and substrate stabilization of detergent-solubilized and membranous (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-activated ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Effect of protein-protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the activity of an intact purified Drs2p-Cdc50p complex was first assayed in the presence of PI4P, which has been shown to be essential for activation of this intact complex (23Azouaoui H. Montigny C. Ash M.-R. Fijalkowski F. Jacquot A. Grønberg C. López-Marqués R.L. Palmgren M.G. Garrigos M. le Maire M. Decottignies P. Gourdon P. Nissen P. Champeil P. Lenoir G.

As expected, the rate of NADH absorption changes resulting from its very low ATPase activity was only slightly different from the background rate of NADH absorption changes. Note that although this PI4P-stimulated activity was hardly distinguishable from the background noise using the NADH assay, it could be unambiguously measured with a larger protein concentration using a phosphomolybdate procedure (Fig. 1D) (23Azouaoui H. Montigny C. Ash M.-R. Fijalkowski F. Jacquot A. Grønberg C. López-Marqués R.L. Palmgren M.G. Garrigos M. le Maire M. Decottignies P. Gourdon P. Nissen P. Champeil P. Lenoir G.

When the Drs2p-Cdc50p complex had been treated beforehand with trypsin, a much higher rate of NADH oxidation showed up, implying activation of the complex by proteolysis (Fig. 1B). The observed effect was specifically associated with Drs2p activation, as treatment with trypsin of the inactive E342Q mutant of Drs2p did not result in any increase of its activity (Fig. 1B). The specific ATPase activity was stimulated about 30–50-fold after trypsin treatment, increasing from ˜0.03–0.07 to ˜ 1.5–2.0 μmol·min−1·mg−1. Pre-treatment of the Drs2p-Cdc50p complex with thrombin also led to a large increase in ATPase activity, although to a slightly lower level (Fig. 1, C and D). When other proteases were used in the presence of PI4P, like chymotrypsin or the poorly specific proteinase K and subtilisin proteases, stimulation of the ATPase activity of the purified complex was also observed, although to various extents (data not shown), suggesting that the portions of the Drs2p-Cdc50p complex attacked by the various proteases are indeed especially exposed or disordered and that the remaining proteolysis fragments displaying high ATPase activity are fairly resistant to further degradation. A specific feature of proteolysis by thrombin versus proteolysis by other proteases is that Cdc50p remains intact under these conditions (Fig. 2A). In the rest of this study, we therefore resorted to thrombin to investigate the effect of proteolysis-dependent truncation on Drs2p-Cdc50p function. After proteolysis was quenched, the proteolyzed samples were used for studying their electrophoretic migration pattern as well as for determining their ATPase activity. Fig. 2A shows results selected from a number of different combinations of proteolysis periods and temperatures. In the absence of PI4P, proteolysis of the ˜150-kDa full-length Drs2p chain led to transient accumulation of large fragments (named fragments 1 and 2), with little if any accumulation of smaller fragments in the 30–100-kDa range. Extending the proteolysis period from 20 to 60 min (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 2A) slightly favored disappearance of the larger fragments (“1”) and accumulation of the smaller fragments (“2”), suggesting that the latter is relatively resistant to proteolysis. Interestingly, the presence of PI4P during proteolysis strongly favored formation of the smaller fragment (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2A). Irrespective of whether proteolysis was performed in the absence or presence of PI4P (samples named T− and T+, respectively), the activity of wild-type Drs2p-Cdc50p in the presence of PI4P increased very significantly compared with the very low ATPase activity of the untreated complex (Fig. 2B). Yet activation of the proteolyzed sample was maximal when proteolysis had occurred in the presence of PI4P, in line with an increase of the fragment 2 species (T+ sample in Fig. 2, A and B). We first analyzed the proteolysis products using N-terminal sequencing (left panels in Fig. 3). For untreated purified Drs2p, N-terminal residues were identified as GXGXGMND, in line with the fact that in our construct, four additional linking glycines together with one glycine from the TEV site are present upstream of the first residue. As to the bands resulting from proteolysis with thrombin (fragments 1 and 2 in T− and fragment 2 in T+), their N-terminal first amino acids were identified as being 105AVKPP for both fragments 1 and 2. All thrombin-derived fragments therefore start at the same location, Ala105, immediately after Arg104. Although cleavage after Arg104 fits with the generally accepted view that thrombin only cleaves polypeptides after an arginine, the present cleavage site (… QSLR↓AVKPP….) deviates significantly from the LVPR↓GS consensus sequence. To estimate the exact molecular masses of Drs2p fragments 1 and 2 and thereby identify the sites of C-terminal cleavage, the thrombin-derived samples were further purified on a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column and submitted to MALDI-TOF analysis (right panels in Fig. 3). In all cases, mass spectra revealed a major peak at 52.3 ± 0.1 kDa, likely reflecting glycosylated Cdc50p. For untreated samples, the mass spectrum also displayed a peak at an m/z value close to the one expected for full-length Drs2p, m/z ˜153.9 kDa (theoretical mass = 154.0 kDa), as well as a peak corresponding to the doubly charged polypeptide (z = 2) at m/z ˜77.0 kDa. For T− samples, the mass spectrum revealed a large component at an m/z of ˜141.6 kDa, as well as the companion peak (for z = 2) at m/z ˜70.9 kDa. As the calculated mass for the Ala105–Ile1355 polypeptide is 141.9 kDa, this component in T− samples fits with fragment 1 resulting from a unique truncation of Drs2p at N-terminal position 105, i.e. left untouched at its C terminus. For T+ samples, a major component was found at m/z ˜134.5 kDa, with the companion peak (for z = 2) at m/z ˜67.3 kDa. Assuming that thrombin cleavage occurs after an arginine, and considering the N-terminal residue of fragment 2 (Ala105) as well as the limited number of arginine residues in the C-terminal region of Drs2p, the conclusion is that fragment 2 in the T+ sample must end at Arg1290, the calculated mass of which is 134.7 kDa. Indeed, the arginine residues closest to Arg1290 in Drs2p sequence are Arg1273 and Arg1298, and masses for polypeptides ending at those residues would be 132.8 and 135.7 kDa, respectively, well beyond experimental error. Note that the mass spectrum of the T+ sample reveals a minor peak at ˜141.8 kDa, presumably corresponding to the small amount of fragment 1 in T+, and the mass spectrum of the T− sample also reveals a minor peak at ˜134.5 kDa, presumably corresponding to the small amount of fragment 2 in T−. Hence, a consistent picture appears to be as follows (Fig. 3D); regardless of the presence or absence of PI4P during cleavage, thrombin treatment removes the N-terminal region of Drs2p after residue Arg104. In the absence of PI4P, the primary product is mainly cleaved at the N terminus only, and has a molecular mass of 141.9 kDa (fragment 1 in Fig. 2A). In the presence of PI4P, the primary product is cleaved both at the N terminus after residue Arg104 and at the C terminus after residue Arg1290, producing an Ala105–Arg1290 polypeptide whose molecular mass is 134.7 kDa (fragment 2 in Fig. 2A). The main Drs2p polypeptide in T+ samples is therefore lacking 104 residues from its N terminus and 65 residues from its C terminus.

Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in an IO IBD patient and subsequent sequencing of the candidate gene in 12 additional IO IBD patients revealed two patients with two mutated ankyrin repeat and zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (ANKZF1) alleles (homozygous ANKZF1 R585Q mutation and compound heterozygous ANKZF1 E152K and V32_Q87del mutations, respectively) and two patients with one mutated ANKZF1 allele. Although the function of ANKZF1 in mammals had not been previously evaluated, we show that ANKZF1 has an indispensable role in the mitochondrial response to cellular stress. ANKZF1 is located diffusely in the cytoplasm and translocates to the mitochondria upon cellular stress. ANKZF1 depletion reduces mitochondrial integrity and mitochondrial respiration under conditions of cellular stress. The ANKZF1 mutations identified in IO IBD patients with two mutated ANKZF1 alleles result in dysfunctional ANKZF1, as shown by an increased level of apoptosis in patients' lymphocytes, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in patient fibroblasts with a homozygous ANKZF1 R585Q mutation, and an inability of ANKZF1 R585Q and E152K to rescue the phenotype of yeast deficient in Vms1, the yeast homologue of ANKZF1. These data indicate that loss-of-function mutations in ANKZF1 result in deregulation of mitochondrial integrity, and this may play a pathogenic role in the development of IO IBD. Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO IBD) is an invalidating illness with an onset before 2 years of age and has a complex pathophysiology in which genetic factors are important. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in an IO IBD patient and subsequent sequencing of the candidate gene in 12 additional IO IBD patients revealed two patients with two mutated ankyrin repeat and zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (ANKZF1) alleles (homozygous ANKZF1 R585Q mutation and compound heterozygous ANKZF1 E152K and V32_Q87del mutations, respectively) and two patients with one mutated ANKZF1 allele. Although the function of ANKZF1 in mammals had not been previously evaluated, we show that ANKZF1 has an indispensable role in the mitochondrial response to cellular stress.

https://openalex.org/W2596220152,"The special-pair chlorophyll (Chl) P680 in photosystem II has an extremely high redox potential (Em) to enable water oxidation in photosynthesis. Significant positive-charge localization on one of the Chl constituents, PD1 or PD2, in P680+ has been proposed to contribute to this high Em. To identify the Chl molecule on which the charge is mainly localized, we genetically introduced a hydrogen bond to the 131-keto C=O group of PD1 and PD2 by changing the nearby D1-Val-157 and D2-Val-156 residues to His, respectively. Successful hydrogen bond formation at PD1 and PD2 in the obtained D1-V157H and D2-V156H mutants, respectively, was monitored by detecting 131-keto C=O vibrations in Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) difference spectra upon oxidation of P680 and the symmetrically located redox-active tyrosines YZ and YD, and they were simulated by quantum-chemical calculations. Analysis of the P680+/P680 FTIR difference spectra of D1-V157H and D2-V156H showed that upon P680+ formation, the 131-keto C=O frequency upshifts by a much larger extent in PD1 (23 cm−1) than in PD2 (≪9 cm−1). In addition, thermoluminescence measurements revealed that the D1-V157H mutation increased the Em of P680 to a larger extent than did the D2-V156H mutation. These results, together with the previous results for the mutants of the His ligands of PD1 and PD2, lead to a definite conclusion that a charge is mainly localized to PD1 in P680+."

Similar to other microbial-type rhodopsins, ChR2 contains a seven-transmembrane domain (TM) structural motif with the chromophore all-trans-retinal bound to a single lysine on TM 7 through a protonated Schiff base linkage (Lys-257 in ChR2) (1Nagel G.

Although structurally similar, ChR2 differs from other microbial-type rhodopsin ion pumps because ChR2 undergoes larger conformational changes in the protein backbone upon photo-isomerization. Like microbial rhodopsins, ChR2 can act as an inefficient proton pump in the absence of an electrochemical gradient (4Feldbauer K. Zimmermann D. Pintschovius V. Spitz J. Bamann C. Bamberg E.

Activation of ChR2 with blue light gives rise to a transient peak current (Ip), which decays to steady-state value (Iss) under continuous illumination (Fig. 1A). Once the light is turned off, Iss decays biexponentially back to zero. Subsequent light pulses result in reduced Ip but equivalent ISS, suggesting that ChR2 enters a desensitized state in the dark. Initially, the ChR2 photocycle was represented by a three-state model with closed, open, and desensitized states (1Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W. Kateriya S. Adeishvili N. Berthold P. Ollig D. Hegemann P. Bamberg E. Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13940-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). Although the three-state model qualitatively described ChR2 photocurrents, it could not quantitatively describe ChR2 kinetics. More recently, a four-state model developed under continuous illumination conditions containing two open (conducting) and two closed (non-conducting) states in equilibrium has been able to quantitatively reproduce ChR2 photocurrents (16Nikolic K.

In this four-state model, photoactivation transitions ChR2 from the ground (closed) state, C1, to the initial high-conducting (open) state, O1 (Fig. 1B). Under continuous illumination, O1 rapidly decays to the lesser conducting (open) state, O2. When illumination ends, O2 decays to the desensitized ground (closed) state, C2. In prolonged darkness, C2 undergoes a transition to C1, which is due to retinal re-isomerization as well as protonation of one or more residues in or near the retinal binding pocket (3Nagel G.

Kinetic evaluation of photosensitivity in genetically engineered neurons expressing green algae light-gated channels.Neurosci. Res. 2006; 54: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Within this four-state model, it is important to note that Ip is a combination of mostly O1 with a fraction of ChR2 already in the O2 state, whereas ISS contains a more transiently stable population of O1 and O2. Finally, after light is turned off, ChR2 is primarily in the C2 state. Upon extended time in the dark, ChR2 will be predominantly in the C1 state. Although the four-state model can quantify the transition states for ChR2 under prolonged activation, the mechanism of light-induced ChR2-mediated cation conductance is unresolved. Analysis of structural and functional experiments has led to the proposal that ion permeation occurs between TMs 1, 2, 3, and 7, which form a large extracellular vestibule filled with water and lined with negatively charged residues (18Eisenhauer K.

Cysteine scanning mutagenesis followed by labeling with methanethiosulfonate derivatives on TM 3 and TM 7 provided experimental evidence that residues comprising these TMs partially mediate ion conductance (8Richards R.

Mutation of Gln-117, which resides at the interface of the extracellular domain and TM 3, has been proposed to disrupt a potential hydrogen bond with Glu-101 at the extracellular interface on TM 2.

Equally significant for understanding ChR2 function is the gating mechanism for activation. Initially, it was thought that a hydrogen bond was required between Cys-128 and Asp-156 for proper channel function and kinetics (24Bamann C. Gueta R. Kleinlogel S. Nagel G. Bamberg E.

However, inspection of the channelrhodopsin chimera C1C2 crystal structure revealed that the distance between Cys-167 and Asp-195 (Cys-128 and Asp-156 in ChR2) is ≫ 4 Å. This suggests that no direct hydrogen bonding occurs between these residues (19Kato H.E. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Ramakrishnan C. Nishizawa T. Hirata K. Ito J. Aita Y. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi S. Hegemann P.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Asp-156 is the internal proton donor for the Schiff base (30Lórenz-Fonfría V.A. Resler T. Krause N. Nack M. Gossing M. Fischer von Mollard G. Bamann C. Bamberg E. Schlesinger R. Heberle J. Transient protonation changes in channelrhodopsin-2 and their relevance to channel gating.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E1273-E1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This indicates that Cys-128 has an undiscovered role in ChR2 function. Currently, gating has been suggested to be controlled, at least partially, through the large conformational changes of the protein and subsequent hydration of helices (31Sattig T. Rickert C. Bamberg E. Steinhoff H.J. Bamann C. Light-induced movement of the transmembrane HelixB in channelrhodopsin-2.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

ChR2 has emerged as a highly successful tool in the field of optogenetics. However, the lack of control over ion selectivity in either open state can produce undesirable indirect effects for in vivo experiments. To rationally design optogenetic mutants to reduce or remove non-selectivity, a better understanding of the molecular basis for the discrete transition between open states and how ChR2 temporally alters ion selectivity is required. To date, experiments designed to elucidate the unique ion permeation pathway of ChR2 have mainly focused on residues known to be important for homologous retiylidene-containing proteins or through targeting of specific transmembrane domains. Here, our objective was to identify and quantify the role of spatially proximal residues along adjacent TMs that form a barrier to ion permeation. To achieve this objective, we applied steered molecular dynamics (SMD) using a sodium ion to an equilibrated closed-state ChR2 model, based on the fully dark-adapted C1C2 crystal structure, representing the C1 state, to identify residues that comprise a TM barrier. We then generated conservative mutations at identified positions. These mutations were based on inspection of sequence alignments with homologous algal opsin proteins. Photocurrents under extended illumination were measured for WT and mutant constructs. We applied the four-state kinetic model to quantify ChR2 transition parameters from our experimental photocurrent traces (16Nikolic K. Grossman N. Grubb M.S. Burrone J. Toumazou C. Degenaar P.

Computational optogenetics: empirically-derived voltage- and light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 model.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9: e1003220Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, photocurrent traces were analyzed to quantify ion conductance, kinetics, and reversal potentials of each mutant ChR2. Using this approach, we have identified proximal residues that contribute to the two conducting states as well as the kinetics and cation selectivity of ChR2. Channelrhodopsin-2 is part of a distinct subfamily of rhodopsins named channelopsins. These proteins are retinylidene-containing seven-transmembrane proteins. In contrast to most rhodopsins, which function as ion pumps or receptors, channelrhodopsin-2 can function as both an ion channel and an ion pump. The objective of the experiments described here was to identify and functionally test the role of spatially proximal residues in channelrhodopsin-2 ion conductance by combining steered molecular dynamics and functional studies and analyzing these data using kinetic modeling. To minimize the system energetic state before SMD experiments, lipid tail groups were melted during a 500-ps equilibration while keeping water and protein fixed. Next, a second 500-ps equilibration was performed with only the protein fixed. Finally, the entire system was released during a 40-ns equilibration. This time frame has been shown previously to be sufficient for performing SMD simulations (34Cui Y. Bastien D.A. Water transport in human aquaporin-4: molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.Biochem.

Fig. 2 shows the overall structure, RMSD of the protein backbone during the 40-ns equilibration, and Ramachandran plot of the equilibrated ChR2 homology model. Following an initial change (≪ 0.5 ns) in RMSD, only small fluctuations were observed during the 40-ns equilibration. Based on the RMSD of the protein backbone during the initial 40-ns equilibration, it can be concluded that the homology model of ChR2 is stable. Analysis of residue dihedrals demonstrated that they were within the allowable limits after the 40-ns simulation (Fig. 2C). Visual inspection of the equilibrated ChR2 model resulted in the observation of bends in both TM 3 and 5, a result of intrahelical hydrogen bonding between a threonine at position i and the carbonyl backbone at i − 4 (39Ballesteros J.A.

The hydrogen bond on TM 3 was formed between the hydroxyl side chain of Thr-127 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu-123, whereas the hydrogen bond on TM 5 was formed between the hydroxyl group of Thr-188 and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr-184. Hydrogen bond stability was also observed for Ser-63/Asn-258, whereas no hydrogen bonding between Cys-128 and Asp-156 was observed in our equilibrated structure. The presence or absence of hydrogen bonds between these sets of residues is consistent with that found in the C1C2 chimera and other ChR2 homology models (19Kato H.E. Zhang F. Yizhar O.

Following equilibration, SMD was applied to a sodium ion previously fixed above the center of the electronegative cavity of ChR2.

Steered molecular dynamics and mechanical functions of proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Simulations were performed with monomeric ChR2 in the closed state with retinal remaining in the all-trans conformation. The functional translocation pathway of ChR2 has been shown to be located within the ChR2 monomer (19Kato H.E. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Ramakrishnan C. Nishizawa T. Hirata K. Ito J. Aita Y. Tsukazaki T.

Our ability to exhaustively screen for APC mutations identify microsatellite-stable and APC-mutation negative familial CRC patients, enabling us to search for novel genes. We performed genome-wide scan on two affected siblings of one family and 88 ethnicity- and gender-matched healthy controls to identify deletions shared by the siblings. Combined loss of heterozygosity, copy number and allelic-specific copy number analysis uncovered 5 shared deletions. Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed chromosome 19q13 deletion, which was subsequently found in one other family. The 32 kb deleted region harbors the CYP2A7 gene and was enriched with enhancer, repressor and insulator sites. The wildtype allele was lost in the polyps of the proband. Further, real-time RT-PCR assays showed that expressions of MIA and MIA-RAB4B located 35 kb upstream of the deletion, were up-regulated in the polyps compared to the matched mucosa of the proband. MIA-RAB4B, the read-through long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), RAB4B, PIM2 and TAOK1 share common binding site of a microRNA, miR-24, in their 3'UTRs. PIM2 and TAOK1, two target oncogenes of miR-24, were co-ordinately up-regulated with MIA-RAB4B in the polyps, suggesting that MIA-RAB4B could function as competitive endogenous RNA to titrate miR-24 away from its other targets. The data suggest that the 19.13 deletion disrupted chromatin boundary, leading to altered expression of several genes and lncRNA, could contribute to colorectal cancer via novel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms."

As a result of inactivation of the pRB-E2F1-EZH2 pathway, the repressive marker trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 at the 11β-HSD2 promoter is removed, which leads to the robust expression of 11β-HSD2 during syncytialization.

The properties of two-dimensional sheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides such as tungsten diselenide (WSe2) depend on how the layers stack. For example, the more common 2H phase has a two-layer AB repeat and is centrosymmetric, but the rare 3R phase has a three-layer ABC repeat and different electronic properties because it is noncentrosymmetric. Shearer et al. grew WSe2 nanoplates through chemical vapor deposition that had screw dislocations. A triangular dislocation grew noncentrosymmetric layers, a hexagonal dislocation grew centrosymmetric layers, and mixed dislocations grew weakly noncentrosymmetric layers. They explored the changes in properties with stacking, such as strong second-harmonic generation with the noncentrosymmetric material.

The prefrontal cortex of the brain is involved in higher-order cognitive processes, including attention, decision-making, and goal-directed action. At present, we do not know how abstract context is represented in the prefrontal cortex, whether there are subregions, and, if so, how they might be organized. Waskom and Wagner used high-resolution brain scanning while subjects performed tasks that demanded goal-directed behavior. Multivariate signal–decoding techniques and examination of spontaneous activity correlations demonstrated the existence of stable networks of subregions within this brain area. Abstract cognitive representations thus emerge from an intrinsic functional organization in the human prefrontal cortex.

Oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, plays vital roles in childbirth and social bonding. It is also crucial in aiding the correct wiring of certain neuronal circuits in the brain during development, and altered oxytocin signaling has been implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Ripamonti et al. looked deeper and discovered that a surge of maternal oxytocin right before childbirth is required for the priming of excitatory hippocampal neurons, which are typically involved in memory formation and anxiety regulation. In this process, oxytocin regulates dendritic branching, synapse formation, and synaptic transmission, allowing for the synchronicity of the neuronal network. Without this, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals is disrupted, which can lead to neurobehavioral disorders.

He suggests tempering assertions about causal links between microaggressions and adverse mental health and proposes a moratorium on intervention programs that may create more problems than they solve.

This discovery identifies a source of compositional buoyancy that would have driven the convection needed for a magnetic field very far back in Earth's history.
