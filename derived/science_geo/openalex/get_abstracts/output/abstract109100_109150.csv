https://openalex.org/W1494416455,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional polypeptide that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of various cells and has an angiogenic effect in vivo, although it inhibits the growth of cultured endothelial cells. We report here that TGF-beta treatment of quiescent cultures of mouse embryo-derived AKR-2B cells, which are growth-stimulated by TGF-beta, and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which are growth-inhibited by TGF-beta, results in the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein. Maximal VEGF mRNA levels occurred 4-8 h after stimulation with a decline to background levels in 24 h. In contrast, the related placenta growth factor mRNA was not induced by TGF-beta in these cells. No VEGF receptor mRNA was seen in AKR-2B cells. Also, TGF-beta treatment of endothelial cells, which express the FLT1 and KDR/FLK-1 receptors for VEGF, did not cause VEGF induction. Because VEGF is known to be a strong angiogenic factor for endothelial cells, the results suggest that the angiogenic effect of TGF-beta on endothelial cells in blood vessels may be mediated at least partly by a paracrine induction of VEGF in other surrounding cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1573000660,"We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine/threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence shows strong homology to conserved domains of members of the protein kinase C (PKC) subfamily. Homologies reside in the duplex zinc-finger-like cysteine-rich motif and in the protein kinase domain. The lack of the C2 domain of the Ca(2+)-dependent PKCs and the presence of a unique NH2-terminal sequence with a potential signal peptide and a transmembrane domain suggest that PKC mu is a novel member of the subgroup of atypical PKCs. An open reading frame coding for 912 amino acids directs an in vitro translation product with an apparent M(r) of 115,000. In vitro phorbol ester binding studies and kinase assays with lysates of cells overexpressing PKC mu showed phorbol ester-independent kinase activity, autophosphorylation, and, in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, predominant phosphorylation of a 30-kDa protein at serine residues. Southern analysis revealed that PKC mu is a single copy gene located on human chromosome 21. There is constitutive low level expression of the human PKC mu gene in normal tissues with a single transcript of 3.8 kilobases and elevated expression levels in selected tumor cell lines. These data suggest a role of PKC mu in signal transduction pathways related to growth control."
https://openalex.org/W2160146943,"The beta gamma subunits (G beta gamma) of heterotrimeric G proteins modulate the activity of several signal-transducing effector molecules including G protein-coupled receptor kinases. G beta gamma binds to the carboxyl terminus of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and regulates its activity. To investigate the effect of such a G beta gamma-binding domain on heterologous G beta gamma interactions, various receptors that can stimulate phospholipase C and/or type II adenylate cyclase were coexpressed in COS-7 cells with the carboxyl terminus of beta ARK1. Phosphoinositol hydrolysis in response to activation of receptors that stimulate phospholipase C via Gi beta gamma (alpha 2-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors) was markedly inhibited by the coexpressed beta ARK1 polypeptide, whereas that mediated by Gq alpha subunits (alpha 1-adrenergic and M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptors) was unaffected. Increased cellular cAMP levels due to stimulation of receptors and coexpressed adenylate cyclase II displayed marked inhibition in the presence of the beta ARK1 polypeptide. Moreover, inhibition of adenylate cyclase produced by alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation (a Gi alpha-mediated process) was unaffected, indicating that the beta ARK1 polypeptide provides a useful tool for distinguishing between G alpha and G beta gamma pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1505084152,"Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as the newly described 70-kDa (ZAP-70/Syk) and Src-related tyrosine kinases are coupled to a variety of receptors, including the antigen receptors on B- and T-cells and the Fc receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) and IgG (Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RIII/CD16). Various subunits of these receptors contain homologous activation motifs which appear capable of autonomously triggering cell activation. Two forms of this motif are present in the Fc epsilon RI multimeric complex: one in the beta chain and one in the gamma chain. Here we show that each of the two tyrosine kinases known to be involved in Fc epsilon RI signaling is controlled by a distinct motif-containing chain. Lyn associates with the nonactivated beta chain, whereas gamma promotes the activation of Syk. We also show that neither the beta nor the gamma motif alone can account for the full signaling capacity of the entire receptor. We propose that, upon triggering of the tetrameric receptor, Lyn already bound to beta becomes activated and phosphorylates beta and gamma; the phosphorylation of gamma induces the association of Syk with gamma and also the activation of Syk, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C gamma 1. Cooperative recruitment of specific kinases by the various signaling chains found in this family of antigen receptors could represent a way to achieve the full signaling capacity of the multimeric complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1488759788,"The capacities of the alpha subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) to inhibit different isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclases were assessed. Membranes from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding either type I, II, V, or VI adenylyl cyclase were reconstituted with purified G protein subunits. Types V and VI adenylyl cyclase are most sensitive to inhibition by Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, and Gi alpha 3; type I adenylyl cyclase can be inhibited by these three Gi alpha proteins and by G(o) alpha as well. Type II adenylyl cyclase appears to be immune to inhibition by these proteins. Examination of the effects of native and mutant Gi alpha proteins, as well as analysis of competition for binding of Gs alpha to adenylyl cyclases, indicate that at least certain adenylyl cyclases have independent sites for interaction with Gs alpha (site 1, stimulatory) and Gi alpha (site 2, inhibitory). High concentrations of Gi alpha can interact with site 1 on types I and II adenylyl cyclase and activate the enzymes. Types I and II adenylyl cyclase also appear to have independent sites for interaction with G protein beta gamma subunits. The type I enzyme is strongly inhibited, while type II adenylyl cyclase is activated if Gs alpha is also present."
https://openalex.org/W1570362997,"Treatment of cells with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, leads to an insulin-resistant state without modification in the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor toward exogenous substrates. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, okadaic acid induced a similar dose-dependent inhibition of the insulin effect on deoxyglucose uptake, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Simultaneously, in okadaic acid-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the reduced IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation was linked to a decrease in its electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. This phosphorylation appeared to result from the activation of cytosolic kinase(s). Furthermore, using in vitro reconstitution, we show that, compared to IRS 1 immunopurified from untreated cells, the IRS 1 obtained from okadaic acid-treated cells had a reduced capacity to be phosphorylated by insulin receptors and, concomitantly, to bind PI 3-kinase. Taken together these data suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 induced by okadaic acid reduces the ability of the insulin receptor to phosphorylate IRS 1 and to dock one of its interacting molecules, i.e. PI 3-kinase. Finally, the inhibitory effect of okadaic acid on the stimulatory action of insulin on glucose transport suggests that the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS 1 might represent a key regulatory mechanism of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1576261436,"Specific albumin binding to the surface of endothelium initiates its transcytosis across continuous endothelium via noncoated plasmalemmal vesicles. Past work has identified several putative albumin-binding proteins (SPARC, gp60, gp30, and gp18). In this study, we examined the specific role of these proteins in the binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to endothelium. The 60-kDa albumin-binding protein (gp60, now called albondin) was purified from cultured rat microvascular endothelial cells for antibody production. Anti-albondin antibodies (alpha gp60) specifically recognized albondin expressed by rat, bovine, and human endothelial cells (EC). alpha gp60 and unlabeled native BSA inhibited 125I-BSA binding to confluent EC monolayers and to both albondin and SPARC extracts immobilized on filters. Modification of BSA by maleic anhydride treatment (Mal-BSA) or by surface adsorption to colloidal gold particles (A-Au) renders the ligand specific for gp30 and gp18 while eliminating its ability to inhibit 125I-BSA binding to EC and to both albondin and SPARC extracts. Mal-BSA and A-Au interacted with EC via distinct binding sites not recognizing native BSA. EC internalization of 125I-BSA is inhibited by unlabeled BSA and alpha gp60 IgG but not nonimmune IgG, Mal-BSA, or A-Au. Conversely, internalization of modified BSA is inhibited by unlabeled modified BSA but not BSA or alpha gp60 IgG. Specific 125I-BSA transendothelial transport in rat lungs perfused in situ and for EC monolayers in vitro is inhibited (> or = 90%) by unlabeled BSA and alpha gp60 IgG but not nonimmune IgG and Mal-BSA. No specific transport of 125I-Mal-BSA is detected across bovine lung microvascular endothelial cell monolayers, only paracellular and/or fluid-phase transport. Low temperatures reduce BSA transport by 5-fold and Mal-BSA by 2-fold. Interestingly, 3-fold more native BSA is transported than Mal-BSA at 37 degrees C, whereas at 8-10 degrees C they are nearly equal, suggesting facilitation of BSA transport. Cumulatively, it appears that gp30 and gp18 mediate the binding, endocytosis, and degradation of modified albumins, whereas albondin mediates native albumin binding which significantly enhances its transcytosis and capillary permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1589229976,A kinetic study of the reaction of NO with O2 in aqueous solution has been carried out using a colorimetric method based on a pH indicator and a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The reaction is second order in NO concentration and first order in O2 concentration; the overall third order rate constant is 6.3 (+/- 0.4) x 10(6) (M-1)2 s-1. Model calculations for the reaction at estimated physiological concentrations of NO and O2 indicate that the simple autoxidation of NO will not limit its diffusion from the site of production in endothelial cells to a spatially removed target molecule such as guanylate cyclase in myocytes and platelets.
https://openalex.org/W1511107734,"omega-Conotoxin-sensitive N-type calcium channels control neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminal and interact with proteins implicated in secretion. Solubilized omega-conotoxin receptors from rat brain synaptic membrane were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against calcium channel alpha 1 subunits, syntaxin, and a 105-kDa plasma membrane protein. A multimeric complex, composed of calcium channel subunits, and synaptic proteins that showed varying degrees of association, was purified by a procedure involving anti-syntaxin immunoaffinity chromatography. A 250-kDa N-type alpha 1 subunit, containing cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site(s), was identified by photoaffinity labeling with 125I-azidonitrobenzoyl omega-conotoxin and immunoblotting with sequence-directed antibodies. An immunologically related 210-kDa form of the alpha 1 subunit was detected that displayed different pharmacological and regulatory properties. Protein bands of 140, 70, 58, and 35 kDa comigrated with purified alpha 1 subunits upon sucrose gradient centrifugation, whereas the 105-kDa protein was removed. The 58- and 35-kDa bands contained, respectively, the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin and syntaxin, a plasma membrane protein that binds synaptic vesicle proteins. Purified omega-contoxin receptors were quantitatively immunoprecipitated by anti-syntaxin antibodies. These proteins may constitute an isolated exocytotic complex in which the N-type calcium channel tightly interacts with a synaptic vesicle docking site."
https://openalex.org/W1607864895,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) both bind to the same receptor with high affinity and thus mediate an overlapping spectrum of biological activities, the signal transduction mechanisms for which are unclear. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinases are involved in both the LIF and OSM signal transduction pathways. However, we found that OSM is a much more potent inducer of both mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and biological response, both of which correlate with the expression of a second OSM receptor that does not bind LIF. In addition, different patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were stimulated by OSM and LIF. We therefore suggest that the two receptors for OSM can be coupled to different signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W1577601626,"Several of the residues constituting the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) were identified by a combination of kinetic studies with 19 single and multiple HuAChE mutants, fluorescence binding studies with the Trp-286 mutant, and by molecular modeling. Mutants were analyzed with three structurally distinct positively charged PAS ligands, propidium, decamethonium, and di(p-allyl-N-dimethylaminophenyl)pentane-3-one (BW284C51), as well as with selective active center inhibitors, hexamethonium and edrophonium. Single mutations of residues Tyr-72, Tyr-124, Glu-285, Trp-286, and Tyr-341 resulted in up to 10-fold increase in inhibition constants for PAS ligands, whereas for multiple mutants up to 400-fold increase was observed. The 6th PAS element residue Asp-74 is unique in its ability to affect conformation of both the active site and the PAS (Shafferman, A., Velan, B., Ordentlich, A., Kronman, C., Grosfeld, H., Leitner, M., Flashner, Y., Cohen, S., Barak, D., and Ariel, N. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 3561-3568) as demonstrated by the several hundred-fold increase in Ki for D74N inhibition by the bisquaternary ligands decamethonium and BW284C51. Based on these studies, singular molecular models for the various HuAChE inhibitor complexes were defined. Yet, for the decamethonium complex two distinct conformations were generated, accommodating the quaternary ammonium group by interactions with either Trp-286 or with Tyr-341. We propose that the PAS consists of a number of binding sites, close to the entrance of the active site gorge, sharing residues Asp-74 and Trp-286 as a common core. Binding of ligands to these residues may be the key to the allosteric modulation of HuAChE catalytic activity. This functional degeneracy is a result of the ability of the Trp-286 indole moiety to interact either via stacking, aromatic-aromatic, or via pi-cation attractions and the involvement of the carboxylate of Asp-74 in charge-charge or H-bond interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1494248298,"Human cdc25C protein, a specific tyrosine phosphatase that activates the p34cdc2 protein kinase at mitosis, is itself a phosphoprotein that shows increased phosphorylation during the G2-M transition. In vitro, cdc25C protein is substantially phosphorylated by purified p34cdc2-cyclin B protein kinase. Of seven putative phosphorylation sites for p34cdc2 protein kinase present in human cdc25C, five are phosphorylated by p34cdc2 protein kinase in vitro, as assessed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and peptide sequencing. These same sites are also phosphorylated in vivo during the G2-M transition in normal mammalian fibroblasts and have been precisely mapped. The cdc25C phosphorylated in vitro by p34cdc2 protein kinase exhibits a 2-3-fold higher activity than the nonphosphorylated cdc25C, as assayed by activation of inactive cdc2 prokinase. Microinjection of purified cdc25C proteins into living fibroblasts reveals that only the phosphorylated form of cdc25 is highly effective in activating G2 cells into premature prophase in a manner similar to microinjection of purified active p34cdc2 protein kinase. Together these data show that multisite phosphorylation of cdc25C by p34cdc2-cyclin B protein kinase occurs at the G2-M transition and is sufficient to induce the autoamplification of cdc2/M-phase promoting factor necessary to drive somatic mammalian cells into mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1604075427,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1 encodes a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. WT1 is expressed in a dramatic spatial and temporal pattern during kidney development and is thought to be critical during mesenchymal-epithelial conversion. The WT1 protein bound multiple sites in the WT1 promoter and functioned as a powerful transcriptional repressor of its gene in vivo (> 50-fold). The WT1 protein carrying an NH2-terminal 17-amino acid insertion and a 3-amino acid insertion (KTS) between zinc fingers 3 and 4, arising from the most abundant of four alternatively spliced transcripts, was the most powerful repressor. Of importance, a subset of WT1-binding sites differs from the Egr-1 consensus sequence, which has been shown to bind one splice variant of the WT1 protein (WT1(-KTS)). We characterized two of these sites and show that they bind both -KTS and +KTS forms of the WT1 zinc-finger protein and can confer repression on a heterologous promoter construct. Our data demonstrate that WT1, in addition to its known effects on insulin-like growth factor II, platelet-derived growth factor A, and Pax-2 transcription, is a powerful repressor of its own gene. These observations emphasize its critical role as a transcriptional regulatory protein during normal kidney development."
https://openalex.org/W1502453110,"We report the synthesis and testing of a series of caged nitric oxide compounds that are stable indefinitely in oxygen-containing solutions until photolyzed by ultraviolet irradiation, whereupon they release nitric oxide (NO) with quantum yields of delta 8% for 3a (CNO-1) and delta 2% for compounds 3b-e (CNO2-5). After a flash, NO release is complete within 5 ms, so that precise temporal control of NO release is possible. NO donor 3d (CNO-4) includes two carboxylate negative charges at physiological pH, which reduce membrane permeability and enable photolytic generation of NO to be selectively confined to either extracellular or intracellular compartments. Esterification of these carboxyls with acetoxymethyl groups produces 3e (CNO-5), which is membrane-permeant and intracellularly hydrolyzable. Therefore, large populations of intact cells can be conveniently intracellularly loaded with caged NO donor 3d by incubation with 3e (CNO-5). The biological efficacy of these NO donors and their absolute dependence on UV-irradiation was demonstrated by inhibition of thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation. Extracellular hemoglobin blocked the effects of NO generated outside but not inside platelets, verifying the sidedness of the NO donors and the limited spatial range of NO action. These molecules should permit precise spatial, temporal, and concentration control of NO release for investigation of its important biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1507117580,"GLUT4-enriched vesicles from fat and muscle cells contain a major protein of 165 kDa. In the present study we have prepared GLUT4 vesicles from a large number of rat adipocytes, isolated the 165-kDa protein by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and obtained the sequences of four tryptic peptides. Comparison of the sequences with those in protein data banks showed that the 165-kDa protein had not previously been sequenced. An antibody preparation against one of the peptides immunoblotted the 165-kDa protein. By this means it was found that the 165-kDa protein was concentrated in GLUT4 vesicles, and that insulin treatment of rat adipocytes caused a translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane that paralleled the translocation of GLUT4."
https://openalex.org/W1487163547,"The conversion of human proinsulin to insulin occurs only in specialized cells which contain the appropriate processing enzymes. To allow proinsulin processing to occur in a wide variety of cell types, we engineered human proinsulin to be cleaved in the constitutive secretory pathway. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced furin consensus cleavage sequences (Arg-X-Lys-Arg) into the human proinsulin cDNA. These mutations allowed for efficient proteolytic maturation of human proinsulin to insulin within cells containing only a constitutive pathway of secretion. Additionally, a naturally occurring mutation (histidine B10 to aspartic acid) yields a form of human insulin which accumulates 10- to over 100-fold more mature insulin when compared to the mutants lacking this change. Engineering furin-specific cleavage sites into each junction of the human proinsulin cDNA results in the secretion of peptides that display the expected molecular weights for the A and B chains of insulin. The accumulation of mature, processed, human insulin was measured in the supernatants by radioimmunoassay, and the bioactivity of this molecule was measured by its ability to stimulate autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Our results suggest that any cell type might be engineered to produce mature, active, and stable insulin in the constitutive pathway of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1537731514,"The 59-kDa dystrophin-associated protein triplet (59-DAP) is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex which may directly associate with dystrophin. The cDNA encoding one component (59-1 DAP) of the 59-DAP triplet has now been cloned from rabbit skeletal muscle. The deduced amino acid sequence of 59-1 DAP predicts a 505-amino acid polypeptide containing nine potential phosphorylation sites and no predicted transmembrane domains. This is consistent with the 59-1 DAP being a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Affinity-purified antibodies against rabbit 59-1 DAP fusion proteins only recognize the lowest band of the 59-DAP triplet in skeletal muscle sarcolemma and isolated dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The tissue-specific expression of 59-1 DAP mRNA, which is most prominent in skeletal and cardiac muscle and is also detected in brain, parallels that of dystrophin but not of utrophin. Levels of 59-1 DAP mRNA are unaffected in mdx mouse skeletal and cardiac muscles, although all dystrophin-associated proteins, including 59-DAP, are greatly reduced in mdx mouse skeletal muscle. However, in mdx mouse cardiac muscle, the up-regulation of utrophin preserves all dystrophin-associated proteins except 59-DAP. Our results suggest that the 59-DAP triplet may contain different protein species and that the 59-1 DAP may associate more specifically with dystrophin than with utrophin."
https://openalex.org/W1589268957,"The amino-terminal presequences of rat peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase precursors (types A and B) were reported to be cleavable signal peptides for peroxisomal protein translocation. In the present study, this was proven by immunoelectron microscopy of the cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing fusion proteins of the amino-terminal sequences of the thiolase precursor and Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. The fusion proteins were processed into mature forms of the apparently correct sizes. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the charged residues in the B-type presequence (26 amino acid residues) revealed that arginine at position -24 and histidine at position -17 were both indispensable. Even replacement of these residues with other basic amino acids abolished the import activity. Both Arg-24 and His-17 were also required in a longer presequence (36 amino acid residues) of the thiolase A, thereby suggesting that the signal can function in an internal position. When glutamic acid at position -11 was changed to amino acids other than aspartic acid, the signal peptide became apparently effective in both peroxisomal and mitochondrial targeting. All of these data indicate that the thiolase signal peptide is a newly defined type of peroxisomal targeting signal recognized by a mechanism presumably different from that for a known peroxisomal signal, the carboxy-terminal Ser-Lys-Leu-COOH motif."
https://openalex.org/W1579749290,"GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter expression is highly regulated in muscle and adipose tissue during perinatal life. Here we have investigated the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of GLUT4 induction and GLUT1 repression associated to neonatal development. Perinatal hypothyroidism markedly impaired GLUT4 protein induction in heart. This effect was heart specific, and a greater expression of GLUT4 was detected in brown adipose tissue from neonatal hypothyroid rats compared with controls. These changes in GLUT4 protein expression were not detected in brown adipose tissue or heart when hypothyroidism was induced in adult rats. These results indicate that GLUT4 induction during perinatal life is highly sensitive to thyroid hormones in both heart and adipose tissue. Perinatal hypothyroidism was characterized by decreased cardiac GLUT4 mRNA concentrations. T3 injection caused a marked increase in cardiac levels of GLUT4 mRNA in hypothyroid neonates. Thus, in 13-day-old hypothyroid rats, GLUT4 mRNA levels increased 3-fold 1 h after T3 injection. Under these conditions, retinoic acid also caused a rapid increase in cardiac GLUT4 mRNA levels from hypothyroid neonates. In addition, cardiac levels of GLUT4 protein markedly increased in fetuses and in neonates 24 h after T3 injection. These findings suggest that a direct effect of thyroid hormones is the promotion of cardiac GLUT4 gene expression. GLUT1 protein expression was markedly enhanced in brown adipose tissue and heart during neonatal hypothyroidism as well as in hypothyroidism induced in adult rats. This was concomitant to greater levels of GLUT1 mRNA in hearts from hypothyroid neonates. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that cardiomyocytes from hypothyroid pups contained an enhanced level of GLUT1 protein. Furthermore, T3 injection caused a decrease in cardiac levels of GLUT1 mRNA in hypothyroid neonates. These results indicate that thyroid hormone manipulation leads to inverse regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter gene expression in the neonatal heart. We conclude that thyroid hormones play a pivotal role controlling the transition of glucose transporter carriers from fetal to neonatal levels in heart and brown adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1540243713,"The human mucosal lymphocyte-1 (HML-1) antigen is expressed on a subclass of T-lymphocytes known as intra-epithelial lymphocytes which are located between mucosal epithelial cells. The HML-1 complex is known to mediate adhesion of intra-epithelial T-lymphocytes to epithelial cell monolayers in vitro. We and others have shown that the HML-1 antigen is an integrin composed of the beta 7 subunit in association with a novel alpha subunit, alpha E. Here we report the cloning of the alpha E cDNA and its primary amino acid sequence. alpha E contained an inserted or I domain and was more homologous to the other I domain containing integrins than to the cleaved group of integrin alpha subunits. However, alpha E contained a unique extra domain of 55 amino acids located just NH2-terminal to the I domain without counterpart in other integrins. This extra domain contained a stretch of 18 consecutive charged residues and included a proteolytic cleavage site. Thus alpha E is the only I domain containing integrin alpha subunit that is also cleaved, and the cleavage site is distinct from that of members of the cleaved group of integrin alpha subunits. These structural features mark alpha E as an unusual member of the integrin family. High levels of alpha E and beta 7 mRNA were restricted to mucosal lymphocytes supporting the hypothesis that alpha E beta 7 plays a role in the localization or site-specific functions of intra-epithelial T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1923562569,"Colicin A is a bacterial toxin which forms channels in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli. Its translocation through the envelope requires the participation of bacterial proteins encoded by the tolQ, -R, -A, and -B genes. Overproduction of the Tol proteins decreased the time needed for colicin A translocation and increased the number of channels formed in vivo. Cells overproducing radioactively labeled Tol proteins and containing or not colicin A were fractionated. The Tol proteins were mainly recovered in the inner membrane and in the contact sites between the two membranes. The presence of colicin A increased the specific radioactivity of the Tol proteins in the contact sites. Our data suggest that the Tol proteins form a complex of definite stoichiometry in the membranes and that colicin A is associated to this complex upon channel formation. We discuss the possibility that the channel activity determined in vivo is due to the colicin A-Tol proteins complex."
https://openalex.org/W1505868918,"Four cDNA clones homologous with a murine prostaglandin E2 receptor have been isolated from a rabbit kidney cortex cDNA library. These cDNAs encode related proteins that differ only in their COOH-terminal sequences. Southern blot analysis of rabbit genomic DNA indicates that these receptor cDNAs represent alternatively spliced variants derived from a single gene. This was confirmed by isolation and sequence analysis of genomic clones containing common region exons and unique 3'-coding exons, which contained intron/exon boundaries at the predicted splice junctions. Transient expression of a novel full-length cDNA in COS1 cells confirmed the ligand binding profile typical of an EP3 receptor subtype. Ribonuclease protection assays indicate that the gene encoding these receptors is most highly expressed in kidney, adrenal, and stomach with lower but significant expression in uterus, lung, heart, ileum, spleen, and brain. Moreover, each of the cloned isoforms is expressed in the kidney. In situ hybridization analyses of rabbit kidney demonstrated that the level of expression is highest in the outer medulla with lesser expression in the cortex and no detectable expression in the inner medulla. The ligand binding profile and tissue distribution of these receptors is consistent with a functional role for this family of EP3 receptors in mediating the renal actions of prostaglandins as well as the effects of prostaglandins on gastric acid secretion and adrenal function."
https://openalex.org/W1513856339,"The eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) is an essential protein that binds the 5' cap structure with high specificity and affinity. Yeast eIF-4E is homologous to eIF-4E of higher eukaryotes, but interacts with a different set of cap-binding complex proteins. In the present study the distribution of yeast eIF-4E in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be similar to that observed in higher cells, whereby the yeast factor was more concentrated in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of yeast eIF-4E in S. cerevisiae exerted at most a minimal effect on growth in liquid minimal medium and was not found to influence the translation of reporter gene mRNAs bearing secondary structure in their leader regions. In a new method to study mRNA-protein interactions, biotinylated mRNAs were synthesized in vitro for use in studies of the binding of eIF-4E in yeast extracts. Streptavidin was used to adsorb the biotinylated mRNAs plus bound initiation factors. Stem-loop structures in the leader region did not influence the binding of eIF-4E or, in comparative experiments, of eIF-4A. Thus yeast eIF-4E shows both similarities and differences with respect to the distribution and function of its counterparts in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1535997180,"The activation of erk/mitogen-activated protein kinases and p21ras is strongly associated with progression through the cell cycle. Cell growth induced by the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) effectively dissociates the activation of p44erk-1 and p42erk-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases and p21ras from cell proliferation. In two cell lines of T lymphocyte and myeloid origin that were dependent upon IL-4 for continuous growth, IL-4 failed to detectably activate or induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p44erk-1 and p42erk-2. The activation of p21ras was also not detectably affected by IL-4 treatment of these cells. Treatment of the same cells with other growth factors (colony-stimulating factor-1 and Steel factor) or phorbol esters induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p44erk-1 and p42erk-2 and stimulated p21ras activity. The presence of IL-4 neither diminished nor enhanced the activation of p44erk-1 and p42erk-2 by colony-stimulating factor-1, Steel factor, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Furthermore, IL-4 also failed to activate p44erk-1, p42erk-2, and p21ras in normal T lymphocytes and mast cells derived from spleen and bone marrow, respectively. Significantly, these findings demonstrate that IL-4-induced cell growth may be dissociated from the activation of p44erk-1, p42erk-2, and p21ras, suggesting that their activation may not be an absolute requirement for growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1526767578,"Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a dominant role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis by storing and releasing Ca2+. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Stains All staining reveals that at least six Ca(2+)-binding proteins are contained in cardiac SR vesicles, five of which have now been identified. These five SR proteins comprise a set of high capacity Ca(2+)-binding proteins, localized to the SR lumen, that exhibit properties expected for physiological Ca2+ stores. In this study, we have purified and isolated cDNA clones for the sixth major Stains All blue-staining protein of dog cardiac SR and identified it as GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein, M(r) = 94,000). Previously, this prominent Ca(2+)-binding component has only been described in non-muscle endoplasmic reticulum. Cardiac GRP94 co-sedimented with cardiac SR vesicles and all previously described SR markers and was completely contained within the SR lumen. GRP94, like several other SR Ca(2+)-binding proteins, was a substrate for casein kinase II and was phosphorylated at two or more sites located near the two ends of the molecule. A low level of endogenous casein kinase II activity was found in crude preparations of cardiac SR but did not co-purify with SR vesicles after calcium oxalate loading, suggesting that casein kinase II phosphorylation in vivo occurs at a site other than the SR."
https://openalex.org/W1585046846,"Abstract The cytokine-mediated stimulation of sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism is emerging as an important signal transduction pathway via the generation of ceramide and sphingosine, products which have been shown to affect a wide variety of biological processes. Because SM-mediated signal transduction is initiated via the hydrolysis of an integral membrane phospholipid by a phospholipase C-like enzyme (sphingomyelinase) to yield lipids which modulate protein kinase C activity, the SM and phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling pathways share certain similarities. The present study was undertaken to examine the potential for interplay between SM and PI turnover by testing the effects of sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide on PI turnover. In dermal fibroblasts, sphingosine stimulated a rapid dose-dependent hydrolysis of PI, yielding inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, followed by increased levels of intracellular calcium. Sphingosine-induced inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation was observed between 5 and 30 microM sphingosine with a maximal accumulation of 2.7-fold over control levels. Enhanced IP formation was measured as early as 5 s following sphingosine treatment and IP levels remained elevated for more than 60 min. Intracellular calcium mobilization accompanied the dose-dependent accumulation of IPs in response to sphingosine, although this effect was not apparent until after a 30-40-s lag period. Interestingly, sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulated a more rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ than sphingosine, but it had no effect on PI turnover. DL-threo-Dihydrosphingosine, a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, stimulates both PI turnover and Ca2+ flux, but does not block the action of sphingosine relative to those two processes. Ceramide (added as C2-ceramide), N-stearylamine, and stearoyl-D-sphingosine did not affect PI turnover or Ca2+ mobilization. Pretreatment of intact cells with pertussis toxin partially inhibited sphingosine-mediated IP accumulation, suggesting a role for guanine nucleotide binding protein(s) (G protein) in sphingosine-stimulated PI turnover. Furthermore, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) stimulated, whereas guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) inhibited, sphingosine-induced IP accumulation in permeabilized cells. Collectively, these data suggest that sphingosine enhances PI turnover by stimulating phospholipase C activity, and the activation of this process may be modulated by G protein interactions. Thus, the regulation of PI turnover and Ca2+ mobilization by sphingosine may represent another mechanism by which sphingosine modulates cell function and that these effects can be distinguished from those of ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1567542319,"Mammalian small intestine secretes a truncated apolipoprotein B (apoB48) species as a result of tissue-specific post-transcriptional RNA editing. The human liver, by contrast, contains only unedited apoB mRNA and secretes only apoB100. We have recently isolated a cDNA clone from rat small intestine which encodes an apoB mRNA editing protein, REPR (Teng, B., Burant, C.F., and Davidson, N.O. (1993) Science 260, 1816-1819). The current study demonstrates that homogenates of Xenopus oocytes expressing REPR confer editing ability upon S100 extracts prepared from human liver when tested on a synthetic apoB RNA template in vitro. Transfection of REPR into HepG2 cells resulted in editing of endogenous apoB mRNA and the appearance of an apoB48-like protein in the media. Extracts prepared from these transfected cells edit mammalian apoB RNA templates when incubated alone and with enhanced efficiency in the presence of chicken intestinal S100 extracts. The results suggest that human liver expresses factor(s) which are critical to apoB mRNA editing and which allow functional complementation of REPR in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1525077571,"Exocytosis is an important example of cell activation. Ca2+ and calcium-binding proteins are considered to modulate signal transduction in exocytosis. We examined the role of calcyclin, calcium-binding protein, in the stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic beta cells. The presence of calcyclin in these cells was demonstrated immunologically. We permeabilized rat pancreatic islets with streptolysin-O and examined the effects of calcyclin on insulin release. The Ca(2+)-stimulated insulin release was enhanced by calcyclin, in a dose-dependent manner, whereas this calcium-binding protein had no effect on insulin release from islets in low Ca2+ buffer or from the islets not subjected to the streptolysin-O treatment. Calgizzarin, another member of the S-100 protein family, had no apparent effect on the Ca(2+)-stimulated secretion under parallel conditions. An anticalcyclin antibody suppressed the increase in insulin release induced by calcyclin. We propose that calcyclin may be involved in signal transduction of the Ca(2+)-induced release of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1676334148,"In mature vertebrate muscle, the chloride channel Clc-1 is necessary for the stabilization of the resting potential. Its functional defect leads to the disease myotonia. The ADR mouse (phenotype ADR, genotype adr/adr) is an animal model for human myotonias. The adr gene is a member of a family of non-complementing recessive autosomal mutations (alleles of adr) that cause myotonia in the mouse. The standard allele adr has arisen by the insertion of a retroposon into the chloride channel gene Clc-1 (Steinmeyer, K., Klocke, R., Ortland, C., Gronemeier, M., Jockusch, H., Grunder, S., and Jentsch, T. J. (1991) Nature 354, 304-308). In order to study the nature of two other alleles, adrmto and adrK, we have analyzed overlapping Clc-1 cDNA amplification products by the hydroxylamine and osmium tetroxide modification technique and direct sequencing. A comparison between ADR*MTO and C57BL/6 wild type showed six base pair substitutions, one of which resulted in a stop codon in position 47, whereas the five others are either silent or lead to amino acid substitutions in non-conserved regions of the Clc-1 sequence and were already present in the wild type inbred SWR/J strain from which adrmto was derived. The detection of the stop codon in the adrmto allele is further indication of the identity of the Clc-1 chloride channel with the adr myotonia gene in the mouse, because a chain termination close to the N terminus would necessarily destroy gene function. For the ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation adrK, an Ile-->Thr exchange in codon 553 was identified. As this affects a conserved residue within a highly conserved region of the Clc-1 gene, a functional significance of this residue is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1537233497,"Recombinant human factor VIII (fVIII) was activated by thrombin at pH 7.4, followed by CM-Sepharose chromatography at pH values ranging from 3.5 to 7.4. Optimal coagulant activity was recovered at pH 5.5 and was associated with the isolation of an A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 heterotrimer. The activity was stable at -80 degrees C, but decayed slowly (t1/2 approximately 1 week) and nonproteolytically at room temperature or 4 degrees C. The coagulant activity of the pH 5.5 fVIIIa preparation assayed in human hemophilia A plasma was only 20% that of porcine factor VIIIa. However, its activity was approximately 75% that of porcine fVIIIa in a plasma-free assay, indicating that human fVIIIa is unstable relative to porcine fVIIIa during the coagulation assay. The first-order rate constant for spontaneous, nonproteolytic loss of activity of human fVIIIa at pH 7.4 was decreased 8-fold by fIXa and phospholipid, indicating that human fVIIIa is stabilized when incorporated into the intrinsic pathway factor X activation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1578094132,"Mouse vas deferens protein (MVDP), a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, is exclusively produced in the epithelial cells of the deferent duct under androgenic regulation. To better understand androgenregulated MVDP gene expression, the location and sequences of androgen response elements (AREs) in the 5'-flanking DNA were determined. Sequence analysis revealed two putative AREs as follows: one between positions -1186 and -1171 (distal ARE) and the other between -111 and -97 (proximal ARE). To study hormonal regulation, fragments of the MVDP promoter region, extending from residue -1804 to +41, were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and cotransfected with a human androgen receptor expression vector into T47D cells in a transient expression assay. A minimal region (-121 to +41) was identified as being sufficient for androgen-regulated gene expression. A mutation in proximal ARE almost completely abolished androgen induction of CAT. One copy of the sequence TGAAGT tcc TGTTCT, cloned in the opposite orientation in front of the thymidine kinase promoter, confers androgen responsiveness to the CAT reporter gene. Androgen transcriptional activity was not detected with the distal ARE. The data provide strong evidence that transcriptional regulation of the MVDP gene occurs via the sequence TGAAGT tcc TGTTCT."
https://openalex.org/W1481073518,"Abstract A composite element that interacts with multiple nuclear receptors has been identified in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). This element, designated nuclear receptor-responsive element (NRRE), spans the -356 to -320 LTR region and contains tightly clustered binding sites for the retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha) and for five nuclear receptors with unknown ligands, apolipoprotein AI regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1), v-erbA-related proteins-2 and -3 (EAR-2 and EAR-3), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), and nerve growth factor-inducible protein-B (NGFI-B). The NRRE also interacts with heterodimers formed between RXR alpha and either ARP-1, EAR-2, EAR-3, the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR alpha), or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Remarkably, nuclear receptor binding is conserved in the LTRs of recently evolved HIV-1 strains but it is absent in the oldest and most divergent viral isolates, raising the intriguing possibility that the NRRE has been evolved recently in the viral genome. Cotransfection experiments in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells have shown that the HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription is activated by RXR alpha and RAR alpha in the presence of 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoic acid, by PPAR and RXR alpha in the presence of clofibric acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and by the orphan receptors HNF-4 and NGFI-B. These findings suggest that a complex network of nuclear receptor signaling pathways, that include 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoic acid, fatty acids, peroxisome proliferators, growth factors, membrane depolarization, and possibly other signals, converge onto the HIV-1 NRRE and may participate in modulation of viral gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1562190035,"We have shown recently that Doxorubicin (Dox, Adriamycin), a potent broad spectrum chemotherapeutic agent with a major side effect of cardiomyopathy, completely prevents myoblast fusion and accumulation of muscle-specific transcripts in the mouse C2 skeletal muscle cell line. Here we use mouse embryonic fibroblast 10T1/2 cells to demonstrate that Dox represses muscle-specific gene expression by interfering with MyoD activity. As assayed by transient cotransfection, Dox inhibits the ability of MyoD to trans-activate muscle-specific reporter genes. A stable cell system was developed in which MyoD is constitutively expressed in 10T1/2 cells (M10 cells). Dox-treated M10 cells express MyoD from a long terminal repeat-driven vector but fail to activate endogenous MyoD and myogenin loci. Dox did not effect E2A gene transcript levels, but Id mRNA levels are significantly increased in Dox-treated M10 cells. Interestingly, overexpression of E2-5, which forms inactive heterodimers with Id, can overcome the Dox-induced suppression of the trans-activation function of MyoD in 10T1/2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 5'-flanking region of the Id2 gene mediates its Dox-inducible transcriptional expression. These findings support a model in which Dox inhibits muscle-specific gene expression by interfering with the function of MyoD protein through, at least in part, induction of Id gene expression. The implications of our results for the molecular mechanisms underlying the myofibrillar loss observed in Dox-induced cardiomyopathy are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1487197384,"Neoplastic transformation may be associated with the development of paraneoplastic syndromes that complicate the management of patients with malignant disease. One of these syndromes, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, has been shown to be attributable to increased secretion of a parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). The gene encoding PTHrP is expressed at low levels in a growth factor-dependent manner in normal tissues, and the mechanisms underlying selective tumor-associated induction of PTHrP gene expression remain unclear. Here we show that cellular transformation by the EJ-Ha-ras and v-src oncogenes is associated with a marked increase in PTHrP gene expression. Ha-ras- and v-src-transfected NRK 49F cells and ras-transfected RCB 2.2 cell lines secreted increased amounts of immunoreactive PTHrP. Northern blot analysis also demonstrated increased levels of PTHrP mRNA transcripts in oncogene-transfected stable cell lines. No significant change in the half-life of PTHrP mRNA transcripts was detected in Ha-ras- and v-src-transformed cells. In contrast, nuclear run-on assays demonstrated an increased rate of PTHrP gene transcription in oncogene-transformed cells. These observations demonstrate that the gene encoding PTHrP is a downstream target for ras and src, potentially providing a molecular basis for understanding the activation of PTHrP gene expression in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia."
https://openalex.org/W1549733491,"In the present study, a new polyclonal antibody (TxAb) was raised against native thromboxane A2 (TXA2)/prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) receptor protein. Previously developed anti-peptide antibodies (P1Ab, P2Ab) and TxAb were then used to prepare immunoaffinity columns to purify TXA2/PGH2 receptors from platelets, brain, and aorta. In platelets, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the purification of a 55-kDa protein by each affinity column. Identification of this protein as the TXA2/PGH2 receptor was based on: 1) an identical electrophoretic mobility to authentic receptor; 2) immunoblotting of TxAb against P1Ab and P2Ab-purified protein; 3) immunoblotting of P1Ab/P2Ab against TxAb-purified protein; and 4) specific [3H]SQ29,548 binding to TxAb-purified protein. P1Ab/TxAb purification of receptors from brain revealed a major protein band at 55 kDa. Furthermore, the eluates from ligand affinity chromatography confirmed the presence of this 55-kDa protein in brain (which was immunoblotted with TxAb), and contained specific [3H]SQ29,548 binding. In addition to the 55-kDa protein, P1Ab/TxAb also purified a minor protein in brain at 52 kDa, which when concentrated, cross-blotted with TxAb and P1Ab. This finding indicates sequence homology between the 55- and 52-kDa proteins. Independent identification of brain TXA2/PGH2 receptors was provided by P2Ab/TxAb immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated specific labeling of discrete myelin-containing fiber tracts. P2Ab/TxAb purification of TXA2/PGH2 receptors from aorta also revealed a major protein band at 55 kDa and a minor band at 52 kDa. These results represent the first purification of TXA2/PGH2 receptors from either brain or aorta."
https://openalex.org/W1532859113,"Interaction of erythropoietin (EPO) and its membrane receptor induces the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors. The molecular mechanism of the EPO receptor-mediated signal transduction remains unclear because the cloned EPO receptor does not contain any enzyme-related or nucleotide-binding consensus sequences in its cytoplasmic domain. We have previously shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces dimerization of a chimeric receptor carrying the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor, resulting in producing proliferation signals in interleukin-3-dependent cells. Here we show that this chimeric receptor transmits an EGF-dependent erythroid differentiation signal in the EPO-responsive erythroleukemia cell line, TSA8. EGF as well as EPO had little effect on the proliferation of TSA8 cells expressing the chimeric receptor, but both of them induced globin synthesis in these cells. Moreover, a truncated chimeric receptor carrying the membrane proximal 127 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor linked to the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor conferred EGF-dependent proliferation on Ba/F3 cells and globin induction on TSA8 cells. These findings indicate that the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor is sufficient to produce both proliferation and differentiation signals if it is properly activated by receptor dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W1518056484,"Coupling of leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis at replication forks formed at Escherichia coli oriC has been studied in vitro using a replication system reconstituted with purified proteins. At low concentrations of primase (8 nM), the major replication products were multigenome-length molecules, generated by a rolling circle-type mechanism, and unit-length molecules. Rolling circle DNA replication was inhibited at high concentrations of primase (80 nM) and the major replication products were half-unit-length leading strands and a distinct population of short Okazaki fragments. At low primase concentrations, an asymmetric mode of DNA synthesis occurred. Each strand was made independently and initiation could occur outside of oriC. At high primase concentrations, initiation occurred exclusively at oriC and two coupled replication forks proceeded bidirectionally around the plasmid. Presumably, at low concentrations of primase, DnaB (the replication fork helicase) unwound the plasmid DNA before replication forks could form, leading to initiation at sites other than oriC. On the other hand, high concentrations of primase resulted in successful capture of the helicase leading to the formation at oriC of coupled replication forks capable of coordinated leading- and lagging-strand synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1482325680,"The nucleotide sequence was determined for the gene of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of a patient of type II hereditary methemoglobinemia found in Yokohama, Japan. An in-frame deletion of 3 base pairs corresponding to codon 298 (TTC) was identified in the patient. The patient was homozygous for the mutation as shown by hybridization experiments using allele-specific oligonucleotides. The mutation causes deletion of Phe-298, which is the third to the COOH-terminal residue, indicating that in this mutant enzyme the sequence of this region has changed from -Cys-Phe-Val-Phe-COOH to -Cys-Val-Phe-COOH. The mutant enzyme, whose Phe-298 was deleted (F298 delta), was prepared by means of a bacterial expression system and site-directed mutagenesis. The kcat/Km value (NADH) of the enzyme was 5.7 s-1 M-1, which corresponds to 0.4% of that of the wild type. Moreover, the enzyme was much less thermostable than the wild type. To examine further the role of the COOH-terminal portion of the enzyme, various mutant enzymes were also prepared and characterized. The enzymatic properties of F298L, F300L, and F298L/F300L were essentially the same as that of the wild type. The kinetic properties of F298A, and F300A were not greatly affected, but the stability of the enzymes was somewhat impaired. Since Val-299 is naturally Ala in steer enzyme, no specific residues in the carboxyl-terminal region (298-300) are essential to the enzyme function. The instability of the F298/F300A double mutant indicates that the hydrophobicity of the carboxyl-terminal region of the enzyme might be important to maintain the conformation of the enzyme. high impairment of the activity of the F298 delta, F298stop, and F300stop mutants might be caused by the loss of the residue(s) in the carboxyl-terminal portion. These results indicate that the hydrophobicity, but not the specific amino acid residues, of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the enzyme is important for the stability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1603278060,"Three isoenzyme forms (designated A, B, and C) of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase were purified from Datura innoxia suspension cultures. Isoenzyme A is the most abundant form, comprising 45-60% of the total activity. Isoenzymes C and B comprise 35-40% and 10-20% of the activity, respectively. The specific activities of the purified isoenzymes are similar (870-893 mumol of cysteine/min/mg of protein). Molecular masses for isoenzymes A, B, and C, estimated by analytical size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, are 63, 86, and 63 kDa, respectively. Isoenzymes A and B are homodimers; isoenzyme C is a heterodimer. Spectral analysis indicates that these isoenzymes possess a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor that binds the O-acetylserine substrate. Binding is reversible by addition of the sulfide substrate. The O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase isoenzymes are active over a broad temperature range, with maximum activity between 42 and 58 degrees C. They are active only between pH 7 and 8, with optimal activity at pH 7.6. Kinetic analysis indicates these enzymes are allosterically regulated and exhibit positive cooperativity with respect to both substrates. They are inhibited by sulfide concentrations above 200 microM. The kinetic analysis together with the physical and spectrophotometric characteristics indicate that the O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase enzymes have two active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1491036241,"The product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene is a 105-kDa protein that has properties of a cell cycle regulatory factor. Previous reports indicated that two distinct DNA-binding factors, RBF-1 and ATF, play an important part in the transcription of the human retinoblastoma gene (Rb). Recently, we demonstrated that pRb activates expression of the human transforming growth factor-beta 2 gene through ATF-2. Since the human Rb gene promoter also contains an ATF-2-like binding site, we examined whether pRb can regulate its own expression through ATF-2. Here we report that overexpression of Rb stimulates Rb promoter activity through the ATF binding site in a variety of different cell types. Mutation of the ATF binding site of the Rb promoter abolishes the Rb autoinduction. We have also determined that the carboxyl-terminal domain of pRb is responsible for the Rb autoinduction through ATF-2. Rb autoinduction may be important for maintaining the action of pRb during cell growth, and loss of autoinductibility may contribute to retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1602545522,"The recombinant 60-kDa fragment of rat hsc70 has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein is not capable of disassembling clathrin from coated vesicles. However, the affinity for peptides and the peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of the intact protein are retained in the 60-kDa fragment. The dissociation constants of peptide P3a (the recognition sequence of clathrin light chain LCa by hsc70) and S peptide of ribonuclease for 60-kDa protein are 13 and 7 microM, respectively. The maximal velocities of stimulated ATPase activity by peptides P3a and GT4 are 0.25 and 0.31 nmol/h/microgram of protein, respectively, and the EC50 values (the concentration of peptides that brought about half-maximum hydrolysis) for peptides P3a and GT4 are 0.56 and 0.30 mM, respectively. These results indicate that peptide-stimulated ATPase activity of hsc70 is not sufficient for clathrin uncoating. We suggest that other activities or cellular components as yet unidentified associated with the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment of hsc70 are required for clathrin uncoating."
https://openalex.org/W1517927081,"ERGIC-53 (former designation, p53) is a 53-kDa nonglycosylated, dimeric, and hexameric type I membrane protein that has been established as a marker protein for a tubulovesicular intermediate compartment in which protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is blocked at 15 degrees C. Although ERGIC-53 is not a resident protein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum its cDNA sequence carries a double lysine endoplasmic reticulum retention motif at the cytoplasmically exposed COOH terminus. Here we report that overexpression of ERGIC-53 in COS cells saturates its intracellular retention system leading to the appearance of ERGIC-53 at the cell surface. Cell surface ERGIC-53 is efficiently endocytosed by a mechanism that is disturbed when the two critical lysines of the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif are replaced by serines. The results suggest a mechanistic similarity of pre-Golgi retention by the double lysine motif and lysine-based endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1593185015,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was obtained from rat postheparin plasma by chromatographies on heparin-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite. The enzyme was associated with fatty acid ethyl ester synthase (FAEE synthase) as judged by their co-elution profiles and identical profiles of inhibition by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Only one polypeptide of molecular weight 57,000 in purified LPL fraction was labeled by affinity labeling with [3H]-diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The FAEE synthase activity of LPL was not affected by addition of apolipoprotein C-II. Digestion of the enzyme with trypsin resulted in almost complete loss of the triolein-hydrolyzing activity without change in FAEE synthase activity. The tributyrin-hydrolyzing activity of LPL was also not affected by addition of apolipoprotein C-II or trypsin digestion. On addition at progressively higher concentrations, bovine serum albumin increased FAEE synthesis to a maximum at 2 mg/ml and at higher concentrations inhibited its activity. On incubation of purified LPL with chylomicrons in an ethanol/water mixture, FAEE was formed in the presence of a high concentration of bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of FAEE synthesis from chylomicrons was about 65 times that from oleic acid. Triolein/gum arabic emulsion was used for identification of reaction products. We propose the following mechanism of FAEE formation from chylomicrons by LPL. The enzyme attacks chylomicrons forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate, and during the deacylation process, ethanol binds to fatty acids as an acceptor. These results suggest that LPL contributes to nonoxidative ethanol metabolism (FAEE formation) through degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as chylomicrons."
https://openalex.org/W1915985314,"Two sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) have been previously identified in platelets: the 100-kDa SERCA2b and the 97-kDa SERCA3 isoforms. Analysis of the acylphosphate intermediate (E-P) formation and the immunoreactivity of the platelet Ca(2+)-ATPases and their proteolytic fragments upon controlled trypsinolysis revealed the presence of an additional 97-kDa Ca(2+)-ATPase that comigrates with SERCA3 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. At a trypsin/membrane protein ratio of 0.025 at 4 degrees C, tryptic fragments of 73-, 68- and 40-kDa, previously unknown in the SERCA family, could be detected by using the PL/IM 430 anti-Ca(2+)-ATPase antibody that had been shown to recognize a 97-kDa Ca(2+)-ATPase. The 73- and 68-kDa fragments were precursors of the 40-kDa one. Ca(2+)-dependent phospholabeling of the 73-kDa fragment and immunostaining of all these proteolytic products by another antibody raised against SERCA1 established the SERCA nature of the 97-kDa parent enzyme. The SERCA3-related E-P-forming 80-kDa tryptic fragment appeared during trypsinolysis with a different time course from that of the 73-, 68-, and 40-kDa ones. At a trypsin/membrane protein ratio of 0.125 at 37 degrees C, it reached its maximum level at 5 min of digestion, while the 73-, 68-, and 40-kDa fragments were fully degraded at 2 min of trypsinization. This 80-kDa species was immunostained neither with the PL/IM 430, nor with the anti-SERCA1 antibodies. Similar results were found in some megakaryoblastoid and lymphoblastoid cell lines. All these data indicate the presence of two distinct tryptic fragmentation patterns attributed to two 97-kDa SERCA isoforms and point to the existence of a multi-SERCA system in different human non-muscle cells."

After DEAE chromatography, total activity increased 12.9-fold, due to the removal of endogenous inhibitors. The inhibitors were isolated and identified as phosphatidic acid and fatty acid. The final preparation showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with an M(r) of 60,000. Gel filtration through Sephacryl S-200 gave a similar value, suggesting that the enzyme exists as a monomer. Activity was highest at pH 6.0 and was not affected by Ca2+, Mg2+, and EDTA. The enzyme produced glycerophosphocholine (GPC), palmitic acid, and dipalmitoyl-GPC on incubation with 1-palmitoyl-GPC, indicating that the enzyme catalyzed both deacylation and transacylation. The relative rates of deacylation and transacylation were 1:0.3 under standard assay conditions. Km for 1-palmitoyl-GPC and Vmax of hydrolase activity were 91 microM and 12.9 mumol/min/mg, respectively. The enzyme was selective for choline lysophospholipid. Ethanolamine, inositol, and serine lysophospholipids were not good substrates of the enzyme. Phosphatidic acid was a potent, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with Ki of about 10 microM as determined with 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl glycerophosphate. Although less potent, lysophosphatidic acid, palmitoyl-L-carnitine, and fatty acid were also inhibitory to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2102052981,"The triosephosphate dehydrogenase 3 gene (TDH3) is a glycolytic enzyme gene and is abundantly transcribed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The promoter region of the TDH3 gene is known to exhibit high transcriptional activity regardless of the fermentability of the carbon source and has been widely utilized to synthesize heterologous gene products in S. cerevisiae. To clarify the mechanism of constitutive transcription by the promoter, we constructed mutant promoters and analyzed the in vivo transcriptional activity of these promoters. The majority of the transcriptional potential is contained within a DNA fragment extending from nucleotides -524 to -255 (-524/-255; relative to the translation initiation codon), which consists of three cis-acting elements: a fermentable carbon source-dependent upstream activation sequence (UAS) 1 (-524/-426), a fermentable carbon source-dependent upstream repression sequence (URS) (-426/-393), and a nonfermetable carbon source-dependent UAS2 (-305/-255). This result indicates that the promoter involves two apparent promoter elements. One is fermentable carbon source-dependent, and another is nonfermentable carbon source-dependent. Southwestern analyses indicated that a novel 20-kDa protein is induced in yeast cells by shifting from a fermentable to nonfermentable carbon source. The protein interacts with two UAS1 13-base pair elements and one URS 13-base pair element, one of which had been previously designated GPE (general regulatory factor 1 (GRF1) binding site potentiator element) (Bitter, G. A., Chang, K. K. H., and Egan, K. M. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 231, 22-32). We therefore termed the 20-kDa protein GPEB (GRF1-binding site potentiator element-binding protein). In addition, mutational analyses strongly suggested that UAS1, URS, and UAS2 interact with GRF1 and GPEB, GPEB, and the GCR1 (glycolysis regulation 1) gene product, respectively. We therefore concluded that constitutive transcription by the TDH3 promoter is sustained by two promoter elements and that the switch between them might be controlled by the nonfermentable carbon source-inducible GPEB."

In addition, the expression of Capl correlates with the induction of the metastatic phenotype in tumor cell lines and the transformation of normal cells by activated oncogenes or chemical carcinogens. Although not previously associated with the nervous system, in this study, Capl was purified from bovine neural retina by a combination of phenyl-Sepharose and organomercurial chromatography. The complete amino acid sequence of bovine Capl was established primarily by Edman degradation of peptides generated by cleavage of methionyl, lysyl, glutamyl, and aspartyl bonds. NH2-terminal methionyl and aspartyl peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, which provided the sequence of the first 8 residues and identified the NH2-terminal blocking group as an acetyl moiety. The molecular mass of the intact protein determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (M(r) = 11,716.75 +/- 0.42) and the calculated molecular mass deduced from the amino acid composition (M(r) = 11,718) were in agreement, thus supporting the accuracy of the sequence assignment. Capl isolated from the retina was shown to be indistinguishable by mass and immunochemical properties from its counterpart in the bovine aorta, which previously was the only source of purified Capl. Northern analysis using cloned Capl cDNA revealed that Capl mRNA is present not only in the retina but the choroid as well. Further support for choroidal localization came from immunohistochemical experiments using specific anti-Capl antibodies. The physiological significance of Capl in ocular tissues and the aorta is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608581963,"Adseverin is a Ca(2+)-dependent actin filament-severing protein that is presumed to have a regulatory function in exocytosis by affecting the organization of the microfilament network underneath the plasma membrane. As the first step to investigate whether adseverin has the expected function in vivo, we have cloned a cDNA for bovine adseverin. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the following points. 1) Adseverin consisted of 715 amino acid residues, and its predicted molecular mass was 80.5 kDa. 2) Adseverin belonged to the gelsolin family of proteins, which consists of six homologous segments. 3) Adseverin had two putative polyphosphoinositide binding sequences, very similar to but distinct from those in gelsolin. Adseverin was produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The adseverin reacted with adseverin-specific antibody and showed Ca(2+)-dependent actin filament severing activity like authentic adseverin. In situ hybridization demonstrated that adseverin mRNA was differentially expressed in the bovine adrenal gland; it was expressed in the adrenal medulla but not in most parts of the adrenal cortex, although both have a secretory function. The observation strongly suggested that adseverin is not involved in secretory processes in general but is specifically involved in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1494719693,"The effect of purified, bacterially expressed human RasH proteins on embryonic cell cycle progression in activated Xenopus egg extracts was studied. Bacterially expressed human oncogenic RasH protein is able to block the progression of the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle into M-phase. In contrast, the corresponding normal human Ras protein is relatively ineffective when assayed in a like manner. The observed arresting activity can be blocked by the addition of Y13-259 anti-Ras monoclonal antibody but not by nonspecific IgG. Oncogenic Ras also induces unique morphological changes in the reconstituted nuclei; the nuclei appear to be enlarged, and the chromatin partially condenses into fiber-like structures. This induced arrest is associated with suppression of p34cdc2 kinase activity, indicating that the oncogenic Ras protein induces the arrest by inactivating p34cdc2. This inactivation by oncogenic Ras protein does not result from inhibition of the synthesis of cyclin B or of the binding of the newly synthesized cyclin B to the p34cdc2."
https://openalex.org/W1596943474,"Four cell surface-exposed, integral membrane proteins from H4-II-E-3 hepatoma monolayer cultures, derivatized by the membrane-impermeant reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotin-amido)ethyl-1,3-dithioproprionate, were resistant to extraction with Triton X-100 at 0 degrees C. Thirty-three other similarly derivatized proteins were solubilized under these same conditions. Antisera were prepared that reacted only with Triton X-100-insoluble proteins. All four Triton X-100-insoluble proteins precipitated with the antibody were slowly degraded (t1/2 > 100 h). By contrast, all but four Triton X-100-soluble proteins were rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 24 h). The detergent-insoluble proteins did not possess glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors nor were they solubilized by Triton X-100 after disruption of the cytoskeleton. In addition, they were insoluble in Triton X-100 in isolated membrane preparations but soluble when isolated on streptavidin-agarose and removed from other membrane proteins. We conclude that protein-protein interactions within the membrane itself result in insolubility in non-ionic detergents for a small cohort of plasma membrane proteins and that this may be directly related to the increased metabolic stability for this class of proteins."
