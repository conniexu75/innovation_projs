https://openalex.org/W2303309927,"Metastasis frequently develops years after the removal of a primary tumor, from a minority of disseminated cancer cells that survived as latent entities through unknown mechanisms. We isolated latency competent cancer (LCC) cells from early stage human lung and breast carcinoma cell lines and defined the mechanisms that suppress outgrowth, support long-term survival, and maintain tumor-initiating potential in these cells during the latent metastasis stage. LCC cells show stem-cell-like characteristics and express SOX2 and SOX9 transcription factors, which are essential for their survival in host organs under immune surveillance and for metastatic outgrowth under permissive conditions. Through expression of the WNT inhibitor DKK1, LCC cells self-impose a slow-cycling state with broad downregulation of ULBP ligands for NK cells and evasion of NK-cell-mediated clearance. By expressing a Sox-dependent stem-like state and actively silencing WNT signaling, LCC cells can enter quiescence and evade innate immunity to remain latent for extended periods."
https://openalex.org/W2307567449,"The major and essential objective of pre-implantation development is to establish embryonic and extra-embryonic cell fates. To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation."

By identifying the precise positions of ribosomes, footprinting experiments have unveiled key insights into the composition and regulation of the expressed proteome, including delineating potentially functional micropeptides, revealing pervasive translation on cytosolic RNAs, and identifying differences in elongation rates driven by codon usage or other factors. This Primer looks at important experimental and analytical concerns for executing ribosome profiling experiments and surveys recent examples where the approach was developed to explore protein biogenesis and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2306843701,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes. Ubiquitination requires the sequential action of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin ligases). This SnapShot highlights the main types of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which can be classified in three families depending on the presence of characteristic domains and on the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate protein."
https://openalex.org/W2307899896,"In an attempt to chart parallel sensory streams passing through the visual thalamus, we acquired a 100-trillion-voxel electron microscopy (EM) dataset and identified cohorts of retinal ganglion cell axons (RGCs) that innervated each of a diverse group of postsynaptic thalamocortical neurons (TCs). Tracing branches of these axons revealed the set of TCs innervated by each RGC cohort. Instead of finding separate sensory pathways, we found a single large network that could not be easily subdivided because individual RGCs innervated different kinds of TCs and different kinds of RGCs co-innervated individual TCs. We did find conspicuous network subdivisions organized on the basis of dendritic rather than neuronal properties. This work argues that, in the thalamus, neural circuits are not based on a canonical set of connections between intrinsically different neuronal types but, rather, may arise by experience-based mixing of different kinds of inputs onto individual postsynaptic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2307093368,"Activation of Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons potently promotes feeding, and chronically altering their activity also affects peripheral glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that acute activation of AgRP neurons causes insulin resistance through impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT). AgRP neuron activation acutely reprograms gene expression in BAT toward a myogenic signature, including increased expression of myostatin. Interference with myostatin activity improves insulin sensitivity that was impaired by AgRP neurons activation. Optogenetic circuitry mapping reveals that feeding and insulin sensitivity are controlled by both distinct and overlapping projections. Stimulation of AgRP → LHA projections impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes feeding while activation of AgRP → anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST)vl projections, distinct from AgRP → aBNSTdm projections controlling feeding, mediate the effect of AgRP neuron activation on BAT-myostatin expression and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that AgRP neurons in mice induce not only eating, but also insulin resistance by stimulating expression of muscle-related genes in BAT, revealing a mechanism by which these neurons rapidly coordinate hunger states with glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2308326102,"Transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA is fundamental for gene regulation. However, it remains unknown how the dynamics of TF-DNA interactions change during cell-fate determination in vivo. Here, we use photo-activatable FCS to quantify TF-DNA binding in single cells of developing mouse embryos. In blastocysts, the TFs Oct4 and Sox2, which control pluripotency, bind DNA more stably in pluripotent than in extraembryonic cells. By contrast, in the four-cell embryo, Sox2 engages in more long-lived interactions than does Oct4. Sox2 long-lived binding varies between blastomeres and is regulated by H3R26 methylation. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that those blastomeres with more long-lived binding contribute more pluripotent progeny, and reducing H3R26 methylation decreases long-lived binding, Sox2 target expression, and pluripotent cell numbers. Therefore, Sox2-DNA binding predicts mammalian cell fate as early as the four-cell stage. More generally, we reveal the dynamic repartitioning of TFs between DNA sites driven by physiological epigenetic changes. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2304223632,"In C. elegans, small RNAs enable transmission of epigenetic responses across multiple generations. While RNAi inheritance mechanisms that enable ""memorization"" of ancestral responses are being elucidated, the mechanisms that determine the duration of inherited silencing and the ability to forget the inherited epigenetic effects are not known. We now show that exposure to dsRNA activates a feedback loop whereby gene-specific RNAi responses dictate the transgenerational duration of RNAi responses mounted against unrelated genes, elicited separately in previous generations. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that, aside from silencing of genes with complementary sequences, dsRNA-induced RNAi affects the production of heritable endogenous small RNAs, which regulate the expression of RNAi factors. Manipulating genes in this feedback pathway changes the duration of heritable silencing. Such active control of transgenerational effects could be adaptive, since ancestral responses would be detrimental if the environments of the progeny and the ancestors were different."

Under homeostatic conditions, mutant macrophages accumulate undigested lysosomal material, which disrupts endocytic recycling and impairs their migration to, and thus engulfment of, dying cells. This causes a buildup of unengulfed cell debris. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages with lysosomal storage cannot migrate toward infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis in the tuberculous granuloma. The unengulfed apoptotic macrophages undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and increased mycobacterial growth. Macrophage lysosomal storage similarly impairs migration to newly infecting mycobacteria. This phenotype is recapitulated in human smokers, who are at increased risk for tuberculosis.

The incapacitation of highly microbicidal first-responding macrophages may contribute to smokers’ susceptibility to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) involves a series of interactions between macrophages and the infecting mycobacterium with this proposed sequence of events (Cambier et al., 2014aCambier C.J. Falkow S.

Rev. 2014; 262: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar): inhaled mycobacteria are engulfed by lung alveolar macrophages and, if not cleared during this initial interaction, are transported deeper into the lung. Here, newly recruited myeloid and other immune cells aggregate around the infected cells to form organized granulomas. The study of zebrafish infected with M. marinum has enabled the dissection of these steps of TB pathogenesis, aided by the genetic tractability of this model organism and its optical transparency during its first few weeks of life (Cambier et al., 2014aCambier C.J. Falkow S. Ramakrishnan L. Host evasion and exploitation schemes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Cell. 2014; 159: 1497-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Newly infecting bacteria can be transported across epithelial barriers by permissive macrophages (Cambier et al., 2014bCambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E. Tobin D.M. Urdahl K.B. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Additional macrophages are recruited to the initial infected macrophage to form the tuberculous granuloma (Cambier et al., 2014aCambier C.J. Falkow S. Ramakrishnan L. Host evasion and exploitation schemes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Cell. 2014; 159: 1497-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cellular expansion of the granuloma, and intracellular bacterial growth within it, proceeds through apoptosis of the infected macrophages and their phagocytosis by newly arriving uninfected macrophages (Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). On the one hand, bacterially mediated granuloma expansion can promote infection through bacterial spread into newly recruited macrophages (Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if the supply of uninfected macrophages is limiting, apoptotic infected cells in the granuloma undergo secondary necrosis, causing granuloma breakdown and the release of bacteria into the extracellular space, which enables their accelerated growth (Pagán et al., 2015Pagán A.J. Yang C.T. Cameron J. Swaim L.E. Ellett F. Lieschke G.J. Ramakrishnan L. Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this work, we characterize a zebrafish mutant identified in a forward genetic screen (Tobin et al., 2010Tobin D.M. Vary Jr., J.C. Ray J.P. Walsh G.S. Dunstan S.J. Bang N.D. Hagge D.A. Khadge S.

Hawn T.R. et al.The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans.Cell. 2010; 140: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) to reveal how, during genetic lysosomal storage disorders, the accumulation of undegraded products in the macrophage lysosome impairs the migration of these phagocytic cells. The disruption of macrophage migration contributes to the pathogenesis of the lysosomal storage disease in the uninfected state and causes granuloma breakdown during tuberculous infection, which underlies hypersusceptibility. The mutation maps to snapc1b, a transcriptional co-regulator that causes lysosomal storage through reduced expression of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins B and L. Using zebrafish models of human lysosomal storage diseases, we generalize our findings to show that the accumulation of diverse biological substrates, as well as inert particles, compromises macrophage migration through the derangement of endocytic recycling. We then show that lysosomal storage in macrophages inhibits their migration to engulf newly infecting bacteria. Because the resident alveolar macrophages of human cigarette smokers have been reported to accumulate particulate material, we asked whether smokers’ macrophages are similarly compromised in their response to mycobacterial infection. We find that the majority of smokers’ alveolar macrophages have enlarged lysosomes filled with opaque material and are impaired in their migration to M. tuberculosis. The compromised migration of these highly microbicidal first responding macrophages suggests a mechanistic explanation for the reported association between smoking and TB (Lin et al., 2007Lin H.H. Ezzati M. Murray M. Tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution and tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e20Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The zebrafish mutant fh111, identified in a forward genetic screen (Tobin et al., 2010Tobin D.M. Vary Jr., J.C. Ray J.P. Walsh G.S. Dunstan S.J. Bang N.D. Hagge D.A. Khadge S. King M.-C.

We used bacterial cording as a sensitive and specific phenotype to map fh111 (Figure 1D) (Tobin et al., 2010Tobin D.M. Vary Jr., J.C. Ray J.P. Walsh G.S. Dunstan S.J. Bang N.D. Hagge D.A. Khadge S.

Mittal V. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. SNAP19 mediates the assembly of a functional core promoter complex (SNAPc) shared by RNA polymerases II and III.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Zebrafish snapc1b has higher amino acid identity to human SNAPC1 than its paralog snapc1a, located on chromosome 20 (39% versus 35%, respectively) (Flicek et al., 2014Flicek P. Amode M.R. Barrell D.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of wild-type (WT) animals at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) showed that snapc1b RNAs were ∼35-fold more abundant than snapc1a RNAs (GEO: GSE74196). We confirmed the location and transcriptional consequence of fh111 by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR (Figures S1A and S1B). Causality of the fh111 mutation was confirmed by a splice-blocking antisense oligonucleotide (morpholino) that targeted the same exon 1–2 splice junction of snapc1b (Table S1) that phenocopied fh111 susceptibility (Figures S1C and S1D) and by non-complementation with an independent retroviral insertion allele that disrupts exon 1 of snapc1b (la010158) (Figures S1E and S1F) (Varshney et al., 2013Varshney G.K.

Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s t test (C,E) and Fisher’s exact test (D). In sum, our findings suggest that Snapc1b deficiency causes hypersusceptibility to mycobacterial infection through early granuloma breakdown, which releases mycobacteria into the extracellular milieu that is more growth permissive than the intracellular environment, culminating in bacterial cording morphology (Pagán et al., 2015Pagán A.J. Yang C.T. Cameron J. Swaim L.E. Ellett F. Lieschke G.J. Ramakrishnan L. Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Granuloma breakdown can result from a global reduction in macrophage numbers available to replenish the granuloma (Pagán et al., 2015Pagán A.J. Yang C.T. Cameron J. Swaim L.E. Ellett F. Lieschke G.J.

Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that, even in uninfected snapc1b mutants, macrophage numbers were increased as revealed by increased numbers of fluorescent macrophages in transgenic animals (Ellett et al., 2011Ellett F. Pase L. Hayman J.W. Andrianopoulos A. Lieschke G.J. mpeg1 promoter transgenes direct macrophage-lineage expression in zebrafish.Blood. 2011; 117: e49-e56Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and by staining with neutral red, a vital dye that accumulates in macrophages (Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) (Figures 1E–1G). The increased abundance of microglia, tissue resident macrophages of the brain derived from a primitive hematopoietic lineage (Clements and Traver, 2013Clements W.K. Traver D. Signalling pathways that control vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell specification.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggested a derangement in multiple waves of myelopoiesis (Figures 1H and 1I). Most of the macrophages in mutants were enlarged and discoid in shape (Figures 1J, 1K, and S2A–S2C ). The enlarged macrophages contained prominent vacuoles, which were revealed to be fused lysosomes by staining with LysoTracker (Figure 1L) (Peri and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008Peri F. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Live imaging of neuronal degradation by microglia reveals a role for v0-ATPase a1 in phagosomal fusion in vivo.Cell. 2008; 133: 916-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The mutant lysosomes were larger than wild-type and occupied a greater proportion of total macrophage volume (Figure 1M). This aberrant macrophage morphology is similar to what has been observed in human lysosomal storage disorders (Kieseier et al., 1997Kieseier B.C. Wisniewski K.E. Goebel H.H. The monocyte-macrophage system is affected in lysosomal storage diseases: an immunoelectron microscopic study.Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our observation of an increased abundance of tissue resident macrophages (histiocytosis) accompanied by increased expression of myeloid growth factors (Table S2) also mirrors findings in several human lysosomal storage disorders (Allen, 2008Allen T.C. Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis and other pulmonary histiocytic diseases: a review.Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2008; 132: 1171-1181PubMed Google Scholar, Hsu et al., 2012Hsu C.L. Lin W. Seshasayee D. Chen Y.H. Ding X. Lin Z. Suto E. Huang Z. Lee W.P. Park H. et al.Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 deficiency perturbs lysosome function and macrophage homeostasis.Science. 2012; 335: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Neutrophils, the other myeloid cells present at this developmental stage, were not increased in snapc1b mutants and displayed normal morphology, consistent with their lack of involvement in homeostatic scavenger functions (Figure S2D; data not shown). To understand the development of vacuolated morphology, we compared microglial morphology and dynamics in uninfected animals during physiological efferocytosis of apoptotic neurons. In wild-type animals, macrophages assumed a vacuolated morphology upon phagocytosis of particulate material (presumably cell debris) but reverted to normal within 4 hr (Figure 2A; Movie S1). Vacuolated morphology was accompanied by a transient reduction in speed of homeostatic migration; movement resumed upon reversion to normal morphology (Figures 2A and 2B; Movie S1). In snapc1b mutants, macrophages became irreversibly vacuolated after only a few phagocytic events, accompanied by sustained immotility and consequently reduced displacement—36 μm versus 131 μm for wild-type—over a 13-hr observation period (Figures 2A and 2B; Movie S1). These vacuolated macrophages did not have obvious phagocytic defects and continued to extend pseudopods in apparent phagocytic events (Figure 2A; Movie S1). Vacuolated macrophages were also unable to migrate in response to the chemotactic molecule CCL2 injected into the hindbrain ventricle (HBV) (Cambier et al., 2014bCambier C.J. Takaki K.K. Larson R.P. Hernandez R.E. Tobin D.M. Urdahl K.B. Cosma C.L. Ramakrishnan L. Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), indicating a broad migratory defect toward both cell debris and chemotactic factors (Figure 2C). These findings are consistent with observations that macrophages from patients with Gaucher’s disease, the most common human lysosomal storage disorder, are defective for migration but competent for phagocytosis (Aflaki et al., 2014Aflaki E. Stubblefield B.K. Maniwang E. Lopez G. Moaven N. Goldin E. Marugan J. Patnaik S. Dutra A. Southall N. et al.Macrophage models of Gaucher disease for evaluating disease pathogenesis and candidate drugs.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 240ra73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Acridine orange staining confirmed that the lysosomal accumulations in mutant macrophages were phagocytosed apoptotic bodies (Abrams et al., 1993Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Programmed cell death during Drosophila embryogenesis.Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Peri and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008Peri F. Nüsslein-Volhard C.

Together, these findings suggested that lysosomal accumulation of undigested cell debris in mutant macrophages impairs migration irreversibly and leads to progressive macrophage incapacitation. If so, then we hypothesized that mutants would have an accumulation of extracellular apoptotic bodies in the brain as seen in several human lysosomal storage disorders (Huang et al., 1997Huang J.Q. Trasler J.M. Igdoura S. Michaud J. Hanal N. Gravel R.A. Apoptotic cell death in mouse models of GM2 gangliosidosis and observations on human Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). They did (Figures 2E and 2F). Furthermore, a global reduction in apoptosis induced by the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh reduced extracellular cell debris (Figure S3A) and decreased the number of macrophages with lysosomal accumulations of the debris and with enlarged lysosomes (Figures S3B and S3C). Together, these findings show that snapc1b mutant macrophages become irreversibly vacuolated due to their inability to degrade phagocytosed cell debris. As more and more macrophages lose their migratory capability, a deficit of functioning macrophages may develop. We recently showed that reduction in the macrophage supply reduces granuloma macrophage replenishment to the point at which apoptotic infected macrophages, failing to be engulfed, undergo secondary necrosis (Pagán et al., 2015Pagán A.J. Yang C.T. Cameron J. Swaim L.E. Ellett F. Lieschke G.J. Ramakrishnan L. Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 15-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Having observed that the vacuolated macrophages of snapc1b mutants failed to migrate to dying cells in the uninfected state and failed to migrate to newly infecting bacteria, we wondered whether they were also unable to migrate to dying cells in the tuberculous granuloma. If so, a functional macrophage deficiency could develop in the context of global macrophage excess, providing an explanation for our observation of early granuloma breakdown. We performed detailed time-lapse confocal imaging of forming granulomas in wild-type and snapc1b mutant larvae over ∼18 hr. Wild-type granulomas retained cellularity over this period through continuous influx of macrophages (Movie S2; Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast, Snapc1b-deficient granulomas broke down soon after formation (Movie S2). Mutant granulomas were surrounded by mostly vacuolated macrophages that failed to migrate into the granuloma (Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S2). The migration deficit in snapc1b mutants was specific to the vacuolated macrophages; the morphologically normal macrophages in the mutants maintained displacements and speeds similar to those of wild-type animals (Figures 3C and 3D; Movie S2). Thus, macrophage lysosomal storage leads to granuloma breakdown by preventing migration to the forming structure and is functionally equivalent to a global macrophage deficiency. Our findings suggest that, once the snapc1b mutants have exhausted their migration-competent macrophages, the tuberculous granuloma breaks down resulting in bacterial cording. Human SNAPC1 is involved in global RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (Baillat et al., 2012Baillat D. Gardini A. Cesaroni M. Shiekhattar R. Requirement for SNAPC1 in transcriptional responsiveness to diverse extracellular signals.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4642-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RNA-seq analysis of snapc1b mutants and wild-type siblings revealed more than 1,000 differentially expressed genes in the mutant (Table S3), suggesting zebrafish Snapc1b functions in a similar manner. How might a broadly acting transcriptional regulator produce such specific phenotypes? Guided by the snapc1b mutant phenotype, we analyzed the RNA-seq dataset for lysosomal genes including those associated with human lysosomal storage disorders (Table S2) (Platt et al., 2012Platt F.M. Boland B. van der Spoel A.C. The cell biology of disease: lysosomal storage disorders: the cellular impact of lysosomal dysfunction.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Only two, the myeloid cell-specific lysosomal cysteine cathepsins B and L1 (ctsbb and ctsl1) (Heng et al., 2008Heng T.S. Painter M.W. Immunological Genome Project ConsortiumThe Immunological Genome Project: networks of gene expression in immune cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), were underrepresented in the mutant, at 9% and 13% of wild-type levels, respectively (Table S2), and we confirmed their commensurate reduction by qRT-PCR analysis (85% and 83%, respectively) (Figure 4A; data not shown). We were able to test lysosomal cathepsin activity in situ using MagicRed (MR)-Cathepsin L, a modified cathepsin L target sequence, which fluoresces only when cleaved (Peri and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008Peri F. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Live imaging of neuronal degradation by microglia reveals a role for v0-ATPase a1 in phagosomal fusion in vivo.Cell. 2008; 133: 916-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In wild-type animals, brain macrophages quickly cleaved injected MR-cathepsin L; this number was reduced as expected by administration of the irreversible pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitor, E64d (42.7% of macrophages in control versus 3.63% in E64d-treated larvae, p < 0.0001) (Murray et al., 1997Murray E.J. Grisanti M.S. Bentley G.V. Murray S.S. E64d, a membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, attenuates the effects of parathyroid hormone on osteoblasts in vitro.Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1090-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B). snapc1b mutants displayed reduced MR-cathepsin-L cleavage compared to wild-type siblings, indicative of reduced lysosomal cathepsin L activity (47.2% of macrophages in WT animals versus 5.3% in mutants, p < 0.0001) (Figure 4C). We next tested whether cysteine cathepsin deficiency underlies all of the snapc1b mutant phenotypes. Inhibition of cysteine cathepsins by E64d recapitulated both baseline and infected snapc1b mutant phenotypes—macrophage lysosomal storage with accompanying migratory defects at baseline, and hypersusceptibility to infection with bacterial cording (Figures 4D–4F). We attempted morpholino knockdown of ctsbb and ctsl1 to probe their individual culpabilities in the snapc1b mutant phenotypes (Table S1). As the ctsbb morpholino was highly toxic, we could only pursue ctsl1 further. ctsl1 morphants recapitulated the snapc1b phenotypes (Figures 4G–4I). Transient overexpression of ctsl1 mRNA in snapc1b mutant larvae restored normal macrophage morphology in uninfected snapc1b mutants and rescued cording (Figures 4J and 4K). Together these experiments implicate cysteine cathepsins in snapc1b hypersusceptibility resulting from macrophage incapacitation. Our data ascribe a substantial portion of snapc1b phenotypes to cathepsin L1 deficiency though we cannot rule out a minor role for cathepsin B deficiency. Prior findings that cathepsin L knockout mice are not hypersusceptible to M. tuberculosis (Nepal et al., 2008Nepal R.M. Vesosky B. Turner J. Bryant P. DM, but not cathepsin L, is required to control an aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) may reflect functional redundancies present in the mouse but not the zebrafish. Our finding that cathepsin L1 deficiency mediated hypersusceptibility prompted us to ask whether this lysosomal hydrolase might play a role in macrophage microbicidal activity for two reasons. First, a deficit in macrophage microbicidal activity (e.g., through TNF deficiency) has been shown to result in granuloma breakdown with bacterial cording (Tobin et al., 2010Tobin D.M. Vary Jr., J.C. Ray J.P. Walsh G.S. Dunstan S.J. Bang N.D. Hagge D.A. Khadge S. King M.-C. Hawn T.R. et al.The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans.Cell. 2010; 140: 717-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Second, in vitro, cathepsin L has been reported to indirectly facilitate mycobacterial killing by cleaving ubiquitin into microbicidal peptides (Alonso et al., 2007Alonso S. Pethe K. Russell D.G. Purdy G.E. Lysosomal killing of Mycobacterium mediated by ubiquitin-derived peptides is enhanced by autophagy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, we found that macrophages of both snapc1b mutants and ctsl1 morphants restricted bacterial growth normally (F"

The receptor of AGEs (RAGE) has an essential contribution to cellular dysfunction driven by chronic inflammatory responses while TGF-β1 is critical in both dermal homeostasis and inflammation. We investigated the contribution of RAGE and TGF-β1 to the modulation of inflammatory response and ECM turnover in AGEs milieu, using a normal fibroblast cell line. RAGE, TGF-β1, collagen I and III gene and protein expression were upregulated after exposure to AGEs-BSA, and MMP-2 was activated. AGEs-RAGE was pivotal in NF-κB dependent collagen I expression and joined with TGF-β1 to stimulate collagen III expression, probably via ERK1/2 signaling. AGEs-RAGE axis induced upregulation of TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-8 cytokines. TNF-α and IL-8 were subjected to TGF-β1 negative regulation. RAGE's proinflammatory signaling also antagonized AGEs-TGF-β1 induced fibroblast contraction, suggesting the existence of an inhibitory cross-talk mechanism between TGF-β1 and RAGE signaling. RAGE and TGF-β1 stimulated anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-4 expression. GM-CSF and IL-6 expression appeared to be dependent only on TGF-β1 signaling. Our data also indicated that IFN-γ upregulated in AGEs-BSA milieu in a RAGE and TGF-β1 independent mechanism. Our findings raise the possibility that RAGE and TGF-β1 are both involved in fibrosis development in a complex cross-talk mechanism, while also acting on their own individual targets. This study contributes to the understanding of impaired wound healing associated with diabetes complications."
https://openalex.org/W2305392762,"The Norway or brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is among the most ubiquitous of rodents. However, the lack of studies describing Norway rat populations from tropical areas have limited our understanding regarding their demography and seasonal dynamics. In this study, we describe seasonal pattern in the abundance, reproductive parameters, and morphometrics of Norway rat populations in Salvador, Brazil. Rodents were trapped over four seasonal trapping periods (2013–2014) from three valleys. A total of 802 Norway rats were trapped over the course of the study over 7653 trap-nights. Norway rat abundance was high, but there was no significant differences between seasons. The reproductive parameters (e.g. frequency of pregnant and lactating females) did not show statistical differences between seasons. Female rats collected in the rainy season were heavier and older than females from the dry season. Salvador rats had a high incidence of pregnancy and birth rate (estimated birth rate of 79 young per year) compared to previous studies. The information generated is critical for the understanding of the ecology of Norway rat, the main reservoir of Leptospira in Salvador. However, future studies examining the effect of rodent control programs aimed at reducing populations, and determining rates of recovery, will further clarify our understanding of population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2317505839,"Background Malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor of the skin and seems to be resistant to current therapeutic approaches. Melanocytic transformation is thought to occur by sequential accumulation of genetic and molecular alterations able to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) and/or the PI3K/AKT (AKT) signalling pathways. Specifically, mutations of B-RAF activate MAPK pathway resulting in cell cycle progression and apoptosis prevention. According to these findings, MAPK and AKT pathways may represent promising therapeutic targets for an otherwise devastating disease. Result Here we show a computational model able to simulate the main biochemical and metabolic interactions in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways potentially involved in melanoma development. Overall, this computational approach may accelerate the drug discovery process and encourages the identification of novel pathway activators with consequent development of novel antioncogenic compounds to overcome tumor cell resistance to conventional therapeutic agents. The source code of the various versions of the model are available as S1 Archive."
https://openalex.org/W2308938254,"Objectives There are significant geographical differences in the prevalence and incidence of celiac disease that cannot be explained by HLA alone. More than 40 loci outside of the HLA region have been associated with celiac disease. We investigated the roles of these non-HLA genes in the development of tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA) and celiac disease in a large international prospective cohort study. Methods A total of 424,788 newborns from the US and European general populations and first-degree relatives with type 1 diabetes were screened for specific HLA genotypes. Of these, 21,589 carried 1 of the 9 HLA genotypes associated with increased risk for type 1 diabetes and celiac disease; we followed 8676 of the children in a 15 y prospective follow-up study. Genotype analyses were performed on 6010 children using the Illumina ImmunoChip. Levels of tTGA were measured in serum samples using radio-ligand binding assays; diagnoses of celiac disease were made based on persistent detection of tTGA and biopsy analysis. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analyses. Results We found 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5 genes associated with celiac disease (TAGAP, IL18R1, RGS21, PLEK, and CCR9) in time to celiac disease analyses (10−4>P>5.8x10−6). The hazard ratios (HR) for the SNPs with the smallest P values in each region were 1.59, 1.45, 2.23, 2.64, and 1.40, respectively. Outside of regions previously associated with celiac disease, we identified 10 SNPs in 8 regions that could also be associated with the disease (P<10−4). A SNP near PKIA (rs117128341, P = 6.5x10−8, HR = 2.8) and a SNP near PFKFB3 (rs117139146, P<2.8x10−7, HR = 4.9) reached the genome-wide association threshold in subjects from Sweden. Analyses of time to detection of tTGA identified 29 SNPs in 2 regions previously associated with celiac disease (CTLA4, P = 1.3x10−6, HR = 0.76 and LPP, P = 2.8x10−5, HR = .80) and 6 SNPs in 5 regions not previously associated with celiac disease (P<10−4); non-HLA genes are therefore involved in development of tTGA. Conclusions In conclusion, using a genetic analysis of a large international cohort of children, we associated celiac disease development with 5 non-HLA regions previously associated with the disease and 8 regions not previously associated with celiac disease. We identified 5 regions associated with development of tTGA. Two loci associated with celiac disease progression reached a genome-wide association threshold in subjects from Sweden."
https://openalex.org/W2308451738,"Obesity is a known risk factor for PDA and recent reports suggest obesity has a negative impact on clinical outcomes in patients with PDA. Pretreatment body mass index (BMI) and serum albumin (SA) have been shown to be associated with worse overall survival in patients with advanced and metastatic PDA. However, minimal data exists on the impact of BMI and SA on perioperative and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with early-stage resected PDA. Herein, we report on the impact of these variables on perioperative clinical outcomes, overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in patients with resected PDA. With IRB approval, we evaluated 1,545 patients with PDA treated at a single institution from 2007-2013 and identified 106 patients who underwent upfront resection with curative intent. BMI and SA were calculated preoperatively and at the time of last clinical evaluation. Influence of preoperative BMI, SA, change in either variable, and influence of other clinical and pathologic variables on perioperative morbidity and mortality was assessed. The impact of these variables on DFS and OS was assessed with cox regression modeling and ANOVA. Actuarial estimates for DFS and OS were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Median follow up time was 16 months (3-89). Mean age was 68 years. Median survival was 14 months (3-65) and median time to recurrence was 11 months (1-79). Length of hospital stay was associated with BMI (p = .023), change in BMI (p = .003) and SA (p = .004). Post-operative transfusion rate was associated with SA (p = .021). There was a strong correlation between BMI change and positive margin (p = .04) and lymph node status (p = .01). On multivariate analysis, change in SA (p = .03) and node positivity (p = .008) were associated with decreased DFS. Additionally, preoperative SA (p = .023), node positivity (p = .026) and poor differentiation (p = .045) were associated with worse OS on multivariate analysis. Low preoperative SA was associated with worse DFS and OS in patients with resected PDA. Lower BMI and SA were associated with longer post-operative hospital stay. Our study is one of the first to describe how pre-operative BMI and SA and post-operative changes in these variables impact clinical and perioperative outcomes. This data supports nutritional status and weight loss as predictors of outcome in resected pancreatic cancer patients and warrants further prospective investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2303226722,"To produce milk that is healthier for human consumption, the present study evaluated the effect of including canola oil in the diet of dairy cows on milk production and composition as well as the nutritional quality of this milk fat. Eighteen Holstein cows with an average daily milk yield of 22 (± 4) kg/d in the middle stage of lactation were used. The cows were distributed in 6 contemporary 3x3 Latin squares consisting of 3 periods and 3 treatments: control diet (without oil), 3% inclusion of canola oil in the diet and 6% inclusion of canola oil in the diet (dry matter basis). The inclusion of 6% canola oil in the diet of lactating cows linearly reduced the milk yield by 2.51 kg/d, short-chain fatty acids (FA) by 41.42%, medium chain FA by 27.32%, saturated FA by 20.24%, saturated/unsaturated FA ratio by 39.20%, omega-6/omega-3 ratio by 39.45%, and atherogenicity index by 48.36% compared with the control treatment. Moreover, with the 6% inclusion of canola oil in the diet of cows, there was an increase in the concentration of long chain FA by 45.91%, unsaturated FA by 34.08%, monounsaturated FA by 40.37%, polyunsaturated FA by 17.88%, milk concentration of omega-3 by 115%, rumenic acid (CLA) by 16.50%, oleic acid by 44.87% and h/H milk index by 94.44% compared with the control treatment. Thus, the inclusion of canola oil in the diet of lactating dairy cows makes the milk fatty acid profile nutritionally healthier for the human diet; however, the lactating performance of dairy cows is reduce."
https://openalex.org/W2309543541,"The scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR) is a measure of the auditory nervous system's representation of periodic sound, and may serve as a marker of training-related enhancements, behavioural deficits, and clinical conditions. However, FFRs of healthy normal subjects show considerable variability that remains unexplained. We investigated whether the FFR representation of the frequency content of a complex tone is related to the perception of the pitch of the fundamental frequency. The strength of the fundamental frequency in the FFR of 39 people with normal hearing was assessed when they listened to complex tones that either included or lacked energy at the fundamental frequency. We found that the strength of the fundamental representation of the missing fundamental tone complex correlated significantly with people's general tendency to perceive the pitch of the tone as either matching the frequency of the spectral components that were present, or that of the missing fundamental. Although at a group level the fundamental representation in the FFR did not appear to be affected by the presence or absence of energy at the same frequency in the stimulus, the two conditions were statistically distinguishable for some subjects individually, indicating that the neural representation is not linearly dependent on the stimulus content. In a second experiment using a within-subjects paradigm, we showed that subjects can learn to reversibly select between either fundamental or spectral perception, and that this is accompanied both by changes to the fundamental representation in the FFR and to cortical-based gamma activity. These results suggest that both fundamental and spectral representations coexist, and are available for later auditory processing stages, the requirements of which may also influence their relative strength and thus modulate FFR variability. The data also highlight voluntary mode perception as a new paradigm with which to study top-down vs bottom-up mechanisms that support the emerging view of the FFR as the outcome of integrated processing in the entire auditory system."
https://openalex.org/W2309517590,"White adipose tissue (WAT) plays a fundamental role in maintaining energy balance and important endocrine functions. The loss of WAT modifies adipokine secretion and disrupts homeostasis, potentially leading to severe metabolic effects and a reduced quality of life. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent used clinically because of its good effectiveness against various types of cancer. However, doxorubicin has deleterious effects in many healthy tissues, including WAT, liver, and skeletal and cardiac muscles. Our objective was to investigate the effects of doxorubicin on white adipocytes through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Doxorubicin reduced the uptake of glucose by retroperitoneal adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells via the inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase Thr172 phosphorylation and glucose transporter 4 content. Doxorubicin also reduced the serum level of adiponectin and, to a greater extent, the expression of genes encoding lipogenic (Fas and Acc) and adipogenic factors (Pparg, C/ebpa, and Srebp1c) in retroperitoneal adipose tissue. In addition, doxorubicin inhibited both lipogenesis and lipolysis and reduced the hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase protein levels. Therefore, our results demonstrate the impact of doxorubicin on WAT. These results are important to understand some side effects observed in patients receiving chemotherapy and should encourage new adjuvant treatments that aim to inhibit these side effects."

CDDS provided aggregate data on primarily non-medical spending for fiscal year 2012-2013 for persons with ASD with or without intellectual disability (ID) (main sample, n = 42,274), and two sub-samples: ASD only (n = 30,164), and ASD+ID (n = 12,110). Demographic variables included sex, age and race-ethnicity. Spending categories included Employment Support, Community Care Facilities, Day Care, Transportation, and in-home and out-of-home Respite.Per-person spending for males and females were approximately the same: $10,488 and $10,791 for males and females for ages 3-17 and $26,491 and $26,627 for ages 18+. Among race/ethnicity categories, the ranking from highest to lowest among ages 3-17 was white non-Hispanics ($11,480), Asian non-Hispanics ($11,036), ""Others"" ($11,031), Hispanics ($9,571), and African-American non-Hispanics ($9,482). For ages 18+, the ranking was whites ($31,008), African-Americans ($26,831), ""Others"" ($25,395), Asians ($22,993), and Hispanics ($18,083). The ASD+ID sub-sample exerted disproportionate influence on findings from the main sample for persons 18+. Combining all ages, the top two expenditure categories for per-person spending were Community Care Facilities ($43,867) and Day Care ($11,244).

https://openalex.org/W2334278671,"Barth Syndrome is the only known Mendelian disorder of cardiolipin remodeling, with characteristic clinical features of cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and neutropenia. While the primary biochemical defects of reduced mature cardiolipin and increased monolysocardiolipin are well-described, much of the downstream biochemical dysregulation has not been uncovered, and biomarkers are limited. In order to further expand upon the knowledge of the biochemical abnormalities in Barth Syndrome, we analyzed metabolite profiles in plasma from a cohort of individuals with Barth Syndrome compared to age-matched controls via 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A clear distinction between metabolite profiles of individuals with Barth Syndrome and controls was observed, and was defined by an array of metabolite classes including amino acids and lipids. Pathway analysis of these discriminating metabolites revealed involvement of mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial biochemical pathways including: insulin regulation of fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, biogenic amine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling, and tRNA biosynthesis. Taken together, this data indicates broad metabolic dysregulation in Barth Syndrome with wide cellular effects."

Methods: two recreational soccer teams were divided in a soccer training only group (SO; n = 13) and a strength and soccer training group (ST; n = 13). Both groups were tested for values of CV, D', Yo-Yo IR1 distance and 30-m sprint time on two separate occasions (pre and post intervention). The ST group performed a concurrent 6-week upper and lower body strength and soccer training, whilst the SO group performed a soccer only training. Results: after the re-test of all variables, the ST demonstrated significant improvements for both, YoYo IR1 distance (p = 0.002) and CV values (p<0.001) with no significant changes in the SO group. 30-m sprint performance were slightly improved in the ST group with significantly decreased performance times identified in the SO group (p<0.001). Values for D' were slightly reduced in both groups (ST -44.5 m, 95% CI = -90.6 to 1.6; SO -42.6 m, 95% CI = -88.7 to 3.5). Conclusions: combining a 6-week moderate strength training with soccer training significantly improves CV, Yo-Yo IR1 whilst moderately improving 30-m sprint performances in non-previously resistance trained male soccer players. Critical Velocity can be recommended to coaches as an additional valid testing tool in soccer."
https://openalex.org/W2310542847,"Tooth morphogenesis is initiated by reciprocal interactions between the ectoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme, and the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in this process. We found that Plakophilin (PKP)1, which is associated with diseases such as ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome, was highly expressed in teeth and skin, and was upregulated during tooth development. We hypothesized that PKP1 regulates Wnt signaling via its armadillo repeat domain in a manner similar to β-catenin. To determine its role in tooth development, we performed Pkp1 knockdown experiments using ex vivo organ cultures and cell cultures. Loss of Pkp1 reduced the size of tooth germs and inhibited dental epithelial cell proliferation, which was stimulated by Wnt3a. Furthermore, transfected PKP1-emerald green fluorescent protein was translocated from the plasma membrane to the nucleus upon stimulation with Wnt3a and LiCl, which required the PKP1 N terminus (amino acids 161 to 270). Localization of PKP1, which is known as an adhesion-related desmosome component, shifted to the plasma membrane during ameloblast differentiation. In addition, Pkp1 knockdown disrupted the localization of Zona occludens 1 in tight junctions and inhibited ameloblast differentiation; the two proteins were shown to directly interact by immunoprecipitation. These results implicate the participation of PKP1 in early tooth morphogenesis as an effector of canonical Wnt signaling that controls ameloblast differentiation via regulation of the cell adhesion complex."
https://openalex.org/W2311428113,"Porphyra is a macrophytic red alga of the Bangiales that is important ecologically and economically. We describe the genomes of three bacteria in the phylum Planctomycetes (designated P1, P2 and P3) that were isolated from blades of Porphyra umbilicalis (P.um.1). These three Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belong to distinct genera; P2 belongs to the genus Rhodopirellula, while P1 and P3 represent undescribed genera within the Planctomycetes. Comparative analyses of the P1, P2 and P3 genomes show large expansions of distinct gene families, which can be widespread throughout the Planctomycetes (e.g., protein kinases, sensors/response regulators) and may relate to specific habitat (e.g., sulfatase gene expansions in marine Planctomycetes) or phylogenetic position. Notably, there are major differences among the Planctomycetes in the numbers and sub-functional diversity of enzymes (e.g., sulfatases, glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases) that allow these bacteria to access a range of sulfated polysaccharides in macroalgal cell walls. These differences suggest that the microbes have varied capacities for feeding on fixed carbon in the cell walls of P.um.1 and other macrophytic algae, although the activities among the various bacteria might be functionally complementary in situ. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses indicate augmentation of gene functions through expansions arising from gene duplications and horizontal gene transfers; examples include genes involved in cell wall degradation (e.g., κ-carrageenase, alginate lyase, fucosidase) and stress responses (e.g., efflux pump, amino acid transporter). Finally P1 and P2 contain various genes encoding selenoproteins, many of which are enzymes that ameliorate the impact of environmental stresses that occur in the intertidal habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2309822245,"An impressive number of new climate change scenarios have recently become available to assess the ecological impacts of climate change. Among these impacts, shifts in species range analyzed with species distribution models are the most widely studied. Whereas it is widely recognized that the uncertainty in future climatic conditions must be taken into account in impact studies, many assessments of species range shifts still rely on just a few climate change scenarios, often selected arbitrarily. We describe a method to select objectively a subset of climate change scenarios among a large ensemble of available ones. Our k-means clustering approach reduces the number of climate change scenarios needed to project species distributions, while retaining the coverage of uncertainty in future climate conditions. We first show, for three biologically-relevant climatic variables, that a reduced number of six climate change scenarios generates average climatic conditions very close to those obtained from a set of 27 scenarios available before reduction. A case study on potential gains and losses of habitat by three northeastern American tree species shows that potential future species distributions projected from the selected six climate change scenarios are very similar to those obtained from the full set of 27, although with some spatial discrepancies at the edges of species distributions. In contrast, projections based on just a few climate models vary strongly according to the initial choice of climate models. We give clear guidance on how to reduce the number of climate change scenarios while retaining the central tendencies and coverage of uncertainty in future climatic conditions. This should be particularly useful during future climate change impact studies as more than twice as many climate models were reported in the fifth assessment report of IPCC compared to the previous one."

The anti-VEGF repebody selected through a phage-display was shown to have a high affinity and specificity for human VEGF. We demonstrate that this repebody effectively inhibits in vitro angiogenic cellular processes, such as proliferation and migration, by blocking the VEGF-mediated signaling pathway. The repebody was also shown to have a strong suppression effect on choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and vascular leakage in vivo. Our results indicate that the anti-VEGF repebody has a therapeutic potential for treating neovascular AMD as well as other VEGF-involved diseases including diabetic retinopathy and metastatic cancers."

Development of new biopesticides targeting this pest might solve the resistance problem and contribute to sustainable crop production. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of Isaria fumosorosea (syn. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus) strain CCM 8367 against L. decemlineata when applied alone or combined with the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae. The last-instar larvae of the Colorado potato beetle showed the highest susceptibility to I. fumosorosea followed by pre-pupae and pupae. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was estimated to be 1.03×106 blastospores/ml. The strain CCM 8367 was more virulent, causing 92.6% mortality of larvae (LT50 = 5.0 days) compared to the reference strain Apopka 97, which caused 54.5% mortality (LT50 = 7.0 days). The combined application of the fungus with the nematodes increased the mortality up to 98.0%. The best results were obtained when S. feltiae was applied simultaneously with I. fumosorosea (LT50 = 2.0 days); later application negatively affected both the penetration rate and the development of the nematodes. We can conclude that the strain CCM 8367 of I. fumosorosea is a prospective biocontrol agent against immature stages of L. decemlineata. For higher efficacy, application together with an entomopathogenic nematode is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2310792464,"Four of the most common limitations of the many available clustering methods are: i) the lack of a proper strategy to deal with outliers; ii) the need for a good a priori estimate of the number of clusters to obtain reasonable results; iii) the lack of a method able to detect when partitioning of a specific data set is not appropriate; and iv) the dependence of the result on the initialization. Here we propose Cross-clustering (CC), a partial clustering algorithm that overcomes these four limitations by combining the principles of two well established hierarchical clustering algorithms: Ward’s minimum variance and Complete-linkage. We validated CC by comparing it with a number of existing clustering methods, including Ward’s and Complete-linkage. We show on both simulated and real datasets, that CC performs better than the other methods in terms of: the identification of the correct number of clusters, the identification of outliers, and the determination of real cluster memberships. We used CC to cluster samples in order to identify disease subtypes, and on gene profiles, in order to determine groups of genes with the same behavior. Results obtained on a non-biological dataset show that the method is general enough to be successfully used in such diverse applications. The algorithm has been implemented in the statistical language R and is freely available from the CRAN contributed packages repository."
https://openalex.org/W2311632283,"Background The ostrich Struthio camelus reaches the highest speeds of any extant biped, and has been an extraordinary subject for studies of soft-tissue anatomy and dynamics of locomotion. An elongate tarsometatarsus in adult ostriches contributes to their speed. The internal osteology of the tarsometatarsus, and its mechanical response to forces of running, are potentially revealing about ostrich foot function. Methods/Principal Findings Computed tomography (CT) reveals anatomy and bone densities in tarsometatarsi of an adult and a young juvenile ostrich. A finite element (FE) model for the adult was constructed with properties of compact and cancellous bone where these respective tissues predominate in the original specimen. The model was subjected to a quasi-static analysis under the midstance ground reaction and muscular forces of a fast run. Anatomy–Metatarsals are divided proximally and distally and unify around a single internal cavity in most adult tarsometatarsus shafts, but the juvenile retains an internal three-part division of metatarsals throughout the element. The juvenile has a sparsely ossified hypotarsus for insertion of the m. fibularis longus, as part of a proximally separate third metatarsal. Bone is denser in all regions of the adult tarsometatarsus, with cancellous bone concentrated at proximal and distal articulations, and highly dense compact bone throughout the shaft. Biomechanics–FE simulations show stress and strain are much greater at midshaft than at force applications, suggesting that shaft bending is the most important stressor of the tarsometatarsus. Contraction of digital flexors, inducing a posterior force at the TMT distal condyles, likely reduces buildup of tensile stresses in the bone by inducing compression at these locations, and counteracts bending loads. Safety factors are high for von Mises stress, consistent with faster running speeds known for ostriches. Conclusions/Significance High safety factors suggest that bone densities and anatomy of the ostrich tarsometatarsus confer strength for selectively critical activities, such as fleeing and kicking predators. Anatomical results and FE modeling of the ostrich tarsometatarsus are a useful baseline for testing the structure’s capabilities and constraints for locomotion, through ontogeny and the full step cycle. With this foundation, future analyses can incorporate behaviorally realistic strain rates and distal joint forces, experimental validation, and proximal elements of the ostrich hind limb."
https://openalex.org/W2304824535,"Armolipid Plus (AP) is a nutraceutical that contains policosanol, fermented rice with red yeast, berberine, coenzyme Q10, folic acid, and astaxanthin. It has been shown to be effective in reducing plasma LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels. In the multicenter randomized trial NCT01562080, there was large interindividual variability in the plasma LDLc response to AP supplementation. We hypothesized that the variability in LDLc response to AP supplementation may be linked to LDLR and PCSK9 polymorphisms.We sequenced the LDLR 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTR) and the PCSK9 5' UTR of 102 participants with moderate hypercholesterolemia in trial NCT01562080. In this trial, 50 individuals were treated with AP supplementation and the rest with placebo.Multiple linear regression analysis, using the response of LDLc levels to AP as the dependent variable, revealed that polymorphisms rs2149041 (c.-3383C>G) in the PCSK9 5' UTR and rs14158 (c.*52G>A) in the LDLR 3' UTR explained 14.1% and 6.4%, respectively, of the variability after adjusting for gender, age, and BMI of individuals. Combining polymorphisms rs2149041 and rs14158 explained 20.5% of this variability (p < 0.004).Three polymorphisms in the 3' UTR region of LDLR, c.*52G>A, c.*504G>A, and c.*773A>G, and two at the 5' UTR region of PCSK9, c.-3383C>G and c.-2063A>G, were associated with response to AP. These results could explain the variability observed in the response to berberine among people with moderate hypercholesterolemia, and they may be useful in identifying patients who could potentially benefit from supplementation with AP."
https://openalex.org/W2305584487,"Bats are the main pollinators and seed dispersers of Stenocereus thurberi, a xenogamous columnar cactus of northwestern Mexico and a good model to illustrate spatial dynamics of gene flow in long-lived species. Previous studies in this cactus showed differences among populations in the type and abundance of pollinators, and in the timing of flowering and fruiting. In this study we analyzed genetic variability and population differentiation among populations. We used three primers of ISSR to analyze within and among populations genetic variation from eight widely separated populations of S. thurberi in Sonora, Mexico. Sixty-six out of 99 of the ISSR bands (P = 66.7%) were polymorphic. Total heterozygosity for all populations sampled revealed high genetic diversity (Hsp = 0.207, HBT = 0.224). The AMOVA showed that most of the genetic variation was within populations (80.5%). At the species level, estimates of population differentiation, θ = 0.175 and θB = 0.194, indicated moderate gene flow among populations. The absence of a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances indicated little isolation by geographic distance. The large genetic variation and diversity found in S. thurberi is consistent with its open reproductive system and the high mobility of bats, a major pollinator. However, small changes in number or kind of pollinators and seed dispersal agents, in the directionality of migratory routes, and/or in the timing of flowering and fruiting among populations, can critically affect gene flow dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2307130378,"Background UNAIDS official estimates of national HIV prevalence are based on trends observed in antenatal clinic surveillance, after adjustment for the reduced fertility of HIV positive women. Uptake of ART may impact on the fertility of HIV positive women, implying a need to re-estimate the adjustment factors used in these calculations. We analyse the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision on population-level fertility in Southern and East Africa, comparing trends in HIV infected women against the secular trends observed in uninfected women. Methods We used fertility data from four community-based demographic and HIV surveillance sites: Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka and Rakai (Uganda) and uMkhanyakude (South Africa). All births to women aged 15–44 years old were included in the analysis, classified by mother’s age and HIV status at time of birth, and ART availability in the community. Calendar time period of data availability relative to ART Introduction varied across the sites, from 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 9 years after. Calendar time was classified according to ART availability, grouped into pre ART, ART introduction (available in at least one health facility serving study site) and ART available (available in all designated health facilities serving study site). We used Poisson regression to calculate age adjusted fertility rate ratios over time by HIV status, and investigated the interaction between ART period and HIV status to ascertain whether trends over time were different for HIV positive and negative women. Results Age-adjusted fertility rates declined significantly over time for HIV negative women in all four studies. However HIV positives either had no change in fertility (Masaka, Rakai) or experienced a significant increase over the same period (Kisesa, uMkhanyakude). HIV positive fertility was significantly lower than negative in both the pre ART period (age adjusted fertility rate ratio (FRR) range 0.51 95%CI 0.42–0.61 to 0.73 95%CI 0.64–0.83) and when ART was widely available (FRR range 0.57 95%CI 0.52–0.62 to 0.83 95%CI 0.78–0.87), but the difference has narrowed. The interaction terms describing the difference in trends between HIV positives and negatives are generally significant. Conclusions Differences in fertility between HIV positive and HIV negative women are narrowing over time as ART becomes more widely available in these communities. Routine adjustment of ANC data for estimating national HIV prevalence will need to allow for the impact of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2306359401,"Our objective is to compare the cost-utility of icotinib and gefitinib for the second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system.Model technology was applied to assess the data of randomized clinical trials and the direct medical costs from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Five-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed.Our model suggested that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months in the icotinib group and 3.5 months in the gefitinib group while they were 4.6 months and 3.4 months, respectively, in the trials. The 5-year QALYs was 0.279 in the icotinib group and 0.269 in the gefitinib group, and the according medical costs were $10662.82 and $13127.57. The ICUR/QALY of icotinib versus gefitinib presented negative in this study. The most sensitive parameter to the ICUR was utility of PFS, ranging from $-1,259,991.25 to $-182,296.61; accordingly the icotinib treatment consistently represented a dominant cost-utility strategy.The icotinib strategy, as a second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients in China, is the preferred strategy relative to gefitinib because of the dominant cost-utility. In addition, icotinib shows a good curative effect and safety, resulting in a strong demand for the Chinese market."
https://openalex.org/W2306582420,"The aim was to compare the average and the days method in exploring the compliance of children with physical activity guidelines and describe their physical activity patterns in different school day segments.Physical activity was objectively measured in 472 children aged 6-13 for one school week. Children were compliant when fulfilling PA recommendations 1) on average over all measured days (average method) or 2) on at least four measured days (days method). To explore the difference in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes between compliant and non-complaint children (using both the average and days method) in various day segments, linear mixed models was used.Compliance with physical activity guidelines was significantly higher with the average compared to the days method (51.7% and 23.7%, respectively). In segmented-day analysis, compliant children accrued more MVPA minutes in all day segments, especially during after-school. Gender differences appeared only during the in-school segments, where girls spent less time in MVPA (average method: -4.39 min, 95% CI = -5.36,-3.42, days method: -4.45 min, 95%CI = -5.46,-3.44). Older children accrued more MVPA minutes during physical education classes, but less during breaks, compared to younger children.The used methods yielded remarkably different prevalence estimates for compliance to physical activity recommendations. To ensure comparability between studies, interventions and reports, there is a need for internationally agreed operationalization and assessment methods of physical activity guidelines. As non-compliant children had lower MVPA during all day segments, greater efforts should be made to provide physical activity opportunities both during and after school."

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on different markers of oxidative stress in HIV-seropositive patients. We performed a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial in The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, a public health hospital. 70 HIV-seropositive patients aged 20 to 55 on clinical score A1, A2, B1 or B2 receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were studied. They were randomly assigned to receive omega 3 fatty acids 2.4 g (Zonelabs, Marblehead MA) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and at the end of the study, anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, glucose and stress oxidative levels [nitric oxide catabolites, lipoperoxides (malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxialkenals), and glutathione] were evaluated. Principal HAART therapy was EFV/TDF/FTC (55%) and AZT/3TC/EFV (15%) without difference between groups. Treatment with omega 3 fatty acids as compared with placebo decreased triglycerides (-0.32 vs. 0.54 mmol/L; p = 0.04), but oxidative stress markers were not different between groups.

https://openalex.org/W2307421136,"Rat ear cartilage was studied using Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy to expand the current knowledge which has been established for relatively more complex cartilage types. Comparison of the FT-IR spectra of the ear cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) with published data on articular cartilage, collagen II and 4-chondroitin-sulfate standards, as well as of collagen type I-containing dermal collagen bundles (CBs) with collagen type II, was performed. Ear cartilage ECM glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were revealed histochemically and as a reduction in ECM FT-IR spectral band heights (1140–820 cm-1) after testicular hyaluronidase digestion. Although ear cartilage is less complex than articular cartilage, it contains ECM components with a macromolecular orientation as revealed using polarization microscopy. Collagen type II and GAGs, which play a structural role in the stereo-arrangement of the ear cartilage, contribute to its FT-IR spectrum. Similar to articular cartilage, ear cartilage showed that proteoglycans add a contribution to the collagen amide I spectral region, a finding that does not recommend this region for collagen type II quantification purposes. In contrast to articular cartilage, the symmetric stretching vibration of –SO3- groups at 1064 cm-1 appeared under-represented in the FT-IR spectral profile of ear cartilage. Because the band corresponding to the asymmetric stretching vibration of –SO3- groups (1236–1225 cm-1) overlapped with that of amide III bands, it is not recommended for evaluation of the –SO3- contribution to the FT-IR spectrum of the ear cartilage ECM. Instead, a peak (or shoulder) at 1027–1016 cm-1 could be better considered for this intent. Amide I/amide II ratios as calculated here and data from the literature suggest that protein complexes of the ear cartilage ECM are arranged with a lower helical conformation compared to pure collagen II. The present results could motivate further studies on this tissue under pathological or experimental states involving ear cartilage."

Here, we investigate the effect of endurance training on adipose progenitor lineage commitment. Using mice with genetically labeled adipose progenitors, we show that these cells react to exercise by decreasing their proliferation and differentiation potential. Analyses of mouse models that mimic the skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise indicate that muscle, in a non-autonomous manner, regulates adipose progenitor homeostasis, highlighting a role for muscle-derived secreted factors. These findings support a humoral link between skeletal muscle and adipose progenitors and indicate that manipulation of adipose stem cell function may help address obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2303791724,"Yersinia pestis enters host cells and evades host defenses, in part, through interactions between Yersinia pestis proteins and host membranes. One such interaction is through the type III secretion system, which uses a highly conserved and ordered complex for Yersinia pestis outer membrane effector protein translocation called the injectisome. The portion of the injectisome that interacts directly with host cell membranes is referred to as the translocon. The translocon is believed to form a pore allowing effector molecules to enter host cells. To facilitate mechanistic studies of the translocon, we have developed a cell-free approach for expressing translocon pore proteins as a complex supported in a bilayer membrane mimetic nano-scaffold known as a nanolipoprotein particle (NLP) Initial results show cell-free expression of Yersinia pestis outer membrane proteins YopB and YopD was enhanced in the presence of liposomes. However, these complexes tended to aggregate and precipitate. With the addition of co-expressed (NLP) forming components, the YopB and/or YopD complex was rendered soluble, increasing the yield of protein for biophysical studies. Biophysical methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy were used to confirm that the soluble YopB/D complex was associated with NLPs. An interaction between the YopB/D complex and NLP was validated by immunoprecipitation. The YopB/D translocon complex embedded in a NLP provides a platform for protein interaction studies between pathogen and host proteins. These studies will help elucidate the poorly understood mechanism which enables this pathogen to inject effector proteins into host cells, thus evading host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2305677681,"Objectives Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are associated with significant mortality and morbidity and prolongation of hospital stay, adding strain on limited hospital resources. Despite stringent infection control practices some children remain at high risk of developing HAI. The development of biomarkers which could identify these patients would be useful. In this study our objective was to evaluate mRNA candidate biomarkers for HAI prediction in a pediatric intensive care unit. Design Serial blood samples were collected from patients admitted to pediatric intensive care unit between March and June 2012. Candidate gene expression (IL1B, TNF, IL10, CD3D, BCL2, BID) was quantified using RT-qPCR. Comparisons of relative gene expression between those that did not develop HAI versus those that did were performed using Mann Whitney U-test. Patients Exclusion criteria were: age <28 days or ≥16 years, expected length of stay < 24 hours, expected survival < 28 days, end-stage renal disease and end-stage liver disease. Finally, 45 children were included in this study. Main Results The overall HAI rate was 30% of which 62% were respiratory infections. Children who developed HAI had a three-fold increase in hospital stay compared to those who did not (27 days versus 9 days, p<0.001). An increased expression of cytokine genes (IL1B and IL10) was observed in patients who developed HAI, as well as a pro-apoptosis pattern (higher expression of BID and lower expression of BCL2). CD3D, a key TCR co-factor was also significantly down-modulated in patients who developed HAI. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study of mRNA biomarkers of HAI in the paediatric population. Increased mRNA expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokine and modulation of apoptotic genes suggest the development of immunosuppression in critically ill children. Immune monitoring using a panel of genes may offer a novel stratification tool to identify HAI risk."
https://openalex.org/W2307946095,"The phase III Thai RV144 vaccine trial showed an estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent HIV-1 infection of 31.2%, which has motivated the search for immune correlates of vaccine protection. In a recent report, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FCGR2C were identified to associate with the level of VE in the RV144 trial. To investigate the functional significance of these SNPs, we utilized a large scale B cell RNA sequencing database of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project to examine associations between FCGR2C SNPs and gene expression. We found that the FCGR2C SNPs that associated with vaccine efficacy in RV144 also strongly associated with the expression of FCGR2A/C and one of them also associated with the expression of Fc receptor-like A (FCRLA), another Fc-γ receptor (FcγR) gene that was not examined in the previous report. These results suggest that the expression of FcγR genes is influenced by these SNPs either directly or in linkage with other causal variants. More importantly, these results motivate further investigations into the potential for a causal association of expression and alternative splicing of FCGR2C and other FcγR genes with the HIV-1 vaccine protection in the RV144 trial and other similar studies."

Daphnia pulex are distributed throughout the world and often regarded as a model organism. The 16S rDNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and 18S genes were used as molecular marks. The genetic diversity and phylogeny of D. pulex obtained from 10 water bodies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were studied. For 16S rDNA, COI gene, and 18S gene, the A+T content (65.4%, 58.4%, and 54.6%) was significantly higher than the G+C content (34.6%, 41.6% and 45.4%). This result was consistent with higher A and T contents among invertebrates. Based on the genetic distances of 16S rDNA and COI genes, the genetic differences of D. pulex from 10 water bodies located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China was minimal (0%-0.8% for 16S rDNA and 0%-1.5% for COI gene). However, D. pulex evolved into two branches in the phylogenetic trees, which coincided with its geographical distribution. Compared with D. pulex from other countries, the average genetic distance of D. pulex obtained from 10 water bodies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River reached 9.1%-10.5%, thereby indicating that D. pulex may have evolved into different subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W2304255651,"The ability of azobenzene trimethylammonium bromide (azoTAB) to sensitize cardiac tissue excitability to light was recently reported. The dark, thermally relaxed trans- isomer of azoTAB suppressed spontaneous activity and excitation propagation speed, whereas the cis- isomer had no detectable effect on the electrical properties of cardiomyocyte monolayers. As the membrane potential of cardiac cells is mainly controlled by activity of voltage-gated ion channels, this study examined whether the sensitization effect of azoTAB was exerted primarily via the modulation of voltage-gated ion channel activity. The effects of trans- and cis- isomers of azoTAB on voltage-dependent sodium (INav), calcium (ICav), and potassium (IKv) currents in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The experiments showed that azoTAB modulated ion currents, causing suppression of sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) currents and potentiation of net potassium (K+) currents. This finding confirms that azoTAB-effect on cardiac tissue excitability do indeed result from modulation of voltage-gated ion channels responsible for action potential."

We evaluated differences between temperature and pollutants at the time of stroke onset for each time interval and averaged those parameters across the 7-year study period.During the interval from 13:00 to 16:59, we found a positive association between ischemic stroke occurrence and ozone concentration relative to other time periods. Upper median ozone levels from 13:00 to 16:59 were positively correlated with ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 1.550; 95% confidence intervals, 1.220 to 1.970; P = <0.001) when compared with lower median levels.The results show diurnal patterns of ischemic stroke occurrence based on upper and lower median ozone levels for a 24-hour period, which extends understanding of the association between stroke occurrence and environmental influences."

However, it is still unknown whether these changes are only the consequence of heart failure decompensation or can also predict development thereof. Objectives were to verify if simple, non-invasive autonomic parameters, such as baroreflex sensitivity and short-term heart rate variability can provide independent of other well-known clinical parameters information on the risk of heart failure decompensation in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.In 142 stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, baroreflex sensitivity and short-term heart rate variability, as well as other well-known clinical parameters, were analyzed. During 23 ± 9 months of follow-up 19 patients were hospitalized due to the heart failure decompensation (EVENT).Pre-specified cut-off values of baroreflex sensitivity (≤2.4 ms/mmHg) and low frequency power index of heart rate variability (≤19 ms2) were significantly associated with the EVENTs (hazard ratio 4.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-14.54 and 5.41, 95% CI 1.87-15.65 respectively). EVENTs were also associated with other parameters, such as left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class, diuretic use, renal function, brain natriuretic peptide and hemoglobin level, left atrial size, left and right ventricular heart failure signs. After adjusting baroreflex sensitivity and low frequency power index for each of the abovementioned parameters, autonomic parameters were still significant predictors of hospitalization due to the heart failure decompensation.Simple, noninvasive autonomic indices can be helpful in identifying individuals with increased risk of hospitalization due to the heart failure decompensation among clinically stable patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, even when adjusted for other well-known clinical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2303030935,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ, ubiquinone) is a central electron carrier in mitochondrial respiration. CoQ is synthesized through multiple steps involving a number of different enzymes. The prevailing view that the CoQ used in respiration exists as a free pool that diffuses throughout the mitochondrial inner membrane bilayer has recently been challenged. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of the gene encoding Coq10p results in respiration deficiency without inhibiting the synthesis of CoQ, suggesting that the Coq10 protein is critical for the delivery of CoQ to the site(s) of respiration. The precise mechanism by which this is achieved remains unknown at present. We have identified a Plasmodium orthologue of Coq10 (PfCoq10), which is predominantly expressed in trophozoite-stage parasites, and localizes to the parasite mitochondrion. Expression of PfCoq10 in the S. cerevisiae coq10 deletion strain restored the capability of the yeast to grow on respiratory substrates, suggesting a remarkable functional conservation of this protein over a vast evolutionary distance, and despite a relatively low level of amino acid sequence identity. As the antimalarial drug atovaquone acts as a competitive inhibitor of CoQ, we assessed whether over-expression of PfCoq10 altered the atovaquone sensitivity in parasites and in yeast mitochondria, but found no alteration of its activity."

We conducted an observational study to evaluate the stroke and mortality risk among heart failure patients without diagnosed atrial fibrillation and with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or prior myocardial infarction (MI).Population-based cohort study of patients diagnosed with incident heart failure during 2000-2012 and without atrial fibrillation, identified by record linkage between nationwide registries in Denmark. Hazard rate ratios of ischemic stroke and all-cause death after 1 year of follow-up were used to compare patients with either: a PAD diagnosis; a prior MI diagnosis; or no vascular disease.39,357 heart failure patients were included. When compared to heart failure patients with no vascular disease, PAD was associated with a higher 1-year rate of ischemic stroke (adjusted hazard rate ratio [HR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.65) and all-cause death (adjusted HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.35-1.59), whereas prior MI was not (adjusted HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15 and 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89-1.00, for ischemic stroke and all-cause death, respectively). When comparing patients with PAD to patients with prior MI, PAD was associated with a higher rate of both outcomes.Among incident heart failure patients without diagnosed atrial fibrillation, a previous diagnosis of PAD was associated with a significantly higher rate of the ischemic stroke and all-cause death compared to patients with no vascular disease or prior MI. Prevention strategies may be particularly relevant among HF patients with PAD."
https://openalex.org/W2312127014,"Background In event-related potentials, the N170 manifests itself especially in reaction to faces. In the healthy population, face-inversion leads to stronger negative amplitudes and prolonged latencies of the N170, effects not being present in patients with autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD). ASD has frequently been associated with differences in oxytocinergic neurotransmission. This ERP-study aimed to investigate the face-inversion effect in association with oxytocinergic candidate genes. It was expected that risk-allele-carriers of the oxytocin-receptor-gene-polymorphism (rs53576) and of CD38 (rs379863) responded similar to upright and inverted faces as persons with ASD. Additionally, reactions to different facial emotional expressions were studied. As there have been difficulties with replications of those molecular genetic association studies, we aimed to replicate our findings in a second study. Method Seventy-two male subjects in the first-, and seventy-eight young male subjects in the replication-study conducted a face-inversion-paradigm, while recording EEG. DNA was extracted from buccal cells. Results Results revealed stronger N170-amplitudes and longer latencies in reaction to inverted faces in comparison to upright ones. Furthermore, effects of emotion on N170 were evident. Those effects were present in the first and in the second study. Whereas we found molecular-genetic associations of oxytocinergic polymorphisms with the N170 in the first study, we failed to do so in the replication sample. Conclusion Results indicate that a deeper theoretical understanding of this research-field is needed, in order to generate possible explanations for these findings. Results, furthermore, support the hypotheses that success of reproducibility is correlated with strength of lower original p-values and larger effect sizes in the original study."

With the ultimate goal being the in-vivo application of such systems, quantification of the key aspects governing the reliability is crucial to bring this method towards clinical use.This work presents a systematic reliability study quantifying the sources of variability and their magnitudes of in-vivo measurements using axial-transmission acoustics. 42 healthy subjects were measured by an experienced operator twice per week, over a four-month period, resulting in over 150000 wave measurements. In a complementary study to assess the influence of different operators performing the measurements, 10 novice operators were trained, and each measured 5 subjects on a single occasion, using the same measurement protocol as in the first part of the study.The estimated standard error for the measurement protocol used to collect the study data was ∼ 17 m/s (∼ 4% of the grand mean) and the index of dependability, as a measure of reliability, was Φ = 0.81. It was shown that the method is suitable for multi-operator use and that the reliability can be improved efficiently by additional measurements with device repositioning, while additional measurements without repositioning cannot improve the reliability substantially. Phase velocity values were found to be significantly higher in males than in females (p < 10-5) and an intra-class correlation coefficient of r = 0.70 was found between the legs of each subject.The high reliability of this non-invasive approach and its intrinsic sensitivity to mechanical properties opens perspectives for the rapid and inexpensive clinical assessment of bone pathologies, as well as for monitoring programmes without any radiation exposure for the patient."

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the only method used in clinics nowadays for quality assurance. However, the accuracy of this method is limited by the loss of signal due to the biological washout processes. Up to the moment, very few studies measured the washout processes and there is no database of washout data as a function of the tissue and radioisotope. One of the main difficulties is related to the complexity of such measurements, along with the limited time slots available in hadron therapy facilities. Thus, in this work, we proposed an alternative in vivo methodology for the measurement and modeling of the biological washout parameters without any radiative devices. It consists in the implementation of a point-like radioisotope source by direct injection on the tissues of interest and its measurement by means of high-resolution preclinical PET systems. In particular, the washout of 11C carbonate radioisotopes was assessed, considering that 11C is is the most abundant β+ emitter produced by carbon beams. 11C washout measurements were performed in several tissues of interest (brain, muscle and 9L tumor xenograf) in rodents (Wistar rat). Results show that the methodology presented is sensitive to the washout variations depending on the selected tissue. Finally, a first qualitative correlation between 11C tumor washout properties and tumor metabolism (via 18F-FDG tracer uptake) was found."
