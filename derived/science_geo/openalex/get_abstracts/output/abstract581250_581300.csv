https://openalex.org/W2593404093,"Although it is not known when or where life on Earth began, some of the earliest habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3,770 million and possibly 4,280 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown among carbonate rosettes and magnetite–haematite granules, and is associated with carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3,770 million years ago. Perhaps the earliest known signs of life have been found in Quebec, where features such as haematite tubes suggest that filamentous microbes lived around hydrothermal vents at least 3,770 million years ago. Hydrothermal vents on the sea floor have been thought to be some of the earliest habitable environments on the planet. Now Matthew Dodd et al. suggest that possible signatures of life in and around hydrothermal vents at least 3,770 million years ago could represent the earliest evidence for life on Earth. Jasper and carbonate rocks from northern Quebec, Canada preserve features thought to indicate the presence of filamentous microorganisms. These features include haematite tubes that preserve morphologies that are indicative of microbial activity in much younger rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2544051481,"Supersolidity is an intriguing concept. It combines the property of superfluid flow with the long-range spatial periodicity of solids, two properties which are often mutually exclusive. The original discussion of quantum crystals and supersolidity focuses on solid Helium-4 where it was predicted that vacancies could form dilute weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates. In this system, direct observation of supersolidity has been elusive. The concept of supersolidity was then generalized to include other superfluid systems which break the translational symmetry of space. One of such systems is a Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling which has a supersolid stripe phase. Despite several recent studies of this system, the stripe phase has not been observed. Here we report the direct observation of the predicted density modulation of the stripe phase using Bragg reflection. Our work establishes a system with unique symmetry breaking properties. Of future interest is further spatial symmetry breaking through the introduction of vortices, solitons, impurities or disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2591669685,"Acetylation of α-tubulin on lysine 40 is associated with microtubule stability. In vitro experiments by Portran et al. show that tubulin acetylation reduces lateral interactions, increasing microtubule flexibility and resistance to mechanical stress. Long-lived microtubules endow the eukaryotic cell with long-range transport abilities. While long-lived microtubules are acetylated on Lys40 of α-tubulin (αK40), acetylation takes place after stabilization1 and does not protect against depolymerization2. Instead, αK40 acetylation has been proposed to mechanically stabilize microtubules3. Yet how modification of αK40, a residue exposed to the microtubule lumen and inaccessible to microtubule-associated proteins and motors1,4, could affect microtubule mechanics remains an open question. Here we develop FRET-based assays that report on the lateral interactions between protofilaments and find that αK40 acetylation directly weakens inter-protofilament interactions. Congruently, αK40 acetylation affects two processes largely governed by inter-protofilament interactions, reducing the nucleation frequency and accelerating the shrinkage rate. Most relevant to the biological function of acetylation, microfluidics manipulations demonstrate that αK40 acetylation enhances flexibility and confers resilience against repeated mechanical stresses. Thus, unlike deacetylated microtubules that accumulate damage when subjected to repeated stresses, long-lived microtubules are protected from mechanical ageing through their acquisition of αK40 acetylation. In contrast to other tubulin post-translational modifications that act through microtubule-associated proteins, motors and severing enzymes, intraluminal acetylation directly tunes the compliance and resilience of microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2527043144,"The concept of a supersolid state is paradoxical. It combines the crystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it is built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous symmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous translational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50 years ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A variant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed lattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on self-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice supersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that characterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the realization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking. The continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically coupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase coherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by measuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields leaking from the cavities. These light fields are also used to monitor the position fluctuations in real-time. Our concept provides a route to creating and studying glassy many-body systems with contrallably lifted ground-state degeneracies, such as supersolids in the presence of disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2594894350,"Gut barrier function is key in maintaining a balanced response between the host and its microbiome. The microbiota can modulate changes in gut barrier as well as metabolic and inflammatory responses. This highly complex system involves numerous microbiota-derived factors. The gut symbiont Akkermansia muciniphila is positively correlated with a lean phenotype, reduced body weight gain, amelioration of metabolic responses and restoration of gut barrier function by modulation of mucus layer thickness. However, the molecular mechanisms behind its metabolic and immunological regulatory properties are unexplored. Herein, we identify a highly abundant outer membrane pili-like protein of A. muciniphila MucT that is directly involved in immune regulation and enhancement of trans-epithelial resistance. The purified Amuc_1100 protein and enrichments containing all its associated proteins induced production of specific cytokines through activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. This mainly leads to high levels of IL-10 similar to those induced by the other beneficial immune suppressive microorganisms such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. Together these results indicate that outer membrane protein composition and particularly the newly identified highly abundant pili-like protein Amuc_1100 of A. muciniphila are involved in host immunological homeostasis at the gut mucosa, and improvement of gut barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2594487894,"Neurons and neural networks often extend hundreds of micrometers in three dimensions. Capturing the calcium transients associated with their activity requires volume imaging methods with subsecond temporal resolution. Such speed is a challenge for conventional two-photon laser-scanning microscopy, because it depends on serial focal scanning in 3D and indicators with limited brightness. Here we present an optical module that is easily integrated into standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopes to generate an axially elongated Bessel focus, which when scanned in 2D turns frame rate into volume rate. We demonstrated the power of this approach in enabling discoveries for neurobiology by imaging the calcium dynamics of volumes of neurons and synapses in fruit flies, zebrafish larvae, mice and ferrets in vivo. Calcium signals in objects as small as dendritic spines could be resolved at video rates, provided that the samples were sparsely labeled to limit overlap in their axially projected images."
https://openalex.org/W2594760713,"Örjan Carlborg and colleagues analyze genotype and phenotype data from 4,390 yeast segregants from a cross between laboratory and vineyard strains to estimate how higher-order genetic interactions contribute to complex trait variation. They find networks of epistatic loci and show that accounting for these interactions leads to more accurate phenotypic predictions. Experiments in model organisms report abundant genetic interactions underlying biologically important traits, whereas quantitative genetics theory predicts, and data support, the notion that most genetic variance in populations is additive. Here we describe networks of capacitating genetic interactions that contribute to quantitative trait variation in a large yeast intercross population. The additive variance explained by individual loci in a network is highly dependent on the allele frequencies of the interacting loci. Modeling of phenotypes for multilocus genotype classes in the epistatic networks is often improved by accounting for the interactions. We discuss the implications of these results for attempts to dissect genetic architectures and to predict individual phenotypes and long-term responses to selection."
https://openalex.org/W2593013168,"Nitrogen fertilization is critical to optimize short-term crop yield, but its long-term effect on soil organic C (SOC) is uncertain. Here, we clarify the impact of N fertilization on SOC in typical maize-based (Zea mays L.) Midwest U.S. cropping systems by accounting for site-to-site variability in maize yield response to N fertilization. Within continuous maize and maize-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems at four Iowa locations, we evaluated changes in surface SOC over 14 to 16 years across a range of N fertilizer rates empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, or excessive for maximum maize yield. Soil organic C balances were negative where no N was applied but neutral (maize-soybean) or positive (continuous maize) at the agronomic optimum N rate (AONR). For continuous maize, the rate of SOC storage increased with increasing N rate, reaching a maximum at the AONR and decreasing above the AONR. Greater SOC storage in the optimally fertilized continuous maize system than in the optimally fertilized maize-soybean system was attributed to greater crop residue production and greater SOC storage efficiency in the continuous maize system. Mean annual crop residue production at the AONR was 22% greater in the continuous maize system than in the maize-soybean system and the rate of SOC storage per unit residue C input was 58% greater in the monocrop system. Our results demonstrate that agronomic optimum N fertilization is critical to maintain or increase SOC of Midwest U.S. cropland."
https://openalex.org/W2591686881,"Melanie Bahlo and colleagues perform the first genome-wide association analysis for macular telangiectasia type 2. They identify three significant loci and report on a potential connection to the glycine/serine metabolism pathway. Idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis type 2 (macular telangiectasia type 2; MacTel) is a rare neurovascular degenerative retinal disease. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for MacTel, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 476 cases and 1,733 controls of European ancestry. Genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10−8) were identified at three independent loci (rs73171800 at 5q14.3, P = 7.74 × 10−17; rs715 at 2q34, P = 9.97 × 10−14; rs477992 at 1p12, P = 2.60 × 10−12) and then replicated (P < 0.01) in an independent cohort of 172 cases and 1,134 controls. The 5q14.3 locus is known to associate with variation in retinal vascular diameter, and the 2q34 and 1p12 loci have been implicated in the glycine/serine metabolic pathway. We subsequently found significant differences in blood serum levels of glycine (P = 4.04 × 10−6) and serine (P = 2.48 × 10−4) between MacTel cases and controls."
https://openalex.org/W2593910516,"The current study provides details of sleep (or inactivity) in two wild, free-roaming African elephant matriarchs studied in their natural habitat with remote monitoring using an actiwatch subcutaneously implanted in the trunk, a standard elephant collar equipped with a GPS system and gyroscope, and a portable weather station. We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02:00 and 06:00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences to studies of elephant sleep in captivity are noted, and specific factors shaping sleep architecture in elephants, on various temporal scales, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2592958412,"Type II diabetes (T2D) has been associated with changes in oral bacterial diversity and frequency. It is not known whether these changes are part of the etiology of T2D, or one of its effects.We measured the glucose concentration, bacterial counts, and relative frequencies of 42 bacterial species in whole saliva samples from 8,173 Kuwaiti adolescents (mean age 10.00 ± 0.67 years) using DNA probe analysis. In addition, clinical data related to obesity, dental caries, and gingivitis were collected. Data were compared between adolescents with high salivary glucose (HSG; glucose concentration ≥ 1.0 mg/d, n = 175) and those with low salivary glucose (LSG, glucose concentration < 0.1 mg/dL n = 2,537).HSG was associated with dental caries and gingivitis in the study population. The overall salivary bacterial load in saliva decreased with increasing salivary glucose concentration. Under HSG conditions, the bacterial count for 35 (83%) of 42 species was significantly reduced, and relative bacterial frequencies in 27 species (64%) were altered, as compared with LSG conditions. These alterations were stronger predictors of high salivary glucose than measures of oral disease, obesity, sleep or fitness.HSG was associated with a reduction in overall bacterial load and alterations to many relative bacterial frequencies in saliva when compared with LSG in samples from adolescents. We propose that hyperglycemia due to obesity and/or T2D results in HSG and subsequent acidification of the oral environment, leading to a generalized perturbation in the oral microbiome. This suggests a basis for the observation that hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of dental erosion, dental caries, and gingivitis. We conclude that HSG in adolescents may be predicted from salivary microbial diversity or frequency, and that the changes in the oral microbial composition seen in adolescents with developing metabolic disease may the consequence of hyperglycemia."

They report that DCC mutations result in variable dominant phenotypes with incomplete penetrance, including mirror movements and ACC associated with a favorable developmental prognosis. Brain malformations involving the corpus callosum are common in children with developmental disabilities. We identified DCC mutations in four families and five sporadic individuals with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) without intellectual disability. DCC mutations result in variable dominant phenotypes with decreased penetrance, including mirror movements and ACC associated with a favorable developmental prognosis. Possible phenotypic modifiers include the type and location of mutation and the sex of the individual."
https://openalex.org/W2593233873,"Objective To define and demonstrate effective cataract surgical coverage (eCSC), a candidate UHC indicator that combines a coverage measure (cataract surgical coverage, CSC) with quality (post-operative visual outcome). Methods All Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) surveys with datasets on the online RAAB Repository on April 1 2016 were downloaded. The most recent study from each country was included. By country, cataract surgical outcome (CSOGood, 6/18 or better; CSOPoor, worse than 6/60), CSC (operated cataract as a proportion of operable plus operated cataract) and eCSC (operated cataract and a good outcome as a proportion of operable plus operated cataract) were calculated. The association between CSC and CSO was assessed by linear regression. Gender inequality in CSC and eCSC was calculated. Findings Datasets from 20 countries were included (2005–2013; 67,337 participants; 5,474 cataract surgeries). Median CSC was 53.7% (inter-quartile range[IQR] 46.1–66.6%), CSOGood was 58.9% (IQR 53.7–67.6%) and CSOPoor was 17.7% (IQR 11.3–21.1%). Coverage and quality of cataract surgery were moderately associated—every 1% CSC increase was associated with a 0.46% CSOGood increase and 0.28% CSOPoor decrease. Median eCSC was 36.7% (IQR 30.2–50.6%), approximately one-third lower than the median CSC. Women tended to fare worse than men, and gender inequality was slightly higher for eCSC (4.6% IQR 0.5–7.1%) than for CSC (median 2.3% IQR -1.5–11.6%). Conclusion eCSC allows monitoring of quality in conjunction with coverage of cataract surgery. In the surveys analysed, on average 36.7% of people who could benefit from cataract surgery had undergone surgery and obtained a good visual outcome."

https://openalex.org/W2594350203,"Motor, sensory, and integrative activities of the brain are coordinated by a series of midline-bridging neuronal commissures whose development is tightly regulated. Here we report a new human syndrome in which these commissures are widely disrupted, thus causing clinical manifestations of horizontal gaze palsy, scoliosis, and intellectual disability. Affected individuals were found to possess biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the axon-guidance receptor 'deleted in colorectal carcinoma' (DCC), which has been implicated in congenital mirror movements when it is mutated in the heterozygous state but whose biallelic loss-of-function human phenotype has not been reported. Structural MRI and diffusion tractography demonstrated broad disorganization of white-matter tracts throughout the human central nervous system (CNS), including loss of all commissural tracts at multiple levels of the neuraxis. Combined with data from animal models, these findings show that DCC is a master regulator of midline crossing and development of white-matter projections throughout the human CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2594273438,"Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) generally undertake annual migrations from polar summer feeding grounds to winter calving and nursery grounds in subtropical and tropical coastal waters. Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent ""fishy"" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region. These novel, predictable, inter-annual, low latitude feeding events provide considerable potential for further investigation of Southern Hemisphere humpback feeding behaviours in these relatively accessible low-latitude waters."
https://openalex.org/W2592935482,"Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a major form of chronic liver disease in the general population in relation to its high prevalence among overweight/obese individuals and patients with diabetes type II or metabolic syndrome. NAFLD can progress to steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis and end-stage of liver disease but mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. Within the mechanisms proposed to mediate the progression of NAFLD, lipotoxicity is believed to play a major role. In the present study we provide data suggesting that microvesicles (MVs) released by fat-laden cells undergoing lipotoxicity can activate NLRP3 inflammasome following internalization by either cells of hepatocellular origin or macrophages. Inflammasome activation involves NF-kB-mediated up-regulation of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and pro-Interleukin-1, then inflammasome complex formation and Caspase-1 activation leading finally to an increased release of IL-1β. Since the release of MVs from lipotoxic cells and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome have been reported to occur in vivo in either clinical or experimental NASH, these data suggest a novel rational link between lipotoxicity and increased inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2592582632,"Background The ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the Finnish National Vaccination Program (NVP) in September 2010 using a 2+1 schedule (3, 5, 12 months). We estimated the direct and indirect effects of PCV10 on pneumonia among children to evaluate the public health impact of the vaccine. Methods We conducted a nation-wide population-based, observational study comparing rates of pneumonia in children before and after the NVP introduction. For the total (direct and indirect) effect, the cohort of vaccine-eligible children (born June 1, 2010 or later) was followed until the end of 2013 (age range 3–42 months). For the indirect effect, a cohort of older children (age range 7–71 months) not eligible for the PCV vaccination was followed from 2011 to 2013. Both cohorts were compared with two season- and age-matched reference cohorts before NVP introduction. Hospitals’ in- and outpatient discharge notifications with ICD-10 diagnoses compatible with pneumonia (J10.0, J11.0, J12-J18, J85.1 or J86) as set by the hospital pediatricians were collected from the national Care Register. The main outcome was hospital-treated primary pneumonia (HTPP), defined as primary diagnosis of pneumonia after in-patient hospitalization. We compared rates of pneumonia in the NVP target and reference cohorts by using Poisson regression models. Results The rate of HTPP episodes was 5.3/1000 person-years in the combined reference cohorts and 4.1/1000 person-years in the target cohort vaccine-eligible children. Compared with the reference cohort, the relative rate reduction in target cohort was 23% (95%CI 18–28) and the absolute reduction 1.3/1000 person-years. In the indirect effect evaluation, we observed continued increase in HTPP incidence until 2011 with a subsequent reduction of 18% (95%CI 10–25) during years 2012 to 2013. Number of empyema diagnoses remained low. Conclusions A substantial decrease in pneumonia rates was observed both among vaccine-eligible children and among older, unvaccinated children after PCV10 introduction."
https://openalex.org/W2593751803,"The objective of this study was to describe the feasibility of using Facebook as a platform to recruit and retain young adult veteran drinkers into an online-alcohol use intervention study. Facebook’s wide accessibility and popularity among the age group that comprises the majority of veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan make it a compelling resource through which research can extend its reach to this otherwise hard-to-reach group. We developed a series of Facebook advertisement campaigns to reach veteran drinkers not specifically searching for alcohol treatment. In doing so, we recruited 793 valid veteran participants in approximately two weeks for an advertising cost of $4.53 per obtained participant. The study sample consisted primarily of male veterans, between 19 and 34 years of age, who were drinking at moderate to heavy levels. Although about half of the sample reported mental health comorbidity, few had received any mental health or substance use treatment in the past year. Facebook appears to be a valuable mechanism through which to recruit young veterans with unmet behavioral health needs, although more specific efforts may be needed to engage certain types of veterans after initial study enrollment."
https://openalex.org/W2592248792,"Cancer cachexia (CC) is a multifactorial disease characterized by decreased food intake and loss of body weight due to reduced musculature with or without loss of fat mass. Patients with gastric cancer have a high incidence of cachexia. We previously established a novel CC rat model induced by human gastric cancer-derived 85As2 cells in order to examine the pathophysiology of CC and identify potential therapeutics. In patients with CC, anorexia is often observed, despite elevation of ghrelin, suggesting that ghrelin resistance may develop in these patients. In this study, we aimed to clarify the occurrence of ghrelin resistance in CC rats accompanied by anorexia and we investigated whether rikkunshito (RKT), a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine that potentiates ghrelin signaling, ameliorated CC-related anorexia through alleviation of ghrelin resistance. 85As2-tumor-bearing rats developed severe CC symptoms, including anorexia and loss of body weight/musculature, with the latter symptoms being greater in cachectic rats than in non-tumor-bearing or pair-fed rats. CC rats showed poor responses to intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin. In CC rats, plasma ghrelin levels were elevated and hypothalamic anorexigenic peptide mRNA levels were decreased, whereas hypothalamic growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) mRNA was not affected. In vitro, RKT directly enhanced ghrelin-induced GHS-R activation. RKT administrated orally for 7 days partly alleviated the poor response to ghrelin and ameliorated anorexia without affecting the elevation of plasma ghrelin levels in CC rats. The expression of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide Y mRNA but not hypothalamic GHS-R mRNA was increased by RKT. Thus, the 85As2 cell-induced CC rat model developed ghrelin resistance, possibly contributing to anorexia and body weight loss. The mechanism through which RKT ameliorated anorexia in the CC rat model may involve alleviation of ghrelin resistance by enhancement of ghrelin signaling. These findings suggest that RKT may be a promising agent for the treatment of CC."
https://openalex.org/W2592269586,"Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family plays important roles in various abiotic stresses and hormone signaling in plants. However, no information is currently available regarding this family in cassava (Manihot esculenta), an important drought-tolerant crop in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Here, 57 HD-Zip genes (MeHDZ01-57) were identified in the cassava genome, and they were classified into four subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis, which was further supported by their gene structure and conserved motif characteristics. Of which five gene pairs were involved in segmental duplication but none for tandem duplication, suggesting that segmental duplication was the main cause for the expansion of MeHDZ gene family in cassava. Global expression profiles revealed that MeHDZ genes were constitutively expressed, or not expressed, or tissue-specific expressed in examined tissues in both cultivated and wild subspecies. Transcriptomic analysis of three genotypes showed that most of MeHDZ genes responded differently to drought and polyethylene glycol treatments. Subsequently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed comprehensive responses of twelve selected MeHDZ genes to various stimuli including cold, salt, and ABA treatments. These findings will increase our understanding of HD-Zip gene family involved in abiotic stresses and signaling transduction, and will provide a solid base for further functional characterization of MeHDZ genes in cassava."
https://openalex.org/W2593988857,"The thalamus connects the cortex with other brain regions and supports sensory perception, movement, and cognitive function via numerous distinct nuclei. However, the mechanisms underlying the development and organization of diverse thalamic nuclei remain largely unknown. Here we report an intricate ontogenetic logic of mouse thalamic structures. Individual radial glial progenitors in the developing thalamus actively divide and produce a cohort of neuronal progeny that shows striking spatial configuration and nuclear occupation related to functionality. Whereas the anterior clonal cluster displays relatively more tangential dispersion and contributes predominantly to nuclei with cognitive functions, the medial ventral posterior clonal cluster forms prominent radial arrays and contributes mostly to nuclei with sensory- or motor-related activities. Moreover, the first-order and higher-order sensory and motor nuclei across different modalities are largely segregated clonally. Notably, sonic hedgehog signaling activity influences clonal spatial distribution. Our study reveals lineage relationship to be a critical regulator of nonlaminated thalamus development and organization."
https://openalex.org/W2593881223,"In severe falciparum malaria cytoadherence of parasitised red blood cells (PRBCs) to vascular endothelium (causing sequestration) and to uninfected red cells (causing rosette formation) contribute to microcirculatory flow obstruction in vital organs. Heparin can reverse the underlying ligand-receptor interactions, but may increase the bleeding risks. As a heparin-derived polysaccharide, sevuparin has been designed to retain anti-adhesive properties, while the antithrombin-binding domains have been eliminated, substantially diminishing its anticoagulant activity. Sevuparin has been evaluated recently in patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and is currently investigated in a clinical trial for sickle cell disease. The effects of sevuparin on rosette formation and cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Thailand were investigated. Trophozoite stages of P. falciparum-infected RBCs (Pf-iRBCs) were cultured from 49 patients with malaria. Pf-iRBCs were treated with sevuparin at 37°C and assessed in rosetting and in cytoadhesion assays with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) under static and flow conditions. The proportion of Pf-iRBCs forming rosettes ranged from 6.5% to 26.0% (median = 12.2%). Rosetting was dose dependently disrupted by sevuparin (50% disruption by 250 μg/mL). Overall 57% of P. falciparum isolates bound to HDMECs under static conditions; median (interquartile range) Pf-iRBC binding was 8.5 (3.0-38.0) Pf-iRBCs/1000 HDMECs. Sevuparin in concentrations ≥ 100 μg/mL inhibited cytoadherence. Sevuparin disrupts P. falciparum rosette formation in a dose dependent manner and inhibits cytoadherence to endothelial cells. The data support assessment of sevuparin as an adjunctive treatment to the standard therapy in severe falciparum malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2593331991,"Marine animals, such as turtles, seabirds and pelagic fishes, are observed to travel and congregate around eddies in the open ocean. Mesoscale eddies, large swirling ocean vortices with radius scales of approximately 50–100 km, provide environmental variability that can structure these populations. In this study, we investigate the use of mesoscale eddies by 24 individual juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region. The influence of eddies on turtles is assessed by collocating the turtle trajectories to the tracks of mesoscale eddies identified in maps of sea level anomaly. Juvenile loggerhead sea turtles are significantly more likely to be located in the interiors of anticyclones in this region. The distribution of surface drifters in eddy interiors reveals no significant association with the interiors of cyclones or anticyclones, suggesting higher prevalence of turtles in anticyclones is a result of their behavior. In the southern portion of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region, turtle swimming speed is significantly slower in the interiors of anticyclones, when compared to the periphery, suggesting that these turtles are possibly feeding on prey items associated with anomalously low near-surface chlorophyll concentrations observed in those features."
https://openalex.org/W2594053300,"Large skeletal defects caused by trauma, congenital malformations, and post-oncologic resections of the calvarium present major challenges to the reconstructive surgeon. We previously identified BMP-9 as the most osteogenic BMP in vitro and in vivo. Here we sought to investigate the bone regenerative capacity of murine-derived calvarial mesenchymal progenitor cells (iCALs) transduced by BMP-9 in the context of healing critical-sized calvarial defects. To accomplish this, the transduced cells were delivered to the defect site within a thermoresponsive biodegradable scaffold consisting of poly(polyethylene glycol citrate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide mixed with gelatin (PPCN-g). A total of three treatment arms were evaluated: PPCN-g alone, PPCN-g seeded with iCALs expressing GFP, and PPCN-g seeded with iCALs expressing BMP-9. Defects treated only with PPCN-g scaffold did not statistically change in size when evaluated at eight weeks postoperatively (p = 0.72). Conversely, both animal groups treated with iCALs showed significant reductions in defect size after 12 weeks of follow-up (BMP9-treated: p = 0.0025; GFP-treated: p = 0.0042). However, H&E and trichrome staining revealed more complete osseointegration and mature bone formation only in the BMP9-treated group. These results suggest that BMP9-transduced iCALs seeded in a PPCN-g thermoresponsive scaffold is capable of inducing bone formation in vivo and is an effective means of creating tissue engineered bone for critical sized defects."

This study examined the mechanism of iron-induced BBB disruption after SAH and investigated the potential therapeutic effect of iron chelation on SAH. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats had an endovascular perforation of left internal carotid artery bifurcation or sham operation. The rats were treated with deferoxamine (DFX) or vehicle (100mg/kg) for a maximum of 7 days. Brain edema, BBB leakage, behavioral and cognitive impairment were examined. In SAH rat, the peak time of brain edema and BBB impairment in the cortex was at day 3 after SAH. SAH resulted in a significant increase in ferritin expression in the cortex. The ferritin positive cells were colocalized with endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Compared with vehicle, DFX caused less ferritin upregulation, brain water content, BBB impairment, behavioral and cognitive deficits in SAH rats. The results suggest iron overload could be a therapeutic target for SAH induced BBB damage."
https://openalex.org/W2592410791,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), the causal agent of kiwifruit canker, is one of the most devastating plant diseases of recent times. We have generated two mini-Tn5-based random insertion libraries of Psa ICMP 18884. The first, a 'phenotype of interest' (POI) library, consists of 10,368 independent mutants gridded into 96-well plates. By replica plating onto selective media, the POI library was successfully screened for auxotrophic and motility mutants. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis mutants with 'Fuzzy-Spreader'-like morphologies were also identified through a visual screen. The second, a 'mutant of interest' (MOI) library, comprises around 96,000 independent mutants, also stored in 96-well plates, with approximately 200 individuals per well. The MOI library was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using Transposon-Directed Insertion site Sequencing (TraDIS) to map insertion sites onto the Psa genome. A grid-based PCR method was developed to recover individual mutants, and using this strategy, the MOI library was successfully screened for a putative LPS mutant not identified in the visual screen. The Psa chromosome and plasmid had 24,031 and 1,236 independent insertion events respectively, giving insertion frequencies of 3.65 and 16.6 per kb respectively. These data suggest that the MOI library is near saturation, with the theoretical probability of finding an insert in any one chromosomal gene estimated to be 97.5%. However, only 47% of chromosomal genes had insertions. This surprisingly low rate cannot be solely explained by the lack of insertions in essential genes, which would be expected to be around 5%. Strikingly, many accessory genes, including most of those encoding type III effectors, lacked insertions. In contrast, 94% of genes on the Psa plasmid had insertions, including for example, the type III effector HopAU1. These results suggest that some chromosomal sites are rendered inaccessible to transposon insertion, either by DNA-binding proteins or by the architecture of the nucleoid."
https://openalex.org/W2593276100,"Around the world government agencies responsible for the selection and reimbursement of prescribed medicines and other health technologies are considering how best to bring community preferences into their decision making. In particular, community views about the distribution or equity of funding across the population. These official committees and agencies often have access to the best available and latest evidence on clinical effectiveness, safety and cost from large clinical trials and population-based studies. All too often they do not have access to high quality evidence about community views. We therefore, conducted a large and representative population-based survey in Australia to determine what community members think about the factors that do and should influence government spending on prescribed medicines.A choice-based survey was designed to elicit the importance of individual criteria when considering the equity of government spending on prescribed medicines. A representative sample of 3080 adult Australians completed the survey by allocating a hypothetical budget to different combinations of money spent on two patient populations. Societal preferences were inferred from absolute majority responses i.e. populations with more than 50% of respondents' allocation for a particular allocation criterion.This study shows that, all else being equal, severity of disease, diseases for which there is no alternative treatment available on the government formulary, diseases that affect patients who are not financially well off, and life-style unrelated diseases are supported by the public as resource allocation criteria. Where 'all else is not equal', participants allocated more resources to the patient population that gained considerable improvement in health and fewer resources to those that gained little improvement in health. This result held under all scenarios except for 'end-of-life treatments'. Responses to cost (and corresponding number of patients treated) trade-off scenarios indicated a significant reduction in the proportion of respondents choosing to divide resources equally and a shift in preference towards devoting resources to the population that were more costly to treat for all criteria with the exception of severity of disease.The general public have clear views on what's fair in terms of government spending on prescribed medicines. In addition to supporting the application of the 'rule of rescue', important considerations for government spending included the severity of disease being treated, diseases for which there is no alternative treatment available on the government formulary, diseases that affect patients who are not financially well off and life-style unrelated diseases. This study shows that the general public are willing to share their views on what constitutes an equitable allocation of the government's drug budget. The challenge remains to how best to consider those views alongside clinical and economic considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2594071428,"Protein-protein interactions are the quintessence of physiological activities, but also participate in pathological conditions. Amyloid formation, an abnormal protein-protein interaction process, is a widespread phenomenon in divergent proteins and peptides, resulting in a variety of aggregation disorders. The complexity of the mechanisms underlying amyloid formation/amyloidogenicity is a matter of great scientific interest, since their revelation will provide important insight on principles governing protein misfolding, self-assembly and aggregation. The implication of more than one protein in the progression of different aggregation disorders, together with the cited synergistic occurrence between amyloidogenic proteins, highlights the necessity for a more universal approach, during the study of these proteins. In an attempt to address this pivotal need we constructed and analyzed the human amyloid interactome, a protein-protein interaction network of amyloidogenic proteins and their experimentally verified interactors. This network assembled known interconnections between well-characterized amyloidogenic proteins and proteins related to amyloid fibril formation. The consecutive extended computational analysis revealed significant topological characteristics and unraveled the functional roles of all constituent elements. This study introduces a detailed protein map of amyloidogenicity that will aid immensely towards separate intervention strategies, specifically targeting sub-networks of significant nodes, in an attempt to design possible novel therapeutics for aggregation disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2594698589,"Background Dietary habits are linked to high maternal glucose levels, associated with preterm delivery. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between meal frequency and glycemic properties of maternal diet in relation to preterm delivery. Methods This prospective cohort study included 66,000 women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Meal frequency and food intake data were obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire during mid-pregnancy. Principal component factor analysis was used with a data-driven approach, and three meal frequency patterns were identified: “snack meal”, “main meal”, and “evening meal”. Pattern scores were ranked in quartiles. Glycemic index and glycemic load were estimated from table values. Intakes of carbohydrates, added sugar, and fiber were reported in grams per day and divided into quartiles. Gestational age was obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Preterm delivery was defined as birth at <37 gestational weeks. A Cox regression model was used to assess associations with preterm delivery. Results After adjustments, the “main meal” pattern was associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 0.98) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99) for the third and fourth quartiles, respectively, and p for trend of 0.028. This was mainly attributed to the group of women with BMI ≥25 kg/m2, with HRs of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.96) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.98) for the third and fourth quartiles, respectively, and p for trend of 0.010. There was no association between glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrates, added sugar, fiber, or the remaining meal frequency patterns and preterm delivery. Conclusion Regular consumption of main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) was associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery. Diet should be further studied as potential contributing factors for preterm delivery."

Although several studies explored the role of the neurological examination in polyneuropathy, they were mostly restricted to specific subgroups of patients and have not correlated examination findings with symptoms and electrophysiological results.To explore the sensitivity and specificity of different neurological examination components in patients with diverse etiologies for polyneuropathy, find the most sensitive combination of examination components for polyneuropathy detection, and correlate examination findings with symptoms and electrophysiological results.Patients with polyneuropathy attending the neuromuscular clinic from 01/2013 to 09/2015 were evaluated. Inclusion criteria included symptomatic polyneuropathy, which was confirmed by electrophysiological studies. 47 subjects with no symptoms or electrophysiological findings suggestive for polyneuropathy, served as controls.The total cohort included 312 polyneuropathy patients, with a mean age of 60±14 years. Abnormal examination was found in 95%, most commonly sensory findings (86%). The most common abnormal examination components were impaired ankle reflexes (74%), vibration (73%), and pinprick (72%) sensation. Combining ankle reflex examination with vibration or pinprick perception had the highest sensitivity, of 88%. The specificities of individual examination component were generally high, excluding ankle reflexes (62%), and vibration perception (77%). Abnormal examination findings were correlated with symptomatic weakness and worse electrophysiological parameters.The neurological examination is a valid, sensitive and specific tool for diagnosing polyneuropathy, and findings correlate with polyneuropathy severity. Ankle reflex examination combined with either vibration or pinprick sensory testing is the most sensitive combination for diagnosing polyneuropathy, and should be considered minimal essential components of the physical examination in patients with suspected polyneuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2594657231,"Adhesion of erythrocytes to endothelial cells lining the vascular wall can cause vaso-occlusive events that impair blood flow which in turn may result in ischemia and tissue damage. Adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelial cells has been described in multiple hemolytic disorders, especially in sickle cell disease, but the adhesion of normal erythrocytes to endothelial cells has hardly been described. It was shown that calcium-loaded erythrocytes can adhere to endothelial cells. Because sickle erythrocyte adhesion to ECs can be enhanced by ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers, we investigated whether calcium loading of erythrocytes could promote binding to endothelial cells via ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. We used (immunofluorescent) live-cell imaging of washed erythrocytes perfused over primary endothelial cells at venular flow rate. Using this approach, we show that calcium-loaded erythrocytes strongly adhere to histamine-stimulated primary human endothelial cells. This adhesion is mediated by ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. Von Willebrand factor knockdown or ADAMTS13 cleavage abolished the binding of erythrocytes to activated endothelial cells under flow. Platelet depletion did not interfere with erythrocyte binding to von Willebrand factor. Our results reveal platelet-independent adhesion of calcium-loaded erythrocytes to endothelium-derived von Willebrand factor. Erythrocyte adhesion to von Willebrand factor may be particularly relevant for venous thrombosis, which is characterized by the formation of erythrocyte-rich thrombi."
https://openalex.org/W2594230038,"1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) is a natural D-glucose analogue and has a strong physiological activity in inhibiting α-glucosidase in vivo. The antidiabetic effects of DNJ in mice or other mammals were extensively explored, but the physiological and toxic roles of DNJ in insects was seldom reported. In this study, the biological effects of DNJ were examined in midgut extracts of fourth-instar larvae of Eri silkworm (Samia cynthia ricini, Saturniidae). Based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabonomics technology, we analyzed the alterations of glycometabolism, lipids, and energy metabolism pathways in the midgut of S. cynthia ricini caused by DNJ. Pattern recognition analysis (partial least square-discriminant analysis, PLS-DA) showed that four groups of latex, 0.25% DNJ, 0.5% DNJ and the mixture of 0.5% DNJ and latex (1:1) were distinctly different from the control group. Moreover, several metabolic pathways of DNJ-mediated modulation in the midgut were identified. Compared with the control group, alanine, succinate, glutamate, and fumarate concentrations decreased in three groups of 0.5% DNJ, latex, and the mixture, choline levels increased in two DNJ groups, and trehalose levels increased in all experimental groups. Therefore, these results suggest that DNJ modulated lipid metabolism by limiting the hydrolysis pathways of phospholipids metabolism. Additionally, DNJ has a potent negative effect on energy metabolism by inhibiting the hydrolysis of trehalose, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Overall, DNJ, as a single-ingredient, is an efficient substance for modulating lipid metabolism and inhibiting energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2592049189,"Mechanical and geometrical cues influence cell behaviour. At the tissue level, almost all organs exhibit immediate mechanical responsiveness, in particular by increasing their stiffness in direct proportion to an applied mechanical stress. It was recently shown in cultured-cell models, in particular with fibroblasts, that the frequency of the applied stress is a fundamental stimulating parameter. However, the influence of the stimulus frequency at the tissue level has remained elusive. Using a device to deliver an oscillating torque that generates cyclic strain at different frequencies, we studied the effect(s) of mild skin massage in an ex vivo model and in vivo. Skin explants were maintained ex vivo for 10 days and massaged twice daily for one minute at various frequencies within the range of 65–85 Hz. Biopsies were analysed at D0, D5 and D10 and processed for immuno-histological staining specific to various dermal proteins. As compared to untreated skin explants, the massaging procedure clearly led to higher rates of expression, in particular for decorin, fibrillin, tropoelastin, and procollagen-1. The mechanical stimulus thus evoked an anti-aging response. Strikingly, the expression was found to depend on the stimulus frequency with maximum expression at 75Hz. We then tested whether this mechanical stimulus had an anti-aging effect in vivo. Twenty Caucasian women (aged 65-75y) applied a commercial anti-aging cream to the face and neck, followed by daily treatments using the anti-aging massage device for 8 weeks. A control group of twenty-two women, with similar ages to the first group, applied the cream alone. At W0, W4 and W8, a blinded evaluator assessed the global facial wrinkles, skin texture, lip area, cheek wrinkles, neck sagging and neck texture using a clinical grading scale. We found that combining the massaging device with a skin anti-aging formulation amplified the beneficial effects of the cream."

Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy, which we will hereafter refer to as autophagy, is a conserved cellular process in which various physiological signals, including nutrient starvation, lead to the recruitment of organelles or cytosolic proteins into double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes eventually fuse with lysosomes for degradation of the internalized cargo. The resulting building blocks, such as amino acids, are then released back to the cytosol for reuse, helping cells survive starvation. Unc-51-like kinase (ULK) is the most upstream kinase for autophagy initiation (15Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Upon starvation, ULK phosphorylates DENND3 at Ser-554 and Ser-572, recruiting the adapter protein 14-3-3, and this process leads to up-regulation of DENND3 GEF activity toward its substrate Rab12. Rab12 on recycling endosomes (16Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M. Small GTPase Rab12 regulates constitutive degradation of transferrin receptor.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) then incorporates into forming autophagosomes and facilitates autophagosome trafficking (13Xu J.

Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although starvation-mediated phosphorylation of DENND3 regulates its GEF activity toward Rab12, the mechanism underlying this regulation is unknown. Here, we report an intramolecular interaction accounting for the regulation of the GEF activity of DENND3. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in DENND3 regulates this intramolecular interaction, suggesting that a signaling pathway involving a tyrosine kinase impinges upon the intramolecular interaction to regulate DENND3 GEF activity toward Rab12. DENND3 is composed of an uncharacterized N-terminal region of 79 amino acids followed by a DENN domain, an ∼50-kDa linker region, and a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain (Fig. 1A). We demonstrated that signals stimulating autophagy up-regulate DENND3-mediated activation of Rab12 (13Xu J. McPherson P.S.

We generated GST fusion proteins from amino acids 538–611 (partial linker), covering the N terminus of the linker around the ULK phosphorylation sites, and amino acids 538–973 (linker), covering the full linker region, and we performed pulldown experiments with cell lysates expressing the FLAG-tagged DENN domain with the N-terminal extension (hereafter called the extension and DENN or Ext-DENN) (Fig. 1A). These experiments were based on the rationale that because the DENN domain encodes the catalytic GEF activity, if there is autoinhibition mediated by the intramolecular interaction, it would most likely involve an interaction with the DENN domain. Interestingly, the GST-linker fusion protein bound robustly to Ext-DENN, although the partial linker had little or no binding (Fig. 1B, top panel). There was no binding of either construct to the WD40 domain (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Thus, DENND3 has an intramolecular interaction involving Ext-DENN and a site on the linker between residues 612 and 973. We next sought to map the intramolecular interaction site in the linker. We generated a series of GST-linker fusion proteins with increasing C-terminal deletions, which we used in pulldown assays with cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged Ext-DENN. Binding between the linker and Ext-DENN was lost after truncating 38 amino acids from the C terminus of the GST-linker (Fig. 1C). When we used the same set of GST fusions for pulldown with full-length DENND3, there was no detectable binding, even for the full linker (Fig. 1D). Thus, the intramolecular interaction within full-length DENND3 is sufficiently robust as to prevent binding to the fusion protein. We next sought to map the interaction site on Ext-DENN. Surprisingly, whereas the linker fusion protein binds strongly to FLAG-tagged Ext-DENN, it does not bind the DENN domain alone (Fig. 1E), indicating that the N-terminal extension is necessary for the intramolecular interaction. However, there was no binding of the GST-linker to the isolated N-terminal extension (Ext) tagged with FLAG nor was their binding of the GST-Ext to the linker tagged with FLAG (Fig. 1F). Thus, both the Ext and the DENN domain are required for the intramolecular interaction with the linker. We next sought to map the site(s) within Ext required for the intramolecular interaction. We generated a series of FLAG-tagged Ext-DENN constructs with different deletions within the N-terminal extension, which we screened for interaction with the GST-linker. Interestingly, we found two patches within Ext, residues 11–30 and 42–59, necessary for interacting with the linker (Fig. 1, G and H). Thus, there is an intramolecular interaction within DENND3 mediated by the C-terminal region of the linker and the Ext-DENN, which requires two patches within the N-terminal extension (Fig. 1I). We mapped the intramolecular interaction site in the linker to a region between amino acids 935 and 973 (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation regulates protein interactions in a fast and reversible manner, and we hypothesized that a phosphorylation event within this region could be involved in the intramolecular interaction. We aligned the sequence between 935 and 973 across species to identify conserved Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues, and for each we created Asp or Glu phosphomimetics as well as Ala or Phe phosphorylation-defective mutants. Binding between the linker and Ext-DENN was not altered with any of the Ser/Thr phosphomimetic or phosphorylation-defective mutations (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, a Y940D mutation almost completely abolished the interaction, although a phosphorylation-defective Y940F mutation continued to show strong binding with Ext-DENN (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that Tyr-940 is a key residue involved in the intramolecular interaction, and consistently it was reported that Tyr-940 of DENND3 is phosphorylated in rat brain (22Hornbeck P.V. Kornhauser J.M. Tkachev S. Zhang B. Skrzypek E. Murray B. Latham V. Sullivan M.

Because of the aromatic ring of tyrosine, there is no natural amino acid substitute that creates an ideal phosphomimetic mutant, but many examples do exist in which mutation of Tyr to Asp or Glu has been used successfully to mimic phosphorylated tyrosine (23Yu B.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Theoretically, if the effect of the phosphorylation is due primarily to the negative charge of the phospho group, Asp or Glu should mimic phosphorylated tyrosine. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the residues flanking Tyr-940 have no secondary structure and are located between α-helices (supplemental Fig. S1). As such, this region would be flexible, perhaps forming a loop. Thus, loss of binding of the linker to Ext-DENN after introducing the Y940D mutation is unlikely to be caused by disruption of a secondary or tertiary structure in the linker. Because the GST-linker binds to the isolated Ext-DENN, but not the full-length DENND3 (Fig. 1, C and D), we wondered whether full-length DENND3 with the Y940D mutation would disrupt the cis interaction allowing for an interaction in trans. However, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2, Y940D does not have better binding to the linker as compared with wild-type or Y940F. We think it likely that when the Ext-DENN and the linker are within full-length DENND3, although the Y940D mutation abolishes the binding between the Ext-DENN and the linker, somehow steric hindrance of the linker or the WD40 repeats in cis blocks access of linker in trans to the Ext-DENN. Tyrosine phosphorylation events are often mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors activated by growth factors or hormones in serum. To gain insight into the regulation of Tyr-940 phosphorylation, we expressed FLAG-tagged linker and HA-tagged Ext-DENN in cells, and after depriving cells of serum, or adding back serum following the deprivation, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments to measure the tyrosine phosphorylation on the linker and the corresponding intramolecular interaction. Interestingly, the interaction is stronger when the cells are deprived of serum compared with cells at steady state or those re-fed with serum (Fig. 2C). Moreover, as determined by a phosphotyrosine antibody, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated linker negatively correlated with the binding intensity (Fig. 2C), indicating that the tyrosine phosphorylation may be the cause of the suppression of the intramolecular interaction. These data reveal that there is an activity in serum, even at steady state, that evokes tyrosine phosphorylation on the linker of DENND3. Because ULK-mediated DENND3 phosphorylation at Ser-554 and Ser-572 increases DENND3 GEF activity (14Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we wondered whether there is cross-talk between this event and Tyr-940 phosphorylation. One potential model is that Tyr-940 phosphorylation opens the intramolecular interaction, allowing easier access for either ULK-mediated phosphorylation or 14-3-3 binding to the phosphorylated Ser-554/Ser-572 residues. One way to test this model was to determine whether the Y940D mutant that disrupts the intramolecular interaction alters 14-3-3 binding. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3A, when compared with wild type, the non-phosphorylatable DENND3 S554A mutant loses 14-3-3 binding, and GST-14-3-3 K50E, a mutant of 14-3-3 that suppresses the interaction between 14-3-3 and its binding partners (28Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. Raf-1 kinase and exoenzyme S interact with 14-3-3ζ through a common site involving lysine 49.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), does not bind to the phosphorylated substrate, which serves as a control for the 14-3-3 pulldown. 14-3-3 binding is unaltered when comparing the Y940D mutant to wild type or the Y940F mutant. Thus, the phosphorylation status of Tyr-940 does not lead to better access of 14-3-3 to DENND3. Moreover, ULK phosphorylation on DENND3 is equivalent when comparing wild-type protein to the Y940D and Y940F mutants (supplemental Fig. S3B). In summary, Tyr-940 is a key residue for regulating an intramolecular interaction between the linker region and the Ext-DENN region of DENND3. Phosphorylation of Tyr-940 is triggered by an activity in serum, and it appears that Tyr-940 phosphorylation is a separate process from ULK-mediated phosphorylation. The Y940F and Y940D mutants of DENND3 provide useful tools to test the hypothesis that Tyr-940 phosphorylation abolishes the intramolecular interaction leading to a conformation that is open to Rab12 (Fig. 3A). To test this concept, we first performed size-exclusion chromatography, which separates proteins and protein complexes by their native mass and hydrodynamic volume. As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type DENND3 elutes with a peak at fraction 27 on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column, the same as the globular marker ferritin, an ∼440-kDa oligomer consisting of 24 subunits. This is surprising because the molecular mass of DENND3 is ∼140 kDa, which is marked by the elution peak of GAPDH. This suggests DENND3 exists as an oligomer. Interestingly, the Y940D mutant peaked at an earlier fraction (fraction 23) (Fig. 3C). This is consistent with an open conformation providing a larger hydrodynamic radius (Stokes radius), leading to an apparently larger size and earlier elution than wild type (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the Y940F mutant had a similar elution profile as wild-type DENND3, likely reflecting the closed conformation (Fig. 3D). To further examine whether Y940D leads to an open conformation, we performed gradient centrifugation, which separates proteins based on protein mass and shape. As demonstrated in supplemental Fig. S4, in which the fractions are collected from the top of the gradient, wild-type DENND3 and Y940F mutant emerged and peaked in fraction 10 (supplemental Fig. S4, A and C), whereas Y940D emerged in fraction 8 (supplemental Fig. S4B). This would indicate an open conformation with a larger frictional coefficient. This further supports that the Tyr-940 phosphorylation alters DENND3 conformation. The data from size-exclusion chromatography and gradient centrifugation suggest that DENND3 exists as an oligomer, and consistently FLAG-tagged DENND3 robustly co-immunoprecipitates HA-tagged DENND3 (Fig. 4A). Because the linker interacts with Ext-DENN of DENND3, we wondered whether the intramolecular interaction is in fact an intermolecular interaction, as demonstrated in the hypothetical model of supplemental Fig. S5A. However, HA-tagged DENND3 Y940F and Y940D co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged DENND3 Y940F and Y940D to an equal extent as the wild-type proteins (supplemental Fig. S5B). These data demonstrate that the interaction between Tyr-940 in the linker and Ext-DENN, which is the hallmark of the intramolecular interaction, is not required for the oligomerization. We thus sought to map the region responsible for the oligomerization of DENND3 using co-immunoprecipitation of various domains of DENND3 tagged with FLAG and full-length DENND3 tagged with HA. Ext-DENN co-immunoprecipitated efficiently with full-length DENND3 (Fig. 4B), whereas neither the linker nor WD40 repeats co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, GST-tagged Ext-DENN co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Ext-DENN (Fig. 4E), supporting that Ext-DENN is sufficient to mediate the oligomerization, which is distinct from the intramolecular interaction. Size-exclusion chromatography further supports that Ext-DENN is sufficient for the oligomerization. As shown in Fig. 4F, Ext-DENN eluted at fractions corresponding to a molecular mass greater than the size of monomer of Ext-DENN (∼70 kDa). To further examine the role of Tyr-940 in the intramolecular interaction of DENND3, we turned to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. We generated constructs of DENND3 (minus the WD40 domain) with or without Tyr-940 mutations, flanked by fluorescent reporters Cerulean and Venus at the N and C termini, respectively (Fig. 5A). We transiently expressed these constructs and performed FRET imaging experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, the FRET signal with the Y940D mutation was suppressed compared with wild-type and the Y940F mutant, with the Y940F mutant displaying the greatest FRET signal. These data further support that the Tyr-940 phosphorylation suppresses the intramolecular interaction rendering DENND3 in an open conformation. To test whether the open conformation has greater GEF activity toward Rab12, we performed in vitro GEF assays. Overexpressed DENND3 proteins (wild type, Y940D, and Y940F) were immunoprecipitated from HEK-293T cells and added to purified Rab12 (preloaded with GDP) in the presence of [35S]GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 5D, the amount of GTP loaded on Rab12 was greater when Rab12 is incubated with the Y940D mutant compared with wild type. Moreover, the Y940F mutant was not able to promote GEF activity (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that the open conformation of DENND3 has greater GEF activity. We hypothesized that the increased GEF activity of the Tyr-940 mutant results from enhanced accessibility of Rab12 for the DENN domain when the intramolecular interaction is abolished. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that binding with nucleotide-free Rab is a hallmark of GEF domains, and we conducted a pulldown experiment using nucleotide-free GST-Rab12. As shown in supplemental Fig. S6, Rab12 binds to both FLAG-tagged full-length Ext-DENN and FLAG-Ext-DENN with deletion from residues 21 to 30, which does not interact with the linker region due to the deletion. Interestingly, addition of purified linker inhibited the binding of Rab12 to Ext-DENN but not the Ext-DENN with deletion. This indicates that the intramolecular interaction excludes Rab12 from accessing the DENN domain. We next explored whether there is a difference in subcellular localization between wild-type DENND3 and the Y940D mutation. As shown in the immunofluorescence experiments (supplemental Fig. S7A), expressed wild-type DENND3 has a cytosolic distribution, regardless of whether the FLAG tag is at the N or C terminus of the protein. The Y940D and Y940F mutants also display cytosolic localization, as does the S554A mutant, which no longer binds to 14-3-3 (14Xu J. Fotouhi M. McPherson P.S. Phosphorylation of the exchange factor DENND3 by ULK in response to starvation activates Rab12 and induces autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Considering that overexpression of the protein may contribute to the cytosolic pattern, we limited the expression level by reducing the duration of expression following transfection from 16 to 10 h. Under this condition, the wild-type DENND3 and its mutants still kept the cytosolic distribution, but a few fine puncta were observed within the cytosolic pool (supplemental Fig. S7A), which suggests some membrane-associated DENND3 was captured. Further subcellular fractionation experiments were employed to examine the membrane pool of DENND3. The post-nuclear supernatant of cell lysates was centrifuged at 200,000 × g to separate membrane fractions from cytosolic fractions. As shown in supplemental Fig. S7B, whereas RME-8, a peripheral membrane protein, and Na+K+-ATPase, an integral membrane protein, were found in the pellet and GAPDH, a cytosolic protein, was found in the supernatant, wild-type DENND3 is found in both fractions, as are the Y940D and Y940F mutants. This indicates that DENND3 has both membrane-associated and cytosolic pools, but there is seemingly no difference in the distributions of the wild type and mutants. Considering that the cytosolic pool may mask the membrane-associated pool in the immunocytochemical experiments, we pre-permeabilized the cells with saponin to release cytosolic DENND3 before fixing the cells for immunofluorescence experiments. As shown in supplemental Fig. S7C, after the pre-permeabilization the fluorescent signal from wild-type DENND3 and its mutants became faint. As a result, a few puncta emerged. However, the wild type and the Y940D/Y940F mutants still display the same pattern (supplemental Fig. S7C). Thus, based on the data of supplemental Fig. S7, A–C, the Y940D mutation does not facilitate the translocation of DENND3 to the membrane where the GEF activity is conducted. We consider that the recruitment of DENND3 to the membrane for activating Rab12 is a transient process. We pr"

Amine oxidase copper containing-3 (AOC3) is a cell-surface-expressed oxidase that regulates leukocyte extravasation. Here we analyzed the potential role of AOC3 using gene-modified and inhibitor-treated mice in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. Inflammation and fibrosis of lungs were assessed by histologic, flow cytometric, and quantitative PCR analysis. AOC3-deficient mice showed a 30-50% reduction in fibrosis, collagen synthesis, numbers of myofibroblasts, and accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes, NK T cells, macrophages, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells compared with wild-type control mice. AOC3-knock-in mice, which express a catalytically inactive form of AOC3, were also protected from lung fibrosis. In wild-type mice, a small-molecule AOC3 inhibitor treatment reduced leukocyte infiltration, myofibroblast differentiation, and fibrotic injury both in prophylactic and early therapeutic settings by about 50% but was unable to reverse the established fibrosis. AOC3 was also induced in myofibroblasts in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, the oxidase activity of AOC3 contributes to the development of lung fibrosis mainly by regulating the accumulation of pathogenic leukocyte subtypes, which drive the fibrotic response.-Marttila-Ichihara, F., Elima, K., Auvinen, K., Veres, T.

https://openalex.org/W2594579646,"Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of primary brain tumour, shows worse prognosis linked to diabetes or obesity persistence. These pathologies are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by altered profiles of inflammatory mediators, including leptin and secreted phospholipase A2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA). Both proteins, in turn, display diverse pro-cancer properties in different cell types, including astrocytes. Herein, to understand the underlying relationship between obesity and brain tumors, we investigated the effect of leptin, alone or in combination with sPLA2-IIA on astrocytoma cell functions. sPLA2-IIA induced up-regulation of leptin receptors in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. Leptin, as well as sPLA2-IIA, increased growth and migration in these cells, through activation/phosphorylation of key proteins of survival cascades. Leptin, at concentrations with minimal or no activating effects on astrocytoma cells, enhanced growth and migration promoted by low doses of sPLA2-IIA. sPLA2-IIA alone induced a transient phosphorylation pattern in the Src/ERK/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/rS6 pathway through EGFR transactivation, and co-addition of leptin resulted in a sustained phosphorylation of these signaling regulators. Mechanistically, EGFR transactivation and tyrosine- and serine/threonine-protein phosphatases revealed a key role in this leptin-sPLA2-IIA cross-talk. This cooperative partnership between both proteins was also found in primary astrocytes. These findings thus indicate that the adipokine leptin, by increasing the susceptibility of cells to inflammatory mediators, could contribute to worsen the prognosis of tumoral and neurodegenerative processes, being a potential mediator of some obesity-related medical complications."

In particular, attentional bias in facial affect processing after violent video game exposure continues to be controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate attentional bias in facial recognition after short term exposure to violent video games and to characterize the neural correlates of this effect. In order to accomplish this, participants were exposed to either neutral or violent video games for 25 min and then event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during two emotional search tasks. The first search task assessed attentional facilitation, in which participants were required to identify an emotional face from a crowd of neutral faces. In contrast, the second task measured disengagement, in which participants were required to identify a neutral face from a crowd of emotional faces. Our results found a significant presence of the ERP component, N2pc, during the facilitation task; however, no differences were observed between the two video game groups. This finding does not support a link between attentional facilitation and violent video game exposure. Comparatively, during the disengagement task, N2pc responses were not observed when participants viewed happy faces following violent video game exposure; however, a weak N2pc response was observed after neutral video game exposure. These results provided only inconsistent support for the disengagement hypothesis, suggesting that participants found it difficult to separate a neutral face from a crowd of emotional faces."
https://openalex.org/W2591742403,"Background Inclusion of vaccine herd-protection effects in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) can impact the CEAs-conclusions. However, empirical epidemiologic data on the size of herd-protection effects from original studies are limited. Methods We performed a quantitative comparative analysis of the impact of herd-protection effects in CEAs for four childhood vaccinations (pneumococcal, meningococcal, rotavirus and influenza). We considered CEAs reporting incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratios (ICERs) (per quality-adjusted-life-years [QALY] gained; per life-years [LY] gained or per disability-adjusted-life-years [DALY] avoided), both with and without herd protection, while keeping all other model parameters stable. We calculated the size of the ICER-differences without vs with-herd-protection and estimated how often inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of the cost-effectiveness threshold (of an assumed societal-willingness-to-pay) of $50,000 for more-developed countries or X3GDP/capita (WHO-threshold) for less-developed countries. Results We identified 35 CEA studies (20 pneumococcal, 4 meningococcal, 8 rotavirus and 3 influenza vaccines) with 99 ICER-analyses (55 per-QALY, 27 per-LY and 17 per-DALY). The median ICER-absolute differences per QALY, LY and DALY (without minus with herd-protection) were $15,620 (IQR: $877 to $48,376); $54,871 (IQR: $787 to $115,026) and $49 (IQR: $15 to $1,636) respectively. When the target-vaccination strategy was not cost-saving without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection always resulted in more favorable results. In CEAs that had ICERs above the cost-effectiveness threshold without herd-protection, inclusion of herd-protection led to crossing of that threshold in 45% of the cases. This impacted only CEAs for more developed countries, as all but one CEAs for less developed countries had ICERs below the WHO-cost-effectiveness threshold even without herd-protection. In several analyses, recommendation for the adoption of the target vaccination strategy depended on the inclusion of the herd protection effect. Conclusions Inclusion of herd-protection effects in CEAs had a substantial impact in the estimated ICERs and made target-vaccination strategies more attractive options in almost half of the cases where ICERs were above the societal-willingness to pay threshold without herd-protection. More empirical epidemiologic data are needed to determine the size of herd-protection effects across diverse settings and also the size of negative vaccine effects, e.g. from serotype substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2591823578,"Microbiota plays an important role in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the variations of the commensal microbiota composition is crucial for a more efficient control of enteric infectious diseases and for the reduction of the use of antibiotics in animal production, which are the main points of interest for improved animal healthcare and welfare and for consumer health protection. Even though the intestinal microbiota has been extensively studied, little is known about the gastric microbiota. This pilot study was aimed at a descriptive analysis of the gastric microbiota in healthy pigs and at the identification of any differences among four potentially distinct microbial niches in the stomach. Gastric mucosal samples from the oxyntic area, the pylorus and the gastric groove, and a sample of gastric contents were collected from four healthy weaned pigs. Bacterial DNA was isolated and extracted from each sample and amplicons from the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM. The data were analysed by an “unsupervised” and a “supervised” approach in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) pipeline. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all the samples. Differences in bacterial community composition were found between mucosal and content samples (one-way ANOSIM pairwise post hoc test, p < 0.05); instead, the different mucosal regions did not show differences between them. The mucosal samples were characterised by Herbiconiux and Brevundimonas, two genera which include cellulolytic and xylanolytic strains. Nevertheless, additional larger trials are needed to support the data presented in this pilot study and to increase the knowledge regarding the resident microbiota of the stomach."

It is uncertain whether the adverse effects of ESA therapy are related to dose and are mitigated when a fixed low ESA dose is used. We conducted a multicenter, prospective randomized open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) trial to evaluate fixed low versus high dose ESA therapy on patient outcomes. We intended to recruit 2104 hemodialysis patients >18 years with anemia or receiving ESA treated at dialysis clinics in Italy. The intervention was fixed low (4000 IU epoetin alfa equivalent weekly) or high (18,000 IU epoetin alfa equivalent weekly) dose ESA for 12 months. Primary outcomes were serum transferrin, ferritin, albumin, C-reactive protein and ESA dose. Secondary outcomes were the composite of death or cardiovascular event, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, and quality of life. Study recruitment was terminated after inclusion of 656 participants with convergence of ESA dose between groups during follow up. Fixed low dose ESA had uncertain effects on serum ferritin (delta of delta (DD) 3.9 ng/ml, 95% CI -85.0 to 92.8), transferrin (9.2 mg/dl, -6.3 to 24.8), transferrin saturation (3.7%, -5.0 to 12.3), serum albumin (-0.03 g/dl, -0.2 to 0.1), or C-reactive protein (-0.6 mg/l, -3.3 to 2.1). In addition, fixed dose therapy had inconclusive effects on the composite endpoint of mortality and cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37), death (0.98, 0.64 to 1.52), nonfatal myocardial infarction (0.52, 0.18 to 1.52), nonfatal stroke (no events), hospital admission for cardiovascular causes (0.93, 0.50 to 1.72) or health-related quality of life. A fixed low ESA dose in hemodialysis patients has uncertain effects on serum parameters, mortality, cardiovascular events, and quality of life.

Recently, genome-wide association studies have found 6p21.3, where the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is coded, to be a susceptibility risk region for CLL. Previous studies have produced discrepant results regarding the association between HLA and CLL development and outcome, but no studies have been performed on hiMBL.We evaluated the role of HLA class I (-A, -B and -C) and class II (-DRB1 and -DQB1) in hiMBL/CLL susceptibility, hiMBL progression to CLL, and treatment requirement in a large series of 263 patients diagnosed in our center with hiMBL (n = 156) or Binet A CLL (n = 107).No consistent association between HLA specificities and hiMBL or CLL susceptibility was found. With a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 48/156 hiMBLs (33%) evolved to asymptomatic CLLs, while 16 hiMBLs (10%) and 44 CLLs (41%) required treatment. No HLA specificities were found to be significantly associated with hiMBL progression or treatment in the whole cohort. However, within antigen-experienced immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGHV)-mutated hiMBLs, which represents the highest proportion of hiMBL cases (81%), the presence of HLA-DQB1*03 showed a trend to a higher risk of progression to CLL (60% vs. 26%, P = 0.062). Moreover, HLA-DQB1*02 specificity was associated with a lesser requirement for 15-year treatment (10% vs. 36%, P = 0.012).In conclusion, our results suggest a role for HLA in IGHV-mutated hiMBL prognosis, and are consistent with the growing evidence of the influence of 6p21 on predisposition to CLL. Larger non-biased series are required to enable definitive conclusions to be drawn."
