https://openalex.org/W1985773459,"YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) films have been grown epitaxially on SrTiO(3) (100) and LaAlO(3) (100) substrates with nearly pure a-axis orientation and with transition temperature T(c) (R = 0) of 85 K. A unique feature of these films is their smooth surface. These smooth surfaces enable the growth of short-period superlattices with well-defined modulations. The films are untwinned and the grains grow with their c-axis along one of two perpendicular directions on the substrate ([100] or [010]). The fabrication of sandwich-type Josephson junctions with good characteristics may now be possible because unlike c-axis-oriented films, the superconducting coherence length of these smooth films is appreciably large perpendicular to their surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2093920789,"Fusion plasmas with reactorlike temperatures have been confined in magnetic-field configurations of the tokamak type. The measured rate of heat leakage from these plasmas is sufficiently small to be compatible with the requirements of a full-sized fusion power reactor. Improvements in other aspects of reactor performance are still needed, however, and the high cost of reactor- development steps has become an obstacle on the path to practical fusion power."

https://openalex.org/W2053022353,"What can the researcher do to protect his ideas? Here the saying ""It is a wise father that knows his own child"" is applicable. Can a present-day researcher be sure that an idea is really his brain child? Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that this is possible; then his safest procedure is to keep that idea to himself until it can be submitted in a protectable package. Most universities and other non-profit research institutions lack patent policies sufficiently broad to be of much assistance to either the researcher or the institution. Possibly the first needed step in increasing the protection of research is a broadening of institutional patent policies to embrace property in ideas, even though ideas may not at present be patentable. Secondly, information regarding what institutions can do to assist in achieving protection of ideas should be disseminated as widely as possible. Thirdly, liaison should be established between the institution and Research Incorporated (32), or some similar nonprofit organization serving the educational community, in order that the developmental aspect of the idea may be guided at an early stage, so that when it is presented for commercial evaluation it will be in a protectable package and appropriately wrapped."
