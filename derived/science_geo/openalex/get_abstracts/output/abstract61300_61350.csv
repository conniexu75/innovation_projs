https://openalex.org/W1931618829,"Abstract The preparation, purification, and analysis of a variety of new sulfonium derivatives of methionine is reported. Deamination of S-adenosyl-l-methionine with nitrous acid yielded, depending on experimental conditions, S-adenosyl l-(2-hydroxy-4-methylthio)butyric acid or S-inosyl-l-(2-hydroxy-4-methylthio)butyric acid. S-Inosyl-l-methionine was obtained by enzymatic deamination of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine to S-inosyl-l-homocysteine and methylation of the latter by methyl iodide. 4-Dimethylsulfonium-l-(2hydroxy)butyric acid has been prepared from S-methyl-l-methionine sulfonium salt. The sulfonium derivatives were purified by ion exchange chromatography and were characterized by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, paper and thin layer chromatography, electrophoresis, and hydrolysis to known fragments. The new methionine sulfonium derivatives and S-adenosyl-(5')-3-methylthiopropylamine were investigated as methyl donors and as inhibitors with three purified methyltransferases: histamine methyltransferase, acetylserotonin methyltransferase, and homocysteine methyltransferase. The replacement of the 2-amino group of the methionine moiety by the hydroxyl group resulted in complete loss of activity in all systems investigated; these deaminated derivatives were also inactive as inhibitors of S-adenosyl-l-methionine in the transmethylations. The methyl donor capacity of inosine derivatives and of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine ranged between inactivity and an effect equal to that of the biological methyl donor. Homocysteine methyltransferase was the least specific of the three enzymes. Experiments with S-inosylmethionine, racemic with respect to the sulfonium pole, established that both sulfonium diastereoisomers were utilized in the methylation of homocysteine. S-Adenosyl-l-homocysteine was found to be a very effective inhibitor of the systems investigated; the enzymatic removal of its amino group in the adenine part led to Sinosylhomocysteine, which was without effect as an inhibitor. 5'-Methylthioadenosine, a catabolite of S-adenosylmethionine, inhibited the methylation of histamine and acetylserotonin. On the basis of these results, three binding sites for S-adenosylmethionine on the methyl transfer enzymes may be postulated."

https://openalex.org/W1516942594,"Abstract Synthesis of l-asparagine was detected in extracts of Escherichia coli K-12 only under conditions where either the amount of asparaginase II was greatly lowered or else its activity was inhibited by 5-diazo-4-oxo-l-norvaline (DONV). Asparagine synthetase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the amino acid, was lacking in extracts of an auxotrophic mutant which required asparagine. Asparagine repressed the formation of the synthetase, but at a rather high concentration, possibly because asparagine is not readily concentrated by the bacterial cell. A genetic locus for the production of asparagine synthetase (for which we propose the name asn) was found to be between the 73rd and 74th min of the E. coli chromosome by conjugation and transduction experiments. Asparagine synthetase was purified 370-fold from a mutant of E. coli impaired in its ability to form asparaginase II. In order to diminish the amount of residual asparaginase further, extracts were made of this mutant after it was osmotically shocked. The synthetase had a molecular weight of about 80,000; it was stabilized by 2-mercaptoethanol and by 10% glycerol. The synthesis of asparagine required aspartate, ATP-Mg2+, and ammonia, and resulted in the stoichiometric production of pyrophosphate and AMP. Glutamine did not serve as a source of amide nitrogen. The pH optimum was 8.4. The enzyme preparation, shown to be free of aspartyl transfer RNA synthetase, in the absence of added ammonia also catalyzed an aspartate-dependent pyrophosphate exchange with ATP, which was inhibited by asparagine. β-Aspartyl hydroxamate was formed in incubations with hydroxylamine."
https://openalex.org/W1544146860,"Abstract Two transfer factors, designated FIs and FIu, which are required for the guanosine triphosphate-dependent, messenger RNA-directed binding of aminoacyl transfer RNA to ribosomes, are also required for maximal interaction with GTP to form a complex that is retained by a nitrocellulose filter. This complex subsequently interacts with aminoacyl-tRNA to form a second complex that is not retained by a nitrocellulose filter and that can be recovered from the filtrate by gel filtration. This second complex is composed of aminoacyl-tRNA, GTP, and the heat-labile transfer factor, FIu. The GTP moiety of the complex does not exchange with GTP or other guanine nucleotides even at 37°; however, the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the complex dissociates and exchanges with other aminoacyl-tRNAs at 25° or 37° but does not rapidly exchange at 0°. At 0° preferential binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the complex to ribosomes can be demonstrated in the presence of free aminoacyl-tRNA. These data provide evidence that the aminoacyl-tRNA-GTP-FIu complex is an intermediate in the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. The binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the complex to ribosomes is inhibited by chlortetracycline but not by deacylated tRNA. In contrast, nonenzymatic binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes is inhibited by deacylated tRNA but not by chlortetracycline. The binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA moiety of the complex to ribosomes occurs with the concomitant formation of Pi and a third complex composed of FIu and GDP. This FIu-GDP complex is retained by a nitrocellulose filter but does not appear to be bound to the ribosomal complex."

https://openalex.org/W1498781822,"Abstract Chicken pepsinogen was extracted from the forestomach of chicken and purified by the consecutive application of acetone precipitation, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The purified pepsinogen was homogeneous on disc electrophoresis and sedimented as monodisperse material. Chicken pepsin was obtained by the activation of the pure zymogen at pH 1.8. It was separated by gel filtration from the peptides split off during activation. It was found by amino acid analyses in conjunction with molecular weight determinations that chicken pepsinogen is composed of 387 and chicken pepsin of 308 amino acid residues. The amino acid composition of the peptide fraction split off during activation accounts for the difference between zymogen and enzyme. The amino acid composition of chicken pepsin shows that it is a less acidic protein than other pepsins so far investigated. Chicken pepsin contains 39 free carboxyl groups and 16 basic groups, whereas swine pepsin (EC 3.4.4.1) contains 40 free carboxyl and only 6 basic groups. The carboxyl-terminal sequence common to chicken pepsinogen and pepsin is Leu-Ser and a proline residue apparently occupies the third or fourth position from the carboxyl terminus. Determinations of amino-terminal residues failed to reveal the amino terminus of the zymogen whereas a seryl residue was found to be amino-terminal in the enzyme. Lysine was the sole amino-terminal residue found in the peptide fraction split from the zymogen during activation. Both chicken pepsinogen and chicken pepsin contain one sulfhydryl group per molecule. The sulfhydryl group in the zymogen reacted with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at pH 7.3 in solutions containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, but not in solutions in phosphate buffer or in 8 m urea. The sulfhydryl group of the enzyme reacted with 5,1'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) without addition of detergent. The sulfhydryl group and the two carboxyl-terminal residues are not essential for the enzymic activity of chicken pepsin. It was thus found that the chicken pepsin derivative obtained by reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) retained 86% of the enzymic activity. The chicken pepsin derivative obtained by the removal of the two carboxyl-terminal amino acids retained 81% of the enzymic activity. This derivative of chicken pepsin seems, however, to undergo autolysis more readily than the native enzyme. Chicken pepsinogen is stable at 24° below pH 10.5, and chicken pepsin is stable below pH 8. At pH 8.5 and above chicken pepsin is rapidly inactivated, and inactivation at 40° and pH 8.5 is accompanied by autolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1600838929,"The kinetic mechanism of action of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli, strain B, was investigated from initial rate studies. The kinetic data are consistent with a sequential mechanism for the enzyme. A rapid equilibrium, fully random mechanism was found to be in harmony with the kinetic findings from studies with competitive and product inhibitors. This result serves to explain why partial exchange reactions are not observed with adenylosuccinate synthetase. It is not, however, possible to ascertain the nature of the catalytic transition state. It was observed that competitive inhibitors for a single substrate acted as noncompetitive inhibitors relative to the other substrates. Similarly, guanosine diphosphate functions as a competitive product inhibitor of GTP, but shows noncompetitive inhibition patterns for inosine monophosphate and aspartate. Adenylosuccinate was found to be competitive with respect to IMP and noncompetitive relative to the other substrates. A procedure is presented for replotting initial rate data for three-substrate systems which permits a choice of mechanism to be made from among sequential mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1547158622,"Abstract Carbamyl phosphate synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium LT-2 has been purified 320-fold; the modulation of enzyme activity by substrate concentration, effectors, and the effect of temperature on this modulation have been studied. Uridine phosphate inhibits the enzymic reaction; ornithine reverses this inhibition and also activates the enzyme in the absence of UMP by decreasing the apparent Km for ATP. The stimulation by ornithine is greater at low temperature, whereas the inhibitory effect of UMP is equal at high and low temperatures. Studies with various strains blocked by mutation in steps which interconvert cytosineand uracil-containing compounds have established that the pyrimidine repressor of the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate synthetase is a cytosine-containing compound."

https://openalex.org/W1585600935,"A procedure is described for the preparation in homogeneous form of the neurotoxin found in cultures of Clostridium botulinum type B. The toxin is a protein of molecular weight 167,000 and consists of at least two subunits. The molecular weights of the subunits are approximately 59,000 and 104,000. The toxin is irreversibly inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetic acid, and iodoacetamide. The protein contains a large proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, especially isoleucine and tryptophan. Fluorescence studies on the toxin show that all of the tryptophan residues are probably located in highly apolar environments."
https://openalex.org/W1545434090,"Asparagine synthetase, purified 370-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli K-12, catalyzed the transfer of oxygen from 18O-labeled aspartate to AMP. No 18O was found in the pyrophosphate produced in the reaction. Initial velocities of asparagine synthesis were obtained when the concentrations of two of the three substrates, aspartate, ATP, and ammonia, were varied; the third substrate was kept constant. A parallel initial velocity pattern was seen when the concentration of either aspartate and ammonia, or ATP and ammonia, was varied. On the other hand, an intersecting initial velocity pattern was seen when aspartate and ATP were the variable substrates. These results supported a two-step reaction mechanism involving an aspartyl enzyme intermediate. The kinetics of product inhibition ruled out any obligatory order of addition of aspartate and ATP. Kinetic studies of the pyrophosphate-ATP exchange catalyzed by the synthetase confirmed the random order of substrate addition. A general rate equation for this exchange reaction is presented. We could not show directly that substrates bind to the enzyme. Nevertheless an indication of binding was obtained since a combination of either aspartate and ATP-Mg2+ or asparagine and AMP-Mg2+ greatly protected the enzyme from inactivation both by iodoacetamide and by heat."

https://openalex.org/W1618824054,"Abstract The DNA ligase from Escherichia coli forms an intermediate enzyme-bound complex with the AMP moiety of DPN+ (ligase-AMP). Detection of this complex was the basis for a simple new assay used in a revised, more extensive purification of the enzyme. Ligase-AMP made from the most highly purified enzyme fraction readily converts to two new chromatographically distinguishable forms (I and II) which differ from the original form (Form III) in their functional capacities. Only Form III is active in the routine DNA joining assay previously described. All three forms discharge their AMP residue in reaction with nicotinamide mononucleotide. Form I does not discharge its AMP residue with DNA bearing single strand interruptions, whereas Form II does so only with much higher DNA concentrations than those that discharge the third form. Gel filtration suggests that Form I has a molecular weight of 5 x 104 daltons compared with 10 x 104 daltons for the other forms."

https://openalex.org/W1503789581,"Abstract The wild type and all mutant α chains of tryptophan synthetase tested can, following denaturation-renaturation, enter into stable dimeric structures. Only certain combinations of mutant α chains yield dimers which have the enzymatic activity which the mutant monomers lack. Most α chains with mutational alterations in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule will complement most α chains that are altered in the COOH-terminal half. One of the five fragments generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the α chain complements (restores activity to) an intact mutant α chain. The site of the amino acid change in the mutant subunit is overlapped by the sequence in the fragment. Some fragments of the α chain generated by the presence of a nonsense (ochre) codon in the structural gene for the α chain are able to complement appropriate intact mutant α chains. The relative size of two such fragments is consistent with the map position of the nonsense codons. The presence of large amounts of other Escherichia coli proteins in the urea solution from which α chain dimers are recovered has only a small effect on the ability of α chains to renature as monomers. Similarly, there is little effect of nonspecific protein on the ability of mutant α chains to form functional dimers. In contrast, the β2 subunit of tryptophan synthetase appears to have a specific effect upon both α chain dimer formation and renaturation of the α monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1547779977,"Abstract Holo acyl carrier protein synthetase transfers 4'-phosphopantetheine from reduced coenzyme A to acyl carrier protein (ACP) apoprotein to form ACP holoprotein (holo-ACP). The specificity of this enzyme was tested by using apopeptides derived from ACP. The apopeptides were derived from holopeptides, those containing 4'-phosphopantetheine, by the mild and specific action of 60% hydrofluoric acid. Holo-ACP, when treated with 60% HF, yielded ACP apoprotein (apo-ACP) which was completely converted to holo-ACP by the action of holo-ACP synthetase. In addition the optical rotatory dispersion curves for apo- and holo-ACP are quite similar, further supporting the contention that 60% HF treatment causes little or no structural damage to apo-ACP. Apopeptides consisting of Residues 7 through 77 or 19 through 61 were inactive with the enzyme. The corresponding holopeptides are also inactive in fatty acid synthesis. Apopeptide 1 through 74 is readily converted to holopeptide which is fully active in fatty acid synthesis. It is concluded that the same site (or sites) and structure of ACP are critical in interactions with enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis or with enzymes involved in the addition and removal of the prosthetic group."

https://openalex.org/W1601214593,"Abstract Deoxycytidylate deaminase from T4+-infected Escherichia coli has been purified approximately 3000-fold. Under optimal conditions it deaminates 245 µmoles of deoxycytidine monophosphate per mg of protein per min. The enzyme requires either deoxycytidine triphosphate or 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine triphosphate for activity and is inhibited by deoxythymidine triphosphate. Kinetic studies indicate that the Michaelis constant for the substrate, deoxycytidine monophosphate, is not altered by the activator, and that the inhibitor competes with the activator at some site on the enzyme distal to the substrate site. By the criteria of disc electrophoresis and equilibrium sedimentation, more than one protein species is present. Centrifugation of the purified enzyme through a sucrose gradient in the presence or absence of either or both of the effectors reveals a major peak of activity with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.3 S and a minor peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 10.8 S. Molecular weights for these two species calculated in reference to catalase are 129,000 and 230,000, respectively. Since only the peak corresponding to 7.3 S is present at an earlier stage in the purification, the heavier form of the enzyme must be introduced during the subsequent steps of the purification."

Protonation of purified l-arabinose isomerase at pH 2.0 or treatment with 8 m urea results in the dissociation of the native enzyme into subunits which are homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and which migrate as a single band on disc eletrophoresis in acrylamide gel containing urea. Physical characterization of the subunits has yielded an s020,w of 2.85 x 10-13 sec with a significant dependence of the sedimentation coefficient on protein concentration. The molecular weight, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, is 6.0 ± 0.26 x 104, indicating 6 identical subunits per molecule of native enzyme. No defined dissociation intermediates corresponding to dimers or trimers were detected by either protonation or treatment with 8 m urea. The identity of the subunits was substantiated by peptide mapping of cyanogen bromide-cleaved, performic acid-oxidized, 14C-carbamylated enzyme. The amino acid composition of the native enzyme includes 95.4 moles of methionine per 363,000 g of enzyme; after cyanogen bromide cleavage, a total of 18 to 19 peptides was detected by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, high voltage electrophoresis, and descending chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1526745244,"Abstract Cystathionine γ-synthase is a pyridoxal-P enzyme which catalyzes replacement of the succinyl group of O-succinyl-homoserine by cysteine. In the absence of cysteine, succinate is rapidly eliminated to form α-ketobutyrate. O-Succinylserine has been synthesized. The succinyl group underwent a slow replacement by homocysteine to yield cystathionine and a rapid elimination, in the absence of a mercaptoamino acid, to yield pyruvate. Thus the enzyme can catalyze the whole spectrum of elimination and replacement reactions of β- and γ-substituted amino acids. While catalyzing pyruvate formation from succinylserine, the enzyme became partially inhibited. The inhibition is similar to that of threonine dehydrase by serine, but it is more rapidly reversible and responds differently to changes in pH. A modified procedure has also been described for preparing pure cystathionine γ-synthase from Salmonella."

https://openalex.org/W1591937212,"Abstract The normally monomeric α subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase forms dimers and higher order aggregates following exposure to high urea concentrations and removal of the urea by dialysis. The maximum yield of α chain dimers is approximately 2%. Dimers of certain combinations of different enzymatically inactive mutant α monomers exhibit the missing enzymatic activity. In such heterologous dimers, the reconstituted active site has at least 50% of the activity of the active site of the native wild type α monomer. α chain dimers form an enzymatically active complex with the tryptophan synthetase β2 subunit. However, an α chain dimer can bind only a single β2 molecule. The α chain dimer dissociates into α monomers when heated at 51°. A tentative model of the structure of an α chain dimer is presented."
