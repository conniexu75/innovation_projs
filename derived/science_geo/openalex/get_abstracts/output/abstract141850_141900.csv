https://openalex.org/W1982022033,"Bone marrow stem cells develop into hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages but have not been known to participate in production of hepatocytes, biliary cells, or oval cells during liver regeneration. Cross-sex or cross-strain bone marrow and whole liver transplantation were used to trace the origin of the repopulating liver cells. Transplanted rats were treated with 2-acetylaminofluorene, to block hepatocyte proliferation, and then hepatic injury, to induce oval cell proliferation. Markers for Y chromosome, dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme, and L21-6 antigen were used to identify liver cells of bone marrow origin. From these cells, a proportion of the regenerated hepatic cells were shown to be donor-derived. Thus, a stem cell associated with the bone marrow has epithelial cell lineage capability."

The average molecular weight of the specific polymer studied, polyethyleneoxide-polyethylethylene (EO40-EE37), is several times greater than that of typical phospholipids in natural membranes. Both the membrane bending and area expansion moduli of electroformed polymersomes (polymer-based liposomes) fell within the range of lipid membrane measurements, but the giant polymersomes proved to be almost an order of magnitude tougher and sustained far greater areal strain before rupture. The polymersome membrane was also at least 10 times less permeable to water than common phospholipid bilayers. The results suggest a new class of synthetic thin-shelled capsules based on block copolymer chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W2106582614,"Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is characterized by multiple, bilateral papillary renal carcinomas. Previously, we demonstrated missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene in HPRC and a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. In this study, we screened a large panel of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas and various solid tumors for mutations in the MET proto-oncogene. Summarizing these and previous results, mutations of the MET proto-oncogene were detected in 17/129 sporadic papillary renal carcinomas but not in other solid tumors. We detected five novel missense mutations; three of five mutations were located in the ATP-binding region of the tyrosine kinase domain of MET. One novel mutation in MET, V1110I, was located at a codon homologous to an activating mutation in the c-erbB proto-oncogene. These mutations caused constitutive phosphorylation of MET when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these activating mutations interfere with the intrasteric mechanism of tyrosine kinase autoinhibition and facilitate transition to the active form of the MET kinase. The low frequency of MET mutations in noninherited papillary renal carcinomas (PRC) suggests that noninherited PRC may develop by a different mechanism than hereditary papillary renal carcinoma."

After 2 years the growth rate of the dominant pine trees increased by about 26 percent relative to trees under ambient conditions. Carbon dioxide enrichment also increased litterfall and fine-root increment. These changes increased the total net primary production by 25 percent. Such an increase in forest net primary production globally would fix about 50 percent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. The response of this young, rapidly growing forest to carbon dioxide may represent the upper limit for forest carbon sequestration."

https://openalex.org/W2135672633,"At any given instant, multiple potential targets for saccades are present in the visual world, implying that a “selection process” within the brain determines the target of the next eye movement. Some superior colliculus (SC) neurons begin discharging seconds before saccade initiation, suggesting involvement in target selection or, alternatively, in postselectional saccade preparation. SC neurons were recorded in monkeys who selected saccade targets on the basis of motion direction in a visual display. Some neurons carried a direction-selective visual signal, consistent with a role in target selection in this task, whereas other SC neurons appeared to be more involved in postselection specification of saccade parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2317234826,"Experimental evidence from several sources has identified a link between mismatch repair deficiency and cytotoxic drug resistance. Selection for cisplatin resistance in the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780, results in loss of expression of the mismatch repair protein hMLH1 in most (90%) of the resultant cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Here we demonstrate that the cisplatin sensitive parental cell line displays methylation of the promoter of only one hMLH1 allele, but that the resistant cell lines all exhibit hyper-methylation of the promoters of both hMLH1 alleles. Full methylation of all sites tested was found to be invariably associated with loss of hMLH1 expression, whereas a partial increase in methylation appears compatible with either loss or maintenance of expression. In addition treatment of two of the resistant cell lines with 5-azacytidine, a known inhibitor of methylation, results in re-expression of hMLH1. Clonogenic assays demonstrate that the 5-azacytidine treated cells show increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Furthermore, 12.5% (3/24) of ovarian tumours show hypermethylation of the hMLH1 promoter. Expression of hMLH1 is absent in the tumours that are hypermethylated, while all the unmethylated tumours still express the protein. This analysis suggests that methylation of the hMLH1 promoter may be a common mechanism for loss of hMLH1 expression, and possibly for cisplatin-resistance, in ovarian cancer."

Nonselective transfer to surrogate mothers of embryos in the GFP series generated about 20 percent offspring expressing the integrated transgene. These data indicate that exogenous DNA can reproducibly be delivered into an oocyte by microinjected spermatozoa and suggest an adaptable method of transgenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1544941962,"Odors are coded by glomerular activity patterns in the insect antennal lobe (AL) and in the mammalian olfactory bulb. We measured glomerular responses to 30 different odors in the AL of honeybees using calcium-sensitive dyes. By subsequently staining glomeruli and identifying individual glomerular outlines, we were able to compare the patterns between animals. Regardless of whether the odors were mixtures or pure substances, environmental odors or pheromones, their representations were highly conserved among individuals. Therefore, it may be possible to create a functional atlas of the AL in which particular molecular receptive ranges are attributed to each glomerulus."
https://openalex.org/W2138489013,The structure of a highly conserved complex between a 58-nucleotide domain of large subunit ribosomal RNA and the RNA-binding domain of ribosomal protein L11 has been solved at 2.8 angstrom resolution. It reveals a precisely folded RNA structure that is stabilized by extensive tertiary contacts and contains an unusually large core of stacked bases. A bulge loop base from one hairpin of the RNA is intercalated into the distorted major groove of another helix; the protein locks this tertiary interaction into place by binding to the intercalated base from the minor groove side. This direct interaction with a key ribosomal RNA tertiary interaction suggests that part of the role of L11 is to stabilize an unusual RNA fold within the ribosome.

For slightly underdoped samples, a uniform shift of several Kelvin in the critical temperature was observed, whereas for more underdoped samples, an insulating state was induced. This transition from superconducting to insulating behavior does not involve chemical or crystalline modification of the material."
https://openalex.org/W2079788829,"Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is a pancreatic beta cell autoantigen in humans and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. beta Cell-specific suppression of GAD expression in two lines of antisense GAD transgenic NOD mice prevented autoimmune diabetes, whereas persistent GAD expression in the beta cells in the other four lines of antisense GAD transgenic NOD mice resulted in diabetes, similar to that seen in transgene-negative NOD mice. Complete suppression of beta cell GAD expression blocked the generation of diabetogenic T cells and protected islet grafts from autoimmune injury. Thus, beta cell-specific GAD expression is required for the development of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice, and modulation of GAD might, therefore, have therapeutic value in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2164255733,"In several experiments, it was found that global perception of spatial form can arise exclusively from unpredictable but synchronized changes among local features. Within an array of nonoverlapping apertures, contours move in one of two directions, with direction reversing randomly over time. When contours within a region of the array reverse directions in synchrony, they stand out conspicuously from the rest of the array where direction reversals are unsynchronized. Clarity of spatial structure from synchronized change depends on the rate of motion reversal and on the proportion of elements reversing direction in synchrony. Evidently, human vision is sensitive to the rich temporal structure in these stochastic events."
https://openalex.org/W1994644266,"RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1; also called FRAP or mTOR) is a member of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-related family of proteins and functions as the in vivo mediator of the effects of the immunosuppressant rapamycin and as an important regulator of messenger RNA translation. In mammalian cells RAFT1 interacted with gephyrin, a widely expressed protein necessary for the clustering of glycine receptors at the cell membrane of neurons. RAFT1 mutants that could not associate with gephyrin failed to signal to downstream molecules, including the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase and the eIF-4E binding protein, 4E-BP1. The interaction with gephyrin ascribes a function to the large amino-terminal region of an ATM-related protein and reveals a role in signal transduction for the clustering protein gephyrin."
https://openalex.org/W2006060912,"Carbon isotopes in fossil emu ( Dromaius novaehollandiae ) eggshell from Lake Eyre, South Australia, demonstrate that the relative abundance of C 4 grasses varied substantially during the past 65,000 years. Currently, C 4 grasses are more abundant in regions that are increasingly affected by warm-season precipitation. Thus, an expansion of C 4 grasses likely reflects an increase in the relative effectiveness of the Australian summer monsoon, which controls summer precipitation over Lake Eyre. The data imply that the Australian monsoon was most effective between 45,000 and 65,000 years ago, least effective during the Last Glacial Maximum, and moderately effective during the Holocene."

https://openalex.org/W2059086372,"The mammalian hippocampus contains the neural circuitry that is crucial for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The development of such circuitry is dependent on the generation and correct placement of the appropriate number and types of neurons. Mice lacking function of the LIM homeobox gene Lhx5 showed a defect in hippocampus development. Hippocampal neural precursor cells were specified and proliferated, but many of them failed to either exit the cell cycle or to differentiate and migrate properly. Lhx5 is therefore essential for the regulation of precursor cell proliferation and the control of neuronal differentiation and migration during hippocampal development."

https://openalex.org/W2312957642,"The p73beta protein shares structural and functional similarities with the tumor suppressor gene product p53. Both proteins activate transcription from p53-responsive promoters. p53's activity is antagonized by the mdm2 protein (also termed hdm2 in human cells). Complex formation between p53 and mdm2 results in p53's transcriptional inactivation and destabilization. Here we show that overexpression of mdm2 reduces p73beta's ability to activate transcription, too. The mdm2 protein forms a specific complex with p73beta in vitro with an efficiency comparable to p53-binding. Further, both p73beta and p53 relocalize a transport-defective mutant of mdm2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, arguing that complex formation occurs in vivo as well. Mutational analysis suggests that the interaction between p73beta and mdm2 follows structural principles analogous to the p53-mdm2-complex. Whereas p53 is destabilized in the presence of mdm2, the amount of intracellular p73beta was not detectably reduced by mdm2. The carboxyterminal RING finger domain of mdm2 was found to be required to reduce the intracellular abundance of p53, but it was dispensable for transcriptionally inactivating either p53 or p73beta. Our results suggest that the autoregulatory feedback loop between p53 and mdm2 also controls p73's activity, but that mdm2-mediated protein degradation is unique to p53."

https://openalex.org/W2071456270,"Coligation of paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIR-B) with B cell antigen receptor (BCR) blocks antigen-induced B cell activation. This inhibition is mediated in part by recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the phosphorylated ITIMs in the cytoplasmic domain of PIR-B; however the molecular target(s) of these phosphatases remain elusive. Here we show that PIR-B ligation inhibits the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Igalpha/Igbeta, Syk, Btk and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma2. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of SHP-1 prevents the PIR-B-mediated inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, Btk, and PLC-gamma2. Dephosphorylation of Syk and Btk mediated by SHP-1 leads to a decrease of their kinase activity, which in turn inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2. Furthermore, we define a requirement for Lyn in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of PIR-B. Based on these results, we propose a model of PIR-B-mediated inhibitory signaling in which coligation of PIR-B and BCR results in phosphorylation of ITIMs by Lyn, subsequent recruitment of SHP-1, and a resulting inhibition of the BCR-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation by dephosphorylation of Syk and Btk."

https://openalex.org/W2065406177,"Initiation of DNA replication requires the function of MCM gene products, which participate in ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once in the cell cycle. Expression of all mammalian genes of the MCM family is induced by growth stimulation, unlike yeast, and the mRNA levels peak at G1/S boundary. In this study, we examined the transcriptional activities of isolated human MCM gene promoters. Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters with mutation in the E2F sites failed in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous E2F expression. In addition, we identified a novel E2F-like sequence in human MCM6 promoter which cooperates with the authentic E2F sites in E2F-dependent regulation. Forced expression of E2F1 could induce expression of all members of the endogenous MCM genes in rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells. Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes, and presumably other MCM members, is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to multiple E2F sites in the promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1995425786,Observations by the Galileo spacecraft and the Keck telescope showed that Jupiter's outermost (gossamer) ring is actually two rings circumscribed by the orbits of the small satellites Amalthea and Thebe. The gossamer rings' unique morphology-especially the rectangular end profiles at the satellite's orbit and the enhanced intensities along the top and bottom edges of the rings-can be explained by collisional ejecta lost from the inclined satellites. The ejecta evolves inward under Poynting-Robertson drag. This mechanism may also explain the origin of Jupiter's main ring and suggests that faint rings may accompany all small inner satellites of the other jovian planets.

The POC:SCOC ratio decreased by 52 to 59 percent between 1989 and 1996. A possible explanation for this trend is the documented sea surface temperature increase and concomitant plankton biomass decrease in the eastern North Pacific, resulting in an apparent reduction in POC export from surface waters to the deep ocean. Continuation of this trend could profoundly impact geochemical cycling as well as the structure and dynamics of deep-sea communities."
https://openalex.org/W2318686332,"Tumors of the endocrine pancreas are extremely rare, and molecular mechanisms leading to their development are not well understood. A candidate tumor suppressor gene, DPC4, located at 18q21, has recently been shown to be inactivated in half of pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts. The close anatomical relationship of the exocrine and endocrine pancreas prompted us to determine the role of DPC4 in the tumorigenesis of 25 pancreatic islet cell tumors (11 insulinomas, nine non-functioning endocrine carcinomas, three gastrinomas, two vipomas). A mutation screening of the highly conserved COOH-terminal domain of DPC4 (exons 8-11) was performed by single-strand conformational variant (SSCP) analysis and a PCR-based deletion assay. Five of nine (55%) non-functioning endocrine pancreatic carcinomas revealed either point mutations, small intragenic deletions or homozygous deletion of DPC4 sequences compared to none of the insulinomas, gastrinomas or vipomas. These results suggest that DPC4 is an important target gene promoting tumorigenesis of non-functioning neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2023258120,"The novel synthetic retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (CD437) has been shown to induce apoptosis in various tumor cell lines including human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells, which are resistant to the natural all-trans retinoic acid and to many synthetic receptor-selective retinoids. Although the mechanism of this effect was not elucidated, it was found to be independent of nuclear retinoid receptors. In the present study, we analysed the mechanisms by which CD437 induces apoptosis in two human NSCLC cell lines: H460 with wild-type p53 and H1792 with mutant p53. Both cell lines underwent apoptosis after exposure to CD437, although the cell line with wild-type p53 (H460) was more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis. CD437 increased the activity of caspase in both cell lines, however, the effect was much more pronounced in the H460 cells. The caspase inhibitors (Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-VAD-FMK) suppressed CD437-induced CPP32-like caspase activation and apoptosis in both cell lines. CD437 induced the expression of the p53 gene and its target genes, p21, Bax, and Killer/DR5, only in the H460 cells. These results suggest that CD437-induced apoptosis is more extensive in NSCLC cells that express wild-type p53, possibly due to the involvement of the p53 regulated genes Killer/DR5, and Bax although CD437 can also induce apoptosis by means of a p53-independent mechanism. Both pathways of CD437-induced apoptosis appear to involve activation of CPP32-like caspase."
https://openalex.org/W2324799005,"Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein can lead to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Several functional domains necessary for mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53 have been mapped, e.g., the proline-rich domain. The proline-rich domain is located within residues 60-90, which comprise five PXXP motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid). To further delineate the function of the proline-rich domain and its potential role in transactivation, we generated several groups of cell lines that inducibly express various p53 mutants using a tetracycline-regulated expression system. We found that p53(delta62-91), which lacks all five PXXP motifs in human p53, is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis, while p53(gln22-ser23/delta62-91), which contains a double point mutation in the activation domain as well as deletion of the proline-rich domain, completely loses its activity. However, p53(delta74-91), which contains only one PXXP motif at its N-terminus, is not only capable of inducing cell cycle arrest but also retains a partial apoptotic activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of the proline-rich region has no or very mild effects on activation of several transiently transfected p53 target gene promoters, i.e., the p21, MDM2, BAX, and GADD45 promoters. However, such deletion differentially affects p53 induction of endogenous target genes, i.e., induction of p21, MDM2, BTG2, p85, PIG3, PIG6 and PIG11 was reduced or abrogated but induction of BAX, KILLER/DR5, PIG2, PIG7 and PIG8 was not substantially affected. Interestingly, induction of GADD45 was enhanced. These results suggest that the proline-rich region may play a role in chromatin remodeling, which counteracts chromatin-mediated repression for some of the endogenous p53 target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2039463749,"Misselected CD8 cells that express T cell receptors (TCRs) that do not recognize class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein can emerge from thymic selection. A postthymic quality control mechanism that purges these cells from the repertoire is defined here. The failure of mature CD8 cells to simultaneously engage their TCR and CD8 coreceptor triggers an activation process that begins with inhibition of CD8 gene expression through remethylation and concludes with up-regulation of surface Fas and Fas ligand and cellular apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of a death signal through continued TCR-CD8 coengagement of MHC molecules is a key checkpoint for the continued survival of correctly selected T cells. Molecular defects that prevent delivery of the death signal to mistakenly selected T cells underlie the expansion of double-negative T cells, which is the cellular signature of a subset of systemic autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2334243467,"Growth arrest and cell cycle progression are regulated by the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor pRB and related proteins p130 and p107 that bind to and inhibit the E2F family of transcription factors. Although the precise mechanism of this inhibition remains to be established, previous studies indicated the presence of transcriptional repression activity in the `pocket' of RB family members. We show here that RBP1, a known pRB pocket-binding protein, possesses transcriptional repression activity and associates with p130-E2F and pRB-E2F complexes specifically during growth arrest. Overexpression of RBP1 both inhibited E2F-dependent gene expression and suppressed cell growth. Thus repression of E2F-dependent transcription by RBP1 via RB family members may play a central role in inducing growth arrest."

https://openalex.org/W1996225161,"Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) patients revealed the importance of MMR deficiency as a risk for carcinogenesis. Since diverse mutations occur in several MMR genes, the instability of repeat sequences dispersed in the genome, which are also governed by the MMR system, is a well used marker. However, the relationship between repeat sequence instability and MMR gene mutation in human cells has not been well defined mainly because precise systems to analyse repeat sequences have not been available. Using our newly developed system, we analysed alteration of dinucleotide repeats in human cell lines which harbour mutations in MMR genes. Among 24 subclones of DLD-1 cells (hMSH6-) only one had a dinucleotide repeat alteration in only one microsatellite locus, while LoVo cells (hMSH2-/hMSH6-) exhibited marked dinucleotide repeat instability (DRI). HCT116 cells, a hMLH1-mutant, showed an ultimate DRI phenotype. Interestingly, SW48 cells lacking hMLH1 expression also demonstrated DRI, albeit the extent of diversity being significantly lower than HCT116. These data suggest that the DRI phenotype in human cells is highly dependent on mutated MMR genes and on forms of mutation. The results of DRI analyses used to detect MMR-deficiency should be interpreted with caution."

https://openalex.org/W2329798716,"It has been reported that Lysine-305 is needed for the nuclear import of the p53 protein (Liang et al., 1998). In the present study, further mutagenesis analyses were carried out between Lys-305 and the major nuclear localization signal (NLS I) of p53. It was found that a single mutation of Arg-306 resulted in the defect of p53 nuclear import. This effect is the same as that of Lys-305 mutation. Other mutations between Arg-306 and NLS I have no effect on the nuclear import of p53. However, deletions of more than two amino acids between this region abolished the transport of p53 into the nucleus. These results indicate that a basic domain other than the well defined NLS is required for the nuclear import of p53. A spacer between this basic domain and NLS I is necessary for the entrance of p53 into the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2324012034,"Nuclear localization of p53 is required for p53 to detect and respond to DNA strand abnormalities and breaks following DNA damage. This leads to activation of the tumour suppressive functions of p53 resulting in either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair; or apoptosis. Critical functional changes in DNA which require strand breaks, including gene rearrangement, may transiently mimic DNA damage: here it is important not to trigger a p53 response. The fine control of p53 in these different circumstances is unknown but may include transient sequestering of p53 in the cytoplasm. Reversible nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is an intrinsic property of p53 (Middeler et al., 1997) associated with cell cycle-related changes in p53's subcellular distribution. Takahashi and Suzuki (1994) described p53 inactivation by shuttling to the cytoplasm and Katsumoto et al. (1995) found wild-type p53 to be closely associated with cytoplasmic actin filaments during DNA synthesis. Here we show that, in the presence of free calcium ions, p53 binds directly to F-actin with a dissocation constant of about 10 μM. Thus, part of the regulatory machinery in normal cell cycling may involve p53-actin interactions regulated by calcium fluxes and the dynamic turnover of F-actin."

P300, a transcriptional coactivator of several AP1 and ATF transcription factors has been postulated to play a role in this activation. Here, we present evidence that p300 can control c-jun transcription by acting as a cofactor for ATF2: (1) Over-expression of p300 was found to stimulate c-jun transcription both in the presence and absence of E1A. (2) Like E1A, p300 activates the c-jun promoter through the junl and jun2 elements and preferentially activates the N-terminal domain of ATF2. (3) Co-immunoprecipitation assays of crude cell extracts indicate that endogenous p300/CBP(-like) proteins and ATF2 proteins are present in a multiprotein complex that can bind specifically to the jun2 element. We further demonstrate that the Stress-Activated-Protein-Kinase (SAPK) target sites of ATF2, Thr69 and Thr71 are not required for the formation of the p300/CBP-ATF2 multiprotein complex. These data indicate that E1A does not inhibit all transcription activation functions of p300, and, in fact, cooperates with p300 in the activation of the ATF2 N-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2334672143,"The INK4a gene, one of the most frequently disrupted loci in human cancer, encodes two unrelated proteins, p16INK4a and p19ARF, that both block cell proliferation. p16INK4a is a component of the Rb regulatory pathway, while p19ARF has been functionally related to p53. Moreover, p16INK4a is inactivated in many human tumors, while it has been very recently reported that p19ARF null mice develop tumors early in life. We show here that p19ARF is able to inhibit the formation of G418-resistant colonies when transfected into human and mouse cell lines expressing wild-type p53, regardless of p16 status. Moreover its amino terminal domain encoded by exon 1β is still sufficient to obtain the same effect. We have analysed the ability of p19ARF to interfere with Ras-mediated cellular transformation in the NIH3T3 cell line. Cotransfection of p19ARF together with activated ras potently inhibited the formation of transformed foci in a dose-dependent manner. We have also isolated stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing p19ARF and we have measured their growth properties as well as their efficiency of transformation by activated ras. Our results suggest that p19ARF can interfere with oncogene-mediated transformation, without significantly affecting NIH3T3 cell growth, at least at the levels of expression achieved in these experiments."
