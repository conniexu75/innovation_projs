https://openalex.org/W2007642676,Aedes aegyptii and Culex pipiens are the only two mosquitoes which have hitherto been reared from egg to adult under sterile conditions. It is interesting to note that the autogenous Culex molestus can also be bred without difficulty on sterile media.

Similar measurements have now been made in the air over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on board R.M.S. Rangitiki, N.Z.S. Co., during a voyage from London to Wellington (May 10–June 16, 1947)."

The environmental conditions, when using these methods, have always been difficult to standardize, though it may be argued that for pathological work they simulate those existing on the surface of fruits and leaves."

https://openalex.org/W2015171809,"I AM much interested in the note by Dr. Erik Zeuthen on the presence of rhythmic respiration in sea urchin eggs1. Fifteen years ago, while at Harvard, I performed a number of experiments on the fertilized eggs of another species of the sea urchin, Arbacia punctulata, using the Warburg microrespirometer technique. I found rhythmic variation in the rate of oxygen consumption by these more or less uniformly cleaving eggs. The phenomenon is quite pronounced at 25°, but not so at 15°. The oxygen consumption υ. time, or oxygen consumption υ. cleavage curves are very much the same as those given by Dr. Zeuthen. I also discussed in detail the reasons for the failure of previous workers to find such variations. In Warburg‘s first experiments2 the readings were taken at too long intervals, and Gray‘s3 experiments were made at too low a temperature (11°) for the variations to be significant. Shearer‘s data actually showed such a variation if his data were replotted differentially as rate against time, rather than as an integral curve of amount of oxygen consumed against time, which was the way he plotted the results."

https://openalex.org/W1966181468,"IN view of the synthesis of dl-sparteine reported by Leonard and Beylen1, we wish to place on record that some time ago we effected the reduction of l-oxysparteine to l-sparteine by treatment with lithium–aluminium hydride. Full details of this work will be published elsewhere in due course."

Choose a quiet room, fill the mouth with tobacco smoke, and blow gently out through a very small aperture between pursed lips. Careful observation of the fine jet of smoke will show that it has a definite periodicity—that of the heart beat. With a delicately controlled jet it is even possible to make the heart blow a smoke ring at each beat."

Martyn Clark, of Amritsar, remarked ""that, as some insects carry the pollen of one plant to the flower of another, so mosquitos [sic] transplant the malarial germ to a suitable nidus by directly inoculating their victims with it""2. He further stated that ""it will probably some day be ascertained that the mosquito fulfils a part in their [that is, the germs of malaria] transmission"". As Ross met Manson in 1894, and Manson brought forward the mosquito theory in that year, Clark‘s adumbration seems to be worthy of recall."

The public in general has had a close acquaintance with the results of the work—if not of the work itself—in the war-time dehydrated foods and the special packagings that were adopted. Probably, however, few of those who complained about their dried egg and their household milk realized the amount of work that had gone into making it possible for us to have these foods at all. Here now is a chance for them to learn something of what was done on their behalf, for the successful application of the research findings was the result of close co-operation between the Board and the Ministry of Food."
