https://openalex.org/W1592623275,"The effects of whole heart ischemia on fatty acid metabolism were studied in the isolated, perfused rat heart. A reduction in coronary flow and oxygen consumption resulted in lower rates of palmitate uptake and oxidation to CO2. This decrease in metabolic rate was associated with increased tissue levels of long chain acyl coenzyme A and long chain acylcarnitine. Cellular levels of acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine, free CoA, and free carnitine decreased. These changes in CoA and its acyl derivatives indicate that beta oxidation became the limiting step in fatty acid metabolism. The rate of beta oxidation was probably limited by high levels of NADH and FADH2 secondary to a reduced supply of oxygen. Tissue levels of neutral lipids showed a slight increase durning ischemia, but incorporation of [U-14C]palmitate into lipid was not altered significantly. Although both substrates for lipid synthesis were present in higher concentrations during ischemia, compartmentalization of long chain acyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix and alpha-glycerol phosphate in the cytosol may have accounted for the relatively low rate of lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2083085787,"I have grown HeLa cells in 5 mM sodium n-butyrate leading to extensive in vivo histone acetylation, and have characterized the structure of chromatin containing the modified histones. Nuclear DNA in butyrate-treated cells is digested 5–10 fold more rapidly by DNAase I than the DNA of control cells. Staphylococcal nuclease degrades the two nuclear samples to acid-soluble material with identical rates; this nuclease, however, does excise nucleosomes with extensively acetylated histones from the nucleoprotein chain preferentially. The physical properties of unsheared chromatin and isolated core particles from control and butyrate-treated cells are closely similar, as are the rates of digestion of core particles from the two cell preparations by DNAase I. Determination of the relative susceptibilities of cleavage sites for DNAase I demonstrates that the site 60 bases from the ends of the DNA, resistant in control cells, becomes susceptible to the nuclease in core particles containing acetylated histones. Similarly, the 5′ terminal phosphate at the end of DNA in core particles is removed by staphylococcal nuclease 2–3 fold faster in particles containing acetylated histones than in particles from control cells."

Both Sinefungin and A9145C were competitive inhibitors of these S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent enzymes having inhibition constants substantially less than S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. These compounds also inhibited plaque formation by vaccinia virus in mouse L-cells."

The increased prostaglandin biosynthesis and morphological changes required at least 24 h for expression. Cycloheximide inhibited the stimulated prostaglandin biosynthesis, the changes in morphology, and the increased lipid deacylation, but hydrocortisone (1.0 microgram/ml) did not. Indomethacin (0.5 microgram/ml) completely inhibited the stimulated prostaglandin biosynthesis and also inhibited some deacylation of cellular lipids. Indomethacin, however, did not effect the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-stimulated changes in morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1852004395,"Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1) from calf liver was purified to homogeneity by crystallization. The purified enzyme exhibited one single component in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. But by Ampholine gel electrophoresis, two isoelectric focusing variants were observed, with pI values at 5.8 and 6.0. when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, one major subunit with a molecular weight of 60,000 was found; five other minor subunit variants were also observed, with molecular weights ranging between 50,000 and 57,000. These minor subunit variants comprised approximately 15% of the total protein applied. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 237,500 by gradient gel electrophoresis. The native enzyme is probably composed of four subunits, each with a molecular weight of not more than 60,000. Amino acid analyses of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of 1.2 residues of glucosamine/mol of enzyme, in addition to all of the common amino acids. The presence of enzyme-bound NAD was confirmed, probably 1 NAD molecule bound/enzyme subunit. In addition to adenosine, 3-deazaadenosine was found to be an effective substrate as well in the direction of synthesis."

Below their critical micelle concentration bile salts strengthened binding slightly. Bile salt inhibition of binding was independent of the presence of lecithin in the micelles but could be reversed by fatty acid. At physiological pH (measured at 6.8 + 0.6), 150 InM NaCl and 8 XnM taurodeoxycholate, lipase, and colipase bind together to form a 1:l complex with a dissociation constant of 3.6 X 10m6 M. With this constant and in the absence of substrate, significant lipase-colipase binding in vivo would not be expected to occur at the duodenal protein concentrations measured (lipase = 1.6 + 1.1 X 10e7 M, colipase = 2.0 & 1.7 X 10m7 M). These results support the sequential idea of lipolysis whereby colipase binds substrate first, then lipase binds to colipase. A possible consequence of this system is the uniform distribution of enzymatic attachment sites (colipase) over the surface and among fat droplets which might not occur if lipase and colipase bound substrate simultaneously. Colipase, isolated from the pancreas of the dogfish (Squab acanthius), was found to activate and to bind in solution to porcine pancreatic lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1608939601,"Physical methods and chemical modifications were used to discriminate between the bilirubin-binding capacity and glutathione-S-transferase activity of ligandin which was purified from rat liver. Binding of bilirubin occurs at a primary high affinity site (KA = 5 X 10(7) M-1) and at a secondary, lesser affinity site (KA = 3 X 10(5) M-1). Circular dichroism and fluorescence-quenching methods were used to distinguish between these sites. Cross-linked as well as reduced and alkylated ligandin lost high affinity bilirubin-binding capacity, but retained glutathione-S-transferase activity, bilirubin binding at a secondary site, and immunological reactivity. Succinylation of ligandin abolished catalytic activity and bilirubin binding at high and low affinity sites, but not immunological reactivity. Catalytic activity was unaffected by concentrations of bilirubin which saturated the primary binding site. These results suggest that the high affinity site at which bilirubin is bound to ligandin is independent from the site at which catalytically reactive substrates bind. The latter substrates probably interact at the secondary bilirubin binding site where bilirubin competitively inhibits glutathione-S-transferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1572193982,"A method is given for preparing tubulin with 1 mol of exchangeably bound [gamma-32P]GTP/mol of 6 S dimer. Bovine tubulin is shown to hydrolyze 1 mol of GTP/mol of 6 S dimer added to assembling microtubules at 37 degrees. Hydrolysis and assembly occur at the same rate and to the same extent. When microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are removed, both hydrolysis and assembly fail to occur. Readdition of the MAPs restores both activities. Tubulin with exchangeable GDP will co-assemble with GTP.tubulin even at equimolar levels. Exchangeability is demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments with GDP or GTP. GDP is also a potent inhibitor of assembly under these conditions, and the rate of assembly is reduced by 50% at 10 micron GDP. One mole of inorganic phosphate is released to the solvent per mole of exchangeable GTP hydrolyzed. An assembly mechanism is proposed in which exchangeable GTP is hydrolyzed without intermediate transphosphorylation of nonexchangeable GDP."
https://openalex.org/W1584936997,"Differentiating (3T3-L1) and nondifferentiating (3T3-C2) fibroblastic cell lines possess two classes of insulin receptors, high affinity (KD = 1.0 to 3.7 X 10(-9) M) and low affinity (KD = 2.0 to 3.6 X 10(-8) M). Confluent cultures of 3T3-L1 cells induced to differentiate by insulin (1.74 x 10(-6) M) or indomethacin (1.25 x 10(-4) M) exhibit a 3-fold increase in the number of high affinity and low affinity receptors per cell or a 1.5- to 1.8-fold increase in the number of receptors per micron2 of surface area. In contrast, nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells treated with insulin or indomethacin lose almost completely the high affinity insulin receptors while retaining the same levels of low affinity receptors. The loss of high affinity receptors of the 3T3-C2 cells is accompanied by the disappearance of the stimulatory effect of insulin on the production of CO2 from glucose and on the uptake of aminoisobutyrate. The levels of high affinity insulin receptors appear to be regulated by different mechanisms in the differentiating (3T3-L1) and nondifferentiating (3T3-C2) cell lines. The mode of this regulation may have a bearing on the ability of a particular cell line to differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W1510632518,"Substrates susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H were reduced in size through alpha-mannosidase treatment and periodate oxidation to yield the following compounds: (Man)4(GlcNAc)2Asn, [Manalpha 1 leads to 6Manalpha 1 leads to 6(Manalpha 1 leads to 3)Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNACAsn]; (Man)3(GlcNAc)2Asn, [Manalpha 1 leads to 3Man-alpha 1 leads to 6Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcAsn]; (Man)2(GlcNAc)2Asn, [Manalpha 1 leads to 6Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4BlcNAcAsm]. Comparison of the relative rates of hydrolysis of these compounds with (Man)5(GlcNAc)2-Asn, the most active substrate to date for the endoglycosidase, revealed (Man)4(GlcNAc)2Asn to be hydrolyzed faster than (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)3-(GlcNAc)2Asn to be equal to or slightly better than (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn as a substrate. (Man)2(GlcNAc)2-Asn was completely hydrolyzed but at a rate that was about 10(4) slower than (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn, which is comparable to that for (Man)3(GlcNAc)2Asn(aa)x [Manalpha 1 leads to 6(Manalpha 1 leads to 3)Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcAsn(aa)x], obtained from immunoglobulin M. (Man)1(GlcNAc)2Asn, [Manbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcAsn] was hydrolyzed at a 100-fold slower rate than the latter glycopeptide. The effective range of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H has thus been extended to compounds containing as few as 2 mannosyl residues."

The finding of four protein species after cross-linkage of the highly purified enzyme with dimethylsuberimidate, dimethyladipimidate, and glutaraldehyde suggests that the enzyme may exist in the native state as a tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1562534581,Accurate quantitation of low concentrations of vitellogenin mRNA by hybridization to vitellogenin cDNA allows analysis of the accumulation of new vitellogenin mRNA sequences throughout secondary estrogen stimulation. Administration of a secondary injection of estradiol-17 beta to male Xenopus laevis which have been withdrawn from estrogen for 60 days results in synthesis of complete vitellogenin mRNA molecules in as little as 1 h after restimulation. Vitellogenin mRNA accumulates at a rate of 13 molecules/cell/min--at least four times the rate observed in primary estrogen stimulation and peaks at a level twice that observed in primary stimulation. Administration of estrogen to male Xenopus laevis evokes stable long lived changes in the pattern of vitellogenin gene expression and constitutes a type of cellular memory effect.

https://openalex.org/W1540947399,"In many human tissues adenosine deaminase exists as a complex composed of two proteins; one protein has adenosine deaminase activity while the other represents a binding protein with no other known binding activity. A rapid, quantitative assay for human adenosine deaminase binding protein has been developed utilizing 125I-labeled calf adenosine deaminase. In addition this binding protein has been purified 1,690-fold from human kidney using adenosine deaminase affinity chromatography and appears to be homogenous by sedimentation equilibrium, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This highly purified binding protein exists as a dimer of native molecular weight 190,000, complexes with calf adenosine deaminase in a ratio of 1:2, respectively, and contains carbohydrate which reacts specifically with phytohemagglutinin and ricin lectins. A second form of this adenosine deaminase binding protein may exist, resulting from degradation of its carbohydrate moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1055493,"A method was developed which enables the characterization and fractionation of chromosomal proteins according to their chromatin binding properties. The method is based on the ability of hydroxyapatite to bind native chromatin in solutions which do not dissocciate chromosomal proteins from the DNA. The proteins are then selectively dissociated from the immobilized chromatin by treatment with NaCl, urea, or guanidine HCl. The hydroxyapatite dissociation method represents a rapid one-step fractionation procedure which results in the quantitative recovery of chromosomal proteins devoid of nucleic acids and is suitable for large preparations. The hydroxyapatite dissociation method provides a versatile procedure for the study and preparation of chromosomal proteins. The patterns of dissociation of both histones and nonhistone chromosomal proteins by NaCl and urea from chicken oviduct chromatin were characterized by this method. In addition, this technique enabled the purification of the major histone species in a single operation. Partial purification of specific nonhistone proteins, including the estrogen receptor, was also achieved. We suggest that this method will be a useful tool in elucidation of the chemical and biological properties of the proteins from chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1482779869,"Band 3, the membrane protein which mediates erythrocyte anion exchange, was purified on a concanavalin A column. Triglycerides, diglycerides, cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine were found to copurify. The column product gave at least two and probably three bands by isoelectric focusing. Antibodies prepared against the purified Band 3 appeared to react only with the cytoplasmic face of Band 3. Vesicles prepared with Band 3 had an accelerated uptake of SO4(2-) which could be inhibited by 2-(j'-aminophenyl)-6-methyl benzene thiazo-3', 7-disulfonic acid, a potent inhibitor of anion transport in the intact system. The possible source of this difference is discussed. Band 3 was spin labeled, probably at one specific site. The spectra showed that the spin label was highly immobilized, but no dipole-dipole interactions between spin labels on adjacent Band 3 subunits were apparent."

https://openalex.org/W2033958335,"The genome of the Moloney strain of murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) has been analyzed by digestion with ribonuclease T1 and separation of the digestion products by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thirty large oligonucleotides isolated from such a fingerprint have been characterized. One of these oligonucleotides (number 21) was found to be present in twice the molar yield of the rest. The 30 oligonucleotides were mapped on the genome by determining their yields in various size classes of 3′ terminal fragments of Mo-MuLV RNA. The physical map obtained in this way suggested that oligonucleotide 21 was present very near the 3′ end of the geome as well as in another location near or at the 5′ end. The genome structure suggested by these results was confirmed by analyzing oligonucleotides in Mo-MuLV RNA complementary to strong stop DNA, which is shown to be a copy of the 5′ terminal 134 nucleotides of the Mo-MuLV genome. Some of the oligonucleotides in the RNA protected from RNAase digestion by hybridization to this DNA, including oligonucleotide 21, were present near both the 3′ and 5′ ends. Comparison of these with the nucleotide sequence of strong stop DNA shows that there is a terminal redundancy of 49–60 nucleotides in the Mo-MuLV genome RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1662362821,"<‘” GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase catalyzes the initial reaction in the formation of “caps” at 5’ termini of mRNAs. The characteristics of the guanylation reaction have been studied using purified enzyme isolated from vaccinia virus. Guanylation requires a divalent cation (Mg2’), is stimulated by monovalent cations (Na+ and K+), and is unaffected by S-adenosylmethionine. The enzyme utilizes GTP as guanylyl donor with an apparent K, of 15 PM; it will guanylate a variety of RNAs. The enzyme specifically requires V-triphosphate-terminated RNA chains, as shown from studies with poly(A) containing 5’-triphosphate, 5’-diphosphate, 5’monophosphate, or 5’-hydroxyl termini; and from studies with the dinucleotides pppGpC and ppGpC. The apparent K, for termini of 5’4riphosphate poly(A) is 0.2 PM. The triphosphate bridge of cap structures synthesized by purified guanylyltransferase is derived from the a-phosphate of GTP, and the a- and /3-phosphates of the triphosphate-terminated RNA acceptor. During guanylation of 5’-triphosphate poly(A), Pi and PPi are each released in a 1: 1 stoichiometry with “cap” formation; Pi and PPi are derived from B’-triphosphateterminated poly(A) and GTP, respectively. The results indicate that the reaction catalyzed by purified guanylyltransferase with GTP and 5’-triphosphate-terminated poly(A) is: uPa 1/P’a’ ap’a’ 1/ UP"

https://openalex.org/W1666448594,"The kinetics of bilirubin binding to human serum albumin at pH 7.40, 4 degrees C, was studied by monitoring changes in bilirubin absorbance. The time course of the absorbance change at 380 nm was complex: at least three kinetic events were detected including the bimolecular association (k1 = 3.8 +/- 2.0 X 10(7) M-1 S-1) and two relaxation steps (52 = 40.2 +/- 9.4 s-1 and k3 = 3.8 +/- 0.5 s-1). The presence of the two slow relaxations was confirmed under pseudo-first order conditions with excess albumin. Curve-fitting procedures allowed the assignment of absorption coefficients to the intermediate species. When the bilirubin-albumin binding kinetics was observed at 420 nm, only the two relaxations were seen; apparently the second order association step was isosbestic at this wavelength. The rate of albumin-bound bilirubin dissociation was measured by mixing the pre-equilibrated human albumin-bilirubin complex with bovine albumin. The rate constant for bilirubin dissociation measured at 485 nm was k-3 = 0.01 s-1 at 4 degrees C. A minimum value of the equilibrium constant for bilirubin binding to human albumin determined from the ratio k1/k-3 is therefore approximately 4 X 10(9) M-1."

AS II is a single polypeptide chain of 197 residues having a calculated molecular weight of 21,684. Previous studies (Goto, Y., Keim, P. S., Zalkin, H., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1976) J. Biol. Chem, 251, 941-949) identified a cysteine residue required for the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The protein has 3 cysteine residues at positions 54, 79, and 140. Cysteine-79 was alkylated selectively by iodoacetamide and by the glutamine affinity analogue L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid. Based on this evidence cysteine-79 is the active site residue involved in formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. Comparison of the P. putida AS II sequence with that of the NH2-terminal 60 residues of the enzyme from Escherichia coli shows 38% sequence identity."

In the presence of NADPH, particulate fractions from pregnant rabbit lungs converted prostaglandins E1, E2, and F2alpha as well as 13,14-dihydro-15-oxoprostaglandin E2 and 13, 14-dihydro-15-oxoprostaglandin F2alpha to their 20-hydroxy derivatives. In the cases of the 3 primary prostaglandins, the corresponding omega-carboxylic acids were also isolated. The omega-hydroxylation reaction occurred in the presence of the microsomal fraction. The mitochondrial fraction was much less active whereas the cytosol fraction converted prostaglandins to their 13, 14-dihydro-15-oxo derivatives. When prostaglandin F2alpha was incubated with homogenates of lungs from pregnant rabbits, omega-oxidation was combined with oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl group and reduction of the 13, 14-double bond to give 13, 14-dihydro-20-hydroxy-15-oxoprostaglandin F2alpha as well as the corresponding derivative with an omega-carboxylic acid group.

The frequency of this latter transformation event in hamster cells was abour 10(3) greater than the frequencies of mutation in these cells. The morphologically altered cells formed in the above transformation process cannot grow in agar (aga-) and do not produce tumors when injected into animals.

https://openalex.org/W1654366416,"After incubation of 3beta-hydroxy-5-[17,21,21,21-2H]-pregnen-20-one with the microsomal fraction of boar testis, the metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following metabolites were identified: 3beta,17alpha-dihydroxy-5-[21,21,21-3H]pregnen-20-one, 3beta-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one, 5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol, and 5-[17beta-2H]androstene-3beta,17alpha-diol. The presence of a 2H atom at the 17beta position of 5-androstene-3beta,17alpha-diol was confirmed by oxidizing the steroid with 3beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas testosteroni to obtain 17alpha-hydroxy-4-[2H]androsten-3-one and then by oxidizing the latter steroid with chromic acid to obtain nonlabeled 4-androstene-3,17-dione. Among these metabolites, the first three can be interpreted to be synthesized by a well documented pathway, including 17alpha-hydroxylation followed by side chain cleavage as follows: 3beta-hydroxy-5-[17,21,21,21-2H]pregnen-20-one leads to 3beta,17alpha-dihydroxy-2-[21,21,212H]-pregnen-20-one leads to 3beta-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one leads to 5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol. On the other hand, 5-androstene-3beta,17alpha-diol, which contained a 2H atom at the 17beta position, is not likely to be synthesized via above mentioned pathway in which nonlabeled 3beta-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one is formed as the first C19-steroid. It seems that an alternate side chain cleavage mechanism leading from pregnenolone to 17alpha-hydroxy-C19-steroid exists in boar testis."

https://openalex.org/W1554226723,"Previous studies have shown that endogenous class III RNA polymerase(s) in nuclei from adenovirus 2-infected cells synthesize virus-coded RNA species which are approximately 200 (V200), 156 (V156), and 140 (V140) nucleotides in length (Weinmann, R., Brendler, T. G., Raskas, H.J., and Roeder, R. G. (1976) Cell 7, 557-566). The V156 nuclear RNA is identical in sequence to the major virus-associated RNA (VA RNA1 or 5.5 S RNA) synthesized in intact cells (Ohe, K., and Weissman, S. M. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6991-7009). The V140 RNA contains several components, one of which appears identical to a minor virus-associated RNA (VA RNAII) which is synthesized in infected cells (Mathews), M. B. (1975) Cell 6, 223-229). Thus transcription of the VA RNAI and VA RNAII genes in vitro accurately reflects the in vivo transcription of these genes. The V200 RNA contains all the nucleotide sequences found in V156 RNA plus an additional 38 to 40 nucleotides on the 3' terminus. Transcription of the gene encoding this RNA species terminates within a stretch of 6 deoxythymidylic acid residues which are located 38 nucleotides beyond the predicted termination site for VA RNAI and which are preceded by a GC-rich sequence of nucleotides. These data suggest either that the V200 RNA is a precursor to the VA RNAI or that the RNA polymerase III occasionally reads-through the presumptive VA RNAI gene termination signal and stops at a potentially stronger downstream termination site."

https://openalex.org/W1565293150,"The effect of colchicine, Nocodazole, and dibucaine on the assembly of Semliki Forest virus was investigated. Colchicine, Nocodazole, and dibucaine reduced the production of extracellular virus by 75 to 90%. Lumicolchicine had no effect on virus growth. Other control experiments showed no effect by these drugs on the incorporation of [3H]leucine into material precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. Colchicine (100 micron) disrupted the microtubles of the baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), whereas dibucaine did not alter microtubule polymerization. The stage of virus assembly inhibited by colchicine and dibucaine was studied by experiments with [3H]-leucine or [35S]methionine. At various times after addition of one of these drugs, the incorporation of the labeled precursors into viral proteins associated with fractions enriched for endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane from the cell was evaluated. The results clearly show that the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus move to the plasma membrane of the cell where they accumulate. The studies strongly suggest that the cytoskeletal system is involved in the final stages of morphogenesis of Semliki Forest virus from the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2027720519,"Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from individuals with the autosomal recessive disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), were shown previously to be significantly more resistant to the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, than were normal human fibroblasts. Here cystic fibrosis fibroblasts are also shown to be more resistant than normal human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the sex hormones, 17 β-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone. Since cells are believed to contain different receptors for each of the steroid hormones, it is not probable that the resistance of CF cells to these hormones results from a receptor deficiency. This was shown by the fact that CF cells were found to exhibit the same receptor activity as normal cells for 3H-dexamethasone. Furthermore, neither normal human nor CF fibroblasts could be demonstrated to contain detectable receptor activity for 3H-17 β-estradiol. In addition, the studies of fibroblast killing by hormones led to the further interesting observation that normal human diploid fibroblasts, regardless of the sex of the tissue donor, are sensitive to killing by each of the sex hormones. These findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the steroid hormones may be observed independently of the specific hormone receptors. The studies reported here thus suggest that the resistance of CF cells to the different steroid hormones is probably the result of a defect in a pathway in cellular steroid hormone metabolism other than that involving receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1578666638,"Following in vivo administration of hydrocortisone or methylisobutylxanthine to rats, higher levels (1.5- to 2.3-fold) of RNA polymerase I activity are present in liver nuclei and nucleoli of the treated animals as compared to control animals. The elevated specific activity is retained after purification of the enzyme under conditions where the enzyme is dependent on exogenous template for activity. The elevated polymerase activity in nuclei, nucleoli, and soluble enzyme can be destroyed by mild trypsin treatment which results in a rapid decay of the specific activity to the control level. Under these conditions, the control polymerase I activity is stable. The results indicate that in vivo stimulation by hydrocortisone or methylisobutylxanthine results in a conversion of the enzyme to a form that is catalytically more active but has an increased sensitivity to proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1587043920,"Proline reductase in Clostridium sticklandii is composed of 10 apparently identical subunits. Each subunit contains a pyruvate residue that became labeled when the cell culture was supplemented with [14C]serine. No NH2-terminal amino acid was detected either by dansylation, by Edman degradation, or by aminopeptidase M digestion. The results suggest that the NH2 terminus may be blocked by pyruvate. A pyruvate-containing peptide, also blocked at the NH2 terminus, was isolated from the NH2-terminal portion of proline reductase. From amino acid analysis the peptide was found to be rich in basic amino acids and to have a molecular weight of 4621. Its COOH-terminal amino acid was found to be serine and since the peptide was released from proline reductase by very mild alkali hydrolysis, it is suspected that an ester bond is involved."
https://openalex.org/W186198347,"The effect of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ on the initial rate of activation of human Factor X by the venom coagulant protein of Vipera russelli has been investigated. Neither Mg2+ nor Mn2+ alone support the reaction. Ca2+ is an essential activator and exhibits cooperative kinetics. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ enhance the reaction cooperatively when Ca2+ is present at suboptimal concentrations. Similarly, Ca2+ quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of human Factor X in a cooperative manner. While neither Mg2+ nor Mn2+ by themselves affect the fluorescence of human Factor X, they decrease the cooperativity of the Ca2+ binding to the protein as judged by Hill plots of the Ca2+ -induced fluoresence quenching. EPR measurements indicate that there are three high affinity Mn2+ binding sites on human Factor X which can also bind Ca2+. Positive cooperativity was not observed for Mn2+ binding. These data indicate that Ca2+ can cause a conformational change of the Factor X molecule which allows the activation reaction to proceed. We propose that Mn2+ does not support the activation of human Factor X because it cannot induce a necessary conformational change in the absence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W126256585,"The kinetics of CO binding to hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital-treated Sprague-Dawley rats, measured by stopped flow spectrophotometry, can be resolved into three components with second order velocity constants of 2.23 +/- 0.35 X 10(5) M-1 S-1, 1.59 +/- 0.18 X 10(6) M-1 S-1, and 8.7 +/- 1.7 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. The three CO-binding species were present in ratios of 1:1.25:1.39 as judged by the relative amplitude of the change in absorbance at 450 nm associated with each of the kinetic components. Similar results were obtained in a range of [CO] from 10 to 700 micron when CO recombination was followed subsequent to flash photolysis of the CO-associated microsomes. In contrast, the dissociation rate of CO from its cytochrome P-450 complex measured by the NO replacement method was biphasic. Approximately 40% of the bound CO dissociated at a rate of 0.40 +/- 0.071 s-1, whereas the remaining 60% dissociated at a rate of 0.049 +/- 0.008 s-1 at 20 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W1539225833,"Abstract Two enzymatic activities that degrade double-stranded RNA have been partially purified from HeLa cell nuclei using reoviral [3H]RNA as the substrate. The two active fractions, separated by chromatography on phosphocellulose, are designated PC I and PC II. Both fractions degrade a variety of double-stranded RNAs with an absolute requirement for a divalent cation. However, they are distinct by at least five criteria. 1)PC I degrades a variety of single- and double-stranded RNAs, single- and double-stranded DNAs, and DNA.RNA hybrids, in addition to double-stranded reoviral RNA. In contrast, PC II has maximal activity with reoviral RNA, some activity with rRNA, and much less activity with the other substrates. 2) Analyses of reaction products by sucrose gradient centrifugation and chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-cellulose indicate that, PC I cleaves reoviral RNA endonucleolytically to a final mixture of mono- and oligonucleotides, whereas the only acid- or alcohol-soluble products of PC II are 5'-XMPs produced exonucleolytically. 3) PC I activity is stimulated 2-fold more by MnCl2 than by MgCl2, whereas PC II activity is stimulated 3-fold more by MgCl2 than by MnCl2. 4) PC I activity is inhibited by NaCl concentrations as low as 10 mM, whereas PC II requires 50 to 80 mM NaCl for optimal activity. 5)Estimated by their sedimentation rates in glycerol gradients, PC I and PC II have apparent molecular weights of 55,000 and 20,000, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1555912241,"5beta-[G-3H]Cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 24xi, 25-tetrol (IV) was synthesized via dehydration and peroxidation of 5beta-[G-3H]cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol. Following perfusion of the labeled compound in the isolated rabbit liver, the bile alcohol and bile acid metabolites secreted into the bile were identified by a combination of thin layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The following bile alcohols were tentatively identified: 5beta-cholest-23-ene-3alpha, 7alpha, 25-triol, 5beta-cholest-25-ene-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 24xi-tetrol, and 5beta-cholestane-3alpha, 7alpha, 12alpha, 24xi, 25-pentol. The amount of administered tetrol recovered unchanged ranged from 1 to 88%. Cholic acid was the major product, but limited amounts of chemodeoxycholic acid were also formed. The 24-hydroxyl group in the steroid side chain did not prevent 12alpha-hydroxylation."
