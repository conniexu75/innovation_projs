https://openalex.org/W2181445041,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is important in brain development and is potentially important in schizophrenia. We characterized DNAm in prefrontal cortex from 335 non-psychiatric controls across the lifespan and 191 patients with schizophrenia and identified widespread changes in the transition from prenatal to postnatal life. These DNAm changes manifest in the transcriptome, correlate strongly with a shifting cellular landscape and overlap regions of genetic risk for schizophrenia. A quarter of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-suggestive loci (4,208 of 15,930, P < 10(-100)) manifest as significant methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), including 59.6% of GWAS-positive schizophrenia loci. We identified 2,104 CpGs that differ between schizophrenia patients and controls that were enriched for genes related to development and neurodifferentiation. The schizophrenia-associated CpGs strongly correlate with changes related to the prenatal-postnatal transition and show slight enrichment for GWAS risk loci while not corresponding to CpGs differentiating adolescence from later adult life. These data implicate an epigenetic component to the developmental origins of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2219957567,"There are widespread genetic effects on DNA methylation in the developing brain. Fetal brain mQTLs are enriched in regulatory domains, overlapping with variants influencing gene expression. Most are developmentally stable, but some are fetal specific. These mQTLs are enriched in genomic regions associated with schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder with neurodevelopmental origins. We characterized DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in a large collection (n = 166) of human fetal brain samples spanning 56–166 d post-conception, identifying >16,000 fetal brain mQTLs. Fetal brain mQTLs were primarily cis-acting, enriched in regulatory chromatin domains and transcription factor binding sites, and showed substantial overlap with genetic variants that were also associated with gene expression in the brain. Using tissue from three distinct regions of the adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a hypothesized neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can be used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of discrete sites of variable fetal brain methylation associated with schizophrenia risk variants."
https://openalex.org/W2203817162,"In vertebrates, the first haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with multi-lineage and long-term repopulating potential arise in the AGM (aorta–gonad–mesonephros) region. These HSCs are generated from a rare and transient subset of endothelial cells, called haemogenic endothelium (HE), through an endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT). Here, we establish the absolute requirement of the transcriptional repressors GFI1 and GFI1B (growth factor independence 1 and 1B) in this unique trans-differentiation process. We first demonstrate that Gfi1 expression specifically defines the rare population of HE that generates emerging HSCs. We further establish that in the absence of GFI1 proteins, HSCs and haematopoietic progenitor cells are not produced in the AGM, revealing the critical requirement for GFI1 proteins in intra-embryonic EHT. Finally, we demonstrate that GFI1 proteins recruit the chromatin-modifying protein LSD1, a member of the CoREST repressive complex, to epigenetically silence the endothelial program in HE and allow the emergence of blood cells. Lacaud and colleagues show that the GFI1 transcriptional repressors are required for endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition in the aorta–gonad–mesonephros region of the mouse embryo by inhibiting the endothelial gene expression program via LSD1."
https://openalex.org/W2205358880,"Cells test the rigidity of the extracellular matrix by applying forces to it through integrin adhesions. Recent measurements show that these forces are applied by local micrometre-scale contractions, but how contraction force is regulated by rigidity is unknown. Here we performed high temporal- and spatial-resolution tracking of contractile forces by plating cells on sub-micrometre elastomeric pillars. We found that actomyosin-based sarcomere-like contractile units (CUs) simultaneously moved opposing pillars in net steps of ∼2.5 nm, independent of rigidity. What correlated with rigidity was the number of steps taken to reach a force level that activated recruitment of α-actinin to the CUs. When we removed actomyosin restriction by depleting tropomyosin 2.1, we observed larger steps and higher forces that resulted in aberrant rigidity sensing and growth of non-transformed cells on soft matrices. Thus, we conclude that tropomyosin 2.1 acts as a suppressor of growth on soft matrices by supporting proper rigidity sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2220105988,"[NiFe] hydrogenases contain a conserved arginine (R509) that is suspended over the Ni and Fe atoms. Biochemical, crystallographic and electrochemical analysis of an R509K mutant reveal >100-fold lower oxidation activity despite the maintenance of structural integrity. The active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases contains a strictly conserved arginine that suspends a guanidine nitrogen atom <4.5 Å above the nickel and iron atoms. The guanidine headgroup interacts with the side chains of two conserved aspartic acid residues to complete an outer-shell canopy that has thus far proved intractable to investigation by site-directed mutagenesis. Using hydrogenase-1 from Escherichia coli, the strictly conserved residues R509 and D574 have been replaced by lysine (R509K) and asparagine (D574N) and the highly conserved D118 has been replaced by alanine (D118A) or asparagine (D118N/D574N). Each enzyme variant is stable, and their [(RS)2Niμ(SR)2Fe(CO)(CN)2] inner coordination shells are virtually unchanged. The R509K variant had >100-fold lower activity than native enzyme. Conversely, the variants D574N, D118A and D118N/D574N, in which the position of the guanidine headgroup is retained, showed 83%, 26% and 20% activity, respectively. The special kinetic requirement for R509 implicates the suspended guanidine group as the general base in H2 activation by [NiFe] hydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W2176176239,"Vector borne diseases are susceptible to climate change because distributions and densities of many vectors are climate driven. The Amazon region is endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis and is predicted to be severely impacted by climate change. Recent records suggest that the distributions of Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) flaviscutellata and the parasite it transmits, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, are expanding southward, possibly due to climate change, and sometimes associated with new human infection cases. We define the vector's climatic niche and explore future projections under climate change scenarios. Vector occurrence records were compiled from the literature, museum collections and Brazilian Health Departments. Six bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in six ecological niche model algorithms (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MaxEnt, GARP, logistic regression and Random Forest). Projections for 2050 used 17 general circulation models in two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways: ""stabilization"" and ""high increase"". Ensemble models and consensus maps were produced by overlapping binary predictions. Final model outputs showed good performance and significance. The use of species absence data substantially improved model performance. Currently, L. flaviscutellata is widely distributed in the Amazon region, with records in the Atlantic Forest and savannah regions of Central Brazil. Future projections indicate expansion of the climatically suitable area for the vector in both scenarios, towards higher latitudes and elevations. L. flaviscutellata is likely to find increasingly suitable conditions for its expansion into areas where human population size and density are much larger than they are in its current locations. If environmental conditions change as predicted, the range of the vector is likely to expand to southeastern and central-southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and further into the Amazonian areas of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. These areas will only become endemic for L. amazonensis, however, if they have competent reservoir hosts and transmission dynamics matching those in the Amazon region."
https://openalex.org/W2183104519,"Data on the future diabetes burden in Scandinavia is limited. Our aim was to project the future burden of diabetes in Sweden by modelling data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and demographic factors.To project the future burden of diabetes we used information on the prevalence of diabetes from the national drug prescription registry (adults ≥ 20 years), previously published data on relative mortality in people with diabetes, and population demographics and projections from Statistics Sweden. Alternative scenarios were created based on different assumptions regarding the future incidence of diabetes.Between 2007 and 2013 the prevalence of diabetes rose from 5.8 to 6.8% in Sweden but incidence remained constant at 4.4 per 1000 (2013). With constant incidence and continued improvement in relative survival, prevalence will increase to 10.4% by year 2050 and the number of afflicted individuals will increase to 940 000. Of this rise, 30% is accounted for by changes in the age structure of the population and 14% by improved relative survival in people with diabetes. A hypothesized 1% annual rise in incidence will result in a prevalence of 12.6% and 1 136 000 cases. Even with decreasing incidence at 1% per year, prevalence of diabetes will continue to increase.We can expect diabetes prevalence to rise substantially in Sweden over the next 35 years as a result of demographic changes and improved survival among people with diabetes. A dramatic reduction in incidence is required to prevent this development."
https://openalex.org/W2182910061,"Chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) exhibit a variety of flower colors due to their differing abilities to accumulate anthocyanins. One MYB member, CmMYB6, has been verified as a transcription regulator of chrysanthemum genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis; however, the co-regulators for CmMYB6 remain unclear in chrysanthemum. Here, the expression pattern of CmbHLH2, which is clustered in the IIIf bHLH subgroup, was shown to be positively correlated with the anthocyanin content of cultivars with red, pink and yellow flower colors, respectively. CmbHLH2 significantly upregulated the CmDFR promoter and triggered anthocyanin accumulation when co-expressed with CmMYB6. Yeast one-hybrid analyses indicated that CmbHLH2 was able to bind directly to the CmDFR promoter. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays indicated protein-protein interaction between CmbHLH2 and CmMYB6. These results suggest that CmbHLH2 is the essential partner for CmMYB6 in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in chrysanthemum."
https://openalex.org/W2183192893,"Recent studies have recognized G protein-coupled receptors as important regulators of oligodendrocyte development. GPR17, in particular, is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that has been identified as oligodendroglial maturation inhibitor because its stimulation arrests primary mouse oligodendrocytes at a less differentiated stage. However, the intracellular signaling effectors transducing its activation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Oli-neu cells, an immortalized cell line derived from primary murine oligodendrocytes, and primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures as model systems to identify molecular targets that link cell surface GPR17 to oligodendrocyte maturation blockade. We demonstrate that stimulation of GPR17 by the small molecule agonist MDL29,951 (2-carboxy-4,6-dichloro-1H-indole-3-propionic acid) decreases myelin basic protein expression levels mainly by triggering the Gαi/o signaling pathway, which in turn leads to reduced activity of the downstream cascade adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In addition, we show that GPR17 activation also diminishes myelin basic protein abundance by lessening stimulation of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), thus uncovering a previously unrecognized role for EPAC to regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Together, our data establish PKA and EPAC as key downstream effectors of GPR17 that inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation. We envisage that treatments augmenting PKA and/or EPAC activity represent a beneficial approach for therapeutic enhancement of remyelination in those demyelinating diseases where GPR17 is highly expressed, such as multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2189428702,"Periodontal disease (PD) develops from a synergy of complex subgingival oral microbiome, and is linked to systemic inflammatory atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD). To investigate how a polybacterial microbiome infection influences atherosclerotic plaque progression, we infected the oral cavity of ApoE null mice with a polybacterial consortium of 4 well-characterized periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerealla forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, that have been identified in human atherosclerotic plaque by DNA screening. We assessed periodontal disease characteristics, hematogenous dissemination of bacteria, peripheral T cell response, serum inflammatory cytokines, atherosclerosis risk factors, atherosclerotic plaque development, and alteration of aortic gene expression. Polybacterial infections have established gingival colonization in ApoE null hyperlipidemic mice and displayed invasive characteristics with hematogenous dissemination into cardiovascular tissues such as the heart and aorta. Polybacterial infection induced significantly higher levels of serum risk factors oxidized LDL (p < 0.05), nitric oxide (p < 0.01), altered lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides, Chylomicrons, VLDL) (p < 0.05) as well as accelerated aortic plaque formation in ApoE null mice (p < 0.05). Periodontal microbiome infection is associated with significant decreases in Apoa1, Apob, Birc3, Fga, FgB genes that are associated with atherosclerosis. Periodontal infection for 12 weeks had modified levels of inflammatory molecules, with decreased Fas ligand, IL-13, SDF-1 and increased chemokine RANTES. In contrast, 24 weeks of infection induced new changes in other inflammatory molecules with reduced KC, MCSF, enhancing GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-13, IL-4, IL-13, lymphotactin, RANTES, and also an increase in select inflammatory molecules. This study demonstrates unique differences in the host immune response to a polybacterial periodontal infection with atherosclerotic lesion progression in a mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2187090880,"Experimental evidence supports the role of mitochondrial ceramide accumulation as a cause of mitochondrial dysfunction and brain injury after stroke. Herein, we report that SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial ceramide biosynthesis via deacetylation of ceramide synthase (CerS) 1, 2, and 6. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CerS1, CerS2, and CerS6, but not CerS4, are associated with SIRT3 in cerebral mitochondria. Furthermore, CerS1, -2, and -6 are hyperacetylated in the mitochondria of SIRT3-null mice, and SIRT3 directly deacetylates the ceramide synthases in a NAD+-dependent manner that increases enzyme activity. Investigation of the SIRT3 role in mitochondrial response to brain ischemia/reperfusion (IR) showed that SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of ceramide synthases increased enzyme activity and ceramide accumulation after IR. Functional studies demonstrated that absence of SIRT3 rescued the IR-induced blockade of the electron transport chain at the level of complex III, attenuated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and decreased reactive oxygen species generation and protein carbonyls in mitochondria. Importantly, Sirt3 gene ablation reduced the brain injury after IR. These data support the hypothesis that IR triggers SIRT3-dependent deacetylation of ceramide synthases and the elevation of ceramide, which could inhibit complex III, leading to increased reactive oxygen species generation and brain injury. The results of these studies highlight a novel mechanism of SIRT3 involvement in modulating mitochondrial ceramide biosynthesis and suggest an important role of SIRT3 in mitochondrial dysfunction and brain injury after experimental stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2234826186,"The majority of bacterial proteins are dispensable for growth in the laboratory but nevertheless have important physiological roles. There are no systematic approaches to identify cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitors of these proteins. We demonstrate a strategy to identify such inhibitors that exploits synthetic lethal relationships both for small-molecule discovery and for target identification. Applying this strategy in Staphylococcus aureus, we have identified a compound that inhibits DltB, a component of the teichoic acid D-alanylation machinery that has been implicated in virulence. This D-alanylation inhibitor sensitizes S. aureus to aminoglycosides and cationic peptides and is lethal in combination with a wall teichoic acid inhibitor. We conclude that DltB is a druggable target in the D-alanylation pathway. More broadly, the work described demonstrates a systematic method to identify biologically active inhibitors of major bacterial processes that can be adapted to numerous organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2283887526,"As bioaerosol research attracts increasing attention, there is a need for additional efforts that focus on method development to deal with different environmental samples. Bioaerosol environmental samples typically have very low biomass concentrations in the air, which often leaves researchers with limited options in choosing the downstream analysis steps, especially when culture-independent methods are intended.This study investigates the impacts of three important factors that can influence the performance of culture-independent DNA-based analysis in dealing with bioaerosol environmental samples engaged in this study. The factors are: 1) enhanced high temperature sonication during DNA extraction; 2) effect of sampling duration on DNA recoverability; and 3) an alternative method for concentrating composite samples. In this study, DNA extracted from samples was analysed using the Qubit fluorometer (for direct total DNA measurement) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).The findings suggest that additional lysis from high temperature sonication is crucial: DNA yields from both high and low biomass samples increased up to 600% when the protocol included 30-min sonication at 65°C. Long air sampling duration on a filter media was shown to have a negative impact on DNA recoverability with up to 98% of DNA lost over a 20-h sampling period. Pooling DNA from separate samples during extraction was proven to be feasible with margins of error below 30%."
https://openalex.org/W2186799722,"Screening of new compounds directed against key protein targets must continually keep pace with emerging antibiotic resistances. Although periplasmic enzymes of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis have been among the first drug targets, compounds directed against the membrane-integrated catalysts are hardly available. A promising future target is the integral membrane protein MraY catalyzing the first membrane associated step within the cytoplasmic pathway of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. However, the expression of most MraY homologues in cellular expression systems is challenging and limits biochemical analysis. We report the efficient production of MraY homologues from various human pathogens by synthetic cell-free expression approaches and their subsequent characterization. MraY homologues originating from Bordetella pertussis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Escherichia coli as well as Bacillus subtilis were co-translationally solubilized using either detergent micelles or preformed nanodiscs assembled with defined membranes. All MraY enzymes originating from Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to detergents and required nanodiscs containing negatively charged lipids for obtaining a stable and functionally folded conformation. In contrast, the Gram-positive B. subtilis MraY not only tolerates detergent but is also less specific for its lipid environment. The MraY·nanodisc complexes were able to reconstitute a complete in vitro lipid I and lipid II forming pipeline in combination with the cell-free expressed soluble enzymes MurA-F and with the membrane-associated protein MurG. As a proof of principle for future screening platforms, we demonstrate the inhibition of the in vitro lipid II biosynthesis with the specific inhibitors fosfomycin, feglymycin, and tunicamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2187651642,"MicroRNAs play diverse roles in both normal and malignant stem cells. Focusing on miRs and/or miR(∗)s abundant in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stem cells, we engineer an efficient, strand-specific expression library, and apply functional genomics screening in mice to identify which of 169 cancer-associated miRs are key drivers in malignant progression. Not previously linked functionally to cancer, miR-21(∗) was the second top hit, surfacing in >12% of tumours. miR-21(∗) also correlates with poor prognosis in human SCCs and enhances tumour progression in xenografts. On deleting the miR-21 gene and rescuing each strand separately, we document the dual, but independent, oncogenicity of miR-21 and miR-21(∗). A cohort of predicted miR-21(∗) targets inversely correlate with miR-21(∗) in SCCs. Of particular interest is Phactr4, which we show is a miR-21(∗) target in SCCs, acting through the Rb/E2F cell cycle axis. Through in vivo physiological miR screens, our findings add an interesting twist to an increasingly important oncomiR locus."
https://openalex.org/W2187558184,"Introduction The relationship between a perioperative change in sarcopenic status and clinical outcome of liver transplantation (LT) is unknown. We investigated whether post-LT sarcopenia and changes in sarcopenic status were associated with the survival of patients. Method This retrospective study was based on a cohort of 145 patients from a single transplant center who during a mean of 1 year after LT underwent computed tomography imaging evaluation. The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle of LT patients was compared with that of age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine whether post-LT sarcopenia and changes in sarcopenic status affect post-LT survival. Results The mean age at LT of the 116 male and 29 female patients was 50.2 ± 7.9 years; the mean follow-up duration was 51.6 ± 32.9 months. All pre-LT patients with sarcopenia still had sarcopenia 1 year after LT; 14 (15%) patients had newly developed sarcopenia. The mean survival duration was 91.8 ± 4.2 months for non-sarcopenic patients and 80.0 ± 5.2 months for sarcopenic patients (log-rank test, p = 0.069). In subgroup analysis, newly developed sarcopenia was an independent negative predictor for post-LT survival (hazard ratio: 10.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.37–80.93, p = 0.024). Conclusion Sarcopenia in LT recipients did not improve in any of the previously sarcopenic patients and newly developed within 1 year in others. Newly developed sarcopenia was associated with increased mortality. Newly developed sarcopenia can be used to stratify patients with regard to the risk of post-LT mortality."

https://openalex.org/W2178323482,"Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperones play an important role in regulating cellular processes that involve protein folding and stabilization, which are essential for the integrity of signaling networks. Although many aspects of allosteric regulatory mechanisms in Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperones have been extensively studied and significantly advanced in recent experimental studies, the atomistic picture of signal propagation and energetics of dynamics-based communication still remain unresolved. In this work, we have combined molecular dynamics simulations and protein stability analysis of the chaperone structures with the network modeling of residue interaction networks to characterize molecular determinants of allosteric mechanisms. We have shown that allosteric mechanisms of Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperones may be primarily determined by nucleotide-induced redistribution of local conformational ensembles in the inter-domain regions and the substrate binding domain. Conformational dynamics and energetics of the peptide substrate binding with the Hsp70 structures has been analyzed using free energy calculations, revealing allosteric hotspots that control negative cooperativity between regulatory sites. The results have indicated that cooperative interactions may promote a population-shift mechanism in Hsp70, in which functional residues are organized in a broad and robust allosteric network that can link the nucleotide-binding site and the substrate-binding regions. A smaller allosteric network in Hsp110 structures may elicit an entropy-driven allostery that occurs in the absence of global structural changes. We have found that global mediating residues with high network centrality may be organized in stable local communities that are indispensable for structural stability and efficient allosteric communications. The network-centric analysis of allosteric interactions has also established that centrality of functional residues could correlate with their sensitivity to mutations across diverse chaperone functions. This study reconciles a wide spectrum of structural and functional experiments by demonstrating how integration of molecular simulations and network-centric modeling may explain thermodynamic and mechanistic aspects of allosteric regulation in chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W2418525743,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most abundant protein transmitters in the central nervous system with roles in a variety of biological functions including: food intake, cardiovascular regulation, cognition, seizure activity, circadian rhythms, and neurogenesis. Reduced NPY and NPY receptor expression is associated with numerous neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). To determine whether replacement of NPY could ameliorate some of the neurodegenerative and behavioral pathology associated with AD, we generated a lentiviral vector expressing NPY fused to a brain transport peptide (apoB) for widespread CNS delivery in an APP-transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD. The recombinant NPY-apoB effectively reversed neurodegenerative pathology and behavioral deficits although it had no effect on accumulation of Aβ. The subgranular zone of the hippocampus showed a significant increase in proliferation of neural precursor cells without further differentiation into neurons. The neuroprotective and neurogenic effects of NPY-apoB appeared to involve signaling via ERK and Akt through the NPY R1 and NPY R2 receptors. Thus, widespread CNS-targeted delivery of NPY appears to be effective at reversing the neuronal and glial pathology associated with Aβ accumulation while also increasing NPC proliferation. Overall, increased delivery of NPY to the CNS for AD might be an effective therapy especially if combined with an anti-Aβ therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2185389647,"The gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as an important mediator of endothelial cell homeostasis and function that impacts upon vascular tone and blood pressure. Cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) is the predominant endothelial generator of H2S, and recent evidence suggests that its transcriptional expression is regulated by the reactive oxygen species, H2O2. However, the cellular source of H2O2 and the redox-dependent molecular signaling pathway that modulates this is not known. We aimed to investigate the role of Nox4, an endothelial generator of H2O2, in the regulation of CSE in endothelial cells. Both gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human endothelial cells in vitro demonstrated Nox4 to be a positive regulator of CSE transcription and protein expression. We demonstrate that this is dependent upon a heme-regulated inhibitor kinase/eIF2α/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling module. ATF4 was further demonstrated to bind directly to cis-regulatory sequences within the first intron of CSE to activate transcription. Furthermore, CSE expression was also increased in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, isolated from endothelial-specific Nox4 transgenic mice, compared with wild-type littermate controls. Using wire myography we demonstrate that endothelial-specific Nox4 transgenic mice exhibit a hypo-contractile phenotype in response to phenylephrine that was abolished when vessels were incubated with a CSE inhibitor, propargylglycine. We, therefore, conclude that Nox4 is a positive transcriptional regulator of CSE in endothelial cells and propose that it may in turn contribute to the regulation of vascular tone via the modulation of H2S production.

Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of CSE-generated H2S has been demonstrated, as CSE-null mice display pronounced hypertension and impaired vascular relaxation to acetylcholine (7Yang G. Wu L. Jiang B.

H2S as a physiologic vasorelaxant: hypertension in mice with deletion of cystathionine γ-lyase.Science. 2008; 322: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Being gaseous and highly reactive, H2S is not readily stored in vesicles and hence must be synthesized, on demand, close to its site of action. Consequently both the expression and activity of CSE must be tightly controlled. An emerging body of evidence suggests that the regulation of CSE expression is subject to redox-dependent mechanisms and is promoted in response to a pro-oxidative cellular environment. Thus the administration of exogenous H2O2 was shown to up-regulate CSE gene expression in fibroblasts (8Wang M. Guo Z. Wang S. Cystathionine γ-lyase expression is regulated by exogenous hydrogen peroxide in the mammalian cells.Gene Expr. 2012; 15: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mesangial cells, CSE expression was increased by the administration of platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and this increase was significantly reduced by the co-administration of diverse anti-oxidants (9Hassan M.I. Boosen M. Schaefer L. Kozlowska J. Eisel F. von Knethen A. Beck M. Hemeida R.A. El-Moselhy M.A. Hamada F.M. Beck K.F. Pfeilschifter J.

Pharmacol. 2012; 166: 2231-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although difficult to quantify (10Hughes M.N. Centelles M.N. Moore K.P. Making and working with hydrogen sulfide: the chemistry and generation of hydrogen sulfide in vitro and its measurement in vivo: a review.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), H2S production has recently been demonstrated to be dependent upon H2O2 using a novel cell-trappable fluorescent probe, allowing real-time visualization of H2S. Thus treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with vascular endothelial growth factor resulted in a CSE-dependent increase in H2S production that could be abolished by the addition of the H2O2 scavenger, catalase, or diphenyleneiodonium chloride, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the ROS-generating NADPH oxidases (and other flavoproteins) (11Lin V.S. Lippert A.R. Chang C.J. Cell-trappable fluorescent probes for endogenous hydrogen sulfide signaling and imaging H2O2-dependent H2S production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7131-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although these experiments suggest a role for ROS and, in particular, H2O2 in the regulation of CSE, the biologically relevant cellular source(s) of ROS and the redox-dependent molecular pathway(s) that underlies this regulation remain unknown. The inhibition of this process by diphenyleneiodonium chloride is, however, suggestive of the involvement of NADPH oxidase(s). NADPH oxidases comprise a family of enzymes whose primary physiological function is the production of ROS, which mediates redox-dependent molecular signaling pathways (12Brandes R.P. Weissmann N. Schröder K. Redox-mediated signal transduction by cardiovascular NOX NADPH oxidases.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2014; 73: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Their physiological and pathophysiological roles in the cardiovascular system have been extensively studied (13Burgoyne J.R. Mongue-Din H. Eaton P. Shah A.M.

Redox signaling in cardiac myocytes.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and within the endothelium NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is the most abundantly expressed isoform. Nox4 has been further shown to participate in the regulation of vascular tone in vivo in both gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. Thus we have demonstrated previously that endothelial-specific Nox4-overexpressing transgenic (eNox4 Tg) mice display significantly greater acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation and lower blood pressure compared with wild-type (WT) littermate controls (15Ray R. Murdoch C.E. Wang M. Santos C.X. Zhang M. Alom-Ruiz S. Anilkumar N. Ouattara A. Cave A.C. Walker S.J. Grieve D.J. Charles R.L. Eaton P. Brewer A.C. Shah A.M.

Chen K. Pei Y. Li C. Huang X. Chen C. Shibata R. Sato K. Walsh K. Keaney Jr., J.F. NADPH oxidase 4 promotes endothelial angiogenesis through endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation.Circulation. 2011; 124: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that (global) ablation of Nox4 results in impaired aortic vascular relaxation to acetylcholine after treatment with angiotensin II (17Schröder K. Zhang M. Benkhoff S. Mieth A. Pliquett R. Kosowski J. Kruse C. Luedike P. Michaelis U.R. Weissmann N. Dimmeler S. Shah A.M. Brandes R.P. Nox4 is a protective reactive oxygen species generating vascular NADPH oxidase.Circ. Res. 2012; 110: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These beneficial, protective effects of Nox4 within the vasculature are in marked contrast to the endothelial dysfunction reported to be promoted by both Nox1 and Nox2 (18Judkins C.P. Diep H. Broughton B.R. Mast A.E. Hooker E.U. Miller A.A. Selemidis S. Dusting G.J. Sobey C.G. Drummond G.R. Direct evidence of a role for Nox2 in superoxide production, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, and early atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoe−/− mice.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in aortas of aged spontaneously hypertensive rats by Nox1/2 is reversed by NADPH oxidase inhibition.Hypertension. 2010; 56: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This difference is perhaps explained by the fact that Nox4 predominantly generates H2O2, whereas Nox1 and Nox2 are known to generate the superoxide (O2̇̄), which reacts with (and hence reduces the bioavailability of) NO within the vasculature (20Martyn K.D. Frederick L.M. von Loehneysen K. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Functional analysis of nox4 reveals unique characteristics compared to other NADPH oxidases.Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a distinct pattern of subcellular localization of Nox4 may couple the ROS it generates to different downstream signaling cascades (21Hilenski L.L. Clempus R.E. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Distinct subcellular localizations of Nox1 and Nox4 in vascular smooth muscle cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Nox4-dependent signaling and CSE expression in endothelial cells. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK Home Office). Generation of eNox4 Tg mice has been described before (15Ray R. Murdoch C.E. Wang M. Santos C.X. Zhang M. Alom-Ruiz S. Anilkumar N. Ouattara A. Cave A.C. Walker S.J. Grieve D.J. Charles R.L. Eaton P.

HUVECs (Lonza) seeded onto precoated dishes (0.4% gelatin in PBS) were maintained in EBM-2 HUVEC media (Lonza). Nox4 overexpression was performed by adenoviral transduction (AdNox4 or Adβ-gal control as described previously (22Murray T.V. Smyrnias I. Shah A.M. Brewer A.C.

Transient transfections of (control) pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or an equivalent plasmid in which the full-length mouse ATF4 cDNA had been inserted (pATF4; Addgene) were carried out using the turbofect reagent (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturers' specifications using 4 μg of plasmid DNA/6-cm dish and incubated for 24 h. For silencing experiments, HUVECs were cultured in 6-cm dishes and serum-starved for 1 h in Opti-MEM before being transfected with siRNAs targeted to Nox4 (5 nm; s27015), p22Phox (20 nm; s194371), ATF4 (20 nm; s1702), heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI; 20 nm; s25823), protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK; 20 nm; s18101), or scrambled control siRNA at equivalent concentrations (all Ambion Silencer-select) and incubated for 24 or 48 h as indicated. Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000® transfection reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' specifications. For tunicamycin treatments, HUVECs were cultured in 6-cm dishes and treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 2 h. For H2O2 treatment, HUVECs were cultured in 6-cm dishes and treated with 10 mm H2O2 (Sigma) for 1 h. For experiments involving the inhibition of heme biosynthesis and degradation, HUVEC were cultured in 6-cm dishes and treated with either 1 mm oxoheptane (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid) (Sigma), 10 μm tin protoporphyrin (Sigma), or DMSO vehicle control. For hypoxia experiments, HUVECs were cultured in 6-cm dishes and incubated at either 21% O2 in a standard tissue culture incubator or at 1% O2 in a hypoxic chamber (Biospherix C Chamber) for 1 h. For assessment of proliferation, HUVEC were treated with Nox4-targeted or control siRNA for 24 h (as above) before being counted in an automated cell counter (TC20, Bio-Rad) and diluted to 125,000 cells/ml. 100 μl of diluted cells were then placed into individual wells of 16-well E-plates (ACEA). Immediately after plating the cell index was measured over 24 h using an xCELLigence real time cell analyzer (RTCA DP, ACEA). In additional experiments, to determine cell viability, cells were supplemented after 5 h with 1 mm dimethyloxalylglycine. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) were grown in DMEM (D6546; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. For luciferase assays, HEK cells were transfected in 24-well plates with a constant amount of 900 ng of total DNA composed of 300 ng of test plasmid, 300 ng of reference plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega), and 300 ng of pCDNA3.1 or pATF4 using the TurboFect transfection reagent (2 μl/well; Thermo Scientific). Cells were lysed after 24 h, and activity was assessed using Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturers' instructions. In all cases the relative luciferase activity of the test plasmid is shown, comparing the activity of the test plasmid to that of the co-transfected reference plasmid, pRL-TK, and represents the average of triplicate biological samples. ChIP assays were performed using the SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit (Magnetic Beads; Cell Signaling). Briefly, T175 tissue culture flasks containing ∼4 × 107 HEK cells were transfected with 25 μg of DNA with 50 μl of Lipofectamine. The DNA was composed of 12.5 μg of −764bpluc-IE and 12.5 μg of either pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pATF4. Cells were incubated overnight in 25 ml of culture medium and subsequently cross-linked by the addition of 675 μl of 37% formaldehyde (10 min at room temperature) before the addition of 2.5 ml of 10× glycine (provided in the kit) and further incubation for 5 min. Subsequent steps were performed exactly as per the manufacturers' instructions. 10 μg of chromatin was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed using positive control antibody to histone H3 (10 μl), negative control normal rabbit IgG (1 μl; both provided in the kit), or antibody to ATF4 (5 μl; D4B8, Cell Signaling). PCR conditions used to amplify site A and site B were 95 °C for 2 min then 23 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30s followed by 72 °C for 7 min. PCR conditions used for negative control RPL30 primers (provided in the kit) were 95 °C for 2 min, then 28 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30 s followed by 72 °C for 7 min. All PCR reactions were performed in 20-μl reaction volumes using REDTaq® ReadyMix™ PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma) and final primer concentrations of 200 nm (see Table 1 for primer sequences).TABLE 1A list of the primers used to measure gene expression in HUVECs and CMECs as well as primers used for cloningPrimer nameForward (5′-3′)Reverse (5′-3′)qPCRCSE (human)ACACTTTTATGTCACCATATTTCCAGTGTTGCAGAATACATAGAAATATCAGCCSE (mouse)GAGGATGAACAGGACCTTCTTCAGCTTTGACTCGAACTTTTAAGGATF4 (human)TCTCCAGCGACAAGGCTAACAATCTGTCCCGGAGAAGGNox1 (human)AAGGATCCTCCGGTTTTACCTTTGGATGGGTGCATAACAANox2 (human)CATTCAACCTCTGCCACCATCCCCAGCCAAACCAGAATNox4 (human)TCCTCGGTGGAAACTTTTGTCCACAACAGAAAACACCAACTNox4 (human/mouse)aUsed to detect both mouse and human Nox4 in Nox4 overexpression experiments.GCCAACGAAGGGGTTAAACATGGCCCTTGGTTATACAGCAPHD4 (human)ACTTCATCCGAACCCTCAGCGCGCTGTAACCCCTTCATCTPHD4 (Rat)ACCTGGCACAGATGAAAGGCATCCCCCATGCAACGAGTAXBP1 (human)CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGGAGGGTCCAAGTTGTCCAGAATGCHRI (human)CCACTTCGTTCAAGACAGGTGGCTAAACTCGTCACTACAAGTGAAAβ-A-ctin (human)GCGAGAAGATGACCGAGATCATCACCGGAGTCCATCACGATβ-Actin(mouse)CTGTCGAGTCGCGTCCACCCATGCCGGAGCCGTTGTCGACβ−Actin (rat)CGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCATGGTACGACCAGAGGGATACAGCloning6414FAGAGAGGGTACCTGAAGTATGCTGCCCCTC764FAGAGAGGGTACCCTTTTAGGAAGCTGCCAGp191RAGAGAGCTCGAGAGAAGAAGAGAGGAAAAGAACACCSE Prox EnhTTAATGGATCCGTGAGCTGGGTCTGTCTGTTAATGGATCCCAGAGGTGAATCACCTGAGa Used to detect both mouse and human Nox4 in Nox4 overexpression experiments. Open table in a new tab Genomic CSE promoter fragment were generated by PCR with Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) using a Pac clone (RP11–42O15, obtained from BACPAC Resources Center, CHORI) as the template. The forward primers (6414F and 764F) incorporated a KpnI restriction within their 5′ ends, whereas the common reverse primer (+191R) incorporated an XhoI restriction site. KpnI/XhoI-digested fragments were subcloned into the KpnI-XhoI cloning sites of pGL4.22 (Promega) to generate −6414bp-luc and −764bp-luc. The 2.4-kb intronic enhancer fragment was generated using the primers CSE Prox Enh F/R, which had BamHI sites incorporated into their 5′ ends. After digestion with BamHI, this fragment was inserted into the unique BamHI site downstream of the SV40 late poly(A) signal in −764-bp luc to generate −764bp-luc-IE. See Table 1 for sequences of cloning primers. 50 μl of streptavidin-coated dynabeads (Invitrogen) were washed 5 times in HBSS and incubated at room temperature with biotinylated antiCD31 antibody (BAF3628, R&D Systems; 50 μg/ml) for 1 h on a tube rotator then washed 3 times in HBSS. Two to three hearts from age-matched WT and eNox4 Tg mice were pooled according to genotype and finely chopped into 2-mm pieces in HBSS. HBSS was removed, and heart pieces were washed twice more with HBSS to remove blood before digestion in 10 ml of HBSS containing 100 mg/ml collagenase A (10103578001, Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C in a shaker for 20 min. Collagenase A solution was removed and supplemented with 1 ml of calf serum. A fresh solution of HBSS containing collagenase A was added to the remaining heart pieces. This process was repeated twice more. Digests were pooled, passed through a 2-μm cell strainer, and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 450 μl of HBSS, added to the previously prepared antiCD31-conjugated dynabeads, and placed on a tube rotator for 3 h at room temperature. After this any unbound cells were removed by washing three times with HBSS. Cells bound to the beads were then lysed in 700 μl of qiazol reagent (for RNA analyses; Qiagen) or lysed directly into 50 μl of protein lysis buffer. RNA was prepared from tissue-cultured cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) and from primary mouse endothelial cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA generation and QPCR were performed as described previously (23Brewer A.C.

XBP-1 spicing was assessed by PCR using primers as described in Table 1 on cDNA generated from HUVEC overexpressing Nox4 for 24 h. PCR reactions were set up using RedTaq ready mix™ and run as follows: 35 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 56 °C), and extension (30 s at 72 °C). The resultant PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels. Protein samples were prepared from cultured cells or homogenized tissue, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to membranes, and probed with appropriate antibodies (see Table 2) as described previously (22Murray T.V.

The thoracic aorta was removed and immersed in cold (4 °C) Krebs-Ringer solution (2.5 mm CaCl2·2H20, 118 mm NaCl, 11 mm glucose d(+), 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4). Aortae were cut into 3-mm-long rings and were mounted in a Danish Myo Technology wire tension myograph. Rings were bathed in Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 °C and supplied with a continuous gas mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Before treatment vessels were stretched to the optimal pre-tension condition (∼2 millinewtons) using the Danish Myo Technology normalization modules. Rings were incubated for 30 min in Krebs before the addition of 20 mm propargylglycine (PPG) for 30 min. Vehicle controls composed of Krebs-Ringer solution were run alongside PPG-treated vessels. This was then followed by a cumulative dose-dependent contraction to PE up to 30 μm. Results were analyzed using LabChart software. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t test and by one- or two-way analysis of variance as indicated. p < 0.05 using Tukey's post hoc test or Student's t test was considered significant. We (and many other groups) have shown previously that overexpression of Nox4 in HUVECs results in an increase in H2O2 generation (15Ray R. Murdoch C.E. Wang M. Santos C.X. Zhang M. Alom-Ruiz S.

To investigate whether Nox4-dependent redox signaling might participate in the regulation of CSE expression in endothelial cells, Nox4 was mis-expressed in HUVECs. Adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of Nox4 (AdNox4) resulted in a significant and robust up-regulation of both CSE mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, A and B). This increased accumulation of CSE mRNA upon Nox4 overexpression was found to be both time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1, B and C). The efficacy of ROS in the activation of CSE in HUVEC was also demonstrated, as exogenous administration of H2O2 resulted in a significant increase in CSE expression after 1 h (Fig. 1D). Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nox4 in HUVECs resulted in a significant decrease in both CSE mRNA and protein (Fig. 1E). The membrane-associated protein, p22phox is an obligate partner of vascular Noxs in the generation of ROS (20Martyn K.D. Frederick L.M. von Loehneysen K. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G.

https://openalex.org/W2183664293,"Mobile populations present unique challenges to malaria control and elimination efforts. Each year, a large number of individuals travel to northwest Amhara Region, Ethiopia to seek seasonal employment on large-scale farms. Agricultural areas typically report the heaviest malaria burden within Amhara thereby placing migrants at high risk of infection. Yet little is known about these seasonal migrants and their malaria-related risk factors.In July 2013, a venue-based survey of 605 migrant laborers 18 years or older was conducted in two districts of North Gondar zone, Amhara. The study population was predominantly male (97.7%) and young (mean age 22.8 years). Plasmodium prevalence by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 12.0%; One quarter (28.3%) of individuals were anemic (hemoglobin <13 g/dl). Nearly all participants (95.6%) originated from within Amhara Region, with half (51.6%) coming from within North Gondar zone. Around half (51.2%) slept in temporary shelters, while 20.5% regularly slept outside. Only 11.9% of participants had access to a long lasting insecticidal net (LLIN). Reported net use the previous night was 8.8% overall but 74.6% among those with LLIN access. Nearly one-third (30.1%) reported having fever within the past two weeks, of whom 31.3% sought care. Cost and distance were the main reported barriers to seeking care. LLIN access (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30, P = 0.04) and malaria knowledge (OR = 0.50, P = 0.02) were significantly associated with reduced Plasmodium infection among migrants, with a similar but non-significant trend observed for reported net use the previous night (OR = 0.16, P = 0.14).High prevalence of malaria and anemia were observed among a young population that originated from relatively proximate areas. Low access to care and low IRS and LLIN coverage likely place migrant workers at significant risk of malaria in this area and their return home may facilitate parasite transport to other areas. Strategies specifically tailored to migrant farm workers are needed to support malaria control and elimination activities in Ethiopia."

The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of Chlamydiaceae in Swiss fattening pigs by applying sensitive and specific detection methods and to correlate prior antibiotic treatment and farm related factors with differences in prevalence. Conjunctival and fecal swabs were collected from 636 pigs in 29 Swiss fattening pig farms with and without antibiotic treatment, at the beginning and the end of the fattening period. The swabs were screened by real-time PCR for Chlamydiaceae. For the chlamydial detection and species-identification, a DNA-microarray analysis was performed. All farms were positive for Chlamydiaceae with 94.3 and 92.0% prevalence in fecal swabs as well as 45.9 and 32.6% in conjunctival swabs at the first and second time points, respectively. Antibiotic treatment could not clear the infection on herd level. Potential contact with wild boars was a significant risk factor, while hygiene criteria did not influence chlamydial prevalence. A correlation of chlamydial positivity to diarrhea, but not to conjunctivitis was evident. Chlamydia suis was the predominant species. Mixed infections with C. suis and C. pecorum were common, with a substantial increase in C. pecorum positivity at the end of the fattening period, and this finding was associated with ruminant contact. C. abortus was detected in one conjunctival swab. In this study, C. suis inhabited the intestinal tract of nearly all examined pigs, implying a long-term infection. C. pecorum was also common and might be transmitted to pigs by ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W2275091148,"How the same DNA sequences can function in the three-dimensional architecture of interphase nucleus, fold in the very compact structure of metaphase chromosomes and go precisely back to the original interphase architecture in the following cell cycle remains an unresolved question to this day. The strategy used to address this issue was to analyze the correlations between chromosome architecture and the compositional patterns of DNA sequences spanning a size range from a few hundreds to a few thousands Kilobases. This is a critical range that encompasses isochores, interphase chromatin domains and boundaries, and chromosomal bands. The solution rests on the following key points: 1) the transition from the looped domains and sub-domains of interphase chromatin to the 30-nm fiber loops of early prophase chromosomes goes through the unfolding into an extended chromatin structure (probably a 10-nm ""beads-on-a-string"" structure); 2) the architectural proteins of interphase chromatin, such as CTCF and cohesin sub-units, are retained in mitosis and are part of the discontinuous protein scaffold of mitotic chromosomes; 3) the conservation of the link between architectural proteins and their binding sites on DNA through the cell cycle explains the ""mitotic memory"" of interphase architecture and the reversibility of the interphase to mitosis process. The results presented here also lead to a general conclusion which concerns the existence of correlations between the isochore organization of the genome and the architecture of chromosomes from interphase to metaphase."

Here, we measured the effects of omega-3 (n-3), n-6 and n-9 fatty acids on the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and naïve T cells. Spleen DCs from BALB/c mice were cultured in vitro with ovalbumin (OVA) with 50 μM fatty acids; α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid or oleic acid and thereafter OVA-specific DO11.10 T cells were added to the cultures. Fatty acids were taken up by the DCs, as shown by gas chromatography analysis. After culture with arachidonic acid or DHA CD11c+ CD11b+ and CD11c+ CD11bneg DCs expressed more CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and PDL-1, while IAd remained unchanged. However, fewer T cells co-cultured with these DCs proliferated (CellTrace Violetlow) and expressed CD69 or CD25, while more were necrotic (7AAD+). We noted an increased proportion of T cells with a regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype, i.e., when gating on CD4+ FoxP3+ CTLA-4+, CD4+ FoxP3+ Helios+ or CD4+ FoxP3+ PD-1+, in co-cultures with arachidonic acid- or DHA-primed DCs relative to control cultures. The proportion of putative Tregs was inversely correlated to T-cell proliferation, indicating a suppressive function of these cells. With arachidonic acid DCs produced higher levels of prostaglandin E2 while T cells produced lower amounts of IL-10 and IFNγ. In conclusion arachidonic acid and DHA induced up-regulation of activation markers on DCs. However arachidonic acid- and DHA-primed DCs reduced T-cell proliferation and increased the proportion of T cells expressing FoxP3, indicating that these fatty acids can promote induction of regulatory T cells."

Like other GTPases, Rab32/38 function as switch molecules that cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active form; the cycle is thought to be regulated by an activating enzyme, guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and an inactivating enzyme, GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which stimulates the GTPase activity of Rab32/38. Although BLOC-3 has already been identified as a Rab32/38-specific GEF that regulates the trafficking of tyrosinase and Tyrp1, no physiological GAP for Rab32/38 in melanocytes has ever been identified, and it has remained unclear whether Rab32/38 is involved in the trafficking of dopachrome tautomerase, another melanogenic enzyme, in mouse melanocytes. In this study we investigated RUTBC1, which was originally characterized as a Rab9-binding protein and GAP for Rab32 and Rab33B in vitro, and the results demonstrated that RUTBC1 functions as a physiological GAP for Rab32/38 in the trafficking of all three melanogenic enzymes in mouse melanocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2193074097,"This study had two main goals: to examine the structure of co-occurring peer bullying experiences among adolescents in South Korea from the perspective of victims and to determine the effects of bullying on suicidal behavior, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, among adolescents.This study used data gathered from 4,410 treatment-seeking adolescents at their initial visits to 31 local mental health centers in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The structure of peer bullying was examined using latent class analysis (LCA) to classify participants' relevant experiences. Then, a binomial logistic regression adjusted by propensity scores was conducted to identify relationships between experiences of being bullied and suicidal behaviors.The LCA of experiences with bullying revealed two distinct classes of bullying: physical and non-physical. Adolescents who experienced physical bullying were 3.05 times more likely to attempt suicide than those who were not bullied. Victims of (non-physical) cyber bullying were 2.94 times more likely to attempt suicide than were those who were not bullied.Both physical and non-physical bullying were associated with suicide attempts, with similar effect sizes. Schools and mental health professionals should be more attentive than they currently are to non-physical bullying."
https://openalex.org/W2186153945,"Background Community based breastfeeding promotion programmes have been shown to be effective in increasing breastfeeding prevalence. However, there is limited data on the cost-effectiveness of these programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a breastfeeding promotion intervention targeting mothers and their 0 to 6 month old children. Methods Data were obtained from a community randomized trial conducted in Uganda between 2006–2008, and supplemented with evidence from several studies in sub-Saharan Africa. In the trial, peer counselling was offered to women in intervention clusters. In the control and intervention clusters, women could access standard health facility breastfeeding promotion services (HFP). Thus, two methods of breastfeeding promotion were compared: community based peer counselling (in addition to HFP) and standard HFP alone. A Markov model was used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the two strategies. The model estimated changes in breastfeeding prevalence and disability adjusted life years. Costs were estimated from a provider perspective. Uncertainty around the results was characterized using one-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Findings Peer counselling more than doubled the breastfeeding prevalence as reported by mothers, but there was no observable impact on diarrhoea prevalence. Estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were US$68 per month of exclusive or predominant breastfeeding and U$11,353 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The findings were robust to parameter variations in the sensitivity analyses Conclusions Our strategy to promote community based peer counselling is unlikely to be cost-effective in reducing diarrhoea prevalence and mortality in Uganda, because its cost per DALY averted far exceeds the commonly assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of three times Uganda’s GDP per capita (US$1653). However, since the intervention significantly increases prevalence of exclusive or predominant breastfeeding, it could be adopted in Uganda if benefits other than reducing the occurrence of diarrhoea are believed to be important."

However, the regulation of Bach2 expression and its activity in the immune cells are still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Bach2 mRNA expression decreased in Pten-deficient primary B cells. Bach2 was phosphorylated in primary B cells, which was increased upon the activation of the B cell receptor by an anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody or CD40 ligand.

We identified multiple new phosphorylation sites of Bach2 by mass spectrometry analysis of epitope-tagged Bach2 expressed in the mature B cell line BAL17.

Immunother. 2010; 59: 489-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) families have been well studied in the context of the immune system in part due to their clear and established association with the upstream signaling cascades. In contrast, although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is critically important for the regulation of immune cells, its downstream transcription factors are still unclear except for the Foxo family (4Okkenhaug K. Signaling by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase family in immune cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 675-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the possibility that the transcription factor Bach2 might be regulated in B cells by the PI3K pathway. Salient features of Bach2 relevant to this study are as follows. Bach2 regulates the immune cells at multiple points. During the development of B cells from the progenitor cells, Bach2, together with its related factor Bach1, represses the expression of myeloid genes. The repression of the myeloid program is critical for the progenitor cells to be committed to the B cell fate (5Itoh-Nakadai A. Hikota R. Muto A. Kometani K. Watanabe-Matsui M. Sato Y. Kobayashi M. Nakamura A. Miura Y. Yano Y. Tashiro S. Sun J. Ikawa T. Ochiai K. Kurosaki T. Igarashi K. The transcription repressors Bach2 and Bach1 promote B cell development by repressing the myeloid program.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At the stage of pre-B cells, the successful completion of antibody heavy chain gene rearrangement is monitored by the lack or presence of pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR 2The abbreviations used are: BCR, B cell receptor; CSR, class switch recombination; GRN, gene regulatory network; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; SILAC, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture; CIAP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; CID, collision-induced dissociation; IT, ion trap; FT, Fourier transform; Pten, phosphatase and tensin; CLS, cytoplasmic localization signal. checkpoint). Bach2 plays a critical role in negative selection (i.e. elimination of cells unsuccessful in the rearrangement) at the pre-BCR checkpoint (6Swaminathan S. Huang C. Geng H. Chen Z. Harvey R. Kang H. Ng C. Titz B. Hurtz C. Sadiyah M.F. Nowak D. Thoennissen G.B. Rand V. Graeber T.G.

Med. 2013; 19: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In mature B cells, Bach2 is required for the class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation that diversify the effector function and antigen affinity, respectively, of antibody molecules in response to antigen and other stimulation (7Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. The transcriptional programme of antibody class switching involves the repressor Bach2.Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Bach2 promotes CSR by delaying the expression of Blimp-1, the master regulator of plasma cell differentiation, and thereby securing a time window for CSR before the terminal differentiation to plasma cells (8Muto A. Ochiai K. Kimura Y. Itoh-Nakadai A. Calame K.L. Ikebe D. Tashiro S. Igarashi K.

An integral view of the Bach2 functions in B cells has been proposed as a gene regulatory network (GRN) consisting of Bach2 and other transcription factor genes (12Igarashi K. Ochiai K.

Bach2 is also a critical regulator in T cells, where it is required for limiting effector T cell differentiation and promoting the generation of regulatory T cells and memory T cells (13Roychoudhuri R.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In both B and T cells, Bach2 represses the expression of the Blimp-1 gene (Prdm1) by directly binding to its enhancer regions. In addition, Bach2 targets many of the super enhancers associated with the genes for the cytokine-signaling pathways (16Vahedi G. Kanno Y. Furumoto Y. Jiang K. Parker S.C. Erdos M.R. Davis S.R.

Super-enhancers delineate disease-associated regulatory nodes in T cells.Nature. 2015; 520: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Outside of the acquired immune system, Bach2 is important for the maturation and function of alveolar macrophages that maintain the homeostasis of the lung (17Nakamura A. Ebina-Shibuya R.

Two lines of observations suggest the possibility that Bach2 may be regulated downstream of the PI3K pathway. First, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), which antagonizes the PI3K activity by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to regenerate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is required for CSR. B cells deficient for Pten show a specific defect in CSR (26Suzuki A. Kaisho T. Ohishi M. Tsukio-Yamaguchi M. Tsubata T. Koni P.A. Sasaki T. Mak T.W. Nakano T. Critical roles of Pten in B cell homeostasis and immunoglobulin class switch recombination.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which is very similar to that of Bach2-deficient mice (7Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. The transcriptional programme of antibody class switching involves the repressor Bach2.Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Second, human BACH2 is phosphorylated downstream of the PI3K, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in lymphoma cells (27Yoshida C. Yoshida F. Sears D.E. Hart S.M. Ikebe D. Muto A. Basu S. Igarashi K. Melo J.V. Bcr-Abl signaling through the PI-3/S6 kinase pathway inhibits nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Bach2, which represses the antiapoptotic factor heme oxygenase-1.Blood. 2007; 109: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when mouse mature B cells are activated in vitro, a portion of them show cytoplasmic accumulation of Bach2, which are becoming IgM-secreting plasma cells without undergoing CSR (8Muto A. Ochiai K. Kimura Y. Itoh-Nakadai A. Calame K.L. Ikebe D. Tashiro S. Igarashi K. Bach2 represses plasma cell gene regulatory network in B cells to promote antibody class switch.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 4048-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These observations have suggested that the execution of CSR may be regulated by tuning the activity of Bach2. However, the exact phosphorylation status of Bach2 in activated B cells and its connection with upstream signaling have not been systematically analyzed. Connecting the Bach2 GRN with intracellular signaling pathways will be important to understand the immune cells at the level of systems biology. In this study, we revisited the putative connection between the PI3K pathway and Bach2 using primary mouse B cells lacking Pten or treated with various chemical inhibitors of the pathway. We also carried out a detailed mass spectrometry analysis of epitope-tagged Bach2 in B cells, finding a total of 72 phosphorylation sites. Among these sites, a single site (serine 535) was critical for promoting its cytoplasmic accumulation and reducing its repressor activity in B cells. A model in which the critical function of Bach2 in B cells is integrated with the PI3K pathway is discussed, which can be extended into T cell biology. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. The Ptenflox/flox mice (26Suzuki A. Kaisho T. Ohishi M. Tsukio-Yamaguchi M. Tsubata T. Koni P.A. Sasaki T. Mak T.W. Nakano T.

Like many health systems in Africa, this is largely because demand for healthcare is outstripping available human and material resource capacity of healthcare facilities and new investment is insufficient. In the light of these demand and supply constraints, systematic community engagement (SCE) in healthcare quality assessment can be a feasible and cost effective option to augment existing quality improvement interventions. SCE entails structured use of existing community groups to assess healthcare quality in health facilities. Identified quality gaps are discussed with healthcare providers, improvements identified and rewards provided if the quality gaps are closed.This paper evaluates whether or not SCE, through the assessment of health service quality, improves patient safety and risk reduction efforts by staff in healthcare facilities.A randomized control trail was conducted in 64 primary healthcare facilities in the Greater Accra and Western regions of Ghana. Patient risk assessments were conducted in 32 randomly assigned intervention and control facilities. Multivariate multiple regression test was used to determine effect of the SCE interventions on staff efforts towards reducing patient risk. Spearman correlation test was used to ascertain associations between types of community groups engaged and risk assessment scores of healthcare facilities.Clinic staff efforts towards increasing patient safety and reducing risk improved significantly in intervention facilities especially in the areas of leadership/accountability (Coef. = 10.4, p<0.05) and staff competencies (Coef. = 7.1, p<0.05). Improvement in service utilization and health resources could not be attributed to the interventions because these were outside the control of the study and might have been influenced by institutional or national level developments between the baseline and follow-up period. Community groups that were gender balanced, religious/faith-based, and had structured leadership appeared to be better options for effective SCE in healthcare quality assessment.Community engagement in healthcare quality assessment is a feasible client-centered quality improvement option that should be discussed for possible scale-up in Ghana and other resource poor countries in Africa."

Although TDG is essential for active demethylation in embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, it is hardly expressed in mouse zygotes and dispensable in pronuclear DNA demethylation. To search for other factors that might contribute to demethylation in mammalian cells, we performed a functional genomics screen based on a methylated luciferase reporter assay. UNG2, one of the glycosylases known to excise uracil residues from DNA, was found to reduce DNA methylation, thus activating transcription of a methylation-silenced reporter gene when co-transfected with Tet2 into HEK293T cells. Interestingly, UNG2 could decrease 5caC from the genomic DNA and a reporter plasmid in transfected cells, like TDG.

CS group B protein (CSB), which is the gene product of one of the genes responsible for CS, belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 DNA-dependent ATPase family and has an ATPase domain and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) in the central region and the C-terminal region, respectively. The C-terminal region containing the UBD is essential for the functions of CSB. In this study, we generated several CSB deletion mutants and analyzed the functions of the C-terminal region of CSB in TC-NER. Not only the UBD but also the C-terminal 30-amino acid residues were required for UV light resistance and TC-NER. This region was needed for the interaction of CSB with RNA polymerase II, the translocation of CS group A protein to the nuclear matrix, and the association of CSB with chromatin after UV irradiation. CSB was modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier 2/3 in a UV light-dependent manner. This modification was abolished in a CSB mutant lacking the C-terminal 30 amino acid residues. However, the substitution of lysine residues in this region with arginine did not affect SUMOylation or TC-NER. By contrast, substitution of a lysine residue in the N-terminal region with arginine decreased SUMOylation and resulted in cells with defects in TC-NER. These results indicate that both the most C-terminal region and SUMOylation are important for the functions of CSB in TC-NER.

Due to their close relationship among their frequencies and DNA damages, they are considered excellent markers of exposure in eukaryotes. However, poor data has been found in literature concerning their genesis, differential occurrence and their life span. In this study, we use markers of cell viability; genotoxicity and cellular turn over in order to shed light to these events. Tilapia and their blood were exposed to cadmium in acute exposure and in vitro assays. They were analyzed using flow cytometry for oxidative stress and membrane disruption, optical microscopy for erythrocytic nuclear alteration, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry for cadmium content in aquaria water, blood and cytochemical and analytical electron microscopy techniques for the hemocateretic aspects. The results showed a close relationship among the total nuclear alterations and cadmium content in the total blood and melanomacrophage centres area, mismatching reactive oxygen species and membrane damages. Moreover, nuclear alterations frequencies (vacuolated, condensed and blebbed) showed to be associated to cadmium exposure whereas others (lobed and bud) were associated to depuration period. Decrease on nuclear alterations frequencies was also associated with hemosiderin increase inside spleen and head kidney macrophages mainly during depurative processes. These data disclosure in temporal fashion the main processes that drive the nuclear alterations frequencies and their relationship with some cellular and systemic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2182458358,"Tree species distributions associated with rainfall are among the most prominent patterns in tropical forests. Understanding the mechanisms shaping these patterns is important to project impacts of global climate change on tree distributions and diversity in the tropics. Beside direct effects of water availability, additional factors co-varying with rainfall have been hypothesized to play an important role, including pest pressure and light availability. While low water availability is expected to exclude drought-intolerant wet forest species from drier forests (physiological tolerance hypothesis), high pest pressure or low light availability are hypothesized to exclude dry forest species from wetter forests (pest pressure gradient and light availability hypothesis, respectively). To test these hypotheses at the seed-to-seedling transition, the potentially most critical stage for species discrimination, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment combined with a pest exclosure treatment at a wet and a dry forest site in Panama with seeds of 26 species with contrasting origin. Establishment success after one year did not reflect species distribution patterns. However, in the wet forest, wet origin species had a home advantage over dry forest species through higher growth rates. At the same time, drought limited survival of wet origin species in the dry forest, supporting the physiological tolerance hypothesis. Together these processes sort species over longer time frames, and exclude species outside their respective home range. Although we found pronounced effects of pests and some effects of light availability on the seedlings, they did not corroborate the pest pressure nor light availability hypotheses at the seed-to-seedling transition. Our results underline that changes in water availability due to climate change will have direct consequences on tree regeneration and distributions along tropical rainfall gradients, while indirect effects of light and pests are less important."
https://openalex.org/W2184360514,"The mechanisms that lead to variation in human skin and hair color are not fully understood. To better understand the molecular control of skin and hair color variation, we modulated the expression of Tyrosinase (Tyr), which controls the rate-limiting step of melanogenesis, by expressing a single-copy, tetracycline-inducible shRNA against Tyr in mice. Moderate depletion of TYR was sufficient to alter the appearance of the mouse coat in black, agouti, and yellow coat color backgrounds, even though TYR depletion did not significantly inhibit accumulation of melanin within the mouse hair. Ultra-structural studies revealed that the reduction of Tyr inhibited the accumulation of terminal melanosomes, and inhibited the expression of genes that regulate melanogenesis. These results indicate that color in skin and hair is determined not only by the total amount of melanin within the hair, but also by the relative accumulation of mature melanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2259137442,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes Johne’s disease (JD) in cattle and other animals. The hallmark of MAP infection in the early stages is a strong protective cell-mediated immune response (Th1-type), characterized by antigen-specific γ-interferon (IFN-γ). The Th1 response wanes with disease progression and is supplanted by a non-protective humoral immune response (Th2-type). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is believed to play a critical role in the regulation of host immune responses to MAP infection and potentially orchestrate the reversal of Th1/Th2 immune dominance during disease progression. However, how its role correlates with MAP infection remains to be completely deciphered. We developed mathematical models to explain probable mechanisms for IL-10 involvement in MAP infection. We tested our models with IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, and MAP fecal shedding data collected from calves that were experimentally infected and followed over a period of 360 days in the study of Stabel and Robbe-Austerman (2011). Our models predicted that IL-10 can have different roles during MAP infection, (i) it can suppress the Th1 expression, (ii) can enhance Th2 (IL-4) expression, and (iii) can suppress the Th1 expression in synergy with IL-4. In these predicted roles, suppression of Th1 responses was correlated with increased number of MAP. We also predicted that Th1-mediated responses (IFN-γ) can lead to high expression of IL-10 and that infection burden regulates Th2 suppression by the Th1 response. Our models highlight areas where more experimental data is required to refine our model assumptions, and further test and investigate the role of IL-10 in MAP infection."
https://openalex.org/W2265954062,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting children < 5 years old. Genes significantly associated with KD mostly involve cardiovascular, immune, and inflammatory responses. Recent studies have observed stronger associations for KD risk with multiple genes compared to individual genes. Therefore, we investigated whether gene combinations influenced KD susceptibility or coronary artery lesion (CAL) formation. We examined 384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 159 immune-related candidate genes in DNA samples from KD patients with CAL (n = 73), KD patients without CAL (n = 153), and cohort controls (n = 575). Individual SNPs were first assessed by univariate analysis (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA). We used multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) to examine individual SNPs in one-, two-, and three-locus best fit models. UVA identified 53 individual SNPs that were significantly associated with KD risk or CAL formation (p < 0.10), while 35 individual SNPs were significantly associated using MVA (p ≤ 0.05). Significant associations in MDR analysis were only observed for the two-locus models after permutation testing (p ≤ 0.05). In logistic regression, combined possession of PDE2A (rs341058) and CYFIP2 (rs767007) significantly increased KD susceptibility (OR = 3.54; p = 4.14 x 10−7), while combinations of LOC100133214 (rs2517892) and IL2RA (rs3118470) significantly increased the risk of CAL in KD patients (OR = 5.35; p = 7.46 x 10−5).

The enrolled eyes were divided into two groups, based on the presence of optic neuritis (ON) in the history (MSON+ group, n = 36 and MSON- group, n = 31). Data of 29 eyes of 24 healthy subjects (H) were used as controls. A total of seven intraretinal layers were segmented and thickness as well as optical parameters such as contrast, fractal dimension, layer index and total reflectance were measured. Mixed-model ANOVA analysis was used for statistical comparisons.Significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer complex (GCL+IPL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC, RNFL+GCL+IPL) was observed between study groups in all comparisons. Significant difference was found in contrast in the RNFL, GCL+IPL, GCC, inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer plexiform layer when comparing MSON+ to the other groups. Higher fractal dimension values were observed in GCL+IPL and INL layers when comparing H vs. MSON+ groups. A significant difference was found in layer index in the RNFL, GCL+IPL and GCC layers in all comparisons. A significant difference was observed in total reflectance in the RNFL, GCL+IPL and GCC layers between the three examination groups.Texture and optical properties of the retinal tissue undergo pronounced changes in MS even without optic neuritis.

This is used clinically in Rhesus prophylaxis, where administration of IgG anti-RhD prevents RhD-negative women from becoming immunized against RhD-positive fetal erythrocytes aquired transplacentally. The mechanisms by which IgG suppresses antibody responses are poorly understood. We have here addressed whether complement or Fc-receptors for IgG (FcγRs) are required for IgG-mediated suppression. IgG, specific for sheep red blood cells (SRBC), was administered to mice together with SRBC and the antibody responses analyzed. IgG was able to suppress early IgM- as well as longterm IgG-responses in wildtype mice equally well as in mice lacking FcγRIIB (FcγRIIB knockout mice) or FcγRI, III, and IV (FcRγ knockout mice). Moreover, IgG was able to suppress early IgM responses equally well in mice lacking C1q (C1qA knockout mice), C3 (C3 knockout mice), or complement receptors 1 and 2 (Cr2 knockout mice) as in wildtype mice. Owing to the previously described severely impaired IgG responses in the complement deficient mice, it was difficult to assess whether passively administered IgG further decreased their IgG response. In conclusion, Fc-receptor binding or complement-activation by IgG does not seem to be required for its ability to suppress antibody responses to xenogeneic erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2266458537,"The present study examined age-related differences in multisensory integration and the effect of spatial disparity on the sound-induced flash illusion—-an illusion used in previous research to assess age-related differences in multisensory integration. Prior to participation in the study, both younger and older participants demonstrated their ability to detect 1–2 visual flashes and 1–2 auditory beep presented unimodally. After passing the pre-test, participants were then presented 1–2 flashes paired with 0–2 beeps that originated from one of five speakers positioned equidistantly 100cm from the participant. One speaker was positioned directly below the screen, two speakers were positioned 50cm to the left and right from the center of the screen, and two more speakers positioned to the left and right 100cm from the center of the screen. Participants were told to report the number of flashes presented and to ignore the beeps. Both age groups showed a significant effect of the beeps on the perceived number of flashes. However, neither younger nor older individuals showed any significant effect of spatial disparity on the sound-induced flash illusion. The presence of a congruent number of beeps increased accuracy for both older and younger individuals. Reaction time data was also analyzed. As expected, older individuals showed significantly longer reaction times when compared to younger individuals. In addition, both older and younger individuals showed a significant increase in reaction time for fusion trials, where two flashes and one beep are perceived as a single flash, as compared to congruent single flash trials. This increase in reaction time was not found for fission trials, where one flash and two beeps were perceived as two flashes. This suggests that processing may differ for the two forms for fission as compared to fusion illusions."
https://openalex.org/W2189259067,"Not all cognitive collaborations are equally effective. We tested whether friendship and communication influenced collaborative efficiency by randomly assigning participants to complete a cognitive task with a friend or non-friend, while visible to their partner or separated by a partition. Collaborative efficiency was indexed by comparing each pair’s performance to an optimal individual performance model of the same two people. The outcome was a strong interaction between friendship and partner visibility. Friends collaborated more efficiently than non-friends when visible to one another, but a partition that prevented pair members from seeing one another reduced the collaborative efficiency of friends and non-friends to a similar lower level. Secondary measures suggested that verbal communication differences, but not psychophysiological arousal, contributed to these effects. Analysis of covariance indicated that females contributed more than males to overall levels of collaboration, but that the interaction of friendship and visibility was independent of that effect. These findings highlight the critical role of partner visibility in the collaborative success of friends."
https://openalex.org/W2181443383,"Pseudomonas species are opportunistically pathogenic to humans, yet closely related species are used in biotechnology applications. In order to screen for the pathogenic potential of strains considered for biotechnology applications, several Pseudomonas strains (P.aeruginosa (Pa), P.fluorescens (Pf), P.putida (Pp), P.stutzeri (Ps)) were compared using functional virulence and toxicity assays. Most Pa strains and Ps grew at temperatures between 28°C and 42°C. However, Pf and Pp strains were the most antibiotic resistant, with ciprofloxacin and colistin being the most effective of those tested. No strain was haemolytic on sheep blood agar. Almost all Pa, but not other test strains, produced a pyocyanin-like chromophore, and caused cytotoxicity towards cultured human HT29 cells. Murine endotracheal exposures indicated that the laboratory reference strain, PAO1, was most persistent in the lungs. Only Pa strains induced pro-inflammatory and inflammatory responses, as measured by elevated cytokines and pulmonary Gr-1 -positive cells. Serum amyloid A was elevated at ≥ 48 h post-exposure by only some Pa strains. No relationship was observed between strains and levels of peripheral leukocytes. The species designation or isolation source may not accurately reflect pathogenic potential, since the clinical strain Pa10752 was relatively nonvirulent, but the industrial strain Pa31480 showed comparable virulence to PAO1. Functional assays involving microbial growth, cytotoxicity and murine immunological responses may be most useful for identifying problematic Pseudomonas strains being considered for biotechnology applications."
https://openalex.org/W2185785890,"MRSA poses a considerable public health threat to the community. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of MRSA carriage and determine factors that were associated with MRSA carriage among outpatients who had used antibiotics in the previous three months and who lived in a high-density livestock farming area along the Dutch-German border.Cross-sectional prevalence study carried out between November 2011 and June 2012. Nasal swabs and questionnaires were collected in patients (>4 years) who had used antibiotics in the previous three months from twelve Dutch General Practitioners (GPs), seven German GPs and two German outpatient urologists. To assess nasal carriage, swabs were analyzed using selective MRSA agars after broth enrichment. MRSA positive samples were spa typed.Data were collected from 513 GP outpatients in the Netherlands, 261 GP outpatients in Germany and 200 urologist outpatients in Germany. The overall prevalence of MRSA carriage was 0.8%, 1.1% and 2.0%, respectively. In the GP outpatient populations, the prevalence was similar in both countries (0.8% and 1.1%, respectively, p = 0.879), all spa types were indicative for livestock-associated MRSA (4xt011 in the Netherlands; 2xt034 and t011 in Germany) and being a farmer, living on or near (<5km) to a farm were associated with MRSA carriage. In the urologist outpatient population, the prevalence was higher (2.0%), all spa types were indicative for healthcare-associated MRSA (t068, t032, t003, t10231) and being a farmer, living on or near to a farm were factors not associated with MRSA carriage.The prevalence of MRSA carriage in these community outpatient populations along the Dutch-German border was low. There were striking similarities in livestock-associated MRSA carriage and clonal spread in the outpatient populations seeing their GP in both countries. In contrast, urologist outpatients in Germany were colonized with spa types indicative of healthcare-associated MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W2183319578,"Reef corals typically contain a number of pigments, mostly due to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates. These pigments usually vary in presence and concentration and influence the spectral characteristics of corals. We studied the variations in pigment composition among seven Caribbean shallow-water Scleractinian corals by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to further resolve the discrimination of corals. We found a total of 27 different pigments among the coral species, including some alteration products of the main pigments. Additionally, pigments typically found in endolithic algae were also identified. A Principal Components Analysis and a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed the separation of coral species based on pigment composition. All the corals were collected under the same physical environmental conditions. This suggests that pigment in the coral’s symbionts might be more genetically-determined than influenced by prevailing physical conditions of the reef. We further investigated the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) as a tool for estimating the total pigment concentration of reef corals. Depending on the coral species, the Rrs and the total symbiont pigment concentration per coral tissue area correlation showed 79.5–98.5% confidence levels demonstrating its use as a non-invasive robust technique to estimate pigment concentration in studies of coral reef biodiversity and health."
https://openalex.org/W2182233419,"Several studies have shown that repeated stressful experiences during childhood increases the likelihood of developing depression- and anxiety-related disorders in adulthood; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We subjected drd3-EGFP and drd3-null mice to daily, two hour restraint stress episodes over a five day period during preadolescence (postnatal day 35 to 39), followed by social isolation. When these mice reached adulthood (post-natal day > 90), we assessed locomotor behavior in a novel environment, and assessed depression-related behavior in the Porsolt Forced Swim test. We also measured the expression and function of dopamine D3 receptor in limbic brain areas such as hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and amygdala in control and stressed drd3-EGFP mice in adulthood. Adult male mice subjected to restraint stress during preadolescence exhibited both anxiety- and depression-related behaviors; however, adult female mice subjected to preadolescent restraint stress exhibited only depression-related behaviors. The development of preadolescent stress-derived psychiatric disorders was blocked by D3 receptor selective antagonist, SB 277011-A, and absent in D3 receptor null mice. Adult male mice that experienced stress during preadolescence exhibited a loss of D3 receptor expression and function in the amygdala but not in hippocampus or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, adult female mice that experienced preadolescent stress exhibited increased D3 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens but not in amygdala or hippocampus. Our results suggest that the dopamine D3 receptor is centrally involved in the etiology of adult anxiety- and depression-related behaviors that arise from repeated stressful experiences during childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2270210611,"Mnemonic processing engages multiple systems that cooperate and compete to support task performance. Exploring these systems' interaction requires memory tasks that produce rich data with multiple patterns of performance sensitive to different processing sub-components. Here we present a novel context-dependent relational memory paradigm designed to engage multiple learning and memory systems. In this task, participants learned unique face-room associations in two distinct contexts (i.e., different colored buildings). Faces occupied rooms as determined by an implicit gender-by-side rule structure (e.g., male faces on the left and female faces on the right) and all faces were seen in both contexts. In two experiments, we use behavioral and eye-tracking measures to investigate interactions among different memory representations in both younger and older adult populations; furthermore we link these representations to volumetric variations in hippocampus and ventromedial PFC among older adults. Overall, performance was very accurate. Successful face placement into a studied room systematically varied with hippocampal volume. Selecting the studied room in the wrong context was the most typical error. The proportion of these errors to correct responses positively correlated with ventromedial prefrontal volume. This novel task provides a powerful tool for investigating both the unique and interacting contributions of these systems in support of relational memory."
https://openalex.org/W2187009461,"Background 
Using current climate models, regional-scale changes for Florida over the next 100 years are predicted to include warming over terrestrial areas and very likely increases in the number of high temperature extremes. No uniform definition of a heat wave exists. Most past research on heat waves has focused on evaluating the aftermath of known heat waves, with minimal consideration of missing exposure information.
Objectives 
To identify and discuss methods of handling and imputing missing weather data and how those methods can affect identified periods of extreme heat in Florida.
Methods 
In addition to ignoring missing data, temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal models are described and utilized to impute missing historical weather data from 1973 to 2012 from 43 Florida weather monitors. Calculated thresholds are used to define periods of extreme heat across Florida.
Results 
Modeling of missing data and imputing missing values can affect the identified periods of extreme heat, through the missing data itself or through the computed thresholds. The differences observed are related to the amount of missingness during June, July, and August, the warmest months of the warm season (April through September).
Conclusions 
Missing data considerations are important when defining periods of extreme heat. Spatio-temporal methods are recommended for data imputation. A heat wave definition that incorporates information from all monitors is advised."
https://openalex.org/W2183915326,"High affinity nicotine-binding sites in the mammalian brain are neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) assembled from at least alpha4 and beta2 subunits into pentameric ion channels. When exposed to ligands such as nicotine, these receptors respond by undergoing upregulation, a correlate of nicotine addiction. Upregulation can be measured using HEK293 (293) cells that stably express alpha4 and beta2 subunits using quantification of [3H]epibatidine ([3H]Eb) binding to measure mature receptors. Treatment of these cells with choline also produces upregulation through a hemicholinium3 (HC3)-sensitive (choline kinase) and an HC3-insensitive pathway which are both independent of the mechanism used by nicotine for upregulation. In both cases, upregulation is significantly enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) which signals through its receptor Tnfr1 to activate p38Mapk. Here we report that the inhibition of class1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases isoform PI3Kbeta using the selective antagonist PI828 is alone sufficient to produce upregulation and enhance both nicotine and choline HC3-sensitive mediated upregulation. Further, these processes are impacted upon by an AG-490 sensitive Jak2-associated pathway. Both PI3Kbeta (negative) and Jak2 (positive) modulation of upregulation converge through p38Mapk and both overlap with TNFalpha enhancement of this process. Upregulation through the PI3Kbeta pathway did not require Akt. Collectively these findings support upregulation of endogenous alpha4beta2 as a balance among cellular signaling networks that are highly responsive to multiple environmental, inflammatory and metabolic agents. The findings also suggest how illness and metabolic stress could alter the expression of this important nicotinic receptor and novel avenues to intercede in modifying its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2186913977,"Species delimitation of geographically isolated forms is a long-standing problem in less studied insect groups. Often taxonomic decisions are based directly on morphologic variation, and lack a discussion regarding sample size and the efficiency of migration barriers or dispersal/migration capacity of the studied species. These problems are here exemplified in a water beetle complex from the Bering Sea region that separates North America from Eurasia. Only a few sampled specimens occur from this particular area and they are mostly found in museum and private collections. Here we utilize the theory of integrated taxonomy to discuss the speciation of the Holarctic Colymbetes paykulli water beetle complex, which historically has included up to five species of which today only two are recognized. Three delimitation methods are used; landmark based morphometry of body shape, variation in reticulation patterns of the pronotum exo-skeleton and sequence variation of the partial mitochondrial gene Cyt b. Our conclusion is that the Palearctic and Nearctic populations of C. paykulli are given the status of separate species, based on the fact that all methods showed significant separation between populations. As a consequence the name of the Palearctic species is C. paykulli Erichson and the Nearctic species should be known as C. longulus LeConte. There is no clear support for delineation between Palearctic and Nearctic populations of C. dahuricus based on mtDNA. However, significant difference in size and reticulation patterns from the two regions is shown. The combined conclusion is that the C. dahuricus complex needs a more thorough investigation to fully disentangle its taxonomic status. Therefore it is here still regarded as a Holarctic species. This study highlights the importance to study several diagnosable characters that has the potential to discriminate evolutionary lineage during speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2953272110,"Multi-marker approaches have received a lot of attention recently in genome wide association studies and can enhance power to detect new associations under certain conditions. Gene-, gene-set- and pathway-based association tests are increasingly being viewed as useful supplements to the more widely used single marker association analysis which have successfully uncovered numerous disease variants. A major drawback of single-marker based methods is that they do not look at the joint effects of multiple genetic variants which individually may have weak or moderate signals. Here, we describe novel tests for multi-marker association analyses that are based on phenotype predictions obtained from machine learning algorithms. Instead of assuming a linear or logistic regression model, we propose the use of ensembles of diverse machine learning algorithms for prediction. We show that phenotype predictions obtained from ensemble learning algorithms provide a new framework for multi-marker association analysis. They can be used for constructing tests for the joint association of multiple variants, adjusting for covariates and testing for the presence of interactions. To demonstrate the power and utility of this new approach, we first apply our method to simulated SNP datasets. We show that the proposed method has the correct Type-1 error rates and can be considerably more powerful than alternative approaches in some situations. Then, we apply our method to previously studied asthma-related genes in 2 independent asthma cohorts to conduct association tests."
