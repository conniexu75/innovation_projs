https://openalex.org/W3184110062,"To capture pandemic experiences of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) to better inform the programs that serve them.We designed, conducted, and analyzed semi-structured qualitative interviews using grounded theory. We conducted interviews until theme saturation was reached and we iteratively developed a codebook of emerging themes. Individuals with lived experience of substance use provided feedback at all steps of the study.We conducted phone or in-person interviews in compliance with physical distancing and public health regulations in outdoor Vancouver parks or well-ventilated indoor spaces between June to September 2020.Using purposive sampling, we recruited participants (n = 19) who were individuals with OUD enrolled in an intensive community outreach program, had visited one of two emergency departments, were over 18, lived within catchment, and were not already receiving opioid agonist therapy.We audio-recorded interviews, which were later transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy while removing all identifiers. Interviews explored participants' knowledge of COVID-19 and related safety measures, changes to drug use and healthcare services, and community impacts of COVID-19.One third of participants were women, approximately two thirds had stable housing, and ages ranged between 23 and 59 years old. Participants were knowledgeable on COVID-19 public health measures. Some participants noted that fear decreased social connection and reluctance to help reverse overdoses; others expressed pride in community cohesion during crisis. Several participants mentioned decreased access to housing, harm reduction, and medical care services. Several participants reported using drugs alone more frequently, consuming different or fewer drugs because of supply shortages, or using more drugs to replace lost activities.COVID-19 had profound effects on the social lives, access to services, and risk-taking behaviour of people with opioid use disorder. Pandemic public health measures must include risk mitigation strategies to maintain access to critical opioid-related services."
https://openalex.org/W3183833358,"Background Burgeoning burden of non-communicable disease among older adults is one of the emerging public health problems. In the COVID-19 pandemic, health services in low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, have been disrupted. This may have posed challenges for older adults with non-communicable chronic conditions in accessing essential health care services in the current pandemic. The present study aimed at exploring the challenges experienced by older Bangladeshi adults with non-communicable chronic conditions in receiving regular health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods The study followed a cross-sectional design and was conducted among 1032 Bangladeshi older adults aged 60 years and above during October 2020 through telephone interviews. Self-reported information on nine non-communicable chronic conditions (osteoarthritis, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, chronic kidney disease, cancer) was collected. Participants were asked if they faced any difficulties in accessing medicine and receiving routine medical care for their medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The association between non-communicable chronic conditions and accessing medication and health care was analysed using binary logic regression model. Results Most of the participants aged 60–69 years (77.8%), male (65.5%), married (81.4%), had no formal schooling (58.3%) and resided in rural areas (73.9%). Although more than half of the participants (58.9%) reported having a single condition, nearly one-quarter (22.9%) had multimorbidity. About a quarter of the participants reported difficulties accessing medicine (23%) and receiving routine medical care (27%) during the pandemic, and this was significantly higher among those suffering from multimorbidity. In the adjusted analyses, participants with at least one condition (AOR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.33–2.85) and with multimorbidity (AOR: 4.75, 95% CI: 3.17–7.10) had a higher likelihood of experiencing difficulties accessing medicine. Similarly, participants with at least one condition (AOR: 3.08, 95% CI: 2.11–4.89) and with multimorbidity (AOR: 6.34, 95% CI: 4.03–9.05) were significantly more likely to face difficulties receiving routine medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Our study found that a sizeable proportion of the older adults had difficulties in accessing medicine and receiving routine medical care during the pandemic. The study findings highlight the need to develop an appropriate health care delivery pathway and strategies to maintain essential health services during any emergencies and beyond. We also argue the need to prioritise the health of older adults with non-communicable chronic conditions in the centre of any emergency response plan and policies of Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3184004561,"Purpose To assess psychological effects of the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on United States (US) medical students in clinical training to anticipate sequelae and prepare for future outbreaks. Methods Authors emailed a cross-sectional survey in April-May, 2020 to students in clinical training years at six US medical schools which included validated General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Primary Care-PTSD (PC-PTSD-5) screening tools, and asked students about pandemic-related stress and specific concerns. Authors used quantitative and thematic analysis to present results. Results Of 2511 eligible students, 741 responded (29.5%) . Most students (84.1%) reported at least “somewhat” increased levels of stress and anxiety related to the pandemic. On the GAD-7, 34.3% showed mild, 16.1% moderate, and 9.5% severe anxiety symptoms, with 39.6% demonstrating no/minimal symptoms. One quarter (25.4%) screened positive for PTSD risk symptoms. Top concerns of students chosen from a pre-populated list included inadequate COVID-19 testing, undiagnosed or asymptomatic spread and racial or other disparities in the pandemic. In thematic analysis, students’ reactions to removal from clinical learning included: understanding the need to conserve PPE (32.2%), a desire to help (27.7%), worry over infectious risk to others (25.4%) and self (21.2%), and lost learning opportunities (22.5%). Female students were significantly more likely to report anxiety and PTSD risk symptoms. Asian students had a greater risk of moderate anxiety and those underrepresented in medicine (UIM) had greater risk of moderate and severe anxiety symptoms compared to white students. Conclusions During the initial peak phase of COVID-19, over 60% of US medical students screened positive for pandemic-related anxiety and one quarter were at risk for PTSD. Female and UIM students were significantly more affected. Medical schools should consider broad support of students, and targeted outreach to female and UIM students."
https://openalex.org/W3184358605,"There is limited evidence on how clinical outcomes differ by socioeconomic conditions among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most studies focused on COVID-19 patients from a single hospital. Results based on patients from multiple health systems have not been reported. The objective of this study is to examine variation in patient characteristics, outcomes, and healthcare utilization by neighborhood social conditions among COVID-19 patients.We extracted electronic health record data for 23,300 community dwelling COVID-19 patients in New York City between March 1st and June 11th, 2020 from all care settings, including hospitalized patients, patients who presented to the emergency department without hospitalization, and patients with ambulatory visits only. Zip Code Tabulation Area-level social conditions were measured by the Social Deprivation Index (SDI). Using logistic regressions and Cox proportional-hazards models, we examined the association between SDI quintiles and hospitalization and death, controlling for race, ethnicity, and other patient characteristics.Among 23,300 community dwelling COVID-19 patients, 60.7% were from neighborhoods with disadvantaged social conditions (top SDI quintile), although these neighborhoods only account for 34% of overall population. Compared to socially advantaged patients (bottom SDI quintile), socially disadvantaged patients (top SDI quintile) were older (median age 55 vs. 53, P<0.001), more likely to be black (23.1% vs. 6.4%, P<0.001) or Hispanic (25.4% vs. 8.5%, P<0.001), and more likely to have chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes: 21.9% vs. 10.5%, P<0.001). Logistic and Cox regressions showed that patients with disadvantaged social conditions had higher risk for hospitalization (odds ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.46, 1.94]; P<0.001) and mortality (hazard ratio: 1.91; 95% CI: [1.35, 2.70]; P<0.001), adjusting for other patient characteristics.Substantial socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes exist among COVID-19 patients in NYC. Disadvantaged neighborhood social conditions were associated with higher risk for hospitalization, severity of disease, and death."
https://openalex.org/W3183311695,"Inferring the impact of climate upon the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confounded by variability in testing, unknown disease introduction rates, and changing weather. Here we present a data model that accounts for dynamic testing rates and variations in disease introduction rates. We apply this model to data from Colombia, whose varied and seasonless climate, central port of entry, and swift, centralized response to the COVID-19 pandemic present an opportune environment for assessing the impact of climate factors on the spread of COVID-19. We observe strong attenuation of transmission in climates with sustained daily temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius and simultaneous mean relative humidity below 78%, with outbreaks occurring at high humidity even where the temperature is high. We hypothesize that temperature and relative humidity comodulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 within respiratory droplets."
https://openalex.org/W3186267239,"Background This study examines the association between food insecurity and mental health of women during the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource poor setting. Materials and methods Data were collected at two time-points (wave 1 and 2) from 2402 women, one per household, participating in a larger study during extended COVID-19 lockdown in the rural areas of the southwest region of Bangladesh. The primary outcome of the analyses is the association between food insecurity, measured using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), and stress level, measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), for women during the lockdown. General awareness about COVID-19 and attitude towards prescribed preventive measures were also measured since COVID-19 health concerns could exacerbate food insecurity. Results An individual-level evaluation of the effect of wave 2 FIES score on PSS score showed that worsening of the food security status increasing the stress level of the participants (95% CI: 1.61; 2.13; p-value: &lt;0.001). Additionally, a significant negative association was observed between the PSS score and change in food security status between the two waves (Coefficient: -1.15, 95% CI: -1.30; -0.99, p-value: &lt;0.001), indicating that deterioration in food security status over the pandemic period increasing the stress level. At the village level, the results showed a similar pattern. General awareness around ways coronavirus spreads was high, yet there were misperceptions at a higher level. Maintaining hand hygiene, wearing face masks outside the home, and going outside only when necessary were widely practised. Fewer respondents could maintain a 1.5-metre distance from others in the outside and maintained cough and sneeze etiquette. Conclusion The results indicate a higher stress level, a potential contributor to poor mental health, as food insecurity deteriorated. Policy initiatives in ameliorating immediate food insecurity during crises, improving long-term wellbeing, and expanding the reach of mental health support are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3185165354,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant pediatric brain tumor. In the latest classification, medulloblastoma is divided into four distinct groups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3, and Group 4. We analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging radiomics features to find the imaging surrogates of the 4 molecular subgroups of MB.Frozen tissue, imaging data, and clinical data of 38 patients with medulloblastoma were included from Taipei Medical University Hospital and Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Molecular clustering was performed based on the gene expression level of 22 subgroup-specific signature genes. A total 253 magnetic resonance imaging radiomic features were generated from each subject for comparison between different molecular subgroups.Our cohort consisted of 7 (18.4%) patients with WNT medulloblastoma, 12 (31.6%) with SHH tumor, 8 (21.1%) with Group 3 tumor, and 11 (28.9%) with Group 4 tumor. 8 radiomics gray-level co-occurrence matrix texture (GLCM) features were significantly different between 4 molecular subgroups of MB. In addition, for tumors with higher values in a gray-level run length matrix feature-Short Run Low Gray-Level Emphasis, patients have shorter survival times than patients with low values of this feature (p = 0.04). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed optimal performance of the preliminary prediction model based on GLCM features for predicting WNT, Group 3, and Group 4 MB (area under the curve = 0.82, 0.72, and 0.78, respectively).The preliminary result revealed that 8 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging texture features were significantly different between 4 molecular subgroups of MB. Together with the prediction models, the radiomics features may provide suggestions for stratifying patients with MB into different risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3186348330,"Introduction Suicide is a major social and health issue in India. Yearly statistics show a concerning increasing pattern of suicidal deaths in India which is higher in comparison to the global trend. There is limited evidence regarding historical analysis of suicide or any forecasting for suicide in India towards predicting the possible risks of death due to suicide. Methods This paper examines the trend of suicide rate and characteristics of suicide victims in India, based on the longitudinal time series data over the last 50 years—collected from the National Crime Record Bureau Reports (1969 to 2018) of the Government of India. In our analysis, we have used the time series model to forecast the suicide rates in India for the next decade. ARIMA (4,1,0) model is found to be the best fit model for forecasting the data. Findings There has been an observable and rising trend of suicide rates in India over the last five decades. The forecast indicates a continuance of rising suicide cases for an upcoming couple of years in India with a limited decline in the following years. The prediction model indicates a future relatively consistent pattern of suicide in India which does not seem to be a very encouraging trend. As we have not included the period staring the year 2020 onwards affected by Covid-19 and which has several disruptions in personal and family spaces, the projected suicide trend during the period of next two to three years (2020–22) may rise far high and then it may show a declining path. Along with this, there is a shift in means of suicide in the last couple of decades. Constituting the second-highest number of cases, Illness associated suicide was visibly a serious concern. Conclusion The present analysis finds that there is no visible substantial relief for suicide deaths during the coming years in India. On the other hand, more extensive exploration of sample cases may provide important information for suicide prevention. Availability of detailed and more inclusive data will be highly useful for analysis and suicide preventive policies. Investment in public health care and other welfare activities like education and employment generation will yield visible positive results in suicide control."
https://openalex.org/W3185656376,"A second wave of COVID-19 has demonstrated how challenging it will be to achieve sustained control of the disease, even with vaccination underway in many countries. Therefore, it remains relevant to keep improving our understanding of the distribution of COVID-19, especially of asymptomatic individuals, among different populations, and particularly in vulnerable regions. Hence, this population-based serosurvey had the objective of estimating the prevalence of individuals 18 years of age or older infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the proportion of asymptomatic individuals, among a vulnerable population living in an urban setting. This was a cross-sectional single-stage cluster sampling serosurvey conducted between September and December of 2019, in a vulnerable region of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Families covered by three public primary healthcare units represented the selected clusters. After study inclusion, participants were asked about signs and symptoms related to COVID-19, and had collected 10 mL of blood for serology testing. A total of 272 individuals from 185 families were included in the study, out of the 400 eligible individuals for inclusion, resulting in a non-response rate of 32%. The post stratified prevalence of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 45.2% (95% CI: 39.4–51.0%), with a proportion of asymptomatic cases of 30.2% (95% CI: 23.3–38.0%). This population-based serosurvey identified a greater prevalence of infected individuals by SARS-CoV-2 compared to data from the beginning of the pandemic, and from a recent citywide serosurvey, with a similar proportion of asymptomatic individuals. It demonstrated the value of primary healthcare services for disease surveillance activities, and the importance of more focused serosurveys, especially in vulnerable locations, and the need to evaluate new surveillance strategies to take into account asymptomatic cases."
https://openalex.org/W3184997058,"Global conservation is increasingly reliant on young people forming meaningful connections with urban nature. However, interactions with nearby nature do not inspire all children and adolescents living in cities to act pro-environmentally. Our survey of over 1,000 school students from Sydney, Australia, revealed that 28% of respondents maintained strong nature connections. Younger students (aged 8-11) were more strongly connected with nature than their older peers (aged 12-14), and environmental behaviors were negatively associated with increasing age. Differences between boys and girls were less consistent, resulting in part from differential functioning of questionnaire items. Regardless, girls were more willing than boys to volunteer for conservation. Our findings suggest that policies designed to strengthen urban children's nature connections will be most effective if they explicitly address the ""adolescent dip"" and other emerging demographic patterns, thereby ensuring all young people reap the health, wellbeing, and conservation benefits of connecting with nature."
https://openalex.org/W3185887024,"Objective To survey the knowledge, attitude, and practices of Vietnamese pharmacists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Method This cross-sectional, paper-based study was conducted from June to August 2020. A validated questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84) was used to interview 1,023 pharmacists in nine provinces of Vietnam. Analysis of covariance was employed to identify factors associated with the knowledge of pharmacists. The best model was chosen by using the Bayesian Model Averaging method in R software version 4.0.4. Results The mean knowledge score was 12.02 ± 1.64 (range: 6–15), which indicated that 93.4% of pharmacists had good knowledge of COVID-19. There was no difference in the average score between males and females (p &gt; 0.05). The multivariate linear regression model revealed that the knowledge was significantly associated with pharmacists’ age, education level, and residence (p &lt; 0.001). About attitude and practices, pharmacists daily sought and updated information on the COVID-19 pandemic through mass media and the internet (social network and online newspapers). Nearly 48% of them conceded that they communicated with customers when at least one person did not wear a face mask at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. At medicine outlets, many measures were applied to protect pharmacists and customers, such as equipping pharmacists with face masks and hand sanitizers (95.0%), using glass shields (83.0%), and maintaining at least one-meter distance between two people (85.2%). Conclusion The pharmacists’ knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, symptoms, and prevention was good. Many useful measures against the spread of this perilous virus were applied in medicine outlets. However, pharmacists should restrict forgetting to wear face masks in communication with medicine purchasers. The government and health agencies should have practical remedies to reduce the significant differences in the COVID-19 knowledge of pharmacists among provinces and education-level groups."
https://openalex.org/W3186142074,"Background Despite the rising global burden, Sri Lanka reported a relatively low caseload and mortality (13 deaths as of 20 October 2020) for COVID-19. This warrants exploration of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the case series during the initial passive case detection phase in Sri Lanka, in order to understand the success in containment of the disease for more than nine months in the country through its initial early and rapid pandemic response. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using secondary data (hospital records and investigation reports) extracted from all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to the three main state-sector hospitals in Sri Lanka from 11 March to 7 April 2020. Clinical outcomes were categorized as mild, severe and critical, as per the international classification. Kruskal-Wallis H, Mann Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests compared differences between the variables. Results The case series comprised 146 live discharges and six deaths. Majority were males (63.2%); mean age of 40.9 (SD = 17.9); and symptomatic (72.4%). Sixty-one (40.1%) had co-morbidities, the commonest being diabetes (20.4%) and hypertension (17.8%). Mild (93.4%), severe (2.6%) and critical (4.0%) disease outcomes were noted. Disease severity was significantly higher with older age (p = 0.037), co-morbidities (p = 0.026); and higher white-cell (p = 0.045) and lymphocyte (p = 0.043) counts; but not with being symptomatic (p = 0.683). The commonest symptoms were fever (62.5%), dry cough (48.0%) and sore throat (26.9%). The median duration (IQR) was 3.0 (1.0–5.0) and 18.0 (15.0–29.5) days, respectively before and during hospitalization. Conclusions In contrast to high-risk countries, the younger age, milder disease and low mortality observed in local patients during the initial phase of the pandemic, reflect the early success in containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka. However, once the disease becomes severe, the factors determining disease fatality remain the same as in other countries. This highlights the value of establishing strong public health systems and disease surveillance in a country, which could provide long-term effects on disease control."
https://openalex.org/W3184871803,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the current health concern and threat to the entire world. Thus, the world needs the fast recognition of appropriate drugs to restrict the spread of this disease. The global effort started to identify the best drug compounds to treat COVID-19, but going through a series of clinical trials and our lack of information about the details of the virus’s performance has slowed down the time to reach this goal. In this work, we try to select the subset of human proteins as candidate sets that can bind to approved drugs. Our method is based on the information on human-virus protein interaction and their effect on the biological processes of the host cells. We also define some informative topological and statistical features for proteins in the protein-protein interaction network. We evaluate our selected sets with two groups of drugs. The first group contains the experimental unapproved treatments for COVID-19, and we show that from 17 drugs in this group, 15 drugs are approved by our selected sets. The second group contains the external clinical trials for COVID-19, and we show that 85% of drugs in this group, target at least one protein of our selected sets. We also study COVID-19 associated protein sets and identify proteins that are essential to disease pathology. For this analysis, we use DAVID tools to show and compare disease-associated genes that are contributed between the COVID-19 comorbidities. Our results for shared genes show significant enrichment for cardiovascular-related, hypertension, diabetes type 2, kidney-related and lung-related diseases. In the last part of this work, we recommend 56 potential effective drugs for further research and investigation for COVID-19 treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3183465155,"Background Aging increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB) and its adverse outcomes, but most studies are based on secondary analyses, and few are in Hispanics. Diabetes is a risk factor for TB in adults, but its contribution in the elderly is unknown. We aimed to identify the role of diabetes and other risk factors for TB in elderly Hispanics. Methods Cross-sectional study among newly-diagnosed TB patients, recent contacts (ReC), or community controls (CoC) totaling 646 participants, including 183 elderly (&gt;60 years; 43 TB, 80 ReC, 60 CoC) and 463 adults (18 to 50 years; 80 TB, 301 ReC and 82 CoC). Host characteristics associated with TB and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI) were identified in the elderly by univariable and confirmed by multivariable logistic regression. Results LTBI was more prevalent among the elderly CoC (55% vs . 23.2% in adults; p&lt;0.001), but not in ReC (elderly 71.3% vs . adult 63.8%); p = 0.213). Risk factors for TB in the elderly included male sex (adj-OR 4.33, 95% CI 1.76, 10.65), smoking (adj-OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.01, 6.45) and low BMI (adj-OR 12.34, 95% CI 4.44, 34.33). Unexpectedly, type 2 diabetes was not associated with TB despite its high prevalence (adj-OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.06, 2.38), and BCG vaccination at birth was protective (adj-OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06, 0.45). Conclusions We report novel distinctions in TB risk factors in the elderly vs . adults, notably in diabetes and BCG vaccination at birth. Further studies are warranted to address disparities in this vulnerable, understudied population."
https://openalex.org/W3184020715,"The reliability of the insulator has directly affected the stable operation of electric power system. The detection of defective insulators has always been an important issue in smart grid systems. However, the traditional transmission line detection method has low accuracy and poor real-time performance. We present an insulator defect detection method based on CenterNet. In order to improve detection efficiency, we simplified the backbone network. In addition, an attention mechanism is utilized to suppress useless information and improve the accuracy of network detection. In image preprocessing, the blurring of some detected images results in the samples being discarded, so we use super-resolution reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the blurred images to enhance the dataset. The results show that the AP of the proposed method reaches 96.16% and the reasoning speed reaches 30FPS under the test condition of NVIDIA GTX 1080 test conditions. Compared with Faster R-CNN, YOLOV3, RetinaNet and FSAF, the detection accuracy of proposed method is greatly improved, which fully proves the effectiveness of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3183846147,"Wearable sensor systems are a emerging tools for the evaluation of the sport's activity and can be used to quantify the external workload of the athlete. The main goal of this paper was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the ""Armbeep inertial measurement unit"" (IMU) sensor both in a closed tennis exercise and in open matchplay. Twentyfour junior tennis players performed a baseline drill and played matches, during which they wore a combined accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. Video footage was concomitantly recorded using a digital video camera. The agreement between the measurements was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the standard error of measurement (SEM). A simple linear regression was used to predict the number of shots registered from the video and from the Armbeep IMU sensor's data. The number of total forehand and backhand shots during the drill repetitions showed an excellent test and re-test reproducibility (ICC≥0.90). There was a significant relationship between the Armbeep IMU sensor's number of contacts and the total number of shots (R2 = 0.938) which indicated the excellent reliability of the tested Armbeep IMU sensor for those parameters. Considering the accuracy of the total tennis shots and the small magnitude of error for wrist speed and acceleration, the Armbeep IMU sensor appears to be an appropriate on-court tool that can be used to monitor the hitting load during tennis practice and matches."
https://openalex.org/W3185819553,"Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain is a common hallmark of most age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies from our group identified the presence of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in leaves derived from the Chilean berry Ugni molinae (murtilla), in addition to show a potent anti-aggregation activity in models of Alzheimer´s disease. However, possible beneficial effects of berry extracts of murtilla was not investigated. Here we evaluated the efficacy of fruit extracts from different genotypes of Chilean-native U. molinae on reducing protein aggregation using cellular models of Huntington´s disease and assess the correlation with their chemical composition. Berry extraction was performed by exhaustive maceration with increasing-polarity solvents. An unbiased automatic microscopy platform was used for cytotoxicity and protein aggregation studies in HEK293 cells using polyglutamine-EGFP fusion proteins, followed by secondary validation using biochemical assays. Phenolic-rich extracts from murtilla berries of the 19-1 genotype (ETE 19-1) significantly reduced polyglutamine peptide aggregation levels, correlating with the modulation in the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. Using LC-MS and molecular network analysis we correlated the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and ellagitannins with the protective effects of ETE 19-1 effects on protein aggregation. Overall, our results indicate the presence of bioactive components in ethanolic extracts from U. molinae berries that reduce the load of protein aggregates in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W3185919540,"Testing is critical to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, but testing capacity has fallen short of the need in the United States and elsewhere, and long wait times have impeded rapid isolation of cases. Operational challenges such as supply problems and personnel shortages have led to these bottlenecks and inhibited the scale-up of testing to needed levels. This paper uses operational simulations to facilitate rapid scale-up of testing capacity during this public health emergency. Specifically, discrete event simulation models were developed to represent the RT-PCR testing process in a large University of Maryland testing center, which retrofitted high-throughput molecular testing capacity to meet pandemic demands in a partnership with the State of Maryland. The simulation models support analyses that identify process steps which create bottlenecks, and evaluate “what-if” scenarios for process changes that could expand testing capacity. This enables virtual experimentation to understand the trade-offs associated with different interventions that increase testing capacity, allowing the identification of solutions that have high leverage at a feasible and acceptable cost. For example, using a virucidal collection medium which enables safe discarding of swabs at the point of collection removed a time-consuming “deswabbing” step (a primary bottleneck in this laboratory) and nearly doubled the testing capacity. The models are also used to estimate the impact of demand variability on laboratory performance and the minimum equipment and personnel required to meet various target capacities, assisting in scale-up for any laboratories following the same process steps. In sum, the results demonstrate that by using simulation modeling of the operations of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, preparedness planners are able to identify high-leverage process changes to increase testing capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3186291236,"Previous literature on the psychological impact of COVID-19 has shown a direct relationship between family conflicts and psychological distress among parents and their children during the domestic lockdown and social isolation; but there are also opportunities to enhance family bonding, encourage collective problem-solving and improve personal relationships. This study aimed to explore psychological adjustment processes of Spanish adolescents and their parents during the first month of lockdown by analyzing their narratives, perceived outcomes, protection and risk factors. A total of 142 people agreed to participate in this study. Of all participants, 61 were adolescents ( M = 13.57; SD = 1.74; 57% women) and 81 were parents ( M = 46.09; SD = 4.72; 91% mothers). All were Spanish residents and completed an online survey during the domestic lockdown in March 2020. From a qualitative design, methodology followed a mixed approach to analyze data. The results showed three different types of adaptation to lockdown and social isolation in both adolescents and their parents: 1) positive adjustment, 2) moderate adjustment, and 3) maladjustment. Most participants reported a good adjustment and only a 20% of parents and a 16% of adolescents stated that they had not been able to achieve a positive psychological adjustment. There are few significant quantitative differences between adolescents and their parents. The qualitative analysis of data showed that adolescents reported less psychological distress than their parents. The two most important protective factors were social support and keeping busy during lockdown. The most significant risk factors were loss of mobility and social isolation. The conclusions stressed that regarding psychological maladjustment, parents experienced feelings of uncertainty whereas adolescents experienced a kind of mourning process. These findings can be used to design and implement effective intervention measures for mental health and psychological well-being in such a difficult situation as domestic lockdown."

Antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested using extracts' solutions in 10% DMSO and acetone. Compositions of working solutions from both solvents were established using LC-MS analysis. Moreover, the availability of details likely to affect reproducibility was evaluated in articles which reported antibacterial activities of studied plants.Inhibition of bacterial growth at MIC of 256-1024 μg/mL was observed in only 15.4% of identical plant species. These values were 4-16-fold higher than those reported earlier. Further, 18.2% of related plant species had MICs of 128-256 μg/mL. Besides, 29.2% and 95.8% of the extracts were soluble to sparingly soluble in 10% DMSO and acetone, respectively. Extracts' solutions in both solvents showed similar qualitative compositions, with differing quantities of corresponding phytochemicals. Details regarding seasons and growth state at collection were missing in 65% and 95% of evaluated articles, respectively. Likewise, solvents used to dissolve the extracts were lacking in 30% of the articles, whereas 40% of them used unidentified bacterial isolates.Reproducibility of previously reported activities from plants' extracts is a multi-factorial aspect. Thus, collective approaches are necessary in addressing the highlighted challenges."
https://openalex.org/W3184081887,"Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) germplasm is exclusively maintained as ex situ living collections in the field for genetic conservation and evaluation. However, this is not for long term and the maintenance of field genebanks is expensive and challenging. Large area of land is required and the germplasms are exposed to extreme weather conditions and casualty from pests and diseases. By using 107 SSR markers, this study aimed to examine the genetic diversity and relatedness of 186 palms from a Nigerian-based oil palm germplasm and to identify core collection for conservation. On average, 8.67 alleles per SSR locus were scored with average effective number of alleles per population ranging from 1.96 to 3.34 and private alleles were detected in all populations. Mean expected heterozygosity was 0.576 ranging from 0.437 to 0.661 and the Wright's fixation index calculated was -0.110. Overall moderate genetic differentiation among populations was detected (mean pairwise population FST = 0.120, gene flow Nm = 1.117 and Nei's genetic distance = 0.466) and this was further confirmed by AMOVA analysis. UPGMA dendogram and Bayesian structure analysis concomitantly clustered the 12 populations into eight genetic groups. The best core collection assembled by Core Hunter ver. 3.2.1 consisted of 58 palms accounting for 31.2% of the original population, which was a smaller core set than using PowerCore 1.0. This core set attained perfect allelic coverage with good representation, high genetic distance between entries, and maintained genetic diversity and structure of the germplasm. This study reported the first molecular characterization and validation of core collections for oil palm field genebank. The established core collection via molecular approach, which captures maximum genetic diversity with minimum redundancy, would allow effective use of genetic resources for introgression and for sustainable oil palm germplasm conservation. The way forward to efficiently conserve the field genebanks into next generation without losing their diversity was further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3185534747,"A new purification technique is developed for obtaining distribution of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) within a specific range of sizes using dual filtration. The GUVs were prepared using well known natural swelling method. For filtration, different combinations of polycarbonate membranes were implemented in filter holders. In our experiment, the combinations of membranes were selected with corresponding pore sizes-(i) 12 and 10 μm, (ii) 12 and 8 μm, and (iii) 10 and 8 μm. By these filtration arrangements, obtained GUVs size distribution were in the ranges of 6-26 μm, 5-38 μm and 5-30 μm, respectively. In comparison, the size distribution range was much higher for single filtration technique, for example, 6-59 μm GUVs found for a membrane with 12 μm pores. Using this technique, the water-soluble fluorescent probe, calcein, can be removed from the suspension of GUVs successfully. The size distributions were analyzed with lognormal distribution. The skewness became smaller (narrow size distribution) when a dual filtration was used instead of single filtration. The mode of the size distribution obtained in dual filtration was also smaller to that of single filtration. By continuing this process of purification for a second time, the GUVs size distribution became even narrower. After using an extra filtration with dual filtration, two different size distributions of GUVs were obtained at a time. This experimental observation suggests that different size specific distributions of GUVs can be obtained easily, even if GUVs are prepared by different other methods."
https://openalex.org/W3186376874,"To examine socioeconomic inequalities in birth outcomes among infants born between 2008 and 2018 and assessed trends in inequalities during that period in Colombia, a middle-income country with high levels of inequality emerging from a long internal armed conflict.Using birth certificate data in Colombia, we analysed the outcomes of low birth weight, an Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes after birth and the number of prenatal visits among full-term pregnancies. Maternal education and health insurance schemes were used as socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators. Inequalities were estimated using the prevalence/mean of the outcomes across categories of the SEP indicators and calculating the relative and slope indices of inequality (RII and SII, respectively).Among the 5,433,265 full-term singleton births analysed, there was a slight improvement in the outcomes analysed over the study period (lower low-birth-weight and Apgar<7 prevalence rates and higher number of prenatal visits). We observed a general pattern of social gradients and significant relative (RII) and absolute (SII) inequalities for all outcomes across both SEP indicators. RII and SII estimates with their corresponding CIs revealed a general picture of no significant changes in inequalities over time, with some particular, time-dependent exceptions. When comparing the initial and final years of our study period, inequalities in low birth weight related to maternal education increased while those in Apgar score <7 decreased. Relative inequalities across health insurance schemes increased for the two birth outcomes but decreased for the number of prenatal visits.The lack of a consistent improvement in the magnitude of inequalities in birth outcomes over an 11-year period is a worrying issue because it could aggravate the cycle of inequality, given the influence of birth outcomes on health, social and economic outcomes throughout the life course. The findings of our analysis emphasize the importance of policies aimed at providing access to quality education and providing a health care system with universal coverage and high levels of integration."
https://openalex.org/W3183705982,"Norm violators demonstrate that they can behave as they wish, which makes them appear powerful. Potentially, this is the beginning of a self-reinforcing loop, in which greater perceived power invites further norm violations. Here we investigate the possibility that sanctions can break this loop by reducing the power that observers attribute to norm violators. Despite an abundance of research on the effects of sanctions as deterrents for norm-violating behavior, little is known about how sanctions may change perceptions of individuals who do (or do not) violate norms. Replicating previous research, we found in two studies (N1 = 203, N2 = 132) that norm violators are perceived as having greater volitional capacity compared to norm abiders. Qualifying previous research, however, we demonstrate that perceptions of volition only translate into attributions of greater power in the absence of sanctions. We discuss implications for social hierarchies and point out avenues for further research on the social dynamics of power."
https://openalex.org/W3183767115,"Aims Mass antigen testing programs have been challenged because of an alleged insufficient specificity, leading to a large number of false positives. The objective of this study is to derive a lower bound of the specificity of the SD Biosensor Standard Q Ag-Test in large scale practical use. Methods Based on county data from the nationwide tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Slovakia between 31.10.–1.11. 2020 we calculate a lower confidence bound for the specificity. As positive test results were not systematically verified by PCR tests, we base the lower bound on a worst case assumption, assuming all positives to be false positives. Results 3,625,332 persons from 79 counties were tested. The lowest positivity rate was observed in the county of Rožňava where 100 out of 34307 (0.29%) tests were positive. This implies a test specificity of at least 99.6% (97.5% one-sided lower confidence bound, adjusted for multiplicity). Conclusion The obtained lower bound suggests a higher specificity compared to earlier studies in spite of the underlying worst case assumption and the application in a mass testing setting. The actual specificity is expected to exceed 99.6% if the prevalence in the respective regions was non-negligible at the time of testing. To our knowledge, this estimate constitutes the first bound obtained from large scale practical use of an antigen test."
https://openalex.org/W3183815623,"Globally, over 300,000 women die of cervical cancer annually. Given that human papillomavirus vaccines are highly effective in the primary prevention of cervical cancer, it is important to explore the barriers and facilitators to vaccination uptake in areas where the burden of disease remains high. This study, informed by the socio-ecological model, aimed to qualitatively explore vaccination uptake via in-depth interviews with eleven nurses and ten teachers involved in vaccine delivery in Iquitos, Peru. The results highlighted that vaccine uptake was influenced by multiple factors including individuals’ knowledge and attitudes, community beliefs, geography, and policy level variables. Findings suggested that professionals were informed and supportive of the HPV vaccination program but perceived that parents were uninformed about the vaccine. There is a need for community education programs, for a revision of the process of obtaining parental consent, for improved communication between professionals and for involvement of grassroots staff in policy making."
https://openalex.org/W3183961706,"The comparatively straightforward and cheaper light-emitting diode fluorescent microscope (LEDFM) was suggested by WHO to replace conventional microscope in tuberculosis (TB) laboratories. However, the comparable efficacy of each of those techniques differs from laboratory to laboratory. We investigated the efficacy of LEDFM for the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 211 samples from clinically suspected tuberculous lymphadenitis patients. Three smears were prepared from FNA on microscope slides for cytomorphology study, Auramine O (AO), and for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. The left-over samples were inoculated onto Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media. Statistical analysis was done using STATA version 11. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated by considering the culture results as the gold standard using a 95% confidence interval.Among 211 samples 49.7% (105) were positive by cytomorphology, 32.7% (69) by LEDFM, 23.69% (50) by LJ culture, and 13.7% (29) by ZN. Compared to the gold standard sensitivity of ZN, LEDFM, and cytomorphology were 30% [95% CI: 17.9-44.6], 66% [95% CI: 51.2-78.8] 78% [95% CI: 64-88.5], respectively. The specificity of ZN, LEDFM, and cytomorphology was 91.3% [95% CI: 85.8-95.2], 77.6% [95% CI: 70.4-83.8], 58.8% [95% CI: 50.7-66.5], respectively.LED fluorescence microscopy gives a legitimate option in contrast to conventional ZN techniques in terms of its higher sensitivity, a bit lower specificity, time-saving, and minimal effort."
https://openalex.org/W3185083371,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefits and inherent risks of dental cleaning procedures, based on serum and urine biomarkers for kidney function and tissue damage, in dogs and cats. Thirty-one asymptomatic, mostly older dogs (14 neutered male and 17 ovariohysterectomized female dogs of various breeds between 3 and 14 years old) and cats (19 neutered male and 12 ovariohysterectomized female domestic short hair cats between 2 and 16 years old) diagnosed with periodontal disease on physical exam, and recommended by their veterinarian to have dental cleaning under general anesthesia were evaluated in a prospective study. Serum and urine samples were collected from dogs and cats 1 week before, 6 hours after, and again 1 week after the dental cleaning procedure. Samples were analyzed for biomarkers of kidney function [serum creatinine (Cr), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine for specific gravity (USG) and protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio]. A panel of biomarkers for renal tissue damage was also assessed [serum β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB), and urine cystatin B and clusterin]. Samples collected one week before dental cleaning procedures showed that increased age and severity of dental disease were linked to abnormal kidney function biomarker values (age: elevated SDMA and Cr concentrations and isosthenuric USG values; disease severity: elevated UPC ratios) as well as elevated urine cystatin B and clusterin concentrations. Directly after the dental cleaning procedure, an increased number of cats with elevated SDMA concentrations was observed (specifically in cats with longer duration of dental procedures). Extended duration of dental procedures (≥60 min) was linked to increased urine cystatin B and clusterin concentrations, whereas shorter duration procedures was linked to decreased urine cystatin B and clusterin. Higher SDMA concentrations persisted in cats one week after the dental cleaning procedures and were linked to elevated UPC ratios one week before cleaning procedures. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate a link between severity of dental disease, renal tissue injury, and impaired renal function. Longer duration dental procedures in cats may carry inherent risks of kidney injury and impaired renal function."
https://openalex.org/W3185111150,"The development of information technology has produced massive amounts of data, which has brought severe challenges to information storage. Traditional electronic storage media cannot keep up with the ever-increasing demand for data storage, but in its place DNA has emerged as a feasible storage medium with high density, large storage capacity and strong durability. In DNA data storage, many different approaches can be used to encode data into codewords. DNA coding is a key step in DNA storage and can directly affect storage performance and data integrity. However, since errors are prone to occur in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and non-specific hybridization is prone to occur in the solution, how to effectively encode DNA has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this article, we propose a DNA storage coding method based on the equilibrium optimization random search (EORS) algorithm, which meets the Hamming distance, GC content and no-runlength constraints and can reduce the error rate in storage. Simulation experiments have shown that the size of the DNA storage code set constructed by the EORS algorithm that meets the combination constraints has increased by an average of 11% compared with previous work. The increase in the code set means that shorter DNA chains can be used to store more data."
https://openalex.org/W3186198052,"Tendons are responsive to mechanical loading and their properties are often the target of intervention programs. The tendon's mechanical properties, particularly stiffness, also govern its function, therefore changes to these properties could have substantial influence on energy-saving mechanisms during activities utilizing the stretch-shortening cycle. We investigated Achilles tendon (AT) function in vivo during walking with respect to a training intervention that elicited significant increases in AT stiffness. 14 men and women completed 12-weeks of isometric plantarflexor strength training that increased AT stiffness, measured during isometric MVC, by ~31%. Before and after the intervention, participants walked shod at their preferred velocity on a fully-instrumented treadmill. Movement kinematics, kinetics and displacement of the gastrocnemius medialis muscle-tendon junction were captured synchronously using 3D motion capture and ultrasound imaging, respectively. A MANOVA test was used to examine changes in AT force, stress, strain, stiffness, Young's modulus, hysteresis and strain energy, measured during walking, before and following strength training. All were non-significant for a main effect of time, therefore no follow-up statistical tests were conducted. Changes in joint kinematics, tendon strain, velocity, work and power and muscle activity during the stance phase were assessed with 1D statistical parametric mapping, all of which also demonstrated a lack of change in response to the intervention. This in vivo examination of tendon function in walking provides an important foundation for investigating the functional consequences of training adaptations. We found substantial increases in AT stiffness did not impact on tendon function during walking. AT stiffness measured during walking, however, was unchanged with training, which suggests that increases in stiffness may not be evident across the whole force-elongation relation, a finding which may help explain previously mixed intervention results and guide future investigations in the functional implications of tendon adaptation."

The mechanisms of such post-stress neuroimmune changes, their contribution to the behavior, the relationship of the intensity of inflammation with genetically determined features have not been clarified. The goal of this work was to evaluate the dynamics of post-stress inflammation in the blood and hippocampus of rats which differ in level of excitability of the nervous system. Rats of two strains (high/low excitability threshold) were subjected to stress according to the K. Hecht protocol and their behavior, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and the number of Iba+ cells in the hippocampus were analysed 24 hours, 7 and 24 days after stress exposure. Highly excitable animals show an increase in anxiety-like behavior, in the number of neutrophils compared to lymphocytes as well as in the number of Iba1+ cells in CA1, CA3 and DG areas of the hippocampus in response to stress. Thus, hereditary high excitability of the nervous system is a possible risk factor for the development of post-stress pathologies."

Lately, machine learning and robust statistical techniques to control false discoveries are being incorporated into metabolomic data analysis. In this paper, we introduce one such recently developed technique called aggregate knockoff filtering to untargeted metabolomic analysis. When applied to a publicly available dataset, aggregate knockoff filtering combined with typical p-value filtering improves the number of significantly changing metabolites by 25% when compared to conventional untargeted metabolomic data processing. By using this method, features that would normally not be extracted under standard processing would be brought to researchers’ attention for further analysis."

Our aim was to assess the alterations of DVA in CA and to evaluate its relation to vestibular function. 32 patients with CA and 3 control groups: 13 patients with unilateral and 13 with bilateral vestibulopathy and 21 age matched healthy volunteers were examined by clinical DVA test, VOR was assessed by video Head Impulse Test and caloric irrigation. The severity of ataxia in CA was assessed by Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). Relationship between DVA and vestibular function in CA patients was examined by linear regressions. DVA impairment was highly prevalent in CA patients (84%) and its severity did not differ between CA and bilateral vestibulopathy patients. The severity of DVA impairment in CA was linked mainly to VOR impairment and only marginally to the degree of ataxia. However, DVA impairment was present also in CA patients without significant vestibular lesion showing that central mechanisms such as impairment of central adaptation of VOR are involved. We suggest that the evaluation of DVA should be a standard part of clinical evaluation in patients with progressive CA, as this information can help to target vestibular and oculomotor rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3184484913,"Melatonin (MLT) is a biological modulator of circadian and seasonal rhythms and reproduction. The photoperiodic information is detected by retinal photoreceptors and transmitted through nerve transmissions to the pineal gland, where MLT is synthesized and secreted at night into the blood. MLT interacts with two G protein-coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2. The aim of our work was to provide evidence for the presence of MLT receptors in the ovine pineal gland and define their involvement on melatonin secretion. For the first time, we identified the expression of MLT receptors with the specific 2-[125I]-MLT agonistic radioligand in ovin pinealocytes. The values of Kd and Bmax are 2.24 ± 1.1 nM and 20 ± 6.8 fmol/mg. MLT receptors are functional and inhibit cAMP production and activate ERK1/2 through pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins. The MLT receptor antagonist/ inverse agonist luzindole increased cAMP production (189 ± 30%) and MLT secretion (866 ± 13%). The effect of luzindole on MLT secretion was additive with the effect of well-described activators of this pathway such as the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Co-incubation of all three compounds increased MLT secretion by 1236 ± 199%. These results suggest that MLT receptors are involved in the negative regulation of the synthesis of its own ligand in pinealocytes. While adrenergic receptors promote MLT secretion, MLT receptors mitigate this effect to limit the quantity of MLT secreted by the pineal gland."
https://openalex.org/W3184526285,"Introduction Little is known about workplace health promotion for bus drivers. Bus drivers are at-risk of chronic disease because they are exposed to the risk factor combination of poor nutrition, low levels of physical activity, high levels of sedentary time and are often overweight or obese. The purpose of this paper is to situate the quantitative baseline data collected from bus drivers within qualitative findings about the socio-cultural context of the workplace. Materials and methods Baseline data about physical activity, dietary intake and sedentary hours was collected from 58 drivers employed by a large bus company in southeast Queensland. Ten drivers and seven key workplace informants participated in interviews and discussion groups about driver health behaviours, workplace structure, culture, and resources. Results The quantitative results of our study reveal bus drivers have a cluster of poor health behaviours—limited physical activity, lower than recommended consumption of fruit and vegetables and high levels of sitting time during working-hours—which contribute to a high prevalence of overweight and obesity and a heightened risk of chronic disease. The qualitative findings suggest there are individual and structural barriers to improving drivers’ modifiable health behaviours. Individual barriers include ingrained poor habits and more pressing life concerns, while structural barriers in the context of the workplace include time constraints, shift work, long days, a lack of work amenities and a general disconnect of drivers with their workplace. Conclusion In this workplace, health promotion strategies for bus drivers should be prioritised as a means of improving drivers’ health. To maximise uptake and effectiveness, these strategies should make use of existing workplace resources and consider the context of workplace health behaviour change. Further research is warranted in a broader sample of Australian bus companies to explore the context of workplace health behavior change so targeted strategies to improve bus drivers’ health can be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3184579374,"Interpersonal violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in the United States and is a major public health problem. The emergence and/or worsening of chronic pain are known sequelae of IPV; however, not all those who experience IPV develop chronic pain. To mitigate its development, it is critical to identify the factors that are associated with increased risk of pain after IPV. This proof-of-concept study used machine-learning strategies to predict pain severity and interference in 47 young women, ages 18 to 30, who experienced an incident of IPV (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) within three months of their baseline assessment. Young women are more likely than men to experience IPV and to subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Women completed a comprehensive assessment of theory-driven cognitive and neurobiological predictors of pain severity and pain-related interference (e.g., pain, coping, disability, psychiatric diagnosis/symptoms, PTSD/trauma, executive function, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress response). Gradient boosting machine models were used to predict symptoms of pain severity and pain-related interference across time (Baseline, 1-,3-,6- follow-up assessments). Models showed excellent predictive performance for pain severity and adequate predictive performance for pain-related interference. This proof-of-concept study suggests that machine-learning approaches are a useful tool for identifying predictors of pain development in survivors of recent IPV. Baseline measures of pain, family life impairment, neuropsychological function, and trauma history were of greatest importance in predicting pain and pain-related interference across a 6-month follow-up period. Present findings support the use of machine-learning techniques in larger studies of post-IPV pain development and highlight theory-driven predictors that could inform the development of targeted early intervention programs. However, these results should be replicated in a larger dataset with lower levels of missing data."
https://openalex.org/W3185448735,"Objectives To describe the relationship between reported serious operational problems (SOPs), and mortality for patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Design English national retrospective cohort study. Setting 89 English hospital trusts (i.e. small groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units). Patients All adults with COVID-19 admitted to ICU between 2nd April and 1st December, 2020 (n = 6,737). Interventions N/A Main outcomes and measures Hospital trusts routinely submit declarations of whether they have experienced ‘serious operational problems’ in the last 24 hours (e.g. due to staffing issues, adverse weather conditions, etc.). Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate the association between in-hospital mortality (binary outcome) and: 1) an indicator for whether a SOP occurred on the date of a patient’s admission, and; 2) the proportion of the days in a patient’s stay that had a SOP occur within their trust. These models were adjusted for individual demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity), and recorded comorbidities. Results Serious operational problems (SOPs) were common; reported in 47 trusts (52.8%) and were present for 2,701 (of 21,716; 12.4%) trust days. Overall mortality was 37.7% (2,539 deaths). Admission during a period of SOPs was associated with a substantially increased mortality; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.34 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.07 to 1.68). Mortality was also associated with the proportion of a patient’s admission duration that had concurrent SOPs; OR 1.47 (95% PCI: 1.10 to 1.96) for mortality where SOPs were present for 100% compared to 0% of the stay. Conclusion and relevance Serious operational problems at the trust-level are associated with a significant increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care. The link isn’t necessarily causal, but this observation justifies further research to determine if a binary indicator might be a valid prognostic marker for deteriorating quality of care."
https://openalex.org/W3186179916,"Delayed plasma leakage recognition could lead to improper fluid administration resulting in dengue shock syndrome, subsequently, multi-organ failure, and death. This prospective observational study was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand, between March 2018 and February 2020 to determine predictors of plasma leakage and develop a plasma leakage predictive score among dengue patients aged ≥15 years. Of 667 confirmed dengue patients, 318 (47.7%) developed plasma leakage, and 349 (52.3%) had no plasma leakage. Multivariate analysis showed three independent factors associated with plasma leakage, including body mass index ≥25.0 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.784; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.040-3.057; P = 0.035), platelet count <100,000/mm3 on fever days 3 to 4 (OR = 2.151; 95% CI = 1.269-3.647; P = 0.004), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥100 U/l on fever days 3 to 4 (OR = 2.189; 95% CI = 1.231-3.891; P = 0.008). Because these three parameters had evidence of equality, each independent factor was weighted to give a score of 1 with a total plasma-leak score of 3. Higher scores were associated with increased plasma leakage occurrence, with ORs of 2.017 (95% CI = 1.052-3.869; P = 0.035) for score 1, 6.158 (95% CI = 2.914-13.015; P <0.001) for score 2, and 6.300 (95% CI = 2.419-16.407; P <0.001) for score 3. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for predicting plasma leakage was good (0.677 [95% CI = 0.616-0.739]). Patients with a plasma-leak score ≥1 had high sensitivity (88.8%), and those with a plasma-leak score of 3 had high specificity (93.4%) for plasma leakage occurrence. This simple and easily accessible clinical score might help physicians provide early and timely appropriate clinical dengue management in endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W3186506879,"Hemophilia A and B are congenital bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency in pro-coagulant factor VIII or IX that is treated by downregulation of antithrombin. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate antithrombin expression remain poorly understood. Here, we identified Cullin 2 and USP2 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase-2) as novel regulators of antithrombin expression that act by modulating antithrombin ubiquitination. Inhibition of the proteasome caused accumulation of antithrombin and its ubiquitinated forms in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. Notably, inhibition of neddylation with MLN4924 suppressed both ubiquitination and degradation of antithrombin, which is recapitulated by silencing of the neddylation enzymes, NAE1, UBA3, and UBE2M, with small interfering RNA (siRNA). We identified Cullin 2 as the interaction partner of antithrombin, and siRNA-mediated Cullin 2 knockdown reduced antithrombin ubiquitination and increased antithrombin protein. We further found that USP2 interacted with antithrombin and regulated antithrombin expression, showing that overexpression of USP2 inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal clearance of antithrombin, whereas pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP2 downregulates antithrombin. Collectively, these results suggest that Cullin 2 E3 ubiquitin ligase and USP2 coordinately regulate antithrombin ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, targeting Cullin 2 and USP2 could be a potential strategy for treatment of hemophilia."
https://openalex.org/W3185342897,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of diatom (microalgae) biomass as a lice-reducing ingredient in salmon feed. The original hypothesis was based on the fact that polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), e.g. 2-trans, 4-trans decadenial (A3) produced by diatoms can function as grazing deterrents and harm copepod development. Salmon lice ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) is a copepod, and we intended to test if inclusion of diatom biomass in the feed could reduce the infestation of lice on salmon. We performed experiments where salmon kept in tanks were offered four different diets, i.e. basic feed with diatoms, fish oil, Calanus sp. oil or rapeseed oil added. After a feeding period of 67 days a statistically representative group of fishes, tagged with diet group origin, were pooled in a 4000L tank and exposed to salmon lice copepodites whereafter lice infestation was enumerated. Salmon from all four diet groups had good growth with SGR values from 1.29 to 1.44% day -1 (increase from ca. 130 g to 350 g). At the termination of the experiment the number of lice on salmon offered diatom feed were statistically significantly lower than on salmon fed the other diets. Mean lice infestation values increased from diatom feed through Calanus and fish oil to standard feed with terrestrial plant ingredients. Analysis of the chemical composition of the different diets (fatty acids, amino acids) failed to explain the differences in lice infestation. The only notable result was that diatom and Calanus feed contained more FFA (free fatty acids) than feed with fish oil and the control feed. None of the potential deleterious targeted polyunsaturated aldehydes could be detected in skin samples of the salmon. What was exclusive for salmon that experienced reduced lice was diatom inclusion in the feed. This therefore still indicates the presence of some lice deterring ingredient, either in the feed, or an ingredient can have triggered production of an deterrent in the fish. An obvious follow up of this will be to perform experiments with different degrees of diatom inclusion in the feeds, i.e. dose response experiments combined with targeted PUA analyses, as well as to perform large scale experiments under natural conditions in aquaculture pens."

The health risk classification criteria for heavy metal contamination of soils and the method of priority assessment for redevelopment were used. The results showed that: the risk of potential utilization types of heavy metals in the abandoned industrial and mining land is different. When the utilization type is agricultural land, the soil environmental quality is good as a whole, and a small number of plots are polluted by cadmium (Cd)and mercury (Hg); When the land use type is construction land, the risk of heavy metal pollution comes from chromium (Cr); The priority of development in this study area is as follows: agricultural land > construction land > ecological land."

Mean age was 63.7 (+ 10.8) years. Among these participants, 44.4%, 15.1% and 8.3% had cataract, dry eye and glaucoma, respectively. Although 86.3% and 88.2% of participants agreed that they should avoid outdoor activities and wear glasses/broad-brimmed hats in harsh daylight, 69.4% and 48.3% of participants never/rarely used glasses or hats/umbrellas in harsh daylight, respectively. Predictors of less practices of eye protection against solar UVR included residents who were male, with lower education level, with longer residence and lack of commercial health insurance. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that practices of eye protection under sun exposure were significantly associated with less cataract, but not glaucoma or dry eye. Participants who did not wear glasses, broad-brimmed hats/use umbrellas or both in harsh sunlight (almost) every time were respectively associated with a 57% (P = 0.028), 45% (P = 0.027) or 70% (P = 0.026) increase of cataract than those who did in harsh sunlight (almost) every time.Practices of eye protection under sun exposure is associated with lower risk of cataract."
https://openalex.org/W3184648017,"The objective of this study was to describe interruptions in the pediatric ambulatory setting and to assess their impact on perceived physician communication, patient satisfaction and recall of provided physician instructions.An observational study was performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pediatric Gastroenterology clinic. Participation consisted of video recording the clinic visit and the caregiver completed post-visit surveys on communication and satisfaction. Video recordings were coded for interruptions, which were divided into 3 main categories: Visit Associated, Pediatric Associated, and Unanticipated. An interruption rate was calculated and correlated with the following outcome variables to assess the impact of interruptions: caregiver satisfaction, caregiver perception on the quality of physician communication, and caregiver instruction recall.There were 675 interruptions noted in the 81 clinic visits, with an average of 7.96 (σ = 7.68) interruptions per visit. Six visits had no interruptions. The Patient was the most frequent interrupter. Significantly higher interruption rates occurred in clinic visits with younger patients (<7 years old) with most of the interruptions being Pediatric Associated interruptions. There was minimal correlation between the clinic visit interruption rate and caregiver satisfaction with the communication, caregiver perception of quality of communication, or caregiver instruction recall rate.The effect of interruptions on the pediatric visit remains unclear. Interruptions may be part of the communication process to ensure alignment of the patient's agenda. Additional studies are needed to help determine the impact of interruptions and guide medical education on patient communication."
https://openalex.org/W3185098108,"Background To constrain propagation and mitigate the burden of COVID-19, most countries initiated and continue to implement several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including national and regional lockdowns. In the Republic of Ireland, the first national lockdown was decreed on 23 rd of March 2020, followed by a succession of restriction increases and decreases (phases) over the following year. To date, the effects of these interventions remain unclear, and particularly within differing population subsets. The current study sought to assess the impact of individual NPI phases on COVID-19 transmission patterns within delineated population subgroups in the Republic of Ireland. Methods and findings Confirmed, anonymised COVID-19 cases occurring between the 29 th of February 2020 and 30 th November 2020 (n = 72,654) were obtained. Segmented modelling via breakpoint regression with multiple turning points was employed to identify structural breaks across sub-populations, including primary/secondary infections, age deciles, urban/commuter/rural areas, patients with underlying health conditions, and socio-demographic profiles. These were subsequently compared with initiation dates of eight overarching NPI phases. Five distinct breakpoints were identified. The first breakpoint, associated with a decrease in the daily COVID-19 incidence, was reported within 14 days of the first set of restrictions in mid-March 2020 for most population sub-groups. Results suggest that moderately strict NPIs were more effective than the strictest Phase 5 (National Lockdown). Divergences were observed across population sub-groups; lagged response times were observed among populations &gt;80 years, residents of rural/ commuter regions, and cases associated with a below-median deprivation score. Conclusions Study findings suggest that many NPIs have been successful in decreasing COVID-19 incidence rates, however the strictest Phase 5 NPI was not. Moreover, NPIs were not equally successful across all sub-populations, with differing response times noted. Future strategies and interventions may need to be increasingly bespoke, based on sub-population profiles and required responses."
https://openalex.org/W3185482321,"We aimed to investigate whether antibiotic administration is necessary for patients with uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. Data from patients diagnosed with uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis, who received inpatient treatment at a single center between January 2019 and January 2021, were retrospectively examined. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether antibiotics were administered. The patients were matched between groups using propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio using logistic regression with the nearest-neighbor method. The primary study outcome was the length of hospital stay, and the secondary outcomes were time to the introduction of sips of water and a soft diet. The study included 138 patients who received antibiotics and 59 who did not. After propensity score matching, 55 patients were assigned to each treatment group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0.772), sex (p>0.999), body mass index (p = 0.121), prehospital symptom duration (p = 0.727), initial body temperature (p = 0.661), white blood cell count (p = 0.688), or C-reactive protein level (p = 0.337). There was also no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the no antibiotic and antibiotic groups (3.1±0.7 days vs. 3.0±1.0 days, p = 0.584). Additionally, no significant difference was observed between the no antibiotic and antibiotic groups with respect to time to sips of water (2.1±0.7 days vs. 1.8±0.9 days, p = 0.100) and time to the introduction of a soft diet (2.4±0.8 days vs. 2.1±0.9 days, p = 0.125). The findings suggest that routine antibiotics may be not required for treating patients with uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis."
https://openalex.org/W3186312636,"Invasive species present a worldwide concern as competition and pathogen reservoirs for native species. Specifically, the invasive social wasp, Vespula pensylvanica, is native to western North America and has become naturalized in Hawaii, where it exerts pressures on native arthropod communities as a competitor and predator. As invasive species may alter the microbial and disease ecology of their introduced ranges, there is a need to understand the microbiomes and virology of social wasps. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiome of V. pensylvanica samples pooled by colony across two geographically distinct ranges and found that wasps generally associate with taxa within the bacterial genera Fructobacillus, Fructilactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, and Zymobacter, and likely associate with environmentally-acquired bacteria. Furthermore, V. pensylvanica harbors-and in some cases were dominated by-many endosymbionts including Wolbachia, Sodalis, Arsenophonus, and Rickettsia, and were found to contain bee-associated taxa, likely due to scavenging on or predation upon honey bees. Next, we used reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR to assay colony-level infection intensity for Moku virus (family: Iflaviridae), a recently-described disease that is known to infect multiple Hymenopteran species. While Moku virus was prevalent and in high titer, it did not associate with microbial diversity, indicating that the microbiome may not directly interact with Moku virus in V. pensylvanica in meaningful ways. Collectively, our results suggest that the invasive social wasp V. pensylvanica associates with a simple microbiome, may be infected with putative endosymbionts, likely acquires bacterial taxa from the environment and diet, and is often infected with Moku virus. Our results suggest that V. pensylvanica, like other invasive social insects, has the potential to act as a reservoir for bacteria pathogenic to other pollinators, though this requires experimental demonstration."
https://openalex.org/W3183586935,"In this study, a network autoregressive model with GARCH effects, denoted by NAR-GARCH, is proposed to depict the return dynamics of stock market indices. A GARCH filter is employed to marginally remove the GARCH effects of each index, and the NAR model with the Granger causality test and Pearson's correlation test with sharp price movements is used to capture the joint effects caused by other indices with the most updated market information. The NAR-GARCH model is designed to depict the joint effects of nonsynchronous multiple time series in an easy-to-implement and effective way. The returns of 20 global stock indices from 2006 to 2020 are employed for our empirical investigation. The numerical results reveal that the NAR-GARCH model has satisfactory performance in both fitting and prediction for the 20 stock indices, especially when a market index has strong upward or downward movements."
https://openalex.org/W3184642829,"The assessment of self-reported outcomes in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is limited by the lack of validated disease-specific measures. The SymptoMScreen (SyMS) is a patient-reported questionnaire for measuring symptom severity in different domains affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), but has not been thoroughly evaluated in NMOSD. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SyMS in a sample of patients with NMOSD.A non-interventional, cross-sectional study in adult subjects with NMOSD (Wingerchuk 2015 criteria) was conducted at 13 neuroimmunology clinics applying the SyMS. A non-parametric item response theory procedure, Mokken analysis, was performed to assess the underlying dimensional structure and scalability of items and overall questionnaire. All analyses were performed with R (v4.0.3) using the mokken library.A total of 70 patients were studied (mean age: 47.5 ± 15 years, 80% female, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score: 3.0 [interquartile range 1.5, 4.5]). Symptom severity was low (median SyMS score: 19.0 [interquartile range 10.0, 32.0]). The SyMS showed a robust internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90 [95% confidence interval 0.86, 0.93]) and behaved as a unidimensional scale with all items showing scalability coefficients > 0.30. The overall SyMS scalability was 0.45 conforming to a medium scale according to Mokken's criteria. Fatigue and body pain were the domains with the highest scalability coefficients. The SyMS was associated with disability (rho: 0.586), and physical and psychological quality of life (rho: 0.856 and 0.696, respectively).The SyMS shows appropriate psychometric characteristics and may constitute a valuable and easy-to-implement option to measure symptom severity in patients with NMOSD."
https://openalex.org/W3186114629,"Adolescence is the last opportunity to reverse any growth faltering accumulated from fetal life through childhood and it is considered a crucial period to optimize human development. In Bangladesh, a growing double burden of underweight and obesity in adolescents is recognized, yet limited data exists on how, when, and where to intervene. This study assesses the dynamics of growth among adolescent girls in Bangladesh, providing insight about critical junctures where faltering occurs and where immediate interventions are warranted.We pooled data from Bangladesh's Food Security and Nutrition Surveillance Project collected between 2011 and 2014 to document the age dynamics of weight and linear growth. 20,572 adolescent girls were measured for height and 19,345 for weight. We constructed growth curves for height, weight, stunting, and underweight. We also stratified growth dynamics by wealth quintile to assess socioeconomic inequities in adolescent trajectories.Height-for-age z-score (HAZ) in Bangladeshi girls deteriorates throughout adolescence and especially during the early years. Mean HAZ decreases by 0.20 standard deviations (sd) per year in early adolescence (10-14 years) vs 0.06 sd/year during late adolescence (15-19 years), while stunting increases by 16 percentage points (pp) vs 6.7 pp, respectively. Conversely, BMI-for-age z-score (BAZ) increases by 0.13 sd/year in early adolescence vs 0.02 sd/year in late adolescence, and underweight decreases by 12.8 pp vs 3.2 pp. Adolescent girls in all socioeconomic groups show a similar pattern of HAZ and BAZ dynamics, but the curve for the richest quintile stays above that of the poorest across all ages.Trends and levels of stunting and underweight among adolescent girls in Bangladesh are worrisome, suggesting substantial linear growth faltering in early adolescence, with improving weight-for-age occurring only as linear growth slows and stops. Given the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Bangladesh and emerging evidence of the link between stunting and later chronic diseases, greater attention to adolescent growth and development is needed. Our findings suggest that, to address stunting, interventions in early adolescence would have the greatest benefits. School-based interventions could be a way to target this population."
