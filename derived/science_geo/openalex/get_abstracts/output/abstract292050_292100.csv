https://openalex.org/W1971288075,"Arabidopsis thaliana is a small flowering plant with various properties that make it an excellent organism for experiments in molecular genetics. These properties include having a small nuclear genome, a near absence of dispersed repetitive DNA, and a generation time of 4 to 5 weeks. In addition, mutations that affect hormone synthesis and response, many different enzyme activities, and numerous developmental processes have been identified and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1977106319,"On the basis of semiempirical and high-level ab initio calculations, theoretical evidence is presented of a ""window"" mechanism operable on the surface of C(60) and other fullerenes. Through this mechanism, large holes may be formed in fullerenes excited to their triplet state, openings through which atoms and small molecules can pass. This work provides a theoretical foundation for experiments that have prepared endohedral noble gas compounds of C(60) under thermal excitation. A method is proposed that could increase the efficiency of the process of noble gas insertion into C(60) and provide a more general means to create endohedral fullerene compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1973613620,"Knowledge of the abundance of H(3)(+) is needed in interstellar and planetary atmospheric chemistry. An important destruction mechanism of H(3)(+) is low-energy electron impact followed by dissociation, but estimates of the reaction rate span several orders of magnitude. As an attempt to resolve this uncertainty, the cross section for dissociative recombination of vibrationally cold H(3)(+) has been measured with an ion storage ring down to collision energies below 1 millielectron volt. A rate coefficient of 1.15 x 10(-7) cubic centimeters per second at 300 kelvin was deduced. The cross section scaled with collision energy according to E(-1.15), giving thee rate a temperature dependence of T(-0.65)."
https://openalex.org/W2081082288,"The Hubble Space Telescope observed the fragmented comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993e) (P indicates that it is a periodic comet) on 1 July 1993. Approximately 20 individual nuclei and their comae were observed in images taken with the Planetary Camera. After subtraction of the comae light, the 11 brightest nuclei have magnitudes between approximately 23.7 and 24.8. Assuming that the geometric albedo is 0.04, these magnitudes imply that the nuclear diameters are in the range approximately 2.5 to 4.3 kilometers. If the density of each nucleus is 1 gram per cubic centimeter, the total energy deposited by the impact of these 11 nuclei into Jupiter's atmosphere next July will be approximately 4 x 10(30) ergs ( approximately 10(8) megatons of TNT). This latter number should be regarded as an upper limit because the nuclear magnitudes probably contain a small residual coma contribution. The Faint Object Spectrograph was used to search for fluorescence from OH, which is usually an excellent indicator of cometary activity. No OH emission was detected, and this can be translated into an upper limit on the water production rate of approximately 2 x 10(27) molecules per second."

Further development of food products and processes based on biotechnology depends upon the improvement of existing processes, such as fermentation, immobilized biocatalyst technology, and production of additives and processing aids, as well as the development of new opportunities for food biotechnology. Improvements are needed in the characterization, safety, and quality control of food materials, in processing methods, in waste conversion and utilization processes, and in currently used food microorganism and tissue culture systems. Also needed are fundamental studies of the structure-function relationship of food materials and of the cell physiology and biochemistry of raw materials."
https://openalex.org/W2054863984,"An important bound on the accuracy of modern techniques for monitoring polar motion is established by intercomparison of measurement series from two different observing techniques, very long baseline interferometry and satellite laser ranging. The root-mean-square differences between the estimates of the pole position from both techniques are shown to be only 2 milliseconds of arc (about 6 centimeters at one Earth radius). In the absence of common systematic errors, these differences bound the total errors in both sets of estimates. An initial investigation did not reveal any clear signature in the pole position that seems to be associated with major earthquakes. Continued measurements at this level of accuracy hold promise for resolving long-standing arguments over such questions as the nature of the excitation mechanism required to maintain the motion of the pole."
https://openalex.org/W2083444022,"Conspicuous changes in gas composition were observed at a fumarole and a mineral spring just before the occurrence of an inland earthquake (magnitude, 6.8) in central Japan in September 1984; the fumarole and spring were 9 and 50 kilometers, respectively, from the earthquake's epicenter. Deep-seated fluids emitted as a result of the compressional stress of the earth tide had been observed previously at this mineral spring and at a lava lake in Hawaii. By analogy, the gas anomaly observed before the earthquake in Japan probably resulted from deepseated fluids being squeezed to the surface by the tectonic stress that caused the earthquake."
