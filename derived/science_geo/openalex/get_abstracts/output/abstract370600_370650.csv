https://openalex.org/W2138544728,"Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinase that relays nutrient availability signals to control numerous cellular functions including autophagy, a process of cellular self-eating activated by nutrient depletion. Addressing the therapeutic potential of modulating mTORC1 signaling and autophagy in human disease requires active chemicals with pharmacologically desirable properties.Using an automated cell-based assay, we screened a collection of >3,500 chemicals and identified three approved drugs (perhexiline, niclosamide, amiodarone) and one pharmacological reagent (rottlerin) capable of rapidly increasing autophagosome content. Biochemical assays showed that the four compounds stimulate autophagy and inhibit mTORC1 signaling in cells maintained in nutrient-rich conditions. The compounds did not inhibit mTORC2, which also contains mTOR as a catalytic subunit, suggesting that they do not inhibit mTOR catalytic activity but rather inhibit signaling to mTORC1. mTORC1 inhibition and autophagosome accumulation induced by perhexiline, niclosamide or rottlerin were rapidly reversed upon drug withdrawal whereas amiodarone inhibited mTORC1 essentially irreversibly. TSC2, a negative regulator of mTORC1, was required for inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rottlerin but not for mTORC1 inhibition by perhexiline, niclosamide and amiodarone. Transient exposure of immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts to these drugs was not toxic in nutrient-rich conditions but led to rapid cell death by apoptosis in starvation conditions, by a mechanism determined in large part by the tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC2, an upstream regulator of mTORC1. By contrast, transient exposure to the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin caused essentially irreversible mTORC1 inhibition, sustained inhibition of cell growth and no selective cell killing in starvation.The observation that drugs already approved for human use can reversibly inhibit mTORC1 and stimulate autophagy should greatly facilitate the preclinical and clinical testing of mTORC1 inhibition for indications such as tuberous sclerosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1966324007,"Integration of diverse data (molecules, fossils) provides the most robust test of the phylogeny of cetaceans. Positioning key fossils is critical for reconstructing the character change from life on land to life in the water.We reexamine relationships of critical extinct taxa that impact our understanding of the origin of Cetacea. We do this in the context of the largest total evidence analysis of morphological and molecular information for Artiodactyla (661 phenotypic characters and 46,587 molecular characters, coded for 33 extant and 48 extinct taxa). We score morphological data for Carnivoramorpha, Creodonta, Lipotyphla, and the raoellid artiodactylan Indohyus and concentrate on determining which fossils are positioned along stem lineages to major artiodactylan crown clades. Shortest trees place Cetacea within Artiodactyla and close to Indohyus, with Mesonychia outside of Artiodactyla. The relationships of Mesonychia and Indohyus are highly unstable, however--in trees only two steps longer than minimum length, Mesonychia falls inside Artiodactyla and displaces Indohyus from a position close to Cetacea. Trees based only on data that fossilize continue to show the classic arrangement of relationships within Artiodactyla with Cetacea grouping outside the clade, a signal incongruent with the molecular data that dominate the total evidence result.Integration of new fossil material of Indohyus impacts placement of another extinct clade Mesonychia, pushing it much farther down the tree. The phylogenetic position of Indohyus suggests that the cetacean stem lineage included herbivorous and carnivorous aquatic species. We also conclude that extinct members of Cetancodonta (whales+hippopotamids) shared a derived ability to hear underwater sounds, even though several cetancodontans lack a pachyostotic auditory bulla. We revise the taxonomy of living and extinct artiodactylans and propose explicit node and stem-based definitions for the ingroup."
https://openalex.org/W2048835947,"Studies have shown that allogeneic (allo-) bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) may enhance tissue repair/regeneration. However, recent studies suggest that immune rejection may occur to allo-MSCs leading to reduced engraftment. In this study, we compared allo-BM-MSCs with syngeneic BM-MSCs or allo-fibroblasts in engraftment and effect in wound healing. Equal numbers of GFP-expressing allo-BM-MSCs, syngeneic BM-MSCs or allo-fibroblasts were implanted into excisional wounds in GFP-negative mice. Quantification of GFP-expressing cells in wounds at 7, 14 and 28 days indicated similar amounts of allogeneic or syngeneic BM-MSCs but significantly reduced amounts of allo-fibroblasts. With healing progression, decreasing amounts of allogeneic and syngeneic BM-MSCs were found in the wound; however, the reduction was more evident (2 fold) in allo-fibroblasts. Similar effects in enhancing wound closure were found in allogeneic and syngeneic BM-MSCs but not in allo-fibroblasts. Histological analysis showed that allo-fibroblasts were largely confined to the injection sites while allo-BM-MSCs had migrated into the entire wound. Quantification of inflammatory cells in wounds showed that allo-fibroblast- but not allo-BM-MSC-treated wounds had significantly increased CD45+ leukocytes, CD3+ lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells. Our study suggests that allogeneic BM-MSCs exhibit ignorable immunogenicity and are equally efficient as syngeneic BM-MSCs in engraftment and in enhancing wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1984576566,"Background Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. Pathogenic mechanisms remain obscure but the neuropathological hallmark is the presence of α-synuclein-immunoreactive glial cytoplasmic inclusions. Genetic variants of the α-synuclein gene, SNCA, are thus strong candidates for genetic association with MSA. One follow-up to a genome-wide association of Parkinson's disease has identified association of a SNP in SNCA with MSA. Methodology/Findings We evaluated 32 SNPs in the SNCA gene in a European population of 239 cases and 617 controls recruited as part of the Neuroprotection and Natural History in Parkinson Plus Syndromes (NNIPPS) study. We used 161 independently collected samples for replication. Two SNCA SNPs showed association with MSA: rs3822086 (P = 0.0044), and rs3775444 (P = 0.012), although only the first survived correction for multiple testing. In the MSA-C subgroup the association strengthened despite more than halving the number of cases: rs3822086 P = 0.0024, OR 2.153, (95% CI 1.3–3.6); rs3775444 P = 0.0017, OR 4.386 (95% CI 1.6–11.7). A 7-SNP haplotype incorporating three SNPs either side of rs3822086 strengthened the association with MSA-C further (best haplotype, P = 8.7×10−4). The association with rs3822086 was replicated in the independent samples (P = 0.035). Conclusions/Significance We report a genetic association between MSA and α-synuclein which has replicated in independent samples. The strongest association is with the cerebellar subtype of MSA.

https://openalex.org/W1978518826,"Emerging infectious diseases represent a challenge for global economies and public health. About one fourth of the last pandemics have been originated by the spread of vector-borne pathogens. In this sense, the advent of modern molecular techniques has enhanced our capabilities to understand vector-host interactions and disease ecology. However, host identification protocols have poorly profited of international DNA barcoding initiatives and/or have focused exclusively on a limited array of vector species. Therefore, ascertaining the potential afforded by DNA barcoding tools in other vector-host systems of human and veterinary importance would represent a major advance in tracking pathogen life cycles and hosts. Here, we show the applicability of a novel and efficient molecular method for the identification of the vertebrate host's DNA contained in the midgut of blood-feeding arthropods. To this end, we designed a eukaryote-universal forward primer and a vertebrate-specific reverse primer to selectively amplify 758 base pairs (bp) of the vertebrate mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (COI) gene. Our method was validated using both extensive sequence surveys from the public domain and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) experiments carried out over specimens from different Classes of vertebrates (Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia and Amphibia) and invertebrate ectoparasites (Arachnida and Insecta). The analysis of mosquito, culicoid, phlebotomie, sucking bugs, and tick bloodmeals revealed up to 40 vertebrate hosts, including 23 avian, 16 mammalian and one reptilian species. Importantly, the inspection and analysis of direct sequencing electropherograms also assisted the resolving of mixed bloodmeals. We therefore provide a universal and high-throughput diagnostic tool for the study of the ecology of haematophagous invertebrates in relation to their vertebrate hosts. Such information is crucial to support the efficient management of initiatives aimed at reducing epidemiologic risks of arthropod vector-borne pathogens, a priority for public health."
https://openalex.org/W1977339956,"The transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha regulates functional plasticity in adipose tissue by linking sympathetic input to the transcriptional program of adaptive thermogenesis. We report here a novel truncated form of PGC-1alpha (NT-PGC-1alpha) produced by alternative 3' splicing that introduces an in-frame stop codon into PGC-1alpha mRNA. The expressed protein includes the first 267 amino acids of PGC-1alpha and 3 additional amino acids from the splicing insert. NT-PGC-1alpha contains the transactivation and nuclear receptor interaction domains but is missing key domains involved in nuclear localization, interaction with other transcription factors, and protein degradation. Expression and subcellular localization of NT-PGC-1alpha are dynamically regulated in the context of physiological signals that regulate full-length PGC-1alpha, but the truncated domain structure conveys unique properties with respect to protein-protein interactions, protein stability, and recruitment to target gene promoters. Therefore, NT-PGC-1alpha is a co-expressed, previously unrecognized form of PGC-1alpha with functions that are both unique from and complementary to PGC-1alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1971956518,"Nitric oxide (NO) activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to induce cell death. However, the mechanism by which this pathway is activated in cells exposed to NO is not known. Here we report that BAX and BAK are activated by NO and that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria. Cells deficient in Bax and Bak or Caspase-9 are completely protected from NO-induced cell death. The individual loss of the BH3-only proteins, Bim, Bid, Puma, Bad or Noxa, or Bid knockdown in Bim−/−/Puma−/− MEFs, does not prevent NO-induced cell death. Our data show that the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 undergoes ASK1-JNK1 mediated degradation upon exposure to NO, and that cells deficient in either Ask1 or Jnk1 are protected against NO-induced cell death. NO can inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain resulting in an increase in superoxide generation and peroxynitrite formation. However, scavengers of ROS or peroxynitrite do not prevent NO-induced cell death. Collectively, these data indicate that NO degrades MCL-1 through the ASK1-JNK1 axis to induce BAX/BAK-dependent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1966357480,"Objective To investigate the effects of melatonin treatment in a rat model of white matter damage (WMD) in the developing brain. Additionally, we aim to delineate the cellular mechanisms of melatonin effect on the oligodendroglial cell lineage. Methods A unilateral ligation of the uterine artery in pregnant rat at the embryonic day 17 induces fetal hypoxia and subsequent growth restriction (GR) in neonatal pups. GR and control pups received a daily intra-peritoneal injection of melatonin from birth to post-natal day (P) 3. Results Melatonin administration was associated with a dramatic decrease in microglial activation and astroglial reaction compared to untreated GR pups. At P14, melatonin prevented white matter myelination defects with an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (APC-immunoreactive) in treated GR pups. Conversely, melatonin was not found to be associated with an increased density of total oligodendrocytes (Olig2-immunoreactive), suggesting that melatonin is able to promote oligodendrocyte maturation but not proliferation. These effects appear to be melatonin-receptor dependent and were reproduced in vitro. Interpretation These data suggest that melatonin has a strong protective effect on developing damaged white matter through decreased microglial activation and oligodendroglial maturation leading to a normalization of the myelination process. Consequently, melatonin should be a considered as an effective neuroprotective candidate not only in perinatal brain damage but also in inflammatory and demyelinating diseases observed in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2047081878,"Among the different subsets of dendritic cells (DC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) play a unique role in secreting large amounts of type I interferons upon viral stimulation, but their efficiency as antigen-presenting cells has not been completely characterized. We show here, by flow cytometry, with human primary blood PDC and with a PDC cell line, that PDC display poor endocytic capacity for soluble or cellular antigens when compared to monocyte-derived myeloid DC. However, immature PDC efficiently take up cellular material from live influenza-exposed cells, subsequently mature and cross-present viral antigens very efficiently to specific CD8+ T cells. Therefore, during viral infection PDC not only secrete immunomodulatory cytokines, but also recognize infected cells and function as antigen cross-presenting cells to trigger the anti-viral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2039681364,"Microfabrication of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices has provided a new set of tools for studying fluid dynamics of blood at the scale of real microvessels. However, we are only starting to understand the power and limitations of this technology. To determine the applicability of PDMS microchannels for blood flow analysis, we studied white blood cell (WBC) margination in channels of various geometries and blood compositions. We found that WBCs prefer to marginate downstream of sudden expansions, and that red blood cell (RBC) aggregation facilitates the process. In contrast to tubes, WBC margination was restricted to the sidewalls in our low aspect ratio, pseudo-2D rectangular channels and consequently, margination efficiencies of more than 95% were achieved in a variety of channel geometries. In these pseudo-2D channels blood rheology and cell integrity were preserved over a range of flow rates, with the upper range limited by the shear in the vertical direction. We conclude that, with certain limitations, rectangular PDMS microfluidic channels are useful tools for quantitative studies of blood rheology."
https://openalex.org/W2068907635,"Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for both lifelong daily maintenance of all blood cells and for repair after cell loss. Until recently the cellular mechanisms by which HSCs accomplish these two very different tasks remained an open question. Biological evidence has now been found for the existence of two related mouse HSC populations. First, a dormant HSC (d-HSC) population which harbors the highest self-renewal potential of all blood cells but is only induced into active self-renewal in response to hematopoietic stress. And second, an active HSC (a-HSC) subset that by and large produces the progenitors and mature cells required for maintenance of day-to-day hematopoiesis. Here we present computational analyses further supporting the d-HSC concept through extensive modeling of experimental DNA label-retaining cell (LRC) data. Our conclusion that the presence of a slowly dividing subpopulation of HSCs is the most likely explanation (amongst the various possible causes including stochastic cellular variation) of the observed long term Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) retention, is confirmed by the deterministic and stochastic models presented here. Moreover, modeling both HSC BrdU uptake and dilution in three stages and careful treatment of the BrdU detection sensitivity permitted improved estimates of HSC turnover rates. This analysis predicts that d-HSCs cycle about once every 149–193 days and a-HSCs about once every 28–36 days. We further predict that, using LRC assays, a 75%–92.5% purification of d-HSCs can be achieved after 59–130 days of chase. Interestingly, the d-HSC proportion is now estimated to be around 30–45% of total HSCs - more than twice that of our previous estimate."
https://openalex.org/W2028994295,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional secreted glycoprotein that displays broad anti-tumor activity based on dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment (anti-angiogenic action) and the tumor cells (direct anti-tumor action). Here, we show that PEDF expression is high in melanocytes, but it is lost during malignant progression of human melanoma. Using a high-throughput analysis of the data from microarray studies of molecular profiling of human melanoma, we found that PEDF expression is lost in highly invasive melanomas. In paired cell lines established from the same lesion but representing the high and low extremes of malignant potential, abundant PEDF expression was restricted to the poorly aggressive counterparts. We used RNA interference to directly address the functional consequences of PEDF silencing. PEDF knockdown in poorly aggressive melanoma cell lines augmented migration, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry, which translated into an increased in vivo metastatic potential. PEDF interference also significantly enhanced the migratory and invasive capability of normal melanocytes and moderately increased their proliferative potential. Our results show that loss of PEDF enables melanoma cells to acquire an invasive phenotype and, therefore, modulation of this multifunctional factor could be critical for the malignant progression of human melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2093910429,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-associated condition and a common finding in Alzheimer's disease in which amyloid-β (Aβ) vascular deposits are featured in >80% of the cases. Familial Aβ variants bearing substitutions at positions 21–23 are primarily associated with CAA, although they manifest with strikingly different clinical phenotypes: cerebral hemorrhage or dementia. The recently reported Piedmont L34V Aβ mutant, located outside the hot spot 21–23, shows a similar hemorrhagic phenotype, albeit less aggressive than the widely studied Dutch E22Q variant. We monitored the apoptotic events occurring after stimulation of human brain microvascular endo-thelial and smooth muscle cells with nonfibrillar structures of both variants and wild-type Aβ40. Induction of analogous caspase-mediated mitochondrial pathways was elicited by all peptides, although within different time frames and intensity. Activated pathways were susceptible to pharmacological modulation either through direct inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release or by the action of pan- and pathway-specific caspase inhibitors, giving a clear indication of the independent or synergistic engagement of both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. Structural analyses of the Aβ peptides showed that apoptosis preceded fibril formation, correlating with the presence of oligomers and/or protofibrils. The data support the notion that rare genetic mutations constitute unique paradigms to understand the molecular pathogenesis of CAA.—Fossati, S., Cam, J., Meyerson, J., Mezhericher, E., Romero, I.

https://openalex.org/W2063557450,"Background Following the amputation of a limb, newts and salamanders have the capability to regenerate the lost tissues via a complex process that takes place at the site of injury. Initially these cells undergo dedifferentiation to a state competent to regenerate the missing limb structures. Crucially, dedifferentiated cells have memory of their level of origin along the proximodistal (PD) axis of the limb, a property known as positional identity. Notophthalmus viridescens Prod1 is a cell-surface molecule of the three-finger protein (TFP) superfamily involved in the specification of newt limb PD identity. The TFP superfamily is a highly diverse group of metazoan proteins that includes snake venom toxins, mammalian transmembrane receptors and miscellaneous signaling molecules. Methodology/Principal Findings With the aim of identifying potential orthologs of Prod1, we have solved its 3D structure and compared it to other known TFPs using phylogenetic techniques. The analysis shows that TFP 3D structures group in different categories according to function. Prod1 clusters with other cell surface protein TFP domains including the complement regulator CD59 and the C-terminal domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator. To infer orthology, a structure-based multiple sequence alignment of representative TFP family members was built and analyzed by phylogenetic methods. Prod1 has been proposed to be the salamander CD59 but our analysis fails to support this association. Prod1 is not a good match for any of the TFP families present in mammals and this result was further supported by the identification of the putative orthologs of both CD59 and N. viridescens Prod1 in sequence data for the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum. Conclusions/Significance The available data suggest that Prod1, and thereby its role in encoding PD identity, is restricted to salamanders. The lack of comparable limb-regenerative capability in other adult vertebrates could be correlated with the absence of the Prod1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2023351304,"The rapidly expanding availability of de novo sequencing technologies can greatly facilitate efforts to monitor the relatively high mutation rates of influenza A viruses and the detection of quasispecies. Both the mutation rates and the lineages of influenza A viruses are likely to play an important role in the natural history of these viruses and the emergence of phenotypically and antigenically distinct strains.We evaluated quasispecies and mixed infections by de novo sequencing the whole genomes of 10 virus isolates, including eight avian influenza viruses grown in embryonated chicken eggs (six waterfowl isolates - five H3N2 and one H4N6; an H7N3 turkey isolate; and a bald eagle isolate with H1N1/H2N1 mixed infection), and two tissue cultured H3N2 swine influenza viruses. Two waterfowl cloacal swabs were included in the analysis. Full-length sequences of all segments were obtained with 20 to 787-X coverage for the ten viruses and one cloacal swab. The second cloacal swab yielded 15 influenza reads of approximately 230 bases, sufficient for bioinformatic inference of mixed infections or quasispecies. Genomic subpopulations or quasispecies of viruses were identified in four egg grown avian influenza isolates and one cell cultured swine virus. A bald eagle isolate and the second cloacal swab showed evidence of mixed infections with two (H1 and H2) and three (H1, H3, and H4) HA subtypes, respectively. Multiple sequence differences were identified between cloacal swab and the virus recovered using embryonated chicken eggs.We describe a new approach to comprehensively identify mixed infections and quasispecies in low passage influenza A isolates and cloacal swabs and add to the understanding of the ecology of influenza A virus populations."
https://openalex.org/W2068959310,"The etiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is still unknown; numerous studies are performed to unravel the environmental factors involved in triggering the disease. SLC11A1 is a membrane transporter that is expressed in late endosomes of antigen presenting cells involved in the immunopathogenic events leading to T1DM. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been reported to be a possible trigger in the development of T1DM.Fifty nine T1DM patients and 79 healthy controls were genotyped for 9 polymorphisms of SLC11A1 gene, and screened for the presence of MAP by PCR. Differences in genotype frequency were evaluated for both T1DM patients and controls. We found a polymorphism in the SLC11A1 gene (274C/T) associated to type 1 diabetic patients and not to controls. The presence of MAP DNA was also significantly associated with T1DM patients and not with controls.The 274C/T SCL11A1 polymorphism was found to be associated with T1DM as well as the presence of MAP DNA in blood. Since MAP persists within macrophages and it is also processed by dendritic cells, further studies are necessary to evaluate if mutant forms of SLC11A1 alter the processing or presentation of MAP antigens triggering thereby an autoimmune response in T1DM patients."

https://openalex.org/W2078192516,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease predominantly affecting motor neurons and manifesting as several different phenotypes. Whether these phenotypes correspond to different underlying disease processes is unknown. We used latent cluster analysis to identify groupings of clinical variables in an objective and unbiased way to improve phenotyping for clinical and research purposes.Latent class cluster analysis was applied to a large database consisting of 1467 records of people with ALS, using discrete variables which can be readily determined at the first clinic appointment. The model was tested for clinical relevance by survival analysis of the phenotypic groupings using the Kaplan-Meier method.The best model generated five distinct phenotypic classes that strongly predicted survival (p<0.0001). Eight variables were used for the latent class analysis, but a good estimate of the classification could be obtained using just two variables: site of first symptoms (bulbar or limb) and time from symptom onset to diagnosis (p<0.00001).The five phenotypic classes identified using latent cluster analysis can predict prognosis. They could be used to stratify patients recruited into clinical trials and generating more homogeneous disease groups for genetic, proteomic and risk factor research."
https://openalex.org/W2081984388,"Earlier we showed that RACK1 regulates growth of human colon cells by suppressing Src activity at G(1) and mitotic checkpoints. Here, we show that RACK1 also induces apoptosis of the cells, partly by inhibiting Src. In the intrinsic pathway, RACK1 inhibits expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), induces expression of pro-apoptotic Bim, targets Bim and Bax to the mitochondria, induces oligomerization of Bax (which requires Bim and inhibition of Src), depolarizes mitochondria membranes, releases cytochrome c, and activates caspases-9 and -3 and death substrates. Bax and Bim are required for RACK1-mediated mitochondrial cell death. RACK1-induced oligomerization of Bax is required for staurosporine-mediated cell death. RACK1 also induces apoptosis by blocking Src activation of the Akt cell survival pathway. This leads to activation of the transcription factor FOXO3, a potent inducer of apoptosis and G(1) arrest. Collectively, our results show that RACK1, partly by inhibiting Src, promotes mitochondrial cell death and blocks Akt-mediated cell survival. Thus, RACK1 inhibits growth and induces death of colon cells. Exploitation of these dual functions could lead to novel colon cancer therapies that mimic RACK1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2061520576,"Amyloid beta-protein 1-42 (Abeta42) is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD), although it is a minor part of Abeta. In contrast, Abeta40 is the predominant secreted form of Abeta and recent studies have suggested that Abeta40 has neuroprotective effects and inhibits amyloid deposition. We have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Abeta42 to Abeta40, and its inhibition enhances brain Abeta42 deposition (Zou, K., Yamaguchi, H., Akatsu, H., Sakamoto, T., Ko, M., Mizoguchi, K., Gong, J. S., Yu, W., Yamamoto, T., Kosaka, K., Yanagisawa, K., and Michikawa, M. (2007) J. Neurosci. 27, 8628-8635). ACE has two homologous domains, each having a functional active site. In the present study, we identified the domain of ACE, which is responsible for converting Abeta42 to Abeta40. Interestingly, Abeta42-to-Abeta40-converting activity is solely found in the N-domain of ACE and the angiotensin-converting activity is found predominantly in the C-domain of ACE. We also found that the N-linked glycosylation is essential for both Abeta42-to-Abeta40- and angiotensin-converting activities and that unglycosylated ACE rapidly degraded. The domain-specific converting activity of ACE suggests that ACE inhibitors could be designed to specifically target the angiotensin-converting C-domain, without inhibiting the Abeta42-to-Abeta40-converting activity of ACE or increasing neurotoxic Abeta42."
https://openalex.org/W1979669814,"Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (Evi-1) is a nuclear transcription factor, which is essential for the proliferation/maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Aberrant expression of Evi-1 has been frequently found in myeloid leukemia, and is associated with a poor patient survival. Recently, we reported candidate target genes of Evi-1 shared in HSCs and leukemic cells using gene expression profiling analysis. In this study, we identified Pbx1, a proto-oncogene in hematopoietic malignancy, as a target gene of Evi-1. Overexpression of Evi-1 increased Pbx1 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. An analysis of the Pbx1 promoter region revealed that Evi-1 upregulates Pbx1 transcription. Furthermore, reduction of Pbx1 levels through RNAi-mediated knockdown significantly inhibited Evi-1-induced transformation. In contrast, knockdown of Pbx1 did not impair bone marrow transformation by E2A/HLF or AML1/ETO, suggesting that Pbx1 is specifically required for the maintenance of bone marrow transformation mediated by Evi-1. These results indicate that Pbx1 is a target gene of Evi-1 involved in Evi-1-mediated leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2070397094,"Compartmentalization of HIV-1 between the genital tract and blood was noted in half of 57 women included in 12 studies primarily using cell-free virus. To further understand differences between genital tract and blood viruses of women with chronic HIV-1 infection cell-free and cell-associated virus populations were sequenced from these tissues, reasoning that integrated viral DNA includes variants archived from earlier in infection, and provides a greater array of genotypes for comparisons.Multiple sequences from single-genome-amplification of HIV-1 RNA and DNA from the genital tract and blood of each woman were compared in a cross-sectional study. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were evaluated for evidence of compartmentalization using four statistical tests. Genital tract and blood HIV-1 appears compartmentalized in 7/13 women by >/=2 statistical analyses. These subjects' phylograms were characterized by low diversity genital-specific viral clades interspersed between clades containing both genital and blood sequences. Many of the genital-specific clades contained monotypic HIV-1 sequences. In 2/7 women, HIV-1 populations were significantly compartmentalized across all four statistical tests; both had low diversity genital tract-only clades. Collapsing monotypic variants into a single sequence diminished the prevalence and extent of compartmentalization. Viral sequences did not demonstrate tissue-specific signature amino acid residues, differential immune selection, or co-receptor usage.In women with chronic HIV-1 infection multiple identical sequences suggest proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells, and low diversity tissue-specific phylogenetic clades are consistent with bursts of viral replication. These monotypic and tissue-specific viruses provide statistical support for compartmentalization of HIV-1 between the female genital tract and blood. However, the intermingling of these clades with clades comprised of both genital and blood sequences and the absence of tissue-specific genetic features suggests compartmentalization between blood and genital tract may be due to viral replication and proliferation of infected cells, and questions whether HIV-1 in the female genital tract is distinct from blood."
https://openalex.org/W2059089835,"The metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau are central to the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined the in vivo turnover of APP, secreted APP (sAPP), Aβ and tau in the wild-type and Tg2576 mouse brain using cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. In spite of overexpression of APP in the Tg2576 mouse, APP is rapidly degraded, similar to the rapid turnover of the endogenous protein in the wild-type mouse. sAPP is cleared from the brain more slowly, particularly in the Tg2576 model where the half-life of both the endogenous murine and transgene-derived human sAPP is nearly doubled compared to wild-type mice. The important Aβ degrading enzymes neprilysin and IDE were found to be highly stable in the brain, and soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in both wild-type and Tg2576 mice rapidly declined following the depletion of APP. The cytoskeletal-associated protein tau was found to be highly stable in both wild-type and Tg2576 mice. Our findings unexpectedly show that of these various AD-relevant protein metabolites, sAPP turnover in the brain is the most different when comparing a wild-type mouse and a β-amyloid depositing, APP overexpressing transgenic model. Given the neurotrophic roles attributed to sAPP, the enhanced stability of sAPP in the β-amyloid depositing Tg2576 mice may represent a neuroprotective response."
https://openalex.org/W2101431584,"Background While premature suture fusion, or craniosynostosis, is a relatively common condition, the cause is often unknown. Estrogens are associated with growth plate fusion of endochondral bones. In the following study, we explore the previously unknown significance of estrogen/estrogen receptor signaling in cranial suture biology. Methodology/Principal Findings Firstly, estrogen receptor (ER) expression was examined in physiologically fusing (posterofrontal) and patent (sagittal) mouse cranial sutures by quantitative RT-PCR. Next, the cranial suture phenotype of ER alpha and ER beta knockout (αERKO, βERKO) mice was studied. Subsequently, mouse suture-derived mesenchymal cells (SMCs) were isolated; the effects of 17-β estradiol or the estrogen antagonist Fulvestrant on gene expression, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation were examined in vitro. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed in which Fulvestrant was administered subcutaneously to the mouse calvaria. Results showed that increased ERα but not ERβ transcript abundance temporally coincided with posterofrontal suture fusion. The αERKO but not βERKO mouse exhibited delayed posterofrontal suture fusion. In vitro, addition of 17-β estradiol enhanced both osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in suture-derived mesenchymal cells, effects reversible by Fulvestrant. Finally, in vivo application of Fulvestrant significantly diminished calvarial osteogenesis, inhibiting suture fusion. Conclusions/Significance Estrogen signaling through ERα but not ERβ is associated with and necessary for normal mouse posterofrontal suture fusion. In vitro studies suggest that estrogens may play a role in osteoblast and/or chondrocyte differentiation within the cranial suture complex."
https://openalex.org/W2001808817,"Lack of available iron is one of many environmental challenges that a bacterium encounters during infection and adaptation to iron starvation is important for the pathogen to efficiently replicate within the host. Here we define the transcriptional response of B. anthracis Sterne (34F2) to iron depleted conditions. Genome-wide transcript analysis showed that B. anthracis undergoes considerable changes in gene expression during growth in iron-depleted media, including the regulation of known and candidate virulence factors. Two genes encoding putative internalin proteins were chosen for further study. Deletion of either gene (GBAA0552 or GBAA1340) resulted in attenuation in a murine model of infection. This attenuation was amplified in a double mutant strain. These data define the transcriptional changes induced during growth in low iron conditions and illustrate the potential of this dataset in the identification of putative virulence determinants for future study."

https://openalex.org/W2063021920,"Background During mammalian preimplantation development, lineage divergence seems to be controlled by the interplay between asymmetric cell division (once cells are polarized) and positional information. In the mouse embryo, two distinct cell populations are first observed at the 16-cell stage and can be distinguished by both their position (outside or inside) and their phenotype (polarized or non-polarized). Many efforts have been made during the last decade to characterize the molecular mechanisms driving lineage divergence. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to evaluate the importance of cell polarity in the determination of cell fate we have disturbed the activity of the apical complex aPKC/PAR6 using siRNA to down-regulate aPKCλ expression. Here we show that depletion of aPKCλ results in an absence of tight junctions and in severe polarity defects at the 16-cell stage. Importantly, we found that, in absence of aPKCλ, cell fate depends on the cellular context: depletion of aPKCλ in all cells results in a strong reduction of inner cells at the 16-cell stage, while inhibition of aPKCλ in only half of the embryo biases the progeny of aPKCλ defective blastomeres towards the inner cell mass. Finally, our study points to a role of cell shape in controlling cell position and thus lineage allocation. Conclusion Our data show that aPKCλ is dispensable for the establishment of polarity at the 8-cell stage but is essential for the stabilization of cell polarity at the 16-cell stage and for cell positioning. Moreover, this study reveals that in addition to positional information and asymmetric cell divisions, cell shape plays an important role for the control of lineage divergence during mouse preimplantation development. Cell shape is able to influence both the type of division (symmetric or asymmetric) and the position of the blastomeres within the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2075621262,"Prior studies showed that tyrosine 12 phosphorylation in the N-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel, K(ir)3.1 facilitates channel deactivation by increasing intrinsic GTPase activity of the channel. Using a phosphoselective antibody directed against this residue (pY12), we now report that partial sciatic nerve ligation increased pY12-K(ir)3.1-immunoreactivity (ir) in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of wild-type mice, but not in mice lacking the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) or lacking the G-protein receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) genes. Treatment of AtT-20 cells stably expressing KOR-GFP with the selective KOR agonist U50,488 increased both phospho-p38-ir and pY12-K(ir)3.1-ir. The U50,488-induced increase in pY12-K(ir)3.1-ir was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Cells expressing KOR(S369A)-GFP did not increase either phospho-p38-ir or pY12-K(ir)3.1-ir following U50,488 treatment. Whole cell voltage clamp of AtT-20 cells expressing KOR-GFP demonstrated that p38 activation by U50,488 reduced somatostatin-evoked K(ir)3 currents. This heterologous desensitization was blocked by SB203580 and was not evident in cells expressing KOR(S369A)-GFP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of K(ir)3.1 was likely mediated by p38 MAPK activation of Src kinase. U50,488 also increased (pY418)Src-ir; this increase was blocked by SB203580 and not evident in KOR(S369A)-GFP expressing AtT20 cells; the Src inhibitor PP2 blocked the U50,488-induced increase in pY12-K(ir)3.1-ir; and the heterologous desensitization of K(ir)3 currents was blocked by PP2. These results suggest that KOR causes phosphorylation of Y12-K(ir)3.1 and channel inhibition through a GRK3-, p38 MAPK- and Src-dependent mechanism. Reduced inward potassium current following nerve ligation would increase dorsal horn neuronal excitability and may contribute to the neuropathic pain response."
https://openalex.org/W2044692126,"Background Jails are an important venue of HIV care and a place for identification, treatment and referral for care. HIV infected inmates in the San Francisco County jail are offered antiretroviral treatment (ART), which many take only while in jail. We evaluated the effect of ART administration in a cohort of jail inmates going in and out of jail over a nine year period. Methodology/Principal Findings In this retrospective study, we examined inmates with HIV going in and out of jail. Inmates were categorized by patterns of ART use: continuous ART - ART both in and out of jail, intermittent ART - ART only in jail; never on ART - eligible by national guidelines, but refused ART. CD4 and HIV viral load (VL) were compared over time in these groups. Over a 9 year period, 512 inmates were studied: 388 (76%) on intermittent ART, 79 (15%) on continuous ART and 45(9%) never-on ART. In a linear mixed model analysis, inmates on intermittent ART were 1.43; 95%CI (1.03, 1.99) times and those never on ART were 2.89; 95%CI (1.71, 4.87) times more likely to have higher VL than inmates on continuous ART. Furthermore, Inmates on intermittent ART and never-on ART lost 1.60; 95%CI (1.06, 2.13) and 1.97; 95%CI (0.96, 3.00) more CD4 cells per month, respectively, compared to continuously treated inmates. The continuous ART inmates gained 0.67CD4 cells/month. Conclusions/Significance Continuous ART therapy in jail inmate's benefits CD4 cell counts and control of VL especially compared to those who never took ART. Although jail inmates on intermittent ART were more likely to lose CD4 cells and experience higher VL over time than those on continuous ART, CD4 cell loss was slower in these inmates as compared to inmates never on ART. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether or not intermittent ART provides some benefit in outcome if continuous ART is not possible or likely."
https://openalex.org/W2101699830,"Demyelinating polyneuropathy is a debilitating, poorly understood disease that can exist in acute (Guillain-Barré syndrome) or chronic forms. Interleukin-10 (IL-10), although traditionally considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has also been implicated in promoting abnormal angiogenesis in the eye and in the pathobiology of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and encephalomyelitis.Overexpression of IL-10 in a transgenic mouse model leads to macrophage-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy. IL-10 upregulates ICAM-1 within neural tissues, promoting massive macrophage influx, inflammation-induced demyelination, and subsequent loss of neural tissue resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis. The primary insult is to perineural myelin followed by secondary axonal loss. Infiltrating macrophages within the peripheral nerves demonstrate a highly pro-inflammatory signature. Macrophages are central players in the pathophysiology, as in vivo depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes reverses the phenotype, including progressive nerve loss and paralysis. Macrophage-mediate demyelination is dependent on Fas-ligand (FasL)-mediated Schwann cell death.These findings mimic the human disease chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and may also promote further understanding of the pathobiology of related conditions such as acute idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or Guillain-Barré syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2077058377,"The laminins are a family of heterotrimeric basement membrane proteins that play roles in cellular adhesion, migration, and tissue morphogenesis. Through in silico analysis of the laminin-encoding genes, we identified a novel family of alternate splice isoforms derived from the 5′-end of the LAMA3 and LAMA5 genes. These isoforms resemble the netrins in that they contain a laminin N-terminal domain followed by a short stretch of laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like repeats. We suggest the terms LaNt (laminin N terminus) α3 and LaNt α5, for the predicted protein products of these mRNAs. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of these transcripts at the mRNA level. Moreover, they exhibit differential, tissue-specific, expression profiles. To confirm the existence of LaNt α3 protein, we generated an antibody to a unique domain within the putative polypeptide. This antibody recognizes a protein at the predicted molecular mass of 64 kDa by immunoblotting. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analyses revealed a basement membrane staining in epithelial tissue for LaNt α3 and LaNt α3 localized along the substratum-associated surface of cultured keratinocytes. We have also tested the functionality LaNt α3 through RNAi-mediated knockdown.

The identification of a lower than initially predicted number of genes in mouse and human genomes has dramatically increased the focus on alternate splicing as an important mechanism of providing the necessary temporally and spatially restricted changes required in gene and protein expression as an organism both develops and responds to injury (1.Kim E. Goren A. Ast G. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, according to recent reports, 40–60% of human genes are alternatively spliced (2.Modrek B. Lee C.J. Nat.

Alternative splicing of such genes results in the inclusion or exclusion of particular exons with the functional consequence of varying the domain composition of the ECM protein (8.Kosmehl H.

In this study, we have utilized an in silico approach to identify a family of transcripts derived by alternative splicing from the laminin extracellular matrix family. The laminins are a major family of basement membrane proteins with roles in maintenance of tissue integrity, in signaling, and development (14.Aumailley M. Smyth N. J.

To date, 12 laminin-encoding genes have been identified, which, based on sequence identity, are subdivided into 5 α, 4 β, and 3 γ chains encoded by LAMA1–5, LAMB1–4, and LAMC1–3, respectively (16.Aumailley M.

In contrast, LAMA3B contains exons 1–38 and 40–76 (i.e. skips exon 39), and encodes a full-length laminin termed α3b (Fig. 1B).

Here, we describe the identification of multiple, short, alternate splice isoforms derived from the 5′-end of the genes (LAMA3 and LAMA5) encoding the α3 and α5 laminin subunits. Functional studies utilizing siRNA knockdown of one of these newly identified isoforms shows that it plays an important role in epidermal cell adhesion and in keratinocyte migration.

The pET41 construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS and protein expression induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were extracted using Bugbuster (Novagen), and the fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, washed extensively, and separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE bis/Tris gel. The band corresponding to GST-LAMA3exon9e was excised and used for rabbit polyclonal antibody production (Moravian Biotechnology, Czech Republic). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin was obtained from Sigma Aldrich; GB3, a mouse monoclonal against laminin γ2 and B1K, a mouse monoclonal against laminin β3, were obtained from Harlan Sera lab Ltd, England and Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, respectively.

They were then treated with 0.005% trypsin, 0.0004% EDTA in PBS (Invitrogen). Phase contrast images were taken every 5 min for 90 min, and the percentage of rounded cells in the population was determined. 72 h after transfection, a scratch wound was created in a confluent monolayer of HaCaT cells with a 10-μl tip, washed twice with PBS, and the medium replaced with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Images of the wound area were taken every 20 min for 36 h. At 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 15 h post-scratching, the width of the wound was measured using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Extracts of cells in monolayers were generated by scraping washed cells directly into urea/SDS sample buffer as previously described (36.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Microscopy confirmed complete removal of cells. ECM proteins were then solubilized in urea/SDS sample buffer. Conditioned medium of confluent or scratch-wounded cultured cells was collected, clarified by low speed centrifugation, and proteins precipitated using ammonium sulfate (1.5-4 m). Protein preparations were subject to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as described elsewhere (36.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar).

Genet. 2003; 12: 2395-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in silico analysis of the laminin α3-encoding gene was undertaken utilizing tools available on the University of Santa Cruz genome browser. Careful analyses of the 5′-end of the LAMA3 gene identified 2 ESTs containing readthrough of 5′ splice sites, raising the possibility that short, novel, splice isoforms are transcribed from this gene. IMAGE clone 1737146, isolated from a testis library (GenBankTM AI125611), was recognized as carrying an extension to the LAMA3 exon 9 (subsequently termed exon 9e) generated by readthrough of the exon 9-intron 9 splice boundary. This exon extension contained a stop codon and a polyadenylation signal, and the isolated EST carried a polyA tail and therefore appeared to be a genuine polyadenylated mRNA species, termed LAMA3LN1. Alternative splicing algorithms predicted that this transcript comprised exons 1–9 of LAMA3, encoding 487 amino acids of which the final 64 were encoded by exon 9e and were therefore unique to this peptide (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR products derived from human epithelial-containing tissues and keratinocytes confirmed the presence of this transcript at the mRNA level (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the mouse and human sequences surrounding the exon 9/intron 9 splice boundary revealed perfect cross species conversation; however, in both there are three changes within the exonic sequence relative to the consensus splice site sequence suggesting a weak splice site (Fig. 1B) (37.Zhang M.Q. Hum Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Readthrough into mouse lama3 intron 9 also introduced an in-frame stop codon 5′ to a consensus polyadenylation signal sequence in a similar location to the human sequence and therefore predicted production of a peptide of almost identical length to human (Fig. 1C). RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the equivalent mouse sequence, and the presence at the message level of this transcript (mlama3ln1) was confirmed in cDNA derived from cultured mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 2B). A second EST was identified that also contained the first 9 LAMA3 exons with splicing occurring within exon 10 to a site within exon 18, then continuing to exon 25 (LAMA3LN2). Readthrough of the 5′ splice site of exon 25 incorporated a unique region containing a polyadenylation signal. The sequence corresponding to this mRNA (GenBankTM AK096422) contained a frameshift insertion, which, in turn, led to a termination codon in exon 19, predicting a protein of 483 amino acids (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR primers were designed to test for the presence of this transcript in the various tissues of a multiple tissue cDNA panel. Two PCR products of a larger size than predicted were amplified and sequenced. The larger product consisted of exons 8 to 25 with 5′ splice site readthrough into exon 25e (LAMA3LN2a). The smaller product had exon 10 spliced out but was otherwise identical (LAMA3LN2b) (Fig. 2A). Assuming both these products were spliced normally to the first 7 exons, one would predict products of 1039 amino acids and 994 amino acids, respectively, of which the final 4 amino acids were derived from exon 25e and were therefore unique. The conserved domain architecture of the various laminin chains, coupled with the expression of fewer isoforms in lower organisms, suggested that gene duplication and rearrangement are responsible for the presence of the multiple chains. With this in mind, the 5′-end of the LN domain containing laminin α chains was analyzed in silico. No potential products were identified in LAMA1 or LAMA2; however, an analogous EST was identified that aligns to LAMA5. This EST (GenBankTM BC015386), had been isolated from a breast adenocarcinoma library and was predicted to encode the first 11 exons of LAMA5 spliced to an alternate 12th exon (exon 12*) including a termination codon (LAMA5LN2) (Fig. 1A). Translation of this mRNA would generate a peptide of 500 amino acids with the final eight being encoded by the alternate 12th exon. The latter would therefore be unique to this transcript. Notably, splice site boundaries at both LAMA3 exon25 and LAMA5 exon 11 also diverged from the consensus sequence (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify this LAMA5-derived transcript. These yielded two major products (LAMA5LN1 and LAMA5LN2) when tested on normal breast cDNA (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of these products revealed the smaller product to contain the expected exons 1–11 plus 12* and the larger, more abundant, second product to be generated from 5′ splice site readthrough of exon 11 (into exon 11e); therefore, consisting of exons 1–11 plus 11e (Fig. 1A). This additional exon encoded a termination codon 11-bp downstream leading to the generation of a protein of 496 amino acids in size. Both transcripts contained non-consensus polyadenylation signal sequences (38.Beaudoing E. Freier S. Wyatt J.R. Claverie J.M. Gautheret D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar).

Lower levels were detected in pancreas, brain, ovary, and fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). No products were present in the colon, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, thymus, or spleen. RT-PCR analysis of the expression profile of the other isoforms revealed distinct differences in distribution. LAMA3LN2a was strongly expressed in placenta, liver, thymus, and prostate with weaker expression in testis and colon; LAMA3LN2b was present in liver, testis, and leukocytes; LAMA5LN1 was strongly expressed in heart, brain, placenta, kidney, spleen, prostate, and small intestine and, more weakly, in liver, pancreas, thymus, and colon; LAMA5LN2 was present in tissues similar to LAMA5LN1 albeit at generally lower levels, particularly in kidney and pancreas with minor products in heart, placenta, liver, prostate, and small intestine (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Of the newly identified isoforms, LAMA3LN1 has the longest region of unique mRNA and protein sequence and therefore was amenable for further study as a paradigm of this new transcript family. Its expression pattern was investigated through ISH using a probe derived from exon 9e, which is specific to the LAMA3LN1 transcript. Positive labeling was obtained in practically all epithelial structures in tongue and skin sections. Staining was seen in the epidermis/interfollicular epidermis from the basal layer to the granular layer with slightly stronger staining in the basal layer (Fig. 2C). Sebaceous glands (not shown), sweat glands, and ducts also stained (Fig. 2D). In the hair follicle, the outer and inner root sheaths were notably labeled with the most prominent label in the hair matrix up to the middle cortex (Fig. 2E). Negligible signal was obtained in connective tissues. These results largely parallel those previously obtained for LAMA3 transcripts in skin and hair (39.Miosge N. Kluge J.G. Studzinski A. Zelent C.

https://openalex.org/W2168009418,"Protein ubiquitylation is a complex enzymatic process that results in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, through Gly-76 of ubiquitin, to an ɛNH2 group of an internal lysine residue in a given substrate. Although E3 ligases frequently use lysines adjacent to the degron within the substrate, many substrates can be targeted to the proteasome through the polyubiquitylation of any lysine. We have assessed the role of lysine residues proximal to the cyclin D1 phosphodegron for ubiquitylation by the SCFFbx4/αB-crystallin ubiquitin ligase and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1. The work described herein reveals a requisite role for Lys-269 (K269) for the rapid polyubiquitin-mediated degradation of cyclin D1. Mutation of Lys-269, which is proximal to the phosphodegron sequence surrounding Thr-286 in cyclin D1, not only stabilizes cyclin D1 but also triggers cyclin D1 accumulation within the nucleus, thereby promoting cell transformation. In addition, D1-K269R is resistant to genotoxic stress-induced degradation, similar to non-phosphorylatable D1-T286A, supporting the critical role for the post-translational regulation of cyclin D1 in response to DNA-damaging agents. Strikingly, although mutation of lysine 269 to arginine inhibits cyclin D1 degradation, it does not inhibit cyclin D1 ubiquitylation in vivo, showing that ubiquitylation of a specific lysine can influence substrate targeting to the 26S proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W1988283321,"Background The human PAF (hPAF) complex is part of the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus and regulates multiple steps in gene expression. Further, the yeast homolog of hPaf1 has a role in regulating the expression of a subset of genes involved in the cell-cycle. We therefore investigated the role of hPaf1 during progression of the cell-cycle. Methodology/Findings Herein, we report that the expression of hPaf1, a subunit of the hPAF complex, increases with cell-cycle progression and is regulated in a cell-cycle dependant manner. hPaf1 specifically regulates a subclass of genes directly implicated in cell-cycle progression during G1/S, S/G2, and G2/M. In prophase, hPaf1 aligns in filament-like structures, whereas in metaphase it is present within the pole forming a crown-like structure, surrounding the centrosomes. Moreover, hPaf1 is degraded during the metaphase to anaphase transition. In the nucleus, hPaf1 regulates the expression of cyclins A1, A2, D1, E1, B1, and Cdk1. In addition, expression of hPaf1 delays DNA replication but favors the G2/M transition, in part through microtubule assembly and mitotic spindle formation. Conclusion/Significance Our results identify hPaf1 and the hPAF complex as key regulators of cell-cycle progression. Mutation or loss of stoichiometry of at least one of the members may potentially lead to cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2025011610,"Background All influenza pandemic plans advocate pandemic vaccination. However, few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. This paper compares the economic outcomes of vaccination compared with treatment with antiviral agents alone, in Singapore. Methodology We analyzed the economic outcomes of pandemic vaccination (immediate vaccination and vaccine stockpiling) compared with treatment-only in Singapore using a decision-based model to perform cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses. We also explored the annual insurance premium (willingness to pay) depending on the perceived risk of the next pandemic occurring. Principal Findings The treatment-only strategy resulted in 690 deaths, 13,950 hospitalization days, and economic cost of USD$497 million. For immediate vaccination, at vaccine effectiveness of >55%, vaccination was cost-beneficial over treatment-only. Vaccine stockpiling is not cost-effective in most scenarios even with 100% vaccine effectiveness. The annual insurance premium was highest with immediate vaccination, and was lower with increased duration to the next pandemic. The premium was also higher with higher vaccine effectiveness, attack rates, and case-fatality rates. Stockpiling with case-fatality rates of 0.4–0.6% would be cost-beneficial if vaccine effectiveness was >80%; while at case-fatality of >5% stockpiling would be cost-beneficial even if vaccine effectiveness was 20%. High-risk sub-groups warrant higher premiums than low-risk sub-groups. Conclusions The actual pandemic vaccine effectiveness and lead time is unknown. Vaccine strategy should be based on perception of severity. Immediate vaccination is most cost-effective, but requires vaccines to be available when required. Vaccine stockpiling as insurance against worst-case scenarios is also cost-effective. Research and development is therefore critical to develop and stockpile cheap, readily available effective vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1967862467,"Background Human primary monocytes are refractory to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) or transduction with HIV-1-derived vectors. In contrast, efficient single round transduction of monocytes is mediated by vectors derived from simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabeys (SIVsmmPBj), depending on the presence of the viral accessory protein Vpx. Methods and Findings Here we analyzed whether Vpx of SIVsmmPBj is sufficient for transduction of primary monocytes by HIV-1-derived vectors. To enable incorporation of PBj Vpx into HIV-1 vector particles, a HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein was generated. Supplementation of HIV-1 vector particles with this fusion protein was not sufficient to facilitate transduction of human monocytes. However, monocyte transduction with HIV-1-derived vectors was significantly enhanced after delivery of Vpx proteins by virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from SIVsmmPBj. Moreover, pre-incubation with Vpx-containing VLPs restored replication capacity of infectious HIV-1 in human monocytes. In monocytes of non-human primates, single-round transduction with HIV-1 vectors was enabled. Conclusion Vpx enhances transduction of primary human and even non-human monocytes with HIV-1-derived vectors, only if delivered in the background of SIVsmmPBj-derived virus-like particles. Thus, for accurate Vpx function the presence of SIVsmmPBj capsid proteins might be required. Vpx is essential to overcome a block of early infection steps in primary monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2078235243,"BRCA1 is a key regulatory protein participating in cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage repair networks. BRCA1 plays important roles in protecting numerous cellular processes in response to cell damaging signals. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a potent regulator of growth, apoptosis and invasiveness of tumor cells. TFG-beta activates Smad signaling via its two cell surface receptors, the TbetaRII and ALK5/TbetaRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation.Here, we report an important role of BRCA1 in modulating TGF-beta signaling during oxidative stress responses. Wild-type (WT) BRCA1, but not mutated BRCA1 failed to activate TGF-beta mediated transactivation of the TGF-beta responsive reporter, p3TP-Lux. Further, WT-BRCA1, but not mutated BRCA1 increased the expression of Smad3 protein in a dose-dependent manner, while silencing of WT-BRCA1 by siRNA decreased Smad3 and Smad4 interaction induced by TGF-beta in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. BRCA1 interacted with Smad3 upon TGF-beta1 stimulation in MCF-7 cells and this interaction was mediated via the domain of 298-436aa of BRCA1 and Smad3 domain of 207-426aa. In addition, H(2)O(2) increased the colocalization and the interaction of Smad3 with WT-BRCA1. Interestingly, TGF-beta1 induced Smad3 and Smad4 interaction was increased in the presence of H(2)O(2) in cells expressing WT-BRCA1, while the TGF-beta1 induced interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 was decreased upon H(2)O(2) treatment in a dose-dependent manner in HCC1937 breast cancer cells, deficient for endogenous BRCA1. This interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 was increased in reconstituted HCC1937 cells expressing WT-BRCA1 (HCC1937/BRCA1). Further, loss of BRCA1 resulted in H(2)O(2) induced nuclear export of phosphor-Smad3 protein to the cytoplasm, resulting decreased of Smad3 and Smad4 interaction induced by TGF-beta and in significant decrease in Smad3 and Smad4 transcriptional activities.These results strongly suggest that loss or reduction of BRCA1 alters TGF-beta growth inhibiting activity via Smad3 during oxidative stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2094222314,"Background One of the most debated issues in the cognitive neuroscience of language is whether distinct semantic domains are differentially represented in the brain. Clinical studies described several anomic dissociations with no clear neuroanatomical correlate. Neuroimaging studies have shown that memory retrieval is more demanding for proper than common nouns in that the former are purely arbitrary referential expressions. In this study a semantic relatedness paradigm was devised to investigate neural processing of proper and common nouns. Methodology/Principal Findings 780 words (arranged in pairs of Italian nouns/adjectives and the first/last names of well known persons) were presented. Half pairs were semantically related (“Woody Allen” or “social security”), while the others were not (“Sigmund Parodi” or “judicial cream”). All items were balanced for length, frequency, familiarity and semantic relatedness. Participants were to decide about the semantic relatedness of the two items in a pair. RTs and N400 data suggest that the task was more demanding for common nouns. The LORETA neural generators for the related-unrelated contrast (for proper names) included the left fusiform gyrus, right medial temporal gyrus, limbic and parahippocampal regions, inferior parietal and inferior frontal areas, which are thought to be involved in the conjoined processing a familiar face with the relevant episodic information. Person name was more emotional and sensory vivid than common noun semantic access. Conclusions/Significance When memory retrieval is not required, proper name access (conspecifics knowledge) is not more demanding. The neural generators of N400 to unrelated items (unknown persons and things) did not differ as a function of lexical class, thus suggesting that proper and common nouns are not treated differently as belonging to different grammatical classes."
https://openalex.org/W2003991896,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and hyperplastic bone marrow. Complete loss or interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 occur frequently in MDS. One candidate tumor suppressor on 5q is the mammalian Diaphanous (mDia)-related formin mDia1, encoded by DIAPH1 (5q31.3). mDia-family formins act as effectors for Rho-family small GTP-binding proteins including RhoB, which has also been shown to possess tumor suppressor activity. Mice lacking the Drf1 gene that encodes mDia1 develop age-dependent myelodysplastic features. We crossed mDia1 and RhoB knockout mice to test whether the additional loss of RhoB expression would compound the myelodysplastic phenotype. Drf1(-/-)RhoB(-/-) mice are fertile and develop normally. Relative to age-matched Drf1(-/-)RhoB(+/-) mice, the age of myelodysplasia onset was earlier in Drf1(-/-)RhoB(-/-) animals--including abnormally shaped erythrocytes, splenomegaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition, we observed a statistically significant increase in the number of activated monocytes/macrophages in both the spleen and bone marrow of Drf1(-/-)RhoB(-/-) mice relative to Drf1(-/-)RhoB(+/-) mice. These data suggest a role for RhoB-regulated mDia1 in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965751720,"Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors are essential players in fast synaptic transmission in the vertebrate central nervous system. Their synaptic delivery and localization as well as their electrophysiological properties are regulated by transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). However, the exact mechanisms of how the four originally designated TARPs (gamma2, gamma3, gamma4, and gamma8) modulate AMPA receptor function remain largely unknown. Previous studies suggested the C-terminal domain (CTD) of gamma2 to mediate increased trafficking and reduced desensitization of AMPA receptors. As it remained unclear whether these findings extend to other TARPs, we set out to investigate and compare the role of the CTDs of the four original TARPs in AMPA receptor modulation. To address this issue, we replaced the TARP CTDs with the CTD of the homologous subunit gamma1, a voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit expressed in skeletal muscle that lacks TARP properties. We analyzed the impact of the resulting chimeras on GluR1 functional properties in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, the CTDs of all TARPs not only modulate the extent and kinetics of desensitization but also modulate agonist potencies of AMPA receptors. Furthermore, the CTDs are required for TARP-induced modulation of AMPA receptor gating, including conversion of antagonists to partial agonists and constitutive channel openings. Strikingly, we found a special role of the cytoplasmic tail of gamma4, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of modulation of AMPA receptor function are different among the TARPs. We propose that the intracellularly located CTD is the origin of TARP-specific functional modulation and not merely a facilitator of trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1974992164,"Platelet depletion is a key feature of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection. The mechanism underlying STEC-induced platelet depletion, however, is not completely understood.Here we demonstrated for the first time that platelet surface expression of CD47 was significantly decreased in C57BL6 mice treated with concentrated culture filtrates (CCF) from STEC O157:H7. STEC O157:H7 CCF treatment also led to a sharp drop of platelet counts. The reduction of cell surface CD47 was specific for platelets but not for neutrophil, monocytes and red blood cells. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was also observed in isolated human platelets treated with O157:H7 CCF. Platelet surface CD47 reduction by O157:H7 CCF could be blocked by anti-TLR4 antibody but not anti-CD62 antibody. Down-regulation of platelet surface CD47 was positively correlated with platelet activation and phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, the enhanced phagocytosis process of O157:H7 CCF-treated platelets was abolished by addition of soluble CD47 recombinants.Our results suggest that platelet CD47 down-regulation may be a novel mechanism underneath STEC-induced platelet depletion, and that the interactions between CD47 and its receptor, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), play an essential role in modulating platelet homeostasis."

The role of the fifth transmembrane domain (TMD5) was investigated using the substituted cysteine accessibility method. All of the residues within Thr-190 to Leu-217 region were mutated one at a time to cysteine, and after expression in COS-7 cells, the mutant receptors were treated with the sulfhydryl-specific alkylating agent methanethiosulfonate-ethylammonium (MTSEA). MTSEA reacts selectively with water-accessible, free sulfhydryl groups of endogenous or introduced point mutation cysteines.

However, the microtubule motors involved in this process have not been identified. In the present report, we studied the role of kinesin-1, a plus-end microtubule molecular motor that has been implicated in the movement of organelles in the Na,K-ATPase traffic. We determined by confocal microscopy and biochemical assays that kinesin-1 and the Na,K-ATPase are present in the same membranous cellular compartment. Knockdown of kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC) or the light chain-2 (KLC2), but not of the light chain-1 (KLC1), decreased the movement of Na,K-ATPase-containing vesicles when compared to sham siRNA-transfected cells (control group). Thus, a specific isoform of kinesin-1 is required for microtubule-dependent recruitment of Na,K-ATPase to the plasma membrane, which is of physiological significance—Trejo, H.

https://openalex.org/W2025541267,"Insulin binds with high affinity to the insulin receptor (IR) and with low affinity to the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGFR). Such cross-binding, which reflects homologies within the insulin-IGF signaling system, is of clinical interest in relation to the association between hyperinsulinemia and colorectal cancer. Here, we employ nonstandard mutagenesis to design an insulin analog with enhanced affinity for the IR but reduced affinity for the IGFR. Unnatural amino acids were introduced by chemical synthesis at the N- and C-capping positions of a recognition alpha-helix (residues A1 and A8). These sites adjoin the hormone-receptor interface as indicated by photocross-linking studies. Specificity is enhanced more than 3-fold on the following: (i) substitution of Gly(A1) by D-Ala or D-Leu, and (ii) substitution of Thr(A8) by diaminobutyric acid (Dab). The crystal structure of [D-Ala(A1),Dab(A8)]insulin, as determined within a T(6) zinc hexamer to a resolution of 1.35 A, is essentially identical to that of human insulin. The nonstandard side chains project into solvent at the edge of a conserved receptor-binding surface shared by insulin and IGF-I. Our results demonstrate that modifications at this edge discriminate between IR and IGFR. Because hyperinsulinemia is typically characterized by a 3-fold increase in integrated postprandial insulin concentrations, we envisage that such insulin analogs may facilitate studies of the initiation and progression of cancer in animal models. Future development of clinical analogs lacking significant IGFR cross-binding may enhance the safety of insulin replacement therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at increased risk of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087484917,"Recent work has demonstrated that Drosophila can be used as a model of dilated cardiomyopathy, defined as an enlarged cardiac chamber at end-diastole when the heart is fully relaxed and having an impaired systolic function when the heart is fully contracted. Gene mutations that cause cardiac dysfunction in adult Drosophila can result from abnormalities in cardiac development or alterations in post-developmental heart function. To clarify the contribution of transgene expression to post-developmental cardiac abnormalities, we applied strategies to examine the temporal and spacial effects of transgene expression on cardiac function. We engineered transgenic Drosophila based on the well-characterized temperature-sensitive Gal80 protein in the context of the bipartite Gal4/UAS transgenic expression system in Drosophila employing the cardiac specific driver, tinCΔ4-Gal4. Then, we developed a strategy using optical coherence tomography to serially measure cardiac function in the individual flies over time course of several days. As a proof of concept we examined the effects of the expression of a human mutant delta-sarcoglycan associated with familial heart failure and observed a reversible, post-developmental dilated cardiomyopathy in Drosophila. Our results show that the unique imaging strategy based on the non-destructive, non-invasive properties of optical coherence tomography can be applied to serially examine cardiac function in individual adult flies. Furthermore, the induction and reversal of cardiac transgene expression can be investigated in adult flies thereby providing insight into the post-developmental effects of transgene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2037233226,"As a transcription factor, the critical tumor suppressor, p53, directly regulates the transcription of hundreds of genes, leading to cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, cellular senescence and differentiation. Although it has been assumed that p53 transcription activity is critical for tumor suppression, this assumption has been increasingly contested by recent findings of transcription-independent roles of p53 in apoptosis as well as findings that none of the mutant mice lacking important p53 transcription targets are cancer prone. On the basis of previous findings that p53 transcription activity is abolished in p53QS (Leu25Trp26 to Gln25Ser26) knock-in mouse cells after DNA damage, to determine the importance of transcription activity of p53 in tumor suppression, we generated knock-in mice that can conditionally express p53QS protein in a Cre-dependent manner. By breeding the knock-in mice with Lck-Cre transgenic mice that specifically express Cre in thymocytes, we show that p53-dependent suppression of thymic lymphomas is abolished in thymocytes expressing high levels of p53QS protein. In addition, p53QS protein is accumulated in some of the thymic tumors. Therefore, p53 transcription activity induced by DNA damage is required for tumor suppression. Together with the findings that the disruption of various p53-dependent functions individually fails to promote cancer, our findings indicate that various transcription-dependent functions of p53 must collaborate to efficiently suppress tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074001319,"Background In areas where adult HIV prevalence has reached hyperendemic levels, many infants remain at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Timely access to care and treatment for HIV-infected infants and young children remains an important challenge. We explore the extent to which public sector roll-out has met the estimated need for paediatric treatment in a rural South African setting. Methods Local facility and population-based data were used to compare the number of HIV infected children accessing HAART before 2008, with estimates of those in need of treatment from a deterministic modeling approach. The impact of programmatic improvements on estimated numbers of children in need of treatment was assessed in sensitivity analyses. Findings In the primary health care programme of HIV treatment 346 children <16 years of age initiated HAART by 2008; 245(70.8%) were aged 10 years or younger, and only 2(<1%) under one year of age. Deterministic modeling predicted 2,561 HIV infected children aged 10 or younger to be alive within the area, of whom at least 521(20.3%) would have required immediate treatment. Were extended PMTCT uptake to reach 100% coverage, the annual number of infected infants could be reduced by 49.2%. Conclusion Despite progress in delivering decentralized HIV services to a rural sub-district in South Africa, substantial unmet need for treatment remains. In a local setting, very few children were initiated on treatment under 1 year of age and steps have now been taken to successfully improve early diagnosis and referral of infected infants."
https://openalex.org/W2132431394,"In contrast to traditional views that consider smooth pursuit as a relatively automatic process, evidence has been reported for the importance of attention for accurate pursuit performance. However, the exact role that attention might play in the maintenance of pursuit remains unclear.We analysed the neuronal activity associated with healthy subjects executing smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) during concurrent attentive tracking of a moving sound source, which was either in-phase or in antiphase to the executed eye movements. Assuming that attentional resources must be allocated to the moving sound source, the simultaneous execution of SPEM and auditory tracking in diverging directions should result in increased load on common attentional resources. By using an auditory stimulus as a distractor rather then a visual stimulus we guaranteed that cortical activity cannot be caused by conflicts between two simultaneous visual motion stimuli. Our results revealed that the smooth pursuit task with divided attention led to significantly higher activations bilaterally in the posterior parietal cortex and lateral and medial frontal cortex, presumably containing the parietal, frontal and supplementary eye fields respectively.The additional cortical activation in these areas is apparently due to the process of dividing attention between the execution of SPEM and the covert tracking of the auditory target. On the other hand, even though attention had to be divided the attentional resources did not seem to be exhausted, since the identification of the direction of the auditory target and the quality of SPEM were unaffected by the congruence between visual and auditory motion stimuli. Finally, we found that this form of task-related attention modulated not only the cortical pursuit network in general but also affected modality specific and supramodal attention regions."
https://openalex.org/W2079957777,"Background Abnormal Ca2+ transients are often observed in heart muscles under a variety of pathophysiological conditions including ventricular tachycardia. To clarify whether these abnormal Ca2+ transients can be attributed to abnormal action potential generation or abnormal Ca2+ handling/excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, we developed a procedure to determine Ca2+ and action potential signals at the cellular level in isolated heart tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings After loading ventricular papillary muscle with rhod-2 and di-4-ANEPPS, mono-wavelength fluorescence images from rhod-2 and ratiometric images of two wavelengths of emission from di-4-ANEPPS were sequentially obtained. To mimic the ventricular tachycardia, the ventricular muscles were field-stimulated in non-flowing Krebs solution which elicited abnormal Ca2+ transients. For the failed and alternating Ca2+ transient generation, there were two types of causes, i.e., failed or abnormal action potential generation and abnormal EC coupling. In cells showing delayed initiation of Ca2+ transients with field stimulation, action potential onset was delayed and the rate of rise was slower than in healthy cells. Similar delayed onset was also observed in the presence of heptanol, an inhibitor of gap junction channels but having a non-specific channel blocking effect. A Na+ channel blocker, on the other hand, reduced the rate of rise of the action potentials but did not result in desynchronization of the action potentials. The delayed onset of action potentials can be explained primarily by impaired gap junctions and partly by Na+ channel inactivation. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that there are multiple patterns for the causes of abnormal Ca2+ signals and that our methods are useful for investigating the physiology and pathophysiology of heart muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2016764423,"BMPs are currently receiving attention for their role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Currently, most BMP expression studies are performed on carcinomas, and not much is known about the situation in sarcomas.We have investigated the BMP expression profiles and Smad activation in clones from different spontaneous canine mammary tumors. Spindle cell tumor and osteosarcoma clones expressed high levels of BMPs, in particular BMP-2, -4 and -6. Clones from a scirrhous carcinoma expressed much lower BMP levels. The various clones formed different tumor types in nude mice but only clones that expressed high levels of BMP-6 gave bone formation. Phosphorylated Smad-1/5, located in the nucleus, was detected in tumors derived from clones expressing high levels of BMPs, indicating an active BMP signaling pathway and BMP-2 stimulation of mammary tumor cell clones in vitro resulted in activation of the Smad-1/5 pathway. In contrast BMP-2 stimulation did not induce phosphorylation of the non-Smad pathway p38 MAPK. Interestingly, an increased level of the BMP-antagonist chordin-like 1 was detected after BMP stimulation of non-bone forming clones.We conclude that the specific BMP expression repertoire differs substantially between different types of mammary tumors and that BMP-6 expression most probably has a biological role in bone formation of canine mammary tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2039528413,"The study of double-stranded RNA unwinding by helicases is a problem of basic scientific interest. One such example is provided by studies on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase using single molecule mechanical experiments. HCV currently infects nearly 3% of the world population and NS3 is a protein essential for viral genome replication. The objective of this study is to model the RNA unwinding mechanism based on previously published data and study its characteristics and their dependence on force, ATP and NS3 protein concentration. In this work, RNA unwinding by NS3 helicase is hypothesized to occur in a series of discrete steps and the steps themselves occurring in accordance with an underlying point process. A point process driven change point model is employed to model the RNA unwinding mechanism. The results are in large agreement with findings in previous studies. A gamma distribution based renewal process was found to model well the point process that drives the unwinding mechanism. The analysis suggests that the periods of constant extension observed during NS3 activity can indeed be classified into pauses and subpauses and that each depend on the ATP concentration. The step size is independent of external factors and seems to have a median value of 11.37 base pairs. The steps themselves are composed of a number of substeps with an average of about 4 substeps per step and an average substep size of about 3.7 base pairs. An interesting finding pertains to the stepping velocity. Our analysis indicates that stepping velocity may be of two kinds- a low and a high velocity."
