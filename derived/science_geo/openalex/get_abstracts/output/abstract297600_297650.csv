https://openalex.org/W1996106043,"San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, an Olmec site which flourished 1150900 B.C. was excavated by Yale University and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. Obsidian tools from the site, and obsidian from 25 Mexican and Guatemalan sources were analyzed by x-ray emission spectroscopy for iron, manganese, rubidium and zirconium. 25 samples were also analyzed by neutron activation for manganese and sodium. X-ray fluorescence analysis was used to compare obsidian from 2 sites. The obsidians from each source are dis tinguishable by appearance, flaking characteristics and trace element concentration. 8 of the 25 sources appear to be represented at SanLorenzo, and there is evidence of trading in obsidian, and of changes in trade routes. -- AATA"
https://openalex.org/W4229614729,"Although the average rate of seismic energy release within the moon appears to be far below that of the earth, over 100 events believed to be moonquakes have been recorded by the two seismic stations installed on the lunar surface during Apollo missions 12 and 14. With few exceptions, the moonquakes occur at monthly intervals near times of perigee and apogee and show correlations with the longer-term (7-month) lunar gravity variations. The repeating moonquakes are believed to occur at not less than 10 different locations. However, a single focal zone accounts for 80 percent of the total seismic energy detected. This active zone appears to be 600 kilometers south-southwest of the Apollo 12 and 14 sites and deep within the moon. Each focal zone must be small (less than 10 kilometers in linear dimension) and fixed in location over a 14-month period. Cumulative strain at each location is inferred. Thus, the moonquakes appear to be releasing internal strain of unknown origin, the release being triggered by tidal stresses."

https://openalex.org/W2006455272,"Exposure of Trichomonas vaginalis in vaginal discharge for 60 hours to 5,000-10,000 units of penicillin in 10.0 ml of a medium containing cysteine (0.15 per cent.), peptone, liver infusion, maltose and human serum was adequate to destroy the associated bacteria. Seven strains were isolated from seven women without a failure. This technic widens the field of investigation by offering a means of obtaining additional strains of bacteria-free Trichomonas vaginalis for comparative study. Efforts to isolate Trichomonas vaginalis by such laborious methods as washing, micropipetting and migration have all failed to yield bacteria-free cultures at this and other laboratories. The adherence of bacteria to the trichomonads, which appear to have sticky surfaces, and the relatively slow speed with which these protozoa swim are probably in large measure responsible for failure. Further trials by these methods now seem unnecessary. In the cases reported above the success of the penicillin method may be attributed to several factors. Resistance of Trichomonas vaginalis to penicillin in the concentrations reported above, the absence from the specimens of vaginal discharge of bacteria resistant to penicillin in these same concentrations, and the destruction of bacteria adherent to the sticky surfaces of the trichomonads perhaps played a large part in assuring successful isolation of the protozoa."
