https://openalex.org/W1999081856,"Cats trained to discriminate between the speech sounds [u] and [i] do not retain and are unable to relearn this discrimination after bilateral ablation of the ventral insular-temporal cortex. In control animals, retention of this ability is not affected by bilateral removal of primary auditory receiving cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2015881218,"Two determinants of adaptation in a mechanoreceptor (Pacinian corpuscle) are described. Both are filters of non-transients. One, a mechanical filter, prevents static components of the mechanical stimulus from reaching the transducer element (nerve ending). This filter is represented by the laminar capsule of the receptor. When the capsule is eliminated by dissection, the generator potential of the nerve ending in response to a sustained stimulus is markedly prolonged. Another filter is represented by an inactivation process of the mechanisms of nerve impulse initiation which prevents a steady outward current from producing repetitive impulses. Both filters cut the duration of the receptor response to a few milliseconds."

https://openalex.org/W1984587416,"Embryonic abnormalities are known to be induced in chick embryos when they are injected with certain organophosphate insecticides prior to incubation. The marked teratogenic effects of Bidrin [3-(dimethoxyphosphinyloxy) N,N-dimethyl-cis-crotonamide] can be alleviated by many analogs of nicotinamide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Successive hydroxylation and N-dealkylation of Bidrin in the egg are not greatly altered by injection of nicotinamide. The delayed neurotoxicity in adult hens after administering tri-o-cresyl phosphate is also partially relieved by administering certain nicotinamide analogs."

https://openalex.org/W1988739612,"Thermal treatment of crystalline β-carotene (240°C in a vacuum) results in the formation of a volatile fraction containing chiefly aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, m- and p-xylene, 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, and ionene. These compounds have been identified by means of gas-liquid chromatography, infrared spectroscopy, and, in the case of ionene, by additional nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. The principal degradation product is a yellowish-brown, glutinous mass which can be separated by means of preparative thin-layer chromatography in a number of fractions different in molecular weight. The structure of these fractions is not yet clear."

https://openalex.org/W2046451647,"Rates of synthesis of hemoglobin A by erythroid cells from thalassemic subjects are markedly decreased. Formation of hemoglobin F, however, proceeds at similar rates in cells from subjects with thalassemia and other types of hemolytic anemias. A mechanism is suggested regarding the altered patterns of hemoglobin synthesis under conditions of erythropoietic stimulation in subjects with and without thalassemia."

https://openalex.org/W2021460976,"The growth of Escherichia coli is reversibly inhibited by drugs of the morphine series. The order of inhibitory effectiveness for the drugs tested was levallorphan > levorphanol > dextrorphan > nalorphine > morphine. The synthetic analgesic, levorphanol, was studied in greater detail. Its effectiveness was found to be strongly dependent on the pH of the medium. Raising the pH of the medium provides a higher concentration of the neutral free base which is thought to diffuse across cell membranes more readily. However, considerations other than the rate of entry of drug into the cells must be of importance since an already established growth inhibition is promptly reversed upon lowering the pH of the medium. Two mutants of Escherichia coli with altered sensitivity to levorphanol were isolated."

A second component, 2-methyl-1,4-quinone, was previously known from the secretion of related millipedes."

https://openalex.org/W2061733973,"Chromatography, on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, of leg muscle extracts from older chick embryos yields three myosin-containing fractions, whereas material from muscle extracts of 11-day embryos cannot be eluted under the same conditions. A major fraction having the adenosine triphosphotase activity characteristic of myosin can be eluted when 11-day-old embryo muscle extracts are given prior treatment with ribonuclease."

https://openalex.org/W2093212855,"IN a previous communication1, we suggested that mechanoreceptor nerve endings in the capsules of the laryngeal joints might contribute to the reflex regulation of the activity of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles; and we there described our identification of the appropriate innervation of the laryngeal joints. Further physiological studies have now specifically demonstrated articular reflex influences on the intrinsic laryngeal muscles from the afferent nerves supplying the cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid joints."

https://openalex.org/W2024943977,"GLUCOSAMINE and galactosamine are usually identified by the ninhydrin degradation method devised by Gardell, Heijkenskjold and Roch-Norlund1, and Stoffyn and Jeanloz2. The method suffers, however, from the disadvantage that glucosamine and mannosamine are not distinguishable under these conditions, since the two hexosamines are converted into the same pentose, that is, arabinose. This communication describes a new method which permits the identification of the three isomers of the hexosamines."

This effect may precede the intracellular action of bilirubin and contribute to the greater severity of experimental manifestations of hyperbilirubinemia with antecedent asphyxia than of asphyxia alone."
https://openalex.org/W2091766908,"THE crystal structure of N-acetylglucosamme, C8H15O6N, has been investigated in connexion with the work on lysozyme proceeding in this laboratory1. Salton2 and others have shown that N-acetylglucosamine is a basic constituent of the bacterial cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, the most commonly used substrate of lysozyme (muramidase), and Wenzel et al.3 have reported that this compound inhibits the action of the enzyme. At a later stage it is hoped to relate the structure to those of lysozyme and its substrates in detail."

Attempts have been made to develop convenient alternatives3–5, but so far these have been shown to yield results valid only for specific cases."
