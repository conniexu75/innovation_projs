https://openalex.org/W2773242491,"An atlas for drug interactions Kinase inhibitors are an important class of drugs that block certain enzymes involved in diseases such as cancer and inflammatory disorders. There are hundreds of kinases within the human body, so knowing the kinase “target” of each drug is essential for developing successful treatment strategies. Sometimes clinical trials can fail because drugs bind more than one target. Yet sometimes off-target effects can be beneficial, and drugs can be repurposed for treatment of additional diseases. Klaeger et al. performed a comprehensive analysis of 243 kinase inhibitors that are either approved for use or in clinical trials. They provide an open-access resource of target summaries that could help researchers develop better drugs, understand how existing drugs work, and design more effective clinical trials.

https://openalex.org/W2773700550,"A bona fide portrayal of tumor growth Bone has a well-established role in advanced cancer. It provides a supportive microenvironment for the growth of metastatic cells that escape the primary tumor, which ultimately leads to loss of bone mass. Engblom et al. show that bone may also contribute to early-stage tumorigenesis through a mechanism that leads to an increase in bone mass (see the Perspective by Zhang and Lyden). In mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, primary tumor cells remotely activated bone-resident cells called osteoblasts, which have a bone-building function. The activated osteoblasts in turn triggered production of a certain type of neutrophil that infiltrates the primary tumor and promotes its growth. Patients with early-stage lung cancer were also found to have an increase in bone density, consistent with the findings in mice. Science , this issue p. eaal5081 ; see also p. 1127"

These data are not routinely used to test ecosystem models that explore ocean biogeography or biogeochemistry. Coles et al. built a model in which genes for a range of functions were assigned to different suites of simulated microbes (see the Perspective by Rynearson). Communities emerged from the model with realistic biogeographical and biogeochemical profiles when compared to microbial data collected from the Amazon River plume. However, functional composition trumped the details of taxonomy, and different, coevolving community compositions emerged that provided similar biogeochemical outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2771514310,"The inflammatory tumoral-immune response alters the physiology of the tumor microenvironment, which may attenuate genomic instability. In addition to inducing inflammatory immune responses, several pathogenic bacteria produce genotoxins. However the extent of microbial contribution to the tumor microenvironment biology remains unknown. We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas, (TCGA) breast cancer data to perform a novel experiment utilizing unmapped and mapped RNA sequencing read evidence to minimize laboratory costs and effort. Our objective was to characterize the microbiota and associate the microbiota with the tumor expression profiles, for 668 breast tumor tissues and 72 non-cancerous adjacent tissues. The prominent presence of Proteobacteria was increased in the tumor tissues and conversely Actinobacteria abundance increase in non-cancerous adjacent tissues. Further, geneset enrichment suggests Listeria spp to be associated with the expression profiles of genes involved with epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Moreover, evidence suggests H. influenza may reside in the surrounding stromal material and was significantly associated with the proliferative pathways: G2M checkpoint, E2F transcription factors, and mitotic spindle assembly. In summary, further unraveling this complicated interplay should enable us to better diagnose and treat breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2775400509,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the formation of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. Elucidating the role of these β-sheet-rich fibrils in disease progression is crucial; however, collecting detailed structural information on amyloids is inherently difficult because of their insoluble, non-crystalline, and polymorphic nature. Here, we show that Raman spectroscopy is a facile technique for characterizing structural features of α-synuclein fibrils. Combining Raman spectroscopy with aggregation kinetics and transmission electron microscopy, we examined the effects of pH and ionic strength as well as four PD–related mutations (A30P, E46K, G51D, and A53T) on α-synuclein fibrils. Raman spectral differences were observed in the amide-I, amide-III, and fingerprint regions, indicating that secondary structure and tertiary contacts are influenced by pH and to a lesser extent by NaCl. Faster aggregation times appear to facilitate unique fibril structure as determined by the highly reproducible amide-I band widths, linking aggregation propensity and fibril polymorphism. Importantly, Raman spectroscopy revealed molecular-level perturbations of fibril conformation by the PD–related mutations that are not apparent through transmission electron microscopy or limited proteolysis. The amide-III band was found to be particularly sensitive, with G51D exhibiting the most distinctive features, followed by A53T and E46K. Relating to a cellular environment, our data would suggest that fibril polymorphs can be formed in different cellular compartments and potentially result in distinct phenotypes. Our work sets a foundation toward future cellular Raman studies of amyloids."
https://openalex.org/W2774800115,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Gemcitabine, as a single agent or in combination therapy, remains the frontline chemotherapy despite its limited efficacy due to de novo or acquired chemoresistance. There is an acute need to decipher mechanisms underlying chemoresistance and identify new targets to improve patient outcomes. Here, we report a novel role for the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase in gemcitabine resistance. Utilizing MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 PDAC cells, we found that knockdown (KD) of ST6Gal-I expression, as well as removal of surface α2–6 sialic acids by neuraminidase, enhances gemcitabine-mediated cell death assessed via clonogenic assays and cleaved caspase 3 expression. Additionally, KD of ST6Gal-I potentiates gemcitabine-induced DNA damage as measured by comet assays and quantification of γH2AX foci. ST6Gal-I KD also alters mRNA expression of key gemcitabine metabolic genes, RRM1, RRM2, hENT1, and DCK, leading to an increased gemcitabine sensitivity ratio, an indicator of gemcitabine toxicity. Gemcitabine-resistant MiaPaCa-2 cells display higher ST6Gal-I levels than treatment-naive cells along with a reduced gemcitabine sensitivity ratio, suggesting that chronic chemotherapy selects for clonal variants with more abundant ST6Gal-I. Finally, we examined Suit2 PDAC cells and Suit2 derivatives with enhanced metastatic potential. Intriguingly, three metastatic and chemoresistant subclones, S2-CP9, S2-LM7AA, and S2-013, exhibit up-regulated ST6Gal-I relative to parental Suit2 cells. ST6Gal-I KD in S2-013 cells increases gemcitabine-mediated DNA damage, indicating that suppressing ST6Gal-I activity sensitizes inherently resistant cells to gemcitabine. Together, these findings place ST6Gal-I as a critical player in imparting gemcitabine resistance and as a potential target to restore PDAC chemoresponse."

https://openalex.org/W2773862931,"Pediatric epilepsies are a group of disorders with a broad phenotypic spectrum that are associated with great genetic heterogeneity, thus making sequential single-gene testing an impractical basis for diagnostic strategy. The advent of next-generation sequencing has increased the success rate of epilepsy diagnosis, and targeted resequencing using genetic panels is the a most cost-effective choice. We report the results found in a group of 87 patients with epilepsy and developmental delay using targeted next generation sequencing (custom-designed Haloplex panel). Using this gene panel, we were able to identify disease-causing variants in 17 out of 87 (19.5%) analyzed patients, all found in known epilepsy-associated genes (KCNQ2, CDKL5, STXBP1, SCN1A, PCDH19, POLG, SLC2A1, ARX, ALG13, CHD2, SYNGAP1, and GRIN1). Twelve of 18 variants arose de novo and 6 were novel. The highest yield was found in patients with onset in the first years of life, especially in patients classified as having early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Knowledge of the underlying genetic cause provides essential information on prognosis and could be used to avoid unnecessary studies, which may result in a greater diagnostic cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2771758303,"The metazoan actin cytoskeleton supports a wide range of contractile and transport processes. Recent studies have shown how the dynamic association with specific tropomyosin isoforms generates actin filament populations with distinct functional properties. However, critical details of the associated molecular interactions remain unclear. Here, we report the properties of actomyosin–tropomyosin complexes containing filamentous β-actin, nonmuscle myosin-2B (NM-2B) constructs, and either tropomyosin isoform Tpm1.8cy (b.–.b.d), Tpm1.12br (b.–.b.c), or Tpm3.1cy (b.–.a.d). Our results show the extent to which the association of filamentous β-actin with these different tropomyosin cofilaments affects the actin-mediated activation of NM-2B and the release of the ATP hydrolysis products ADP and phosphate from the active site. Phosphate release gates a transition from weak to strong F-actin–binding states. The release of ADP has the opposite effect. These changes in dominant rate-limiting steps have a direct effect on the duty ratio, the fraction of time that NM-2B spends in strongly F-actin–bound states during ATP turnover. The duty ratio is increased ∼3-fold in the presence of Tpm1.12 and 5-fold for both Tpm1.8 and Tpm3.1. The presence of Tpm1.12 extends the time required per ATP hydrolysis cycle 3.7-fold, whereas it is shortened by 27 and 63% in the presence of Tpm1.8 and Tpm3.1, respectively. The resulting Tpm isoform–specific changes in the frequency, duration, and efficiency of actomyosin interactions establish a molecular basis for the ability of these complexes to support cellular processes with widely divergent demands in regard to force production, capacity to move processively, and speed of movement."
https://openalex.org/W2769644847,"Childhood maltreatment is associated with attention deficits. We examined the effect of childhood abuse and abuse-by-gene (5-HTTLPR, MAOA, FKBP5) interaction on functional brain connectivity during sustained attention in medication/drug-free adolescents. Functional connectivity was compared, using generalised psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, between 21 age-and gender-matched adolescents exposed to severe childhood abuse and 27 healthy controls, while they performed a parametrically modulated vigilance task requiring target detection with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention. Behaviourally, participants exposed to childhood abuse had increased omission errors compared to healthy controls. During the most challenging attention condition abused participants relative to controls exhibited reduced connectivity, with a left-hemispheric bias, in typical fronto-parietal attention networks, including dorsolateral, rostromedial and inferior prefrontal and inferior parietal regions. Abuse-related connectivity abnormalities were exacerbated in individuals homozygous for the risky C-allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs3800373 of the FK506 Binding Protein 5 (FKBP5) gene. Findings suggest that childhood abuse is associated with decreased functional connectivity in fronto-parietal attention networks and that the FKBP5 genotype moderates neurobiological vulnerability to abuse. These findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional connectivity abnormalities, which hopefully will facilitate the development of specific treatment strategies for victims of childhood maltreatment."
https://openalex.org/W2775359460,"Iron is an indispensable element for plant growth and defense and hence it is essential to improve the plant's ability to accumulate iron. Besides, it is also an important aspect for human health. In view of this, we attempted to increase the iron content in banana cultivar Rasthali using MusaFer1 as a candidate gene. Initially, the expression of all five genes of the MusaFer family (MusaFer1-5) was quantified under iron-excess and -deficient conditions. The supplementation of 250 and 350 μM iron enhanced expression of all MusaFer genes; however, MusaFer1 was increased maximally by 2- and 4- fold in leaves and roots respectively. Under iron deficient condition, all five MusaFer genes were downregulated, indicating their iron dependent regulation. In MusaFer1 overexpressing lines, iron content was increased by 2- and 3-fold in leaves and roots respectively, as compared with that of untransformed lines. The increased iron was mainly localized in the epidermal regions of petiole. The analysis of MusaFer1 promoter indicated that it might control the expression of iron metabolism related genes and also other genes of MusaFer family. MusaFer1 overexpression led to downregulated expression of MusaFer3, MusaFer4 and MusaFer5 in transgenic leaves which might be associated with the plant's compensatory mechanism in response to iron flux. Other iron metabolism genes like Ferric reductase (FRO), transporters (IRT, VIT and YSL) and chelators (NAS, DMAS and NAAT) were also differentially expressed in transgenic leaf and root, suggesting the multifaceted impact of MusaFer1 towards iron uptake and organ distribution. Additionally, MusaFer1 overexpression increased plant tolerance against methyl viologen and excess iron which was quantified in terms of photosynthetic efficiency and malondialdehyde content. Thus, the study not only broadens our understanding about iron metabolism but also highlights MusaFer1 as a suitable candidate gene for iron fortification in banana."
https://openalex.org/W2773573021,"Skeletal muscle atrophy, or sarcopenia, is commonly observed in older individuals and in those with chronic disease and is associated with decreased quality of life. There is recent medical and broad concern that sarcopenia is rapidly increasing worldwide as populations age. At present, strength training is the only effective intervention for preventing sarcopenia development, but it is not known how this exercise regimen counteracts this condition. Here, we report that expression of the inflammatory mediator angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) increases in skeletal muscle of aging mice. Moreover, in addition to exhibiting increased inflammation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), denervated atrophic skeletal muscles in a mouse model of denervation-induced muscle atrophy had increased ANGPTL2 expression. Interestingly, mice with a skeletal myocyte–specific Angptl2 knockout had attenuated inflammation and ROS accumulation in denervated skeletal muscle, accompanied by increased satellite cell activity and inhibition of muscular atrophy compared with mice harboring wildtype Angptl2. Moreover, consistent with these phenotypes, wildtype mice undergoing exercise training displayed decreased ANGPTL2 expression in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, ANGPTL2 up-regulation in skeletal myocytes accelerates muscle atrophy, and exercise-induced attenuation of ANGPTL2 expression in those tissues may partially explain how exercise training prevents sarcopenia.

https://openalex.org/W2978498021,"The LSD1 histone demethylase is highly expressed in breast tumors where it constitutes a factor of poor prognosis and promotes traits of cancer aggressiveness such as cell invasiveness. Recent work has shown that the Estrogen-Related Receptor α (ERRα) induces LSD1 to demethylate the Lys 9 of histone H3. This results in the transcriptional activation of a number of common target genes, several of which being involved in cellular invasion. High expression of ERRα protein is also a factor of poor prognosis in breast tumors. Here we show that, independently of its demethylase activities, LSD1 protects ERRα from ubiquitination, resulting in overexpression of the latter protein. Our data also suggests that the elevation of LSD1 mRNA and protein in breast cancer (as compared to normal tissue) may be a key event to increase ERRα protein, independently of its corresponding mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2772043688,"Background Diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) relies on microscopic visualization of P. jirovecii, or detection of Pneumocystis DNA in respiratory specimens, which involves invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage. The (1–3)-β-D-glucan (BG) assay has been proposed as a less invasive and less expensive diagnostic test to rule out PCP. We therefore compared blood levels of BG in patients with PCP with those of patients with candidemia, chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC), invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and tuberculosis and those of healthy volunteers. Methods Adult patients who were diagnosed with PCP, candidemia, CDC, invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and tuberculosis whose blood samples were available, and healthy volunteers were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea, during a 21-month period. The blood samples were assayed with the Goldstream Fungus (1–3)-β-D-glucan test (Gold Mountain River Tech Development, Beijing, China). Results A total of 136 individuals including 50 patients P. jirovecii,15 candidemia, 6 CDC, 15 invasive aspergillosis, 10 mucormycosis, and 40 controls (20 TB and 20 healthy volunteers) were included. The mean±SD of the concentration of 1–3-β-D-glucan in the patients with PCP (290.08 pg/mL±199.98) were similar to those of patients with candidemia (314.14 pg/mL±205.60, p = 0.90 at an α = 0.005) and CDC (129.74 pg/mL±182.79, p = 0.03 at an α = 0.005), but higher than those of patients with invasive aspergillosis (131.62 pg/mL±161.67, p = 0.002 at an α = 0.005), mucormycosis (95.08 pg/mL±146.80, p<0.001 at an α = 0.005), and tuberculosis (103.31 pg/mL±140.81, p<0.001 at an α = 0.005) as well as healthy volunteers (101.18 pg/mL±197.52, p<0.001 at an α = 0.005). At a cut-off value > 31.25 pg/mL, which is highly sensitive for PCP versus tuberculosis plus healthy volunteers at the expense of specificity, the BG assay had a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 81%-98%) and a specificity of 55% (95% CI 39%-71%). Conclusions The BG assay appears to be a useful adjunct test for PCP."
https://openalex.org/W2772353029,"Fragrance of rice is an important trait that confers a large economic benefit to the farmers who cultivate aromatic rice varieties. Several aromatic rice varieties have limited geographic distribution, and are endowed with variety-specific unique fragrances. BADH2 was identified as a fragrance gene in 2005, and it is essential to identify the fragrance alleles from diverse geographical locations and genetic backgrounds. Seeragasamba is a short-grain aromatic rice variety of the indica type, which is cultivated in a limited area in India. Whole genome sequencing of this variety identified a new badh2 allele (badh2-p) with an 8 bp insertion in the promoter region of the BADH2 gene. When the whole genome sequences of 76 aromatic varieties in the 3000 rice genome project were analyzed, the badh2-p allele was present in 13 varieties (approximately 17%) of both indica and japonica types. In addition, the badh2-p allele was present in 17 varieties that already had the loss-of-function allele, badh2-E7. Taken together, the frequency of badh2-p allele (approximately 40%) was found to be greater than that of the badh2-E7 allele (approximately 34%) among the aromatic rice varieties. Therefore, it is suggested to include badh2-p as a predominant allele when screening for fragrance alleles in aromatic rice varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2771685599,"In lipoxygenases, the topologically conserved C-terminal domain catalyzes the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, generating an assortment of biologically relevant signaling mediators. Plant and animal lipoxygenases also contain a 100-150-amino acid N-terminal C2-like domain that has been implicated in interactions with isolated fatty acids and at the phospholipid bilayer. These interactions may lead to increased substrate availability and contribute to the regulation of active-site catalysis. Because of a lack of structural information, a molecular understanding of this lipid-protein interaction remains unresolved. Herein, we employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDXMS) to spatially resolve changes in protein conformation upon interaction of soybean lipoxygenase with a fatty acid surrogate, oleyl sulfate (OS), previously shown to act at a site separate from the substrate-binding site. Specific, OS-induced conformational changes are detected both at the N-terminal domain and within the substrate portal nearly 30 A away. Combining previously measured kinetic properties in the presence of OS with its impact on the Kd for linoleic acid substrate binding, we conclude that OS binding brings about an increase in rate constants for both the ingress and egress of substrate. We discuss the role of OS-induced changes in protein flexibility in the context of changes in the mechanism of substrate acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2774794139,"Empyema is defined by the presence of bacteria and/or pus in pleural effusions. However, the biology of bacteria within human pleural fluid has not been studied. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of pediatric and frequent cause of adult empyema. We investigated whether S. pneumoniae can proliferate within human pleural fluid and if growth is affected by the cellular content of the fluid and/or characteristics of pneumococcal surface proteins. Invasive S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 24) and reference strain recovered from human blood or empyema were inoculated (1.5×106CFU/mL) into sterile human malignant pleural fluid samples (n = 11). All S. pneumoniae (n = 25) strains proliferated rapidly, increasing by a median of 3009 (IQR 1063-9846) from baseline at 24hrs in all pleural effusions tested. Proliferation was greater than in commercial pneumococcal culture media and concentrations were maintained for 48hrs without autolysis. A similar magnitude of proliferation was observed in pleural fluid before and after removal of its cellular content, p = 0.728. S. pneumoniae (D39 strain) wild-type, and derivatives (n = 12), each with mutation(s) in a different gene required for full virulence were inoculated into human pleural fluid (n = 8). S. pneumoniae with pneumococcal surface antigen A (ΔpsaA) mutation failed to grow (2207-fold lower than wild-type), p<0.001, however growth was restored with manganese supplementation. Growth of other common respiratory pathogens (n = 14) across pleural fluid samples (n = 7) was variable and inconsistent, with some strains failing to grow. We establish for the first time that pleural fluid is a potent growth medium for S. pneumoniae and proliferation is dependent on the PsaA surface protein and manganese."

https://openalex.org/W2775004091,"During development, a multi-potent group of cells known as the cranial neural crest (CNC) migrate to form craniofacial structures. Proper migration of these cells requires proteolysis of cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins. In Xenopus laevis, preventing extracellular cleavage of cadherin-11 impairs CNC migration. However, overexpression of the soluble cleavage product (EC1-3) is capable of rescuing this phenotype. The mechanism by which EC1-3 promotes CNC migration has not been investigated until now. Here we show that EC1-3 stimulates phosphorylation of Akt, a target of PI3K, in X.laevis CNC. Through immunoprecipitation experiments, we determined that EC1-3 interacts with all ErbB receptors, PDGFRα, and FGFR1. Of these receptors, only ErbB2 was able to produce an increase in Akt phosphorylation upon treatment with a recombinant EC1-3. This increase was abrogated by mubritinib, an inhibitor of ErbB2. We were able to recapitulate this decrease in Akt phosphorylation in vivo by knocking down ErbB2 in CNC cells. Knockdown of the receptor also significantly reduced CNC migration in vivo. We confirmed the importance of ErbB2 and ErbB receptor signaling in CNC migration using mubritinib and canertinib, respectively. Mubritinib and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreased cell migration while canertinib nearly prevented it altogether. These data show that ErbB2 and Akt are important for CNC migration and implicate other ErbB receptors and Akt-independent signaling pathways. Our findings provide the first example of a functional interaction between the extracellular domain of a type II classical cadherin and growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2772300025,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously expressed Serine-Threonine phosphatase mediating 30–50% of protein phosphatase activity. PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric complex, with the B subunits directing target specificity to regulate the activity of many key pathways that control cellular phenotypes. PP2A-B56α has been shown to play a tumor suppressor role and to negatively control c-MYC stability and activity. Loss of B56α promotes cellular transformation, likely at least in part through its regulation of c-MYC. Here we report generation of a B56α hypomorph mouse with very low B56α expression that we used to study the physiologic activity of the PP2A-B56α phosphatase. The predominant phenotype we observed in mice with B56α deficiency in the whole body was spontaneous skin lesion formation with hyperproliferation of the epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Increased levels of c-MYC phosphorylation on Serine62 and c-MYC activity were observed in the skin lesions of the B56αhm/hm mice. B56α deficiency was found to increase the number of skin stem cells, and consistent with this, papilloma initiation was accelerated in a carcinogenesis model. Further analysis of additional tissues revealed increased inflammation in spleen, liver, lung, and intestinal lymph nodes as well as in the skin lesions, resembling elevated extramedullary hematopoiesis phenotypes in the B56αhm/hm mice. We also observed an increase in the clonogenicity of bone marrow stem cells in B56αhm/hm mice. Overall, this model suggests that B56α is important for stem cells to maintain homeostasis and that B56α loss leading to increased activity of important oncogenes, including c-MYC, can result in aberrant cell growth and increased stem cells that can contribute to the initiation of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2775137752,"Background Clinical pharmacy is not only a medical science but also an elaborate public health care system firmly related to its subsystems of education, training, qualification authentication, scientific research, management, and human resources. China is a developing country with a tremendous need for improvements in the public health system, including the clinical pharmacy service system. Objectives The aim of this research was to evaluate the infrastructure and personnel qualities of clinical pharmacy services in China. Setting Public county hospitals in China. Materials and method A national survey of clinical pharmacists in county hospitals was conducted. It was sampled through a stratified sampling strategy. Responses were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The main outcome measures include the coverage of clinical pharmacy services, the overall staffing of clinical pharmacists, the software and hardware of clinical pharmacy services, the charge mode of clinical pharmacy services, and the educational background, professional training acquisition, practical experience, and entry path of clinical pharmacists. Results The overall coverage of clinical pharmacy services on both the department scale (median = 18.25%) and the patient scale (median = 15.38%) does not meet the 100% coverage that is required by the government. In 57.73% of the sample hospitals, the staffing does not meet the requirement, and the size of the clinical pharmacist group is smaller in larger hospitals. In addition, 23.4% of the sample hospitals do not have management rules for the clinical pharmacists, and 43.1% do not have rational drug use software, both of which are required by the government. In terms of fees, 89.9% of the sample hospitals do not charge for the services. With regard to education, 8.5% of respondents are with unqualified degree, and among respondents with qualified degree, 37.31% are unqualified in the major; 43% of respondents lack the clinical pharmacist training required by the government. Most respondents (93.5%) have a primary or medium professional title. The median age and work seniority of respondents are 31 and four years, respectively. Only 18.5% of respondents chose this occupation by personal consideration or willingness. Conclusions The main findings in this research include the overall low coverage of clinical pharmacy services, the low rate of clinical pharmacy service software, hardware, and personnel as well as a wide variance in educational training of pharmacists at county hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2768491269,"Diatoms constitute a major group of phytoplankton, accounting for ~20% of the world’s primary production. It has been shown that iron (Fe) can be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth, in particular, in the HNLC (High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll) regions. Iron plays thus an essential role in governing the marine primary productivity and the efficiency of biological carbon pump. Oceanic systems are undergoing continuous modifications at varying rates and magnitudes as a result of changing climate. The objective of our research is to evaluate how changing environmental conditions (dust deposition, ocean warming and acidification) can affect marine Fe biogeochemistry and diatom growth. Laboratory culture experiments using a marine diatom Chaetoceros socialis were conducted at two temperatures (13°C and 18°C) and under two pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure) (400 μatm and 800 μatm) conditions. The present study clearly highlights the effect of ocean acidification on enhancing the release of Fe upon dust deposition. Our results also confirm that being a potential source of Fe, dust provides in addition a readily utilizable source of macronutrients such as dissolved phosphate (PO4) and silicate (DSi). However, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations may also have an adverse impact on diatom growth, causing a decrease in cell size and possible further changes in phytoplankton composition. Meanwhile, ocean warming may lead to the reduction of diatom production and cell size, inducing poleward shifts in the biogeographic distribution of diatoms. The changing climate has thus a significant implication for ocean phytoplankton growth, cell size and primary productivity, phytoplankton distribution and community composition, and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si) and Fe biogeochemical cycles in various ways."

Methods Nineteen eyes of 19 patients after DMEK, 23 eyes of 23 patients after DSAEK, and 18 eyes of 18 control subjects were retrospectively analyzed. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), aberration factors (higher-order aberrations [HOAs], spherical aberrations [SAs], and coma aberrations [Comas] at 6.0 mm) were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. The posterior refractive pattern of the topography map was classified into 5 grades (0–5) (posterior color grade) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Correlations between BSCVA and some factors (abbreviation factors, posterior color grade) were analyzed. Results BSCVA was significantly better after DMEK than after DSAEK (P < 0.001). Posterior HOAs, SAs, and Comas after each type of endothelial keratoplasty were significantly greater compared to control (P < 0.01). Posterior HOAs, total/anterior/posterior SAs, and posterior color grade were significantly lower in the DMEK group than in the DSAEK group at 3 months (P < 0.024 [posterior HOAs], P = 0.047 [total SA], P < 0.001 [anterior SAs], P = 0.021 [posterior SAs], and P < 0.001 [posterior color grade]) and 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.034 [posterior HOAs], P < 0.001 [total SAs], P < 0.001 [anterior SAs], P = 0.013 [posterior SAs], and P = 0.004 [posterior color grade]). BSCVA was significantly correlated with HOAs, SAs, and posterior color grade (P < 0.001 for all except anterior HOAs [P = 0.004]). Conclusions High posterior color grades were associated with larger aberration factors and had a negative effect on visual function after endothelial keratoplasty. Rapid improvement of visual function after DMEK may be attributed to less change at the posterior surface."
https://openalex.org/W2774319149,"Background Screening of anal cancer in HIV-infected MSM with anal cytology results in high rates of false positive results and elevated burden of high-resolution anoscopies. High-risk HPV up-regulates p16 and Ki67 expression in epithelial cells. We assessed the usefulness of P16/Ki-67 immunostaining cytology for the diagnosis of precancerous anal lesions. Methodology Cross-sectional multicenter study. Concomitant anal liquid cytology with p16/Ki-67 immunostaining and HRA with biopsy of acetowhite lugol-negative lesions was performed in HIV-infected MSM. We compared the diagnostic performance of an abnormal anal cytology and p16/Ki-67 immunostaining relative to HRA-guided biopsy by logistic regression and comparison of ROC areas. Results We included 328 HIV-infected MSM. HSIL was histologically diagnosed in 72 subjects (25.1%), and 2 (0.6%) were diagnosed with anal cancer. An abnormal cytology showed a sensitivity of 95.6% and a specificity of 58.8% for the diagnosis of biopsy-proven HSIL. P16/Ki67 positivity was associated with the presence of biopsy-proven HSIL (P trend = 0.004) but with low sensitivity (41.2%) and specificity (71%). The combination of standard cytology with P16/Ki67 immunostaining did not increment the predictive value of standard cytology alone (AUC 0.685 vs. 0.673, respectively, P = 0.688). Conclusion In HIV-infected MSM P16/Ki67 immunostaining does not improve the diagnostic accuracy of anal cytology, which shows a high sensitivity yet poor specificity. Other approaches aimed at improving the diagnostic accuracy of current techniques for the diagnostic of precancerous HSIL are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2774546526,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignant tumor of the head and neck and frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes. Aggressive local invasion and metastasis of OSCC are significant factors for poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated whether ephrin-B2 expressed in OSCC contributed to tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Clinical specimens from patients with OSCC had robust ephrin-B2-positive tumor cells and ephrin-B2 protein level was associated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. We also determined that ephrin-B2 protein level was increased in OSCC cell lines compared to normal human oral keratinocytes and that its levels were associated with the migratory and invasive potential of OSCC cell lines. Transfection of an EFNB2–specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into SAS-L1 cells significantly reduced proliferation, attachment, migration, and invasion through phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, FAK, ERK1/2, p38, AKT, and JNK1/2 pathways. Furthermore, knockdown of EFNB2 significantly suppressed adhesion and transmigration of SAS-L1 cells toward human lymphatic endothelial cells. In addition, the growth rate of tumor xenografts and cervical lymph node metastases of OSCC were suppressed by local injection of EFNB2 siRNA. These results suggest that ephrin-B2 overexpression and activation of the ephrin-B2 reverse signaling pathway in tumor microenvironment in OSCC facilitates progression and lymph node metastasis via enhancement of malignant potential and interaction with surrounding cells."
https://openalex.org/W2772693763,"Prevailing theories suggests that cortical regions responsible for face perception operate in a serial, feed-forward fashion. Here, we utilize invasive human electrophysiology to evaluate serial models of face-processing via measurements of cortical activation, functional connectivity, and cortico-cortical evoked potentials. We find that task-dependent changes in functional connectivity between face-selective regions in the inferior occipital (f-IOG) and fusiform gyrus (f-FG) are bidirectional, not feed-forward, and emerge following feed-forward input from early visual cortex (EVC) to both of these regions. Cortico-cortical evoked potentials similarly reveal independent signal propagations between EVC and both f-IOG and f-FG. These findings are incompatible with serial models, and support a parallel, distributed network underpinning face perception in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2772179687,"Bladder cancer associated protein (Blcap) expression is commonly down-regulated in invasive bladder cancer, and may have prognostic value given that its expression is negatively correlated with patient survival. We have previously investigated the expression patterns and cellular localization of Blcap in bladder cancer, where we found that about 20% of the lesions examined displayed strong nuclear expression of Blcap, and that this phenotype was associated with overall poor disease outcome. Here we report on the analysis of possible functional associations between nuclear expression of Blcap and canonical signaling pathways. We performed serial immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of bladder tissue samples, with serial sections stained with phospho-specific antibodies recognizing key signaling intermediates, such as P-Stat3, P-Akt, and P-Erk1/2, among others, in an immunophenotyping approach we have established and reported previously. Using this approach, we found that nuclear localization of Blcap was associated with expression of P-Stat3. A parallel analysis, cytokine profiling of bladder tumor interstitial fluids of samples expressing (or not) Blcap, showed interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) to be correlated with nuclear expression of Blcap, independently supporting a role for Stat3 signaling in localization of Blcap. Multiple indirect immunofluorescence analysis of tissue biopsies confirmed that Blcap co-localized with Stat3. Furthermore, we could also demonstrate, using an in situ proximity ligation assay that Blcap and Stat3 are in close physical proximity of each other in bladder tissue, and that Blcap physically interacts with Stat3 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins. Our data indicates that Blcap is a novel Stat3 interaction partner and suggests a role for Blcap in the Stat3-mediated progression of precancerous lesions to invasive tumors of the bladder."
https://openalex.org/W2775432400,"During routine monitoring of commercial purse seine catches in 2011, 87 fingerling specimens of scombrids were collected in the southern Adriatic Sea. Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA control region locus inferred that specimens belonged to the Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758) (N = 29), bullet tuna, Auxis rochei (Risso, 1810) (N = 30) and little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus, Rafinesque, 1810 (N = 28). According to previously published growth parameters, the age of the collected specimens was estimated at approximately 30–40 days, suggesting they might have been spawned in the Adriatic Sea, contrary to the current knowledge. A coupled modelling system with hydrodynamic (ROMS) and individual based model (IBM—Ichthyop) was set up to determine the location of the spawning event. Numerical simulations with the IBM model, both backward and forward in time, indicate commercial tuna cages in the middle Adriatic coastal area as possible spawning location. The two other non-commercial species likely opportunistically use the positive environmental (abiotic and biotic) conditions to spawn in the same area."
https://openalex.org/W2771108926,"Periplasmic Binding Proteins (PBPs) trap nutrients for their internalization into bacteria by ABC transporters. Ligand binding triggers PBP closure by bringing its two domains together like a Venus flytrap. The atomic determinants that control PBP opening and closure for nutrient capture and release are not known, although it is proposed that opening and ligand release occur while in contact with the ABC transporter for concurrent substrate translocation. In this paper we evaluated the effect of the isomerization of a conserved proline, located near the binding site, on the propensity of PBPs to open and close. ArgT/LAO from Salmonella typhimurium and HisJ from Escherichia coli were studied through molecular mechanics at two different temperatures: 300 and 323 K. Eight microseconds were simulated per protein to analyze protein opening and closure in the absence of the ABC transporter. We show that when the studied proline is in trans, closed empty LAO and HisJ can open. In contrast, with the proline in cis, opening transitions were much less frequent and characterized by smaller changes. The proline in trans also renders the open trap prone to close over a ligand. Our data suggest that the isomerization of this conserved proline modulates the PBP mechanism: the proline in trans allows the exploration of conformational space to produce trap opening and closure, while in cis it restricts PBP movement and could limit ligand release until in productive contact with the ABC transporter. This is the first time that a proline isomerization has been related to the control of a large conformational change like the PBP flytrap mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2773442433,"Organizational external behavior changes are caused by the internal structure and interactions. External behaviors are also known as the behavioral events of an organization. Detecting event-related changes in organizational networks could efficiently be used to monitor the dynamics of organizational behaviors. Although many different methods have been used to detect changes in organizational networks, these methods usually ignore the correlation between the internal structure and external events. Event-related change detection considers the correlation and could be used for event recognition based on social network modeling and supervised classification. Detecting event-related changes could be effectively useful in providing early warnings and faster responses to both positive and negative organizational activities. In this study, event-related change in an organizational network was defined, and artificial neural network models were used to quantitatively determine whether and when a change occurred. To achieve a higher accuracy, Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNNs) were optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We showed the feasibility of the proposed method by comparing its performance with that of other methods using two cases. The results suggested that the proposed method could identify organizational events based on a correlation between the organizational networks and events. The results also suggested that the proposed method not only has a higher precision but also has a better robustness than the previously used techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2773293755,"Objective To assess experimental virulence among sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli bloodstream isolates in relation to virulence genotype and subclone. Methods We analysed 48 Spanish ST131 bloodstream isolates (2010) by PCR for ST131 subclone status (H30Rx, H30 non-Rx, or non-H30), virulence genes (VGs), and O-type. Then we compared these traits with virulence in a murine sepsis model, as measured by illness severity score (ISS) and rapid lethality (mean ISS ≥ 4). Results Of the 48 study isolates, 65% were H30Rx, 21% H30 non-Rx, and 15% non-H30; 44% produced ESBLs, 98% were O25b, and 83% qualified as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Of 49 VGs, ibeA and iss were associated significantly with non-H30 isolates, and sat, iha and malX with H30 isolates. Median VG scores differed by subclone, i.e., 12 (H30Rx), 10 (H30 non-Rx), and 11 (non-H30) (p < 0.01). Nearly 80% of isolates represented a described virotype. In mice, H30Rx and non-H30 isolates were more virulent than H30 non-Rx isolates (according to ISS [p = 0.03] and rapid lethality [p = 0.03]), as were ExPEC isolates compared with non-ExPEC isolates (median ISS, 4.3 vs. 2.7: p = 0.03). In contrast, most individual VGs, VG scores, VG profiles, and virotypes were not associated with mouse virulence. Conclusions ST131 subclone and ExPEC status, but not individual VGs, VG scores or profiles, or virotypes, predicted mouse virulence. Given the lower virulence of non-Rx H30 isolates, hypervirulence probably cannot explain the ST131-H30 clade's epidemic emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2773968797,"Polyandry, i.e. females mating with multiple males, is more common than previously anticipated and potentially provides both direct and indirect fitness benefits to females. The level of polyandry (defined by the lifetime number of male mates of a female) is an important determinant of the occurrence and intensity of sexual selection acting on male phenotypes. While the forces of sexual selection acting on phenotypic male traits such as body size are relatively well understood, sexual selection acting on phenotypic plasticity of these traits is unexplored. We tackled this issue by scrutinizing the link between polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size in two sympatric plant-inhabiting predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus. These two species are similar in life history, ecological niche requirements, mating behavior, polygyny and female body size plasticity but strikingly differ in the level of both polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size (both lower in P. persimilis). We hypothesized that deviations from standard body size, i.e. the size achieved under favorable conditions, incur higher costs for males in the less polyandrous P. persimilis. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments on (i) the effects of male body size on spermatophore transfer in singly mating females and (ii) the effects of mate sequence (switching the order of standard-sized and small males) on mating behavior and paternity success in doubly mating females. In P. persimilis but not N. californicus, small males transferred fewer but larger spermatophores to the females; in both species, females re-mated more likely with standard-sized following small than small following standard-sized males; in P. persimilis, first standard-sized males sired a higher proportion of offspring produced after re-mating by the female than first small males, whereas in N. californicus the paternity success of small and standard-sized males was independent of the mating sequence. Based on our results and pertinent previous studies, which showed that females of P. persimilis, but not N. californicus, prefer mating with standard-sized over small males and allow them fertilizing more eggs, the lack of interspecific difference in female body size plasticity, and the absence of any clue pointing at a role of natural selection, we suggest that the interspecific difference in male body size plasticity is sexually selected. Our study provides an indication of sexual selection constraining plasticity of male phenotypes, suggesting that the level of polyandry may be an important co-determinant of the level of phenotypic plasticity of male body size."
https://openalex.org/W2774350129,"Anti-hinge antibodies (AHAs) are an autoantibody subclass that, following proteolytic cleavage, recognize cryptic epitopes exposed in the hinge regions of immunoglobulins (Igs) and do not bind to the intact Ig counterpart. AHAs have been postulated to exacerbate chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, AHAs may protect against invasive microbial pathogens and cancer. However, despite more than 50 years of study, the origin and specific B cell compartments that express AHAs remain elusive. Recent research on serum AHAs suggests that they arise during an active immune response, in contrast to previous proposals that they derive from the preexisting immune repertoire in the absence of antigenic stimuli. We report here the isolation and characterization of AHAs from memory B cells, although anti-hinge-reactive B cells were also detected in the naive B cell compartment. IgG AHAs cloned from a single human donor exhibited restricted specificity for protease-cleaved F(ab')2 fragments and did not bind the intact IgG counterpart. The cloned IgG-specific AHA-variable regions were mutated from germ line-derived sequences and displayed a high sequence variability, confirming that these AHAs underwent class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Consistent with previous studies of serum AHAs, several of these clones recognized a linear, peptide-like epitope, but one clone was unique in recognizing a conformational epitope. All cloned AHAs could restore immune effector functions to proteolytically generated F(ab')2 fragments. Our results confirm that a diverse set of epitope-specific AHAs can be isolated from a single human donor."
https://openalex.org/W2771423116,"Objective Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), caused by the rupture of intracranial aneurysms, is a devastating event with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) plays a critical role in the potential loss of life as its sufferers are usually of a young age. We aimed to investigate the incidence of aSAH along with the patients’ characteristics over five consecutive years in Fars, a large province located in Southern Iran. Methods In this prospective study, anonymous data of all patients diagnosed with aSAH in Fars province were collected after patient admission and surgery. Data from the last national census in 2011 were used to calculate the incidence. The data were analysed using SPSS software version 18 using independent sample t test, chi square test and ANOVA. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results The number of aSAH cases identified in Fars, Iran, each year varied between 78 (2011) and 98 (2015) for a total of 421 aSAH cases within the 5-year study period. The annual aSAH incidence estimates showed no differences and were 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58–1.72], 1.70 (95%CI: 1.68–1.72), 1.71 (95%CI: 1.63–1.78), 1.82 (95%CI: 1.74–1.9), and 2.05 (95%CI: 1.97–2.13) per 100,000 persons, respectively, for the five consecutive years from 21 March 2011 to 20 March 2016. Hypertension was the most common risk factor, and was found in 198 (48%) aSAH patients. Ninety-four (22.5%) patients had moderate hydrocephalus on admission. Middle cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery were the most common sites of aneurysms. On admission, 351 (83%) patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score >7, 197 (47%) presented with Hunt and Hess score of 1, and 365 (87%) had a Fisher score of ≤3. Multiple aneurysms were found in 59 (14%) of the 421 cases and the most common risk factors in multiple aneurysms were hypertension in 30 (51%) and smoking in 26 (44%) cases. Survival data were available only on patients diagnosed in year 2015, and the six-month survival rate was 89.8%. Conclusions This study revealed that although the incidence of aSAH remained stable, the survival of aSAH patients who reached the hospital alive and were operated on, improved in Shiraz (the six-month survival rate was 89.8% in year 2015). The incidence and survival study on aSAH in other geographic areas of Iran as a multi-centre study is recommended. There is a need to inform primary healthcare workers regarding the possibility of aSAH in a patient with signs of the sentinel headache."
https://openalex.org/W2773733230,"Light and trace metals are critical growth factors for algae but how the interdependence of light quality and metal availability affects algal growth remains largely unknown. Our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of Ni and Fe on the growth of Trichodesmium and Symbiodinium, respectively, two important marine primary producers inhabiting environments with high light intensities. Here, we investigated the effects of light quality and intensity with availability of either Ni or Fe on their growth. For Trichodesmium, we found that specific growth rates for high Ni treatments were all significantly higher than in corresponding low Ni treatments with varying light quality and intensity. The inhibitory effect of low intensity red light was also countered by sufficient Ni supply. For Symbiodinium, we found that growth rates and biomass were reduced by 75% under low intensity red light and the stress can only be partially relieved by sufficient Fe supply. The results show that trace metal availability plays an important role in relieving the stress induced by low red light condition for both Trichodesmium and Symbiodinium although the cyanobacterium performs better in this growth condition. The difference may be attributed to the presence of phycocyanin, a unique pigment attuned to absorption of red light, in Trichodesmium. Our study shows that the concerted effects of light intensity and quality compounded with trace metal availability may influence the growth of photosynthetic organisms in the ocean."

Casein kinase 1 (CK1) is a family of serine/threonine kinases. To date, six human (α, δ, ∈, γ1, γ2, and γ3) isoforms and one bovine (β) isoform have been identified (15Cheong J.K. Virshup D.M. Casein kinase 1: complexity in the family.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43 (21145983): 465-46910.1016/j.biocel.2010.12.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Knippschild U. Gocht A.

Among them, both CK1δ and CK1∈ are considered important regulators of oncogenesis, which comes from the abnormal regulation of either the Wnt or the Hedgehog signaling pathway (15Cheong J.K.

However, the functional differences between CK1δ and CK1∈ have only recently been explored. The FA is a multiprotein complex that contains a large number of proteins, such as paxillin, talin, integrin, α-actinin, vinculin, and FAK (20Oakes P.W. Gardel M.L. Stressing the limits of focal adhesion mechanosensitivity.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 30 (24998185): 68-7310.1016/j.ceb.2014.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Zaidel-Bar R.

FAs usually serve as the connection between the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Therefore, cell migration is accompanied by FA disassembly. Disassembly of FAs is an acutely regulated cellular process (22Gu Z. Noss E.H. Hsu V.W. Brenner M.B. Integrins traffic rapidly via circular dorsal ruffles and macropinocytosis during stimulated cell migration.J.

Recently, Rho- and Rac-independent, microtubule-induced FA disassembly has been reported to be mediated by the FAK and dynamin (24Ezratty E.J. Partridge M.A. Gundersen G.G. Microtubule-induced focal adhesion disassembly is mediated by dynamin and focal adhesion kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7 (15895076): 581-59010.1038/ncb1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which the FA-docking protein is translocated into the FA site has not yet been well characterized. An indirect relationship between Plk1 and HEF1 in the HEF1 degradation machinery has been suggested (19Lee K.H. Johmura Y. Yu L.R. Park J.E. Gao Y. Bang J.K. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Yeon Kim B. Lee K.S. Identification of a novel Wnt5a-CK1∈-Dvl2-Plk1-mediated primary cilia disassembly pathway.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22609948): 3104-311710.1038/emboj.2012.144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a direct relationship between these two proteins is not known. In this study, we identified a novel phosphorylation-dependent HEF1 transportation mechanism that is directly regulated by Plk1. We demonstrated that CK1δ phosphorylates HEF1 at Ser-780 and Thr-804 residues, which allows non-mitotic Plk1 to dock to one of the resulting two phosphoepitopes. Furthermore, the docking of non-mitotic Plk1 on HEF1 was shown to be critical for HEF1 to translocate to FAs and for cell migration in HeLa cells. Our previous attempts to identify novel Plk1-binding partners and novel Plk1 functions in primary cilium disassembly suggested that Plk1 has an indirect effect on HEF1 during HEF1 degradation (19Lee K.H. Johmura Y. Yu L.R. Park J.E. Gao Y. Bang J.K. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Yeon Kim B. Lee K.S. Identification of a novel Wnt5a-CK1∈-Dvl2-Plk1-mediated primary cilia disassembly pathway.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22609948): 3104-311710.1038/emboj.2012.144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted here to elucidate the functional relationship between Plk1 and HEF1 in cellular processes. To this end, we first closely monitored the physical interaction between HEF1 and Plk1. We demonstrated an interaction, direct or indirect, between HEF1 and Plk1 during cell cycle progression using an immunoprecipitation assay, with thymidine-treated, asynchronously growing, or nocodazole-arrested 293T cells. HEF1 continuously formed a complex with Plk1 in each cell cycle population (Fig. 1A). Additionally, throughout the cell cycle, HEF1 mainly bound to the WT PBD rather than to AM (a phospho-dependent binding-defective mutant; PBD H538A/K540M mutant) (11Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. The molecular basis for phosphodependent substrate targeting and regulation of Plks by the Polo-box domain.Cell. 2003; 115 (14532005): 83-9510.1016/S0092-8674(03)00725-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The continual binding of HEF1 to Plk1 during cell cycle progression may reflect the HEF1 function present in all cell cycle stages in combination with Plk1. Next, to identify the phosphorylation site on HEF1 responsible for Plk1 PBD binding, we generated eight truncation mutant constructs of HEF1 based on its domain structure (Fig. 1C) and performed a PBD pulldown assay using these mutants. Among the eight deletion mutants, three C-terminal regions (T4, T5, and T6) bound to Plk1 PBD, whereas the N-terminal regions (T1, T2, T3, T1-1, and T1-2) did not (Fig. 1D). Thus, the region of HEF1 comprising aa 710–834 was identified as a minimal region containing the Plk1 PBD-binding phosphorylation sites. Taken together, these results show that the HEF1 aa 710–834 region binds to Plk1 PBD in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and it may work together with Plk1 throughout the entire cell cycle. We then chose three candidate sites (Ser-735, Ser-780, and Thr-804) from the sequence in the HEF1 aa 710–834 region, based on the consensus Plk1 PBD-binding module ((ϕ/P)ϕ(T/Q/H/M)S(pS/pT)(P/X), where ϕ is a hydrophobic residue) (11Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. The molecular basis for phosphodependent substrate targeting and regulation of Plks by the Polo-box domain.Cell. 2003; 115 (14532005): 83-9510.1016/S0092-8674(03)00725-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). After selection by visual scanning, either a Ser → Ala or a Thr → Ala substitution mutant for each candidate site was generated on the HEF1-T6 construct. Subsequent PBD-binding assays revealed that the S780A or T804A mutation severely hindered the HEF1–Plk1 PBD binding, whereas the S735A mutation did not do so (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, in a peptide-binding assay, only the phospho-Ser-780 and phospho-Thr-804 peptides interacted with endogenous Plk1, whereas their respective non-phosphorylated peptides did not (Fig. 2B). In line with the importance of pSer-780 and pThr-804 epitopes to PBD binding, both of these residues were conserved across various species (Fig. 2C), and a mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of both pSer-780 and pThr-804 peptides in thymidine-treated HeLa cells (Table 1 and Fig. S1A). Their phosphorylation in vivo was further confirmed in immunoprecipitation (IP)-immunoblotting analyses using phospho-specific antibodies, which were generated against either the pSer-780 or the pThr-804 epitope (Fig. 2D). As expected, HEF1 WT was immunoprecipitated by both phospho-antisera, whereas S780A- or T804A-containing HEF1 mutant was not immunoprecipitated by anti-pSer-780 or anti-pThr-804 antiserum, respectively.Table 1Phosphopeptides from HEF1 immunoprecipitates identified by mass spectrometry analysisView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Asterisks indicate phosphorylated residues.

The larger-sized letters were used to highlight the pSer-780 and pThr-804 peptides. To verify the phospho-dependent interactions between Plk1 PBD and HEF1, we attempted to determine the complex structures of the phosphopeptides of HEF1 with Plk1 PBD (Fig. 3A). Two phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 775KVMNSpSNQLC784 and 799LHYPSpTTALQE809 of HEF1, referred to as pSer-780 and pThr-804 peptides, respectively, were synthesized. Each peptide was complexed with Plk1 PBD, and crystallization attempts were made. However, only the Plk1 PBD complexed with pThr-804 peptide gave diffraction quality crystals (see Table 2 and “Experimental procedures” for details). The final model included all Plk1 PBD (residues 371–593) and 800HYPSpTTAL807 of the pThr-804 peptide because the terminal residues were not clearly defined in the electron density maps. There were two copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which were almost identical, with a root mean square deviation value of 0.36 Å for the 208 Cα atoms.Table 2Statistics on data collection and refinementPlk1-PBD and pThr-804 complexBeam linePAL 5CWavelength (Å)0.9795Space groupP21Unit cell parametersa (Å)57.564b (Å)59.440c (Å)72.748α (degrees)90β (degrees)99.48γ (degrees)90Resolution range (Å)50–2.9 (3.0–2.9)aValues in parentheses are for the outermost resolution shell.No. of total/unique reflections477,131/10,907Completeness (%)84.4 (67.3)I/σ(I)7.6 (1.7)RmergebRmerge = ΣhΣi|I(h,i) − 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣi I(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of reflection h and 〈I(h)〉 is the mean value of I(h,i) for all i measurements.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure determined at 2.9 Å resolution shows that the pThr-804 peptide is bound in a groove formed by Polo box 1 (PB1; consisting of residues 412–489) and Polo box 2 (PB2; consisting of residues 512–594) of Plk1 PBD (Fig. 3, B and C). The core of the pThr-804 peptide adopts a β-structure, forming four hydrogen bonds with the last strand of the β-sheet in Polo box 1 of Plk1. In particular, Tyr-801 and Ser-803 of the pThr-804 peptide form hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides and carbonyls of Asp-416 and Trp-414 of Plk1, respectively. The phosphate moiety of the pThr-804 peptide binds to the positively charged binding pocket, forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys-540 and His-538 of Plk1, and stabilizes the backbone conformation of the peptide by forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Thr-804. In addition, the carbonyl of Ser-803 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Thr-805, stabilizing the conformation. The imidazole ring of His-800 of the pThr-804 peptide is located at the tyrosine cluster of Plk1 PBD and forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr-485, whereas Tyr-801 is on the hydrophobic binding surface formed by Trp-414 and Phe-535 of Plk1. There are additional interactions between the C-terminal region of the peptide and the L2 region of Plk1 PBD. The interface between Plk1 PBD and the pThr-804 peptide is estimated as ∼490 Å per polypeptide, and the detailed interactions are shown in Fig. 3C (PDB code 5X3S). Interestingly, the key residues involved in the interactions seem to be highly conserved. The overall binding mode for the phosphopeptide of HEF1 to Plk1 is quite similar to that reported previously (i.e. the interactions with the β-sheet of Polo box 1 and the interactions around the phosphothreonine are almost the same as in the previous report), whereas the interactions seen for the terminal ends of the peptide seem to vary somewhat, depending on the sequence (25Jia J.L.

Biol. 2009; 16 (19597481): 876-88210.1038/nsmb.1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural analysis clearly suggests that the phosphothreonine at position 804 of HEF1 (pThr-804) plays an important role in specific interaction and recognition by Plk1 PBD. In accordance with our previous finding that CK1δ and CK1∈ phosphorylate the priming phosphorylation sites on Dvl2 for Plk1 PBD binding (19Lee K.H. Johmura Y. Yu L.R. Park J.E. Gao Y. Bang J.K. Zhou M. Veenstra T.D. Yeon Kim B. Lee K.S. Identification of a novel Wnt5a-CK1∈-Dvl2-Plk1-mediated primary cilia disassembly pathway.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22609948): 3104-311710.1038/emboj.2012.144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it could be assumed that both of these kinases also act as the pSer-780– and pThr-804–generating kinases on HEF1. Accordingly, we observed that the expression of CK1δ efficiently induced pSer-780 and pThr-804 epitopes in a kinase overexpression experiment, whereas, by comparison with CK1δ, CK1∈ changed these phosphoepitopes to a lesser degree (Fig. 4A). In line with these observations, clear enhancement of Plk1 PBD binding to FLAG-HEF1 T6 was observed in the CK1δ-overexpressing sample. On the other hand, altering CK1∈ did not result in substantial changes in this experiment (Fig. 4B). Thus, we surmised that, although CK1δ and CK1∈ share high similarity at the amino acid level, there may be limited functional redundancy between them in the generation of pSer-780 and pThr-804 epitopes on HEF1. We also observed the direct phosphorylation of HEF1 by CK1δ in bacterially purified forms of GST-HEF1 and GST-CK1δ (Fig. 4C). Strong HEF1 phosphorylation signals were observed in the CK1δ WT-incubated samples, whereas HEF1, alone or in combination with a CK1δ kinase-inactive mutant form (K38M), did not produce any specific signal (Fig. 4C). In line with these observations, a clear reduction in CK1δ-generated phosphorylation of HEF1 was observed by S780A/T804A double mutation of HEF1 (Fig. 4D). The HEF1 S780A/T804A double mutant remarkably reduced HEF1 phosphorylation by CK1δ in comparison with that for HEF1 WT in an in vitro kinase assay. In addition, in the time course experiments of HEF1 WT and HEF1 S780A/T804A phosphorylation by CK1δ, the difference in the extent of phosphorylation between HEF1 WT and S780A/T804A was 2.8-fold after 30 min, 3-fold after 1 h, 2.5-fold after 1.5 h, and 2.5-fold after 2 h. The difference in phosphorylation between the two was statistically significant over time (Fig. 4E). These results strongly support the idea that the activity of CK1δ is important for the phosphorylation of both the Ser-780 and Thr-804 residues of HEF1, resulting in the formation of the HEF1–Plk1 complex. Because HEF1 is considered to act during FA disassembly (3Kim M. Gans J.D. Nogueira C. Wang A. Paik J.H. Feng B. Brennan C. Hahn W.C. Cordon-Cardo C. Wagner S.N. Flotte T.J. Duncan L.M. Granter S.R.

Interestingly, consistent with the PBD pulldown assay, only the C-terminal region–containing HEF1 mutants (T4, T5, and T6), and not the N-terminal constructs (T1, T2, and T3), accumulated at FAs in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 5, A and B). FA accumulation of FLAG-HEF1 WT or its C-terminal region-containing HEF1 mutants (T4, T5, and T6) was observed in ∼80 or 60% of transfected HeLa cells, respectively.

They can block rivers, creating lakes that can later unleash floods, and by depleting glacier mass, they can threaten the flow of meltwater that downstream towns and farms may depend on. Now, by studying glaciers from Tibet to the Arctic islands of the Svalbard archi­pelago in Norway, researchers are starting to understand why some glaciers swing between extremes of stagnation and crush­ing flow, and how surges may be predicted. Studying surging glaciers could also offer insights into grander-scale ice flows with global consequences: the movements of the ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, which can change abruptly, altering the ice discharges that affect sea level."
https://openalex.org/W2771065031,"FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice develop severe lupus glomerulonephritis due to lack of an inhibitory immune cell receptor combined with a Y-chromosome linked autoimmune accelerator mutation. In the present study, we have investigated nephritis development and progression in FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice to find shared features with NZB/NZW F1 lupus prone mice and human disease. We sacrificed 25 male FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice at various disease stages, and grouped them according to activity and chronicity indices for lupus nephritis. Glomerular morphology and localization of electron dense deposits containing IgG were further determined by immune electron microscopy. Renal DNase I and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. DNase I protein levels was assessed by immunohistochemistry and zymography. Our results demonstrate early development of electron dense deposits containing IgG in FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice, before detectable levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies. Similar to NZB/NZW F1, electron dense deposits in FcγRIIB-/-yaa progressed from being confined to the mesangium in the early stage of lupus nephritis to be present also in capillary glomerular basement membranes. In the advanced stage of lupus nephritis, renal DNase I was lost on both transcriptional and protein levels, which has previously been shown in NZB/NZW F1 mice and in human disease. Although lupus nephritis appears on different genetic backgrounds, our findings suggest similar processes when comparing different murine models and human lupus nephritis."

We present a staining method that identifies major human mononuclear lymphoid and myeloid populations (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes), using only two fluorochromes and a minimal number of cells. Our approach increases the number of markers recordable on most flow cytometers allowing for a deeper and more comprehensive immunophenotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2773297935,"Planar lipid bilayer device, alternatively known as BLM, is a powerful tool to study functional properties of conducting membrane proteins such as ion channels and porins. In this work, we used BLM to study the prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) NaChBac in a well-defined membrane environment. Navs are an essential component for the generation and propagation of electric signals in excitable cells. The successes in the biochemical, biophysical and crystallographic studies on prokaryotic Navs in recent years has greatly promoted the understanding of the molecular mechanism that underlies these proteins and their eukaryotic counterparts. In this work, we investigated the single-molecule conductance and ionic selectivity behavior of NaChBac. Purified NaChBac protein was first reconstituted into lipid vesicles, which is subsequently incorporated into planar lipid bilayer by fusion. At single-molecule level, we were able to observe three distinct long-lived conductance sub-states of NaChBac. Change in the membrane potential switches on the channel mainly by increasing its opening probability. In addition, we found that individual NaChBac has similar permeability for Na+, K+, and Ca2+. The single-molecule behavior of the full-length protein is essentially highly stochastic. Our results show that planar lipid bilayer device can be used to study purified ion channels at single-molecule level in an artificial environment, and such studies can reveal new protein properties that are otherwise not observable in in vivo ensemble studies."
https://openalex.org/W2774577502,"Threshold effects are common in ecosystems and can generate counterintuitive outcomes in management interventions. A threshold effect proposed for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is size-conditional smolting and marine survival. Steelhead are anadromous, maturing in the ocean but migrating to freshwater to spawn, where their offspring reside for one or more years before smolting-physiologically transforming to a saltwater form-and migrating to the ocean. In conditional smolting, juveniles transform only if growth exceeds a threshold body size prior to migration season, and subsequent marine survival correlates with size at ocean entry. Conditional smolting suggests that efforts to improve freshwater survival of juveniles may reduce smolt success if they increase competition and reduce growth. Using model-selection techniques, we asked if this effect explained declining numbers of adult Carmel River steelhead. This threatened population has been the focus of two decades of habitat restoration, as well as active translocation and captive-rearing of juveniles stranded in seasonally dewatered channels. In the top-ranked model selected by information-theoretic criteria, adult decline was linked to reduced juvenile growth rates in the lower river, consistent with the conditional smolting hypothesis. According to model inference, since 2005 most returning adult steelhead were captively-reared. However, a lower-ranked model without conditional smolting also had modest support, and suggested a negative effect of captive rearing. Translocations of juvenile fish to perennial reaches may have reduced the steelhead run slightly by raising competition, but this effect is confounded in the data with effects of river flow on growth. Efforts to recover Carmel River steelhead will probably be more successful if they focus on conditions promoting rapid growth in the river. Our analysis clearly favored a role for size-conditional smolting and marine survival in the decline of the population, but did not definitively rule out alternative explanations."
https://openalex.org/W2772938722,"Aldose reductase (AR: human, AKR1B1; mouse, AKR1B3), the first enzyme in the polyol pathway, plays a key role in mediating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In earlier studies, using transgenic mice broadly expressing human AKR1B1 to human-relevant levels, mice devoid of Akr1b3, and pharmacological inhibitors of AR, we demonstrated that AR is an important component of myocardial I/R injury and that inhibition of this enzyme protects the heart from I/R injury. In this study, our objective was to investigate if AR modulates the β-catenin pathway and consequent activation of mesenchymal markers during I/R in the heart. To test this premise, we used two different experimental models: in vivo, Akr1b3 null mice and wild type C57BL/6 mice (WT) were exposed to acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by recovery for 48 hours or 28 days, and ex-vivo, WT and Akr1b3 null murine hearts were perfused using the Langendorff technique (LT) and subjected to 30 min of global (zero-flow) ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Our in vivo results reveal reduced infarct size and improved functional recovery at 48 hours in mice devoid of Akr1b3 compared to WT mice. We demonstrate that the cardioprotection observed in Akr1b3 null mice was linked to acute activation of the β-catenin pathway and consequent activation of mesenchymal markers and genes linked to fibrotic remodeling. The increased activity of the β-catenin pathway at 48 hours of recovery post-LAD was not observed at 28 days post-infarction, thus indicating that the observed increase in β-catenin activity was transient in the mice hearts devoid of Akr1b3. In ex vivo studies, inhibition of β-catenin blocked the cardioprotection observed in Akr1b3 null mice hearts. Taken together, these data indicate that AR suppresses acute activation of β-catenin and, thereby, blocks consequent induction of mesenchymal markers during early reperfusion after myocardial ischemia. Inhibition of AR might provide a therapeutic opportunity to optimize cardiac remodeling after I/R injury."

https://openalex.org/W2775143220,"Three years after the United States and Cuba announced the restoration of diplomatic relations, the atmosphere for cooperation has grown sharply chillier. In June, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would roll back the rapprochement, and his administration followed through last month with rules that limit travel to Cuba from the United States, and where Americans can spend money on the island. The new regulations don’t explicitly target science and have exemptions for academics. But the Trump administration has forbidden short-term travel by most U.S. government officials to Cuba. (Scientists with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had to pull out of a conference in Havana next month for that reason.) And the closure of the U.S. consulate in Havana in October means that Cubans must travel to a third country to apply for a U.S. visa, all but shutting down visits by Cuban scientists to the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2775417458,"A key tenet of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity has passed yet another test with flying colors—and for the first time in space. A French satellite experiment has shown that gravity tugs objects of different masses at the same rate, just as relativity dictates. The result is the most precise confirmation yet of the equivalence principle, first explored more than 400 years ago by Galileo Galilei. The MICROSCOPE satellite found no discrepancy in the free fall of two small test masses to about one part in 100 trillion. That’s more than 10 times better than the most sensitive ground-based experiments. Although no discrepancy has been found, physicists continue to look for one, because any violation of the equivalence principle could point to new forces of nature."
https://openalex.org/W2771915826,"In 2011, researchers discovered recurring slope lineae, thousands of streaks along steep slopes, mostly near the equator, that gradually grow and darken as spring turns to summer, as if fed by seeps of water, before fading. One of the discoverers, Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, was never so sure that liquid flowing water was responsible. Now, McEwen and his colleagues have shown that the hillside markings might be better explained by dry flows of sand and dust seeking their natural angle of repose. Science recently caught up with McEwen for an interview."
https://openalex.org/W2773379110,"When Dutch researchers developed an open-source algorithm designed to flag statistical errors in psychology papers, it received mixed reaction from the research community—especially after the free tool was run on tens of thousands of papers and the results were posted on the peer-review website PubPeer. Many questioned the accuracy of the algorithm, named statcheck, or said the exercise amounted to public shaming. But statcheck actually gets it right in more than 95% of cases, its developers claim in a study posted on the preprint server PsyArXiv on 16 November. Some outsiders agree, and are calling for routine use. Others still aren’t convinced."
