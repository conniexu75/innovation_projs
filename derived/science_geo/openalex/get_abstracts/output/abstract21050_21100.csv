https://openalex.org/W1980755859,"The rat TGF-beta type III receptor cDNA has been cloned by overexpression in COS cells. The encoded receptor is an 853 amino acid protein with a large N-terminal extracellular domain containing at least one site for glycosaminoglycan addition, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 41 amino acid cytoplasmic tail with no obvious signaling motif. Introduction of the cDNA into COS cells and L6 myoblasts induces expression of a heterogenously glycosylated 280-330 kd protein characteristic of the type III receptor that binds TGF-beta 1 specifically. In L6 myoblasts lacking the endogenous type III receptor, expression of the recombinant receptor leads to an increase in the amount of ligand bound and cross-linked to surface type II TGF-beta receptors. This indicates that the type III receptor may regulate the ligand-binding ability or surface expression of the type II receptor."
https://openalex.org/W108431095,"The subfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G proteins) designated Gq has been shown to regulate the activity of phospholipase C by reconstitution. However, the role of these proteins in hormonal regulation of this activity has not been demonstrated. Two antisera were used in attempts to interrupt this pathway. Antiserum W082, developed against a peptide representing an internal sequence in alpha q, was specific for alpha q by immunoblots but did not recognize the native protein. Antiserum X384 was developed against a peptide representing the 12 amino acids of the common carboxyl termini of alpha q and alpha 11. It had a broader specificity for this subfamily of G protein alpha subunits and recognized the native proteins. Antiserum X384 specifically immunoprecipitated alpha q and its homologs from purified preparations and detergent extracts of membranes. Affinity-purified antibodies attenuated stimulation of phosphatidylinositide 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis by bradykinin, angiotensin, and histamine in membranes derived from NG108-15 cells, rat liver, and 1321N1 cells, respectively. Activation of the phospholipase C activity by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate alone was also inhibited. Inclusion of the peptide to which the antisera were raised blocked the effect of the antibody. In contrast, affinity-purified W082, which did not recognize native proteins, did not alter regulation of phospholipase C. This indicates that the Gq family of signaling proteins can couple to several receptors and is responsible for the hormonal regulation of phospholipase C in these diverse systems. The further generality of this regulatory pathway remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1570643773,"The cDNA for a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor was cloned from a human leukocyte cDNA library using a 0.8-kilobase pair fragment of the guinea pig lung PAF receptor cDNA (Honda, Z., Nakamura, M., Miki, I., Minami, M., Watanabe, T., Seyama, Y., Okado, H., Toh, H., Ito, K., Miyamoto, T., and Shimizu, T. (1991) Nature 349, 342-346). The cDNA (1.8-kilobase pairs) had an open reading frame encoding 342 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 39,203. The clone was shown to code for a PAF receptor based on the following criteria: 1) the amino acid sequence possesses seven putative membrane spanning domains with 83% identity to the guinea pig lung PAF receptor, 2) Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with the transcript of the clone showed an electrophysiological response to PAF, and 3) COS-7 cells expressing the encoded receptor showed ligand binding with the pharmacological properties of the PAF receptor. Activation of the PAF receptor yielded inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in both COS-7 cells and oocytes, and guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio)bisphosphate injection into the oocytes inhibited PAF-induced Cl- current, providing an evidence that PAF stimulates phosphoinositide turnover via G-protein(s). PAF receptor mRNA was abundant in leukocytes and less so in an undifferentiated human eosinophilic cell line (EoL-1 cells) or human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells). The production of the mRNA was prominently increased when EoL-1 cells were treated with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-5, and n-butyrate."
https://openalex.org/W1558058463,"In order to investigate the mechanism of topoisomerase I inhibition by camptothecin, we studied the induction of DNA cleavage by purified mammalian DNA topoisomerase I in a series of oligonucleotides and analyzed the DNA sequence locations of preferred cleavage sites in the SV40 genome. The oligonucleotides were derived from the sequence of the major camptothecin-induced cleavage site in SV40 DNA (Jaxel, C., Kohn, K. W., and Pommier, Y. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 11157 to 11170) with the cleaved bond in their center. DNA length was critical since cleavage was detectable only in 30 and 20 base pair-(bp) oligonucleotides, but not in a 12-bp oligonucleotide. Cleavage was at the same position in the oligonucleotides as in SV40 DNA. Its intensity was greater in the 30- than in the 20-bp oligonucleotide, indicating that sequences more than 10 bp away from the cleavage site may influence intensity. Camptothecin-induced DNA cleavage required duplex DNA since none of the single-stranded oligonucleotides were cleaved. Analysis of base preferences around topoisomerase I cleavage sites in SV40 DNA indicated that camptothecin stabilized topoisomerase I preferentially at sites having a G immediately 3' to the cleaved bond. Experiments with 30-bp oligonucleotides showed that camptothecin produced most intense cleavage in a complementary duplex having a G immediately 3' to the cleavage site. Weaker cleavage was observed in a complementary duplex in which the 3'G was replaced with a T. The identity of the 3' base, however, did not affect topoisomerase I-induced DNA cleavage in the absence of drug. These results indicate that camptothecin traps preferentially a subset of the enzyme cleavage sites, those having a G immediately 3' to the cleaved bond. This strong preference suggests that camptothecin binds reversibly to the DNA at topoisomerase I cleavage sites, in analogy to a model previously proposed for inhibitors of topoisomerase II (Capranico, G., Kohn, K.W., and Pommier, Y. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 6611-6619)."
https://openalex.org/W1673990805,"Rats treated with hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] (HCCL), a cobalamin analogue that induces methylmalonic aciduria, have increased hepatic mitochondrial content and increased oxidative metabolism of pyruvate and palmitate per hepatocyte. The present studies were undertaken to characterize oxidative metabolism in isolated liver mitochondria from rats treated with HCCL. After 5-6 weeks, state 3 oxidation rates for diverse substrates are reduced in mitochondria from HCCL-treated rats. Similar reductions of mitochondrial oxidation rates are obtained with dinitrophenol-uncoupled mitochondria excluding defective phosphorylation as a cause for the observed decrease in mitochondrial oxidation. The activities of mitochondrial oxidases are reduced in HCCL-treated rats and demonstrate a defect in complex IV. Investigation of the complexes of the respiratory chain reveals a 32% decrease of ubiquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) activity and a 72% decrease of ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase (complex IV) activity in mitochondria from 5-6-week HCCL-treated rats as compared with controls. Liver mitochondria from HCCL-treated rats also demonstrate decreased cytochrome content per mg of mitochondrial protein (25% decrease of cytochrome b and 52% decrease of cytochrome a + a3 as compared with control rats). The HCCL-treated rat represents an animal model for the study of the consequences of respiratory chain defects in liver mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1504464280,"Five mutants of recombinant insulin-like growth factor-II (rIGF-II) that bound with high affinity to either the IGF-II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/CIM6-P) or the IGF-I receptor were prepared by site-directed mutagenic procedures, expressed as fusion proteins in the larva of Bombyx mori or Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, renatured, and characterized in terms of their receptor binding affinities and specificities as well as their biological activities. Class I mutants in which Phe26, Tyr27, and Val43 were substituted with Ser, Leu, and Leu, respectively, bound to enriched preparations of rat placental IGF-II/CIM6-P receptors with apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd(app)) that were only slightly greater, i.e. 0.10, 0.05, and 0.06 nM, than that of rIGF-II (0.04 nM) or hIGF-II (0.03 nM). In contrast, replacing Phe26 with Ser resulted in 5- and 20-fold decreases in the affinities of this mutant for highly purified human placental IGF-I and insulin receptors, respectively. The affinities of the two other Class I mutants, [Leu27]- and [Leu43]rIGF-IIs, for these two receptors were reduced 80- to 220-fold. The affinities of Class II mutants, i.e. [Thr48,Ser49,Ile50]- and [Arg54,Arg55] rIGF-IIs, for IGF-I receptors were as potent as rIGF-II; however, they bound very poorly or not at all to the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor. In the binding study of those mutant rIGF-IIs, IGF-II was observed to have an unexpectedly high affinity for pure human placental insulin receptor preparations. For example, the affinities of hIGF-II, rIGF-II, and two Class II rIGF-II mutants for the insulin receptor were only 3-, 9-, and 5-fold less, respectively, than that of porcine insulin. In two biological assay systems, i.e. the stimulation of DNA synthesis in Balb/c 3T3 cells and glycogen synthesis in HepG2 cells, the Kd(app) of the rIGF-II mutants for the IGF-I receptor but not the IGF-II/CIM6-P receptor correlated with their abilities to produce biological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1596181788,"Recently, we have shown that human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) release oxygen radicals from the plasma membrane in response to cytokines. Now we have used diphenylene iodonium, a covalent binding inhibitor of activated 45-kDa flavoprotein, in neutrophils radiolabeled with 125I and could identify a 45-kDa protein band in a separated HMC plasma membrane fraction. Low temperature difference spectroscopy showed a peak absorbance at 428 and 558 nm. Direct potentiometry of HMC membranes (-340 to -160 mV) showed the presence of a low potential cytochrome (76 pmol/mg to HMC membrane protein) identified as cytochrome b558. In slot blots, mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7D5, specific for the extracellular domain of the alpha-subunit, showed a positive reaction with HMCs. In Western blots, mAb 449, directed against the cytoplasmic epitope of the alpha-subunit, identified a 23-kDa protein; and mAb 48, raised against the large (beta) subunit of cytochrome b558 of human neutrophils (Verhoeven, A. J., Bolscher, B. G. J. M., Meerhof, L. J., van Zwieten, R., Keijer, J., Weening, R. S., and Roos, D. (1989) Blood 73, 1686-1694), detected a smear between 75 and 100 kDa in denatured HMC membrane protein. These data determined with HMCs, suggest for the first time the expression of three essential components of NADPH:O2- oxidoreductase in mesenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543914169,"Erythropoietin (Epo) has three N-linked sugar chains. Codons for asparagine at N-glycosylation sites in genomic human Epo DNA were replaced with those for glutamine. The wild-type Epo gene and seven mutants that lacked N-glycosylation sites in every possible combination were introduced into baby hamster-kidney cells. To study the role of the N-linked sugars in Epo biosynthesis, Epo protein expressed transiently was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The elimination of all three N-glycosylation sites decreased Epo production to 10% of that of the wild-type Epo. Wild-type and mutant Epos produced by stably transfected cells were partially purified to investigate their properties. Removal of N-glycosylation sites changed affinity of Epo to the receptor. The in vitro activity of Epo that lost all N-glycosylation sites was comparable with that of the wild-type Epo, while the in vivo activity severely decreased. These results indicate that N-linked sugars of Epo have two major functions; N-linked sugars are important for 1) proper biosynthesis and/or secretion and 2) expression of the in vivo activity probably by enhancing survival in the circulation. N-Linked sugars of Epo affect binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor but do not play a key role in expression of the in vitro activity."
https://openalex.org/W1494636314,"Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was studied in the parent PC12 cell line and in recently isolated clones sensitive or insensitive to caffeine. In the caffeine-sensitive cells the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) responses by the xanthine drug and by stimulants of receptors coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-P3) generation (bradykinin, ATP) depend on separate pathways because 1) caffeine does not stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and 2) Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, the process activated by caffeine, plays no major role in the Ins-P3-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Although distinct, these two mechanisms converge onto the same Ca2+ store. In fact 1) the [Ca2+]i responses by receptor agonists and caffeine were not additive; 2) either type of agent reduced (up to complete inhibition) the response to a subsequent administration of the same or the other agent; 3) all these responses were prevented by selective Ca2+ ATPase blockers; 4) ryanodine, which affects the intracellular Ca2+ channel sensitive to caffeine, also induced depletion of the receptor-sensitive Ca2+ pool; 5) in the 10 PC12 clones tested, sensitivity to caffeine paralleled ryanodine sensitivity. Therefore, PC12 cells, similar to some smooth muscle fibers but at variance with neurons and other secretory cells, express a single, rapidly exchanging Ca2+ store in which two distinct intracellular Ca2+ channels, i.e. the receptors for caffeine-ryanodine and Ins-P3, appear to be colocalized."
https://openalex.org/W1544918831,"Import of authentic or artificial precursor proteins into the matrix of isolated yeast mitochondria can proceed via a translocation intermediate that is lodged between the two mitochondrial membranes. The intermediate accumulates when import is arrested by depleting mitochondria of ATP. Generation of the intermediate requires a potential across the inner membrane. The intermediate is membrane-bound, partly or completely processed (depending on the precursor), and chased into the matrix by added ATP. This chase does not require a potential across the inner membrane. The properties of this intermediate support the proposal (Hwang, S., Jascur, J., Vestweber, D., Pon, L., and Schatz, G. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 487-493) that import into the matrix involves two distinct translocation systems in the outer and the inner mitochondrial membrane that are not permanently coupled to each other. Only translocation across the inner membrane requires ATP in the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1522634048,"We have examined, by low temperature ESR, the protein-derived radicals formed by reaction of purified ram seminal vesicle prostaglandin H synthase (PHS). Upon addition of arachidonic acid or 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide (PPHP) to PHS reconstituted with Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX (Fe-PHS) at -12 degrees C, an ESR spectrum was observed at -196 degrees C containing a doublet that rapidly converted into a singlet. These protein-derived radicals were identified as tyrosyl radicals. The addition of a peroxidase substrate, phenol, completely abolished the appearance of the doublet and suppressed the formation of the singlet but did not inhibit eicosanoid formation. Incubation of arachidonic acid with PHS reconstituted with Mn(III)-protoporphyrin IX (Mn-PHS) produced only a broad singlet that exhibited different power saturation behavior than the tyrosyl radicals and decayed more rapidly. This broad singlet does not appear to be a tyrosyl radical. No ESR signals were observed on incubation of PPHP with Mn-PHS, which has cyclooxygenase but not peroxidase activity. Eicosanoid synthesis occurred very rapidly after addition of arachidonic acid and was complete within 1 min. In contrast, the protein-derived radicals appeared at a slower rate and after the addition of the substrate reached maximal levels between 1 and 2 min for Fe-PHS and 4-6 min for Mn-PHS. These results suggest that the observed protein-derived radicals are not catalytically competent intermediates in cyclooxygenase catalysis by either Fe-PHS or Mn-PHS. The peroxidase activity appears to play a major role in the formation of the tyrosyl radicals with Fe-PHS."
https://openalex.org/W1669215771,"The earliest responses to activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor include a transient increase in calcium influx and a transient membrane hyperpolarization. The underlying mechanisms are, however, not well understood as yet. In the present study, we have applied patch clamp recording in the cell-attached and the outside-out mode, and fluorimetric cytosolic Ca2+ determinations, to identify the nature of the ion channels involved, to characterize their properties at the level of single channels, and to unravel their mechanism of activation. We provide evidence that activation of the EGF receptor results initially in the activation of voltage-independent Ca2+ channels that can be defined as direct receptor-operated channels. This in turn causes the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, which results in a (delayed) membrane hyperpolarization and then leads to the activation of a second class of Ca2+ channels that are sensitive to hyperpolarization. An autocatalytic generation of further hyperpolarization and Ca2+ influx is the predicted outcome of this ionic cascade. Based on the observed inhibitory effects of protein kinase C activation on the activity of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels, we propose that protein kinase C is involved in the negative regulation of this cascade, which explains the transient nature of these responses."
https://openalex.org/W1498023566,"Antibodies that recognize the alpha 2 delta and alpha 1 subunits of skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels have been used to investigate the subunit components and phosphorylation of omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTx)-sensitive N-type calcium channels from rabbit brain. Photolabeling of the N-type channel with a photoreactive derivative of 125I-omega-CgTx results in the identification of a single polypeptide of 240 kDa. MANC-1, a monoclonal antibody recognizing alpha 2 delta subunits of L-type calcium channels from skeletal muscle, immunoprecipitates the omega-CgTx-labeled 240-kDa polypeptide and approximately 6% of the digitonin-solubilized 125I-omega-CgTx-labeled N-type channels. MANC-1 also immunoprecipitates a phosphoprotein of 240 kDa that comigrates with 125I-omega-CgTx-labeled N-type calcium channels, but not with L-type calcium channels, in sucrose gradients. Both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C are effective in the phosphorylation of this polypeptide. Similar to the alpha 1 subunits of skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels, the immunoprecipitation of the 240-kDa phosphoprotein by MANC-1 is prevented by the detergent Triton X-100. Anti-CP-(1382-1400), an antipeptide antibody against a highly conserved segment of the alpha 1 subunits of calcium channels, immunoprecipitates the 240-kDa phosphopeptide in Triton X-100. The 240-kDa protein is phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of phosphate/mol of omega-CgTx-binding N-type calcium channels by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. Our results show that the 240-kDa polypeptide is an alpha 1-like subunit of an omega-CgTx-sensitive N-type calcium channel. The N-type calcium channels containing this subunit are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C and contain noncovalently associated alpha 1-like and alpha 2 delta-like subunits as part of their oligomeric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1497445549,"The mechanism by which the type 2 topoisomerase from bacteriophage T4 mediates knotting of negatively supercoiled DNA was deduced from an analysis of product topology. The knotted products were nicked and then subjected to electrophoresis in order to separate species on the basis of the minimum number of crossings in the knotted form. Knots with defined numbers of crossings were purified and the configuration of these crossings determined in the electron microscope by the RecA coating method. The product knots were exclusively of the twist form, in which an interwound region is entrapped by a single interlock of two looped ends. The interwound region was of negative sign in greater than 98% of the molecules examined, whereas the single interlock was equally likely to be positive or negative. These results are interpreted in terms of a model for knot formation in which random strand passage mediated by the topoisomerase links bent or branched portions of a superhelix that has a specific interwound geometry. Superhelix interwinding and DNA contacts stabilized by excess enzyme molecules explain the very high frequency of knotting."
https://openalex.org/W1554339438,"An endo-exonuclease has been identified and partially purified from the basidiocarp tissues of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus, which include synchronous meiosis at karyogamy-pachytene stages. Its peak activity appears during the meiotic prophase. The Coprinus endo-exonuclease has a single-strand specific endonuclease activity that converts the supercoiled DNA to relaxed DNA. The endonucleolytic cleavage of single-strand DNA generates 3'-phosphomonoester termini. It is also a single-strand-specific exonuclease and it hydrolyzes linear DNA in a 3' to 5' direction, but is unable to hydrolyze single-strand DNA having a 3'-phosphomonoester terminus. It requires Mg2+ with an optimal concentration of 25 mM. It has an optimal pH of 8.3, a peak enzyme activity at 50 degrees C, and it contains a single 43-kilodalton polypeptide. Coprinus meiotic endo-exonuclease may be involved in the substrate preparation for meiotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1536927947,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42mapk) becomes transiently activated after treatment of serum-starved murine Swiss 3T3 cells or EL4 thymocytes with a diversity of mitogens. Similarly, a meiosis-activated protein kinase (p44mpk) becomes stimulated during maturation of sea star oocytes induced by 1-methyladenine. Both p42mapk and p44mpk have been identified as protein-serine/threonine kinases that are activated as a consequence of their phosphorylation. Because homologous protein kinases may play essential roles in both mitogenesis and oogenesis, we have compared in detail the biochemical properties of these two kinases. We find that these kinases are highly related based on their in vitro substrate specificities, sensitivity to inhibitors, and immunological cross-reactivity. However, they differ in apparent molecular weight and can be separated chromatographically, indicating that the two enzymes are distinct. Furthermore, in the course of this investigation, we have identified a 44-kDa protein kinase in mitogen-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells and EL4 thymocytes that co-purifies with p44mpk and thus appears to be a closer homolog of the sea star enzyme. Analysis of these protein kinases clarifies the relationships between a set of tyrosine-phosphorylated 41-45-kDa proteins present in mitogen-stimulated cells (Martinez, R., Nakamura., K. D., and Weber, M. J. (1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 653-655; Cooper, J. A., and Hunter, T. (1984) Mol. Cell. Biol. 4, 30-37), two myelin basic protein kinases identified in epidermal growth factor-treated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells (Ahn, N. G., Weiel, J. E., Chan, C. P., and Krebs, E. G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11487-11494), and p42mapk. Our work points to the existence of a group of related serine/threonine protein kinases, regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and functioning at different stages of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1560709577,"We investigated the ability of highly purified recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) AB to interact with the products of alpha and beta receptor genes expressed in cells independently or concurrently. Although PDGF-AB lacked any detectable ability to bind or activate beta receptors in cells expressing only this receptor, efficient beta receptor activation by this ligand was readily observed in cells coexpressing alpha platelet-derived growth factor receptors (alpha PDGFRs). beta receptor activation induced by PDGF-AB was shown to be dependent upon in vivo physical association of this receptor with alpha PDGFRs. Moreover, cross-linking analysis established the existence of PDGF-AB-induced beta PDGFR dimers in vivo. All of these findings argue that initial PDGF-AB interaction with the alpha PDGFR induces conformational changes in the ligand or receptor that facilitates efficient recruitment of beta PDGFR by this PDGF isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1551236457,"We report the identification of cell surface glycoproteins that bind transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in an isoform-specific manner, and are distinct from TGF-beta receptors I and II or the TGF-beta binding proteoglycan beta-glycan. The novel TGF-beta binding proteins have been identified in various cell lines including fetal bovine heart endothelial cells and MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells. They include proteins of 90-100 and 180 kDa that preferentially bind TGF-beta 1 (KD 0.1-0.2 nM) and proteins of 60 and 140 kDa that preferentially bind TGF-beta 2 (KD 0.5-1 nM). The 180-kDa TGF-beta 1 binding protein and the 60- and 140-kDa TGF-beta 2 binding proteins can be released from the cell surface by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, suggesting that these proteins are attached to the plasma membrane through a phosphatidylinositol anchor. The expression of these three proteins as well as their sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C is cell line-dependent. The 90-100-kDa TGF-beta 1 binding proteins are components of a 190-kDa disulfide-linked complex. The structural properties of these proteins and their high affinity and selectivity for different TGF-beta isoforms defines them as a novel class of cell surface TGF-beta binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1605154807,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a cytokine in a variety of cell types, and an intermediary in cell activation. It is produced from membrane phospholipids by either lysophosphatidate acyl-CoA:acyltransferase (lyso-PA AT) or phospholipase D. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation of human mesangial cells (HMC) induced activation of lyso-PA AT, and synthesis of new PA species with significant increase in PA mass. These PA species were enriched in long-chain unsaturated acyl side chains (C18:1, C18:2, C20:5, and C22:6) in both the sn-2 and sn-1 positions, and stimulated the action of the lyso-PA AT as a positive feedback mechanism. Gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the acyl composition of phosphatidic acid does not resemble that of the major phospholipid fractions of this preparation and therefore is not the product of phospholipase D. The PA species were rapidly converted to 1,2-sn-diacylglycerols by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, which also was activated by IL-1 via a separate mechanism involving a pertussis-sensitive G-protein. The activities of lyso-PA AT and phosphatidate phosphohydrolase were associated with plasma membrane enriched and refined microsomal fractions. IL-1 stimulation of a murine T cell (thymoma) line, EL-4, also caused stimulation of lyso-PA AT, resulting in PA formation. EL-4 mutants with defective IL-1 receptors did not demonstrate stimulation of lyso-PA AT, showing the necessity of intact IL-1 receptors for activation of this enzyme. We conclude that PA is a significant signaling intermediary for IL-1 via activation of lyso-PA AT and a G-protein, which activates phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. This system suggests a novel mechanism whereby a low intensity signal may be translated into cellular activation."
https://openalex.org/W1538432305,"The phosphorylation state of cytidylyltransferase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was correlated with its subcellular distribution and activity in vivo. Western blot analysis of soluble and particulate fractions from control and phospholipase C-treated cells revealed slower migrating forms of cytidylyltransferase present only in the soluble fraction of control cells. These were abolished by incubating the soluble fraction at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ but persisted if 135 mM NaF was present in the incubation. CHO cells were labeled with 32Pi, and cytidylyltransferase was immunoprecipitated from soluble and particulate fractions from control and phospholipase C-treated cells. The slower migrating forms of cytidylyltransferase, present in the soluble fraction of control cells, were phosphorylated at multiple sites. Although an equivalent amount of cytidylyltransferase was immunoprecipitated from the particulate fraction of phospholipase C-treated cells, it contained little 32P. Pretreatment of the CHO cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A phosphatases, prevented the stimulation of cytidylyltransferase in vivo by phospholipase C. These results demonstrate that dephosphorylation of soluble cytidylyltransferase is required for the phospholipase C-mediated translocation of cytidylyltransferase in CHO cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576898335,"Abstract The binding of specific inhibitors to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket (QP center) of cytochrome c reductase was analyzed before and after removal of bound phospholipid and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein using optical spectroscopy and fluorescence quench binding assays. The enzyme lacking iron-sulfur protein showed almost unchanged, tight binding of the E-beta-methoxyacrylate inhibitors oudemansin A and MOA-stilbene, whereas binding of the chromone inhibitor stigmatellin was almost completely abolished. The affinity of the weak inhibitor 3-undecyl-2-hydroxy-naphthoquinone was decreased. Oudemansin A binding to the defective pocket of the iron-sulfur protein-depleted enzyme was lowered by added phospholipid. It was deduced from these results that the QP center is a spacious pocket formed by domains of cytochrome b, bearing the E-beta-methoxcyacrylate binding site, and the iron-sulfur protein, bearing the stigmatellin binding site. Moreover, removal of the iron-sulfur protein leaves this pocket defective but essentially unchanged in its remaining binding capability. The affinity of three preparations of cytochrome c reductase, the complete, the delipidated, and the iron-sulfur depleted enzyme for E-beta-methoxyacrylate-stilbene, was analyzed for different redox states of the centers of cytochrome c reductase. The apparent Kd values for the different redox states were interpreted in terms of two conformational states. It is suggested that these changes reflect the two states of the catalytic switch proposed recently for the QP pocket of cytochrome c reductase (Brandt, U., and von Jagow, G. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 163-170). According to the refined model presented in this work, changeover to the state is triggered by reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster, and changeover back to the FeS state is triggered by electron transfer from the low potential onto the high potential heme b center. Our interpretation implies that the stability of the two states is affected by the redox states of the enzyme, but that additionally changing the redox states of the two centers is required for switching on a time scale."
https://openalex.org/W250996202,"Thiol:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase catalyzes the GSH reduction of protein disulfides to sulfhydryls. Chromatography of solubilized hepatic microsomes on Mono Q yielded two peaks, Q-2 and Q-5, which contained all the thiol:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase activity. These were further purified by chromatofocusing giving specific activities of 14.4 and 45.9 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively with purifications of 45.0- and 143.6-fold. Amino acids 1-18 of Q-5 were the same as previously reported for Thiol:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase (Edman, J. C., Ellis, L., Blacher, R. W., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Q-2 differed markedly from Q-5 but Q-2 showed 100% identity at amino acids 25-54, 258-269, 285-310, 347-350, 412-419, and 434-463 for the reported sequence of rat, hepatic, cytosolic phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C form 1a (PLC) (Bennett, C. F., Balcarek, J. M., Varrichio, A., and Crooke, S. T. (1988) Nature 334, 268-270). PLC activity was found in the elution from the Mono Q column, but none was found in purified Q-2 or Q-5. Antibodies to Q-5 reacted with Q-2, but anti-Q-2 did not react with Q-5. Anti-Q-2 antibody showed immunoreactivity with 55- and 60-kDa microsomal proteins, whereas Q-5 antibody reacted with a number of microsomal proteins. Although Q-2 was immunoreactive with a polyclonal antibody to guinea pig, uterine cytosolic PLC, partially purified PLCs from rat liver cytosol did not react to this antibody. Our data would suggest that the published sequence for PLC form 1a may actually be the sequence for Q-2."
https://openalex.org/W1514914554,"A vaccinia virus open reading frame (ORF) previously predicted to encode thymidylate kinase (TmpK) is shown to encode an active enzyme. A copy of the ORF, generated by polymerase chain reaction, was cloned into an Escherichia coli inducible expression vector. Cell extracts of E. coli expressing the vaccinia gene contained high levels of TmpK activity, whereas extracts of cells without the TmpK gene did not. The vaccinia ORF expressed from a yeast vector complemented a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc8 mutant, demonstrating functional compatibility of the vaccinia virus and yeast TmpK enzymes. The gene is shown to be nonessential for the replication of vaccinia virus in cultured cells by the construction of a viable virus mutant that has the coding region of the TmpK gene interrupted by the Ecogpt gene. Synthesis of the vaccinia TmpK protein in infected cells was demonstrated by the use of a polyvalent rabbit antiserum raised against the purified TmpK enzyme expressed in E. coli to immunoprecipitate a 23-kDa early polypeptide from cells infected with wild type vaccinia but not from cells infected with the TmpK mutant. Plasmid vectors that allow the construction of recombinant viruses expressing foreign gene(s) from the nonessential TmpK locus are described."
https://openalex.org/W1600883380,"Many anaerobic bacteria fix CO2 via the acetyl-CoA pathway. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), a key enzyme in the pathway, condenses a methyl group, a carbonyl group from CO, CO2, or the carboxyl group of pyruvate, and CoA to form acetyl-CoA. When treated with CO, CODH exhibits an EPR signal which results from an organometallic complex containing nickel, at least 3 iron, and CO and has been referred to as the NiFeC signal. Although this EPR signal has been presumed to be the spectroscopic signature of the enzyme-bound C-1 precursor of the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA, its catalytic relevance had not been rigorously studied. We have demonstrated the catalytic competence of this NiFeC species by showing that the rate of formation of the NiFeC EPR signal is faster than the rate of an isotope exchange reaction between CO and acetyl-CoA, a partial reaction in the overall synthesis. Generation of the NiFeC signal in the absence of CO by acetyl-CoA has been demonstrated and requires a one-electron reduction at a midpoint potential of -541 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode. In addition, we have observed and characterized an isotope exchange reaction between the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA and the carbonyl group of the NiFeC complex, indicating that the C in the NiFeC complex is in the form of CO. These combined results demonstrate that the NiFeCO complex exhibits the characteristics expected of the precursor of the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1597394817,"We have previously shown that activity of a Cl- channel is required for acidification of clathrin-coated vesicles by the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase (Arai, H., Pink, S. and Forgac, M. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3075-3082). We demonstrate that activity of the coated vesicle Cl- channel is modulated by phosphorylation. Cl- conductance was measured in a reconstituted preparation of coated vesicle membrane proteins using the Cl(-)-sensitive fluorescence probe, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium. Treatment of coated vesicle membranes with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a 25 +/- 5% decrease in Cl- channel activity. A parallel decrease in ATP-dependent acidification of coated vesicles was also observed. The decrease in Cl- conductance and ATP-dependent acidification was reversed by treatment with protein kinase A and MgATP; the alkaline phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, blocked the inhibition of acidification. These results indicate that Cl- conductance in coated vesicles is modulated by a protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation and that this modulation in turn affects ATP-dependent acidification."
https://openalex.org/W1569210990,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is a critical component of the mechanism responsible for signal transduction between nerve and muscle. Induction of AChR gene expression occurs during myogenesis when myoblasts exit the cell cycle and fuse to form myotubes. Induction of muscle-specific genes during differentiation is believed to be mediated through the activities of members of the MyoD family of myogenic regulatory factors. At least two of the factors, MyoD and myogenin, function as transcriptional activators. Here we present evidence that MyoD is capable of activating transcription of the mouse AChR gamma subunit gene. We have identified seven potential MyoD-binding sites (E-boxes) within the 5'-flanking DNA of the gamma subunit gene. We demonstrate that two small regions of the 5'-flanking DNA, one containing a pair of E-boxes and the other containing a single E-box, are required for gamma subunit expression in mouse muscle cells. DNase I footprinting indicates that the E-box proximal to the transcriptional initiation site is capable of interacting directly with MyoD. Furthermore, site-directed mutational analysis indicates that the single E-box is necessary for transactivation by MyoD and expression of the gamma subunit promoter region in muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514789115,"The lysosomotropic amine primaquine has previously been shown to inhibit both secretory and recycling processes of cells in culture. We have used a cell-free assay that reconstitutes glycoprotein transport through the Golgi apparatus to investigate the mechanism of action of primaquine. In this assay, primaquine inhibits protein transport at a half-maximal concentration of 50 microM, similar to the concentration previously reported to disrupt protein secretion in cultured cells. Kinetic analysis of primaquine inhibition indicates that its point of action is at an early step in the vesicular transport mechanism. Primaquine does not inhibit the fusion of vesicles already attached to their target membranes. Primaquine irreversibly inactivates the membranes that form transport vesicles (donor), but not the membranes that are the destination of those vesicles (acceptor). Morphological data indicate that primaquine inhibits the budding of vesicles from the donor membranes. Once formed, the vesicles are refractile to primaquine action, and their attachment to and fusion with acceptor membranes proceeds unimpeded. In addition to illuminating the mechanism of action of primaquine, this study suggests that the selective action of this agent will make it a useful tool in the study of the formation of transport vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W162095732,"Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) stimulates proliferation of clonal osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells mainly via the stimulation of phospholipase C. These cells constitutively produced and secreted insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). In addition, a neutralizing anti-IGF-I antibody completely abolished DNA synthesis stimulated by PGF2 alpha in MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting that IGF-I indeed mediates the PGF2 alpha effect. However, PGF2 alpha decreased the expression of IGF-I mRNA and the secretion of immunoreactive IGF-I into the medium, whereas progression activity in the conditioned medium was not affected by PGF2 alpha. Although IGF-I alone did not stimulate DNA synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells, when PGF2 alpha was added to the cultures, IGF-I stimulated their proliferation. Thus, PGF2 alpha may potentiate the action of IGF-I. At the same time, PGF2 alpha increased the number of high affinity binding sites (molecular mass of 130 kDa) for IGF-I in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in IGF-I-binding site number preceded the elevation of DNA synthesis by approximately 3 h. Furthermore, MC3T3-E1 cells secreted at least three species of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) with molecular masses of 24, 30, and 34 kDa. In the early period of PGF2 alpha exposure, PGF2 alpha attenuated the secretion of all of these IGFBPs, whereas thereafter, it markedly increased their secretion, especially that of the 34-kDa IGFBP, suggesting a modulation of metabolism and action of IGF-I. These effects of PGF2 alpha on IGF-I receptor number and IGFBP secretion may play a role in the synergism between PGF2 alpha and IGF-I that results in the stimulation of DNA synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581220527,"Eicosanoids containing a 12-hydroxyl group preceded by at least two conjugated double bonds are metabolized to 10,11-dihydro and 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo products by porcine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) (Wainwright, S. L., Falck, J. R., Yadagiri, P., and Powell, W. S. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 10126-10135). These 10,11-dihydro metabolites could either have been formed by the direct reduction of the 10,11-double bond of the substrate, as previous evidence suggested, or via an initially formed 12-oxo intermediate. To gain some insight into the mechanism for the formation of dihydro products by this pathway, we investigated the metabolism of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoicacid(12(S)-HETE), and 12(R)-HETE by subcellular fractions from porcine PMNL. In the presence of NAD+ and a microsomal fraction from PMNL, each of the above 12-hydroxyeicosanoids was converted to a single product with a lambda max approximately 40 nm higher than that of the substrate, indicating that the conjugated diene or triene chromophore had been extended by one double bond, presumably by oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group to an oxo group. In the case of LTB4, this was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which indicated that the product was identical to 12-oxo-LTB4. LTB4 was not converted to any products by a cytosolic fraction from PMNL, but was converted to both 10,11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 by the 1500 x g supernatant in the presence of NAD+. Negligible amounts of dihydro products were formed in the presence of NADH or NADPH, suggesting that initial oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group is a requirement for reduction of the 10,11-double bond. Consistent with this hypothesis, 12-oxo-LTB4 was rapidly metabolized to 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 by the cytosolic fraction in the presence of NADH. Only small amounts of this product, along with some LTB4, were formed by the microsomal fraction. These results indicate that the initial step in the formation of 10,11-dihydro products from 12-hydroxyeicosanoids is oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group by a microsomal 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+, which is followed by reduction of the olefinic double bond by a cytosolic delta 10-reductase in the presence of NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1527095121,"cDNAs encoding Na,K-ATPase beta-subunits containing deletions in the cytoplasmic domain or in the single membrane-spanning domain of the molecule were constructed and expressed in mouse L cells to determine the effect(s) of deletions in these domains on alpha/beta-subunit assembly and intracellular targeting. Avian beta-subunits lacking some or all of the cytoplasmic domain (endodomain) assemble with the endogenous mouse alpha-subunit and are correctly transported to the plasma membrane. Mutants containing deletions in the transmembrane domain were constructed by fusing portions of cDNAs encoding the amino-terminal one-third of human beta-subunit deletion mutants with avian beta-subunit cDNA encoding the carboxyl two-thirds of the molecule. A deletion of 3 amino acids in transmembrane domain resulted in correct alpha/beta-subunit assembly and localization to the plasma membrane. In contrast, deletions of 5 or more amino acids in the transmembrane domain prevented expression of the beta-subunit at the cell surface and resulted in the accumulation of these molecules in the ER. In spite of these targeting differences, all beta-subunit mutants capable of membrane insertion were also able to assemble with the alpha-subunit. These results suggest that the specificity for alpha/beta assembly resides in the ectodomains of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1528861111,"We have investigated the interaction between phage Mu transposase (A protein) and the ends (att sites) of Mu by chemical and nuclease protection and interference studies. These studies define a 24-base pair contact region at five of the six att sites (L1, L3 at att L and R1, R2, R3 at att R). Hydroxyl radical footprints show that the transposase binds to one face of the DNA helix and covers two consecutive major grooves. Binding specificity is achieved primarily through the major groove. Strong contacts are found with 3 guanines which are conserved at five of the sites. Two of these guanines are missing in the weakest binding site (L2) where 13 base pairs are mainly contacted. A pair of DNAase I hypersensitive sites, one on each strand, appear at the back of only one of the two contacted major grooves at most sites except at L2, and can be correlated with the degree of A protein-induced bend (Kuo, C.-F., Zou, A., Jayaram, M., Getzoff, E. D., and Harshey, R. M. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1585-1591) at these sites. No contacts are observed for 4-5 base pairs in the vicinity of L1 and R1, where the A protein nicks DNA during transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1591806550,"Abstract The NADPH-oxidase of human neutrophils can be activated in a cell-free system comprised of plasma membrane, cytosol, and an anionic amphiphile such as arachidonate or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Recently, we showed that diacylglycerol acts synergistically with SDS in the cell-free system to stimulate superoxide generation, with concurrent phosphorylation of a 47-kDa cytosolic protein which is thought to be a component of the oxidase (Burnham, D. N., Uhlinger, D. J., and Lambeth, J. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17550-17559). We report herein that when undialyzed cytosol is used along with either SDS alone or SDS plus diacylglycerol as activators, adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) and guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) both stimulated superoxide generation several fold, yielding about the same maximal velocity. ATP and GTP showed lower levels of stimulation. Stimulation by ATP gamma S and GTP gamma S was nonadditive, and showed a 5-7-fold greater specificity for GTP gamma S. ATP gamma S stimulation was inhibited by the nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase inhibitor UDP. In contrast, when extensively dialyzed cytosol was used, most of the stimulation by ATP gamma S was lost, while most of that by GTP gamma S was retained. Addition of GDP restored the ability of ATP gamma S to stimulate, consistent with NDP kinase-catalyzed formation of GTP gamma S from ATP gamma S plus GDP. This activity was demonstrated directly in both cytosol and plasma membrane. Using undialyzed cytosol, phosphorylation of p47 showed a similar nonspecificity for nucleoside triphosphates, due to NDP kinase activity, but revealed the expected ATP specificity when dialyzed cytosol was used. Neither ATP gamma S nor GTP gamma S were good substrates for protein phosphorylation. Under a variety of conditions, phosphorylation of p47 or other neutrophil proteins failed to correlate with oxidase activation. The present studies indicate that SDS and diacylglycerol stimulation of superoxide generation in the cell-free system is independent of protein kinase C or other protein kinase activity, and suggest a novel role for diacylglycerol in cell regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1552052272,"We describe that stimulation of human fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induces a transient up-regulation of the PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor transcript and protein levels. The effect of PDGF-BB on the receptor transcript levels was more pronounced than those seen when other cytokines were used. Regulation of transcript levels by PDGF-BB was mediated through post-transcriptional mechanisms. No induction could be observed in a nuclear run-on analysis, but cycloheximide treatment attenuated the accumulation of both alpha- and beta-receptor transcripts induced by PDGF-BB. An increase in receptor protein levels was observed using two different experimental approaches. Increased amounts of receptor precursor forms could be immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled cells, stimulated with PDGF-BB. In a second approach, cells were exposed to different concentrations of PDGF-BB, and, in a subsequent step, ligand binding analysis was performed. In this experiment, an initial down-regulation of receptors was followed by increased levels of the cell surface forms of the receptors. In conclusion, PDGF-BB, but not PDGF-AA, induces increased synthesis of both PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor protein; this constitutes a positive feed-back mechanism, which, for example, could serve to potentiate autocrine stimulation of growth."
https://openalex.org/W1510045653,"The functional properties of carboxyl terminally truncated mutants of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor were compared with those of the wild-type receptor and a receptor mutant made kinase negative by a point mutation. A mutant in which 98 amino acids were deleted retained kinase activity and mediated a mitogenic signal, whereas deletion of 141 or 155 amino acids led to loss of kinase activity and ability to mediate a mitogenic signal. The mutant with 155 amino acids deleted, i.e. the entire carboxyl-terminal tail downstream of the kinase domain, did not undergo ligand-mediated internalization and down-regulation, whereas the mutant with 141 amino acids deleted was internalized at a relatively high rate. This indicates that the 14 amino acids immediately downstream of the kinase domain is of importance for the internalization of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor. This region is hydrophobic and shares no similarity to other sequences postulated to mediate endocytotic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1589709775,"The last three consecutive epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures of human thrombomodulin constitute the functional domain for protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity. Using site-directed deletion mutagenesis, we found that amino acid Asp349 of TME456, a recombinantly produced protein consisting of EGF-like structures 4, 5, and 6, is essential for retaining full protein C-activating cofactor activity. To investigate the role of Asp349 in the protein C-activating cofactor activity of human thrombomodulin, we have constructed two mutants of TMD123, a recombinantly produced protein consisting of domains D1, D2, and D3 of thrombomodulin, using site-directed point mutagenesis of the thrombomodulin coding sequence. In mutant TMD123A, the Asp349 codon was replaced with an Ala codon and in mutant TMD123E, the Asp349 codon was replaced with a Glu codon. The partially purified mutant proteins were assayed for their protein C-activating cofactor activity at various Ca2+ concentrations. TMD123 and TMD123E protein showed similar high levels of cofactor activity and similar patterns of Ca2+ dependence, while TMD123A had lower cofactor activity and did not show any Ca2+ dependence. We concluded that Asp349 in the fourth EGF-like structure of human thrombomodulin plays a role in its Ca(2+)-mediated binding to protein C."
https://openalex.org/W1496932311,"We have demonstrated previously that HDL-mediated efflux of plasma membrane cholesterol is independent of specific binding of apolipoproteins to the high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor in either control or cholesterol-enriched cells (Karlin, J. B., Johnson, W. J., Benedict, C. R., Chacko, G. K., Phillips, M. C., and Rothblat, G. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12557-12564 and Johnson, W. J., Mahlberg, F. H., Chacko, G. K., Phillips, M. C., and Rothblat, G. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14099-14106). The present studies were conducted to determine if the process for removal of intracellular (lysosomal) cholesterol is similar to that of membrane cholesterol or if, in contrast, it is selectively regulated by specific apolipoproteins of HDL. For these reasons, we examined the influence of each of the major apolipoproteins of human HDL, apoAI, apoAII, and apoCs on the metabolism of membrane and lysosomal cholesterol in a macrophage foam cell model. We developed an experimental system which allows, for the first time, the simultaneous determination of lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester and efflux and esterification of both lysosomal and membrane cholesterol. J774 and elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were loaded with cholesteryl ester within lysosomes through phagocytosis of sonicated lipid droplets. Membrane and lysosomal pools of cholesterol were differentially radiolabeled. Discoidal complexes of egg phosphatidylcholine and purified apolipoproteins having a similar size and composition were used as cholesterol acceptors. Our results demonstrate that lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester is independent of the presence of extracellular acceptors. Lysosomal production of cholesterol stimulates the esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase of membrane and lysosomal cholesterol. All the particles tested induce the efflux of both pools of cholesterol at a similar ratio. As efflux is stimulated, esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase is reduced. We conclude that none of these apolipoproteins selectively influences the efflux or the esterification of membrane of lysosomal cholesterol. In addition, we observe that particles containing apoAI are the most efficient acceptors, but this effect is not linked to specific binding to the HDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1492594459,"Interleukin 1 (IL-1) mediates many cellular functions, but the signal transduction mechanisms of its actions are not clearly understood. Here, we have examined the exact participation of cAMP in the IL-1-induced production of the precursors of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and their specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) in human uterine cervical fibroblasts. IL-1 significantly augmented the production of proMMP-1 (vertebrate procollagenase), proMMP-3 (prostromelysin), and TIMP without detectable changes in the intracellular level of cAMP. Dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) and the cAMP elevating agent (forskolin) did not replace IL-1 as MMP inducers. On the contrary, the IL-1-mediated induction of proMMP-1 and proMMP-3 was significantly suppressed by treatment of the cells with Bt2cAMP, forskolin, or theophylline. The suppressive effect of Bt2cAMP on the IL-1-induced production of proMMP-1 and -3 was not due to the inhibition of zymogen secretion, but resulted from the decrease in the steady-state levels of proMMP-1 and proMMP-3 mRNAs. In contrast, Bt2cAMP slightly enhanced the IL-1-induced production of TIMP. The synthesis of proMMP-2 (72-kDa progelatinase/type IV procollagenase) was not altered by IL-1 and/or Bt2cAMP. These results suggest, first, that induction of proMMP-1 and -3 synthesis may share similar transduction pathways but they are distinct from those for proMMP-2 and TIMP synthesis and, second, that cAMP does not function as a second messenger in the MMPs' induction upon IL-1 stimulation in human uterine cervical fibroblasts. Thus, it is further suggested that the system that increases the intracellular cAMP level may be involved in negative regulation of proMMP-1 and -3 production."
https://openalex.org/W1557212676,"We have reported previously that expression of the human apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene in mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells suppresses basal and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-stimulated steroidogenesis. To understand the mechanism of this suppression, we have examined the integrity of cAMP regulated events required for adrenal steroidogenesis. Both acute and chronic responses to ACTH or cAMP are suppressed in Y1 cells which express apoE (Y1-E cells) as compared with parental Y1 cells. Acute morphologic changes in response to cAMP and acute induction of steroidogenesis by cAMP are suppressed in the Y1-E cell lines. Constitutive expression of P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme mRNA, the rate-limiting enzyme in steroid hormone synthesis, is reduced up to 11-fold in the Y1-E cell lines. The level of mRNA encoding P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage correlates directly with the reduction in basal steroid production observed in the individual Y1-E cell lines. Expression of P450-11 beta-hydroxylase mRNA, although readily detectable in Y1 parent cells, is absent or reduced in the Y1-E cell lines. Inhibition of cAMP-regulated gene expression is not restricted to genes required for steroid synthesis, since cAMP induction of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA is also inhibited in the Y1-E cell lines. These data indicate that suppression of steroidogenesis in Y1-E cells is due, at least in part, to inhibition of cAMP-regulated gene expression. These effects are not due to a defective cAMP-dependent protein kinase, since kinase activity in vitro and activation in vivo are unaltered in the Y1-E cell lines. These results suggest that expression of apoE in Y1 cells blocks cAMP-mediated signal transduction at a point distal to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1485505868,"Conjugate ubiquitin was previously found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membranes of eukaryotic cells while the enzymes of the ubiquitin-conjugating system appear to be cytoplasmic. We have prepared the from rabbit brain by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation and by Western blotting, using a specific antibody against conjugate ubiquitin, showing that it contains ubiquitin conjugates in a very wide molecular weight range. Electron microscopy and measurement of specific enzyme markers show that this not only contains mitochondria but also some endoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Immunostaining with anti-ubiquitin IgG followed by immunodecoration with colloidal gold particles provides evidence for the presence of conjugate ubiquitin both in mitochondria and in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, this mitochondrial fraction shows a pronounced ATP-dependent ability to conjugate 125I-ubiquitin into a number of endogenous proteins as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Addition of E1, E2, and E3, the enzymes of the ubiquitin conjugating system purified from rabbit reticulocytes, does not further increase this ubiquitination nor incorporate 125I-ubiquitin into additional protein bands. The same is not able to carry out any ATP-dependent degradation of 125I-albumin; however, it contains an isopeptidase activity able to release the covalently incorporated 125I-ubiquitin and is also able to conjugate 125I-ubiquitin to exogenous proteins as oxidized RNase. By affinity chromatography on ubiquitin-agarose of II of a crude Triton X-100 extract of the fraction, several proteins corresponding in Mr to the E1 and E2s enzymes were obtained. These proteins were also able to form specific ubiquitin-thiol ester bounds on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and to support 125I-ubiquitin conjugation to oxidized RNase. Detergent fractionation of the provided evidence for a possible localization of the ubiquitin conjugating activity in the external membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of an active ubiquitin protein conjugating system in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum may be related to the turnover of organelle proteins as well as to specific cell functions such as import of proteins into mitochondria and ubiquitination of externally oriented membrane-bound proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1601992011,"A 32-carboxylic acid derivative of lanosterol (SKF 104976) was found to be a potent inhibitor of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (14 alpha DM). 14 alpha DM activity in a Hep G2 cell extract was inhibited 50% by 2 nM SKF 104976. Exposure of intact cells to similar concentrations of the compound resulted in the inhibition of incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol with concomitant accumulation of lanosterol as well as a 40-70% decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity. SKF 104976 did not effect low density lipoprotein uptake and degradation in Hep G2 cells, suggesting that HMGR and low density lipoprotein receptor activity were not coordinately regulated under these conditions. Reduction of the flux of carbon units in the sterol synthetic pathway by as much as 80% did not alter the suppressing effect of SKF 104976 on HMGR activity. However, under conditions where sterol synthesis was almost completely blocked by lovastatin, HMGR activity was not suppressed by SKF 104976. Mevalonate, at concentrations that did not decrease HMGR activity, was able to restore the inhibiting effect of SKF 104976 on HMGR activity. The rapid inhibition (2-3 h) of HMGR activity by SKF 104976 to 30-60% of the level in controls was not dependent on the initial amount of HMGR enzyme present. These findings suggest that upon inhibition of 14 alpha DM by SKF 104976, a mevalonate-derived precursor regulates HMGR activity, even when the sterol synthetic rate is considerably reduced and when HMGR protein levels are very high. In Hep G2 cells, formation of oxylanostenols from [3H]mevalonate reached a maximum between 1 and 10 nM SKF 104976 and was negligible at higher concentrations. This result suggests that oxylanostenols are not the key mediators of the modulation of HMGR in Hep G2 cells upon 14 alpha DM inhibition."

Bacteria containing pJL11 were induced to express a 29-kDa protein (designated pp29la1) that represents a truncated portion of the ICP10-PK domain (includes PK catalytic motifs I-V) as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies that recognize different antigenic domains, competition studies with extracts of ICP10-positive eukaryotic cells, and peptide mapping.pp29la1 has autophosphorylating and transphosphorylating activity for calmodulin. The enzyme is activated by Mn2+ but not by Mg2+ ions, and autophosphorylation is inhibited by histone. It differs from the authentic ICP10-PK in that phosphorylation is specific only for threonine."

We have previously reported the purification and characterization of three of these enzymes, termed smooth muscle phosphatase (SMP)-I, -II, and -IV. Recently, we have purified SMP-III to near homogeneity. Although all of the smooth muscle phosphatases dephosphorylate the isolated myosin light chains, only SMP-III and -IV are active toward intact myosin and, therefore, are most likely to play a direct role in the muscle contraction-relaxation process. SMP-III has a higher molecular weight (390,000), as determined by gel filtration, than the other smooth muscle phosphatases and migrates as single band with a molecular weight of 40,000 in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. SMP-III is immunologically distinct from SMP-I and -II. It dephosphorylates heavy meromyosin and the isolated myosin light chains at a rapid rate but has low activity toward phosphorylase alpha. The activity of SMP-III is not affected by Ca2+ but is activated by Mn2+.Mg2+ stimulates the activity toward heavy meromyosin but inhibits the myosin light chain phosphatase activity. Attempts to classify SMP-III according to the scheme proposed by Ingebritsen and Cohen (Ingebritsen T. S., and Cohen, P. (1983) Science 221, 331-338) revealed that it is resistant to the heat stable inhibitor-2, suggesting that it is a Type 2 protein phosphatase. However, SMP-III is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid which are characteristic of Type 1 protein phosphatases and it binds to heparin-Sepharose like other Type 1 phosphatases. But most interestingly, SMP-III does not dephosphorylate the alpha- or beta-subunits of phosphorylase kinase, a property not reported for any Ser/Thr protein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1550982765,"N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide is a hydrophobic, sulfhydryl-directed, chemical modification probe which, at a low concentration, inhibits the capacity of lamb kidney sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase [Na,K)-ATPase; EC 3.6.1.3) to bind ouabain. This inhibition is partially blocked by preincubation of the enzyme with ouabagenin, an aglycone derivative which can be used as a reversible protecting ligand for the ouabain binding site. The kinetics of inhibition are not first order, suggesting that there may be more than one site of labeling which is responsible for the inhibition of ouabain binding. Although earlier work (Kirley, T. L., Lane, L. K., and Wallick, E. T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4525-4528) indicates that the inhibition is accompanied by a loss in the number of binding sites rather than a decrease in affinity of the sites for the ligand, other data (Scheiner-Bobis, G., Zimmerman, M., Kirch, V., and Schoner, W. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 165, 653-656) indicates that there is no cysteine residue located extracellularly in the ouabain binding site. By sequence analysis of alpha subunit peptides labeled by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide in the absence but not in the presence of protecting ligand, it is demonstrated in this work that there are two major sites of labeling protected by the binding of ouabagenin, Cys-367 and Cys-656. Both of these sites are located in the large cytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit, one close to the phosphorylation site (Asp-369), and the other implicated in the binding of ATP (Cys-656). Therefore, it appears from this data that the inhibition of ouabain binding by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide is not due to modification of a site in the binding pocket for cardiac glycosides, but rather to an allosteric effect, since cardiac glycoside binding is known to be dependent on the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. The dependence of inhibition on the presence of sodium, potassium, and ATP also is consistent with this interpretation. The work reported here thus explains the apparent paradox posed by the earlier data."
https://openalex.org/W1570583376,"Northern blot analysis showed that human muscle glycogen phosphorylase is developmentally regulated in human adult and fetal skeletal muscle. Furthermore, muscle phosphorylase mRNA expression is temporally regulated in the C2C12 mouse muscle cell line. To define regulatory elements that control expression of the human muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene, the structure of the 5' end of the gene was determined, and 1,129 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region were subcloned and sequenced. Primer extension, RNase protection, and S1 nuclease protection experiments mapped the transcription start site to 76 base pairs upstream from the starting methionine. Sequential deletions of the 5'-flanking region were tested for the ability to activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in fused or proliferating C2C12 cells. Inclusion of the 43 base pairs between -612 and -570 led to a 9-fold increase in CAT activity in fused myotubes. No increase was observed in proliferating myoblasts. This region contains a 10-base pair sequence, CTCCAAAAGG, at -592, which is also repeated at -252. Mutation of the sequence at -592 results in a 50% decrease in CAT activity compared with the amount of CAT activity observed with the normal or a control mutation. These results indicate that a regulatory element is found within -612 to -570 of the 5'-flanking DNA of the human muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene which activates transcription only in differentiated muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517026189,"The intracellular distribution and catalytic properties of CTP: ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase from endosperm of castor bean (Ricinus communis L. var. Hale) have been studied. This enzyme was confined to membranes, with about 80% of the activity occurring in mitochondria and the rest in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The mitochondrial location of this enzyme was supported by further purifying mitochondria on Percoll density gradients. The mitochondrial cytidylyltransferase was detected largely in outer membrane fractions, and lost its activity after trypsin treatment, indicating that the active sites are exposed to the cytoplasm. Both mitochondrial and ER cytidylyltransferase required cations for activity; Mg2+ was preferred over Mn2+ and Ca2+. The pH optima both were 6.5. The apparent Km values for ethanolamine phosphate were 143 and 83 microM and those for CTP were 125 and 1010 microM, respectively, for the mitochondrial and ER activities. The mitochondrial cytidylyltransferase reached a maximal velocity of 3.0 nmol/min/mg protein, whereas ER cytidylyltransferase was 0.424 nmol/min/mg protein. These findings reveal that the majority of the cytidylyltransferase activity in castor bean endosperm is not closely associated with ethanolaminephosphotransferase (predominantly in ER) which catalyzes the subsequent reaction in the synthesis of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine by a nucleotide pathway. The possible roles of these enzymes in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in plants are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589583272,"Abstract Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell nuclear extract following electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels revealed that a small proportion of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) displays a low mobility, in confirmation of previous reports. This low mobility form of U2 snRNP (termed LMC, for low mobility complex) also formed in vitro when U2 snRNP present in HeLa cytoplasmic S100 was added to a micrococcal nuclease-treated nuclear extract. Of greater experimental value, we found that the LMC also formed when a T7 U2 RNA transcript was assembled into U2 snRNP in a HeLa cytoplasmic S100 system, followed by its incubation in micrococcal nuclease-treated nuclear extract. LMC formation was ATP-dependent and was specific for U2 snRNP since it was not observed with S100-assembled U1 or U4 snRNPs. RNase H cleavage of U2 snRNP in the nuclear extract with an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 28-42 of U2 RNA, as opposed to micrococcal nuclease treatment, rendered the extract competent to form the LMC, indicating that the nuclear factors responsible for LMC formation reside on endogenous U2 snRNP. LMC formation was not competed by excess U2 RNA but was competed by partially purified native U2 snRNP, providing further evidence that the LMC represents an interaction of nuclear factors with already assembled U2 snRNP. LMC formation did not take place on a mutant U2 snRNP lacking the binding site for the two U2-specific proteins, A' and B, nor on mutant U2 snRNPs lacking nucleotides 34-37 or nucleotides 46-49. Further results revealed that nucleotides 35 and 36 of U2 RNA, but not 34 and 37, are required for LMC formation. These experiments demonstrate a nucleotide sequence-specific interaction of U2 snRNP with nuclear factors in the absence of pre-mRNA. Among the U2 RNA nucleotides involved in the formation of this complex are ones previously implicated in base pairing between U2 RNA and the pre-mRNA lariat branch site. These findings are discussed in the context of the possibility that the LMC is on the spliceosome assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2143332568,"The presence of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as the organic cofactor of Dactylium dendroides galactose oxidase and lentil (Lens culinaris) seedling amine oxidase, purported PQQ-containing oxidoreductases (Van der Meer, R. A., Jongejan, J. A., and Duine, J. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7792-7794; Citro, G., Verdina, A., Galati, R., Floris, G., Sabatini, S., and Finazzi-Argo', A. (1989) FEBS Lett. 247, 201-204), was reinvestigated using the nitro blue tetrazolium redoxcycling method (Paz, M. A., Gallop, P. M., Torrelio, B. M., and Fluckiger, R. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 154, 1330-1337; Paz, M. A., Fluckiger, R., Boak, A., Kagan, H. M., and Gallop, P. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 689-692) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with polyclonal antibodies against PQQ. The possible quinoprotein nature of the laccases from Polyporus versicolor and Rhus vernicifera was also investigated because of the similarities in spectroscopic and kinetic features of these enzymes and the laccase from Phlebia radiata, reported to be a PQQ protein (Karhunen, E., Niku-Paavola, M.-L., Viikari, L., Haltia, T., Van der Meer, R. A., and Duine, J. A. (1990) FEBS Lett. 267, 6-8). The presence of a quinonoid cofactor in lentil seedling amine oxidase is confirmed, whereas galactose oxidase and both laccases do not display any quinoprotein nature."
https://openalex.org/W1590150849,"High hydrostatic pressure enhanced the specific activity of regulatory enzymes of the Benson-Calvin cycle (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, phosphoribulokinase) which are modulated by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. High activity of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase required dithiothreitol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and Ca2+. At 100 bar the A0.5 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (0.3 mM) was lower than that at 1 bar (1.5 mM), whereas similar variations of pressure did not alter the A0.5 for Ca2+ (55 microM). The response of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase exposed to 500 bar was a 4-fold increase in the NADP-linked activity; conversely, the NAD-dependent activity remained unchanged. The concerted action of high pressure and Pi (or ATP), both activators of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, led to inactivation. On the other hand, the activity of phosphoribulokinase increased 10-fold when the enzyme was incubated at 1500 bar; the activation process was strictly dependent on the presence of dithiothreitol. At variance with these enzymes, bovine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, yeast glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, and chloroplast ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, whose activities are not modulated by reduced thioredoxin, were inactivated by high pressure. The comparison of oligomeric enzymes revealed that the stimulation of specific activity by high pressure correlated with thioredoxin-mediated activation, and it did not depend on a particular subunit composition. Present results show that high pressure resembled thioredoxin, cosolvents, and chaotropic anions in its action on regulatory enzymes of the Benson-Calvin cycle. The comparison of physiological and non-physiological modulators suggested that thioredoxin-mediated modifications of noncovalent interactions is an important event in light-dependent regulation of chloroplast enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1548579375,"Abstract To investigate the protein-ubiquinone interaction in the bovine heart mitochondrial succinate-cytochrome c reductase region of the respiratory chain, three fluorine substituted ubiquinone derivatives, 2,3-dimethoxy-6-(9'-fluorodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (9FQ), 2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TFQ), and 2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-6-(9'-fluorodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (9FTFQ), were synthesized. 9FQ was synthesized by radical coupling of Q0 and bis(10-fluoroundecanoyl)peroxide. The latter was prepared by fluorination of undecylenic acid followed by thionylchloride treatment and peroxidation. TFQ was synthesized from 2,2,2-trifluoro-p-cresol by methylation, nitration, reduction, acetylation, nitration, reduction, oxidation, and radical alkylation. 9FTFQ was prepared by the radical alkylation of 2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-1,4-benzoquinone with bis(10-fluoroundecanoyl)peroxide. All three fluoro-Q derivatives are active (greater than 50% the activity of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone) when used as electron acceptors for succinate-ubiquinone reductase. However, only 9FQ is active when used as an electron donor for ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or as an electron mediator for succinate-cytochrome c reductase. Both TFQ and 9FTFQ are competitive inhibitors for ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. A 19FNMR peak-broadening effect was observed for 9FQ when it was reconstituted with ubiquinone-depleted ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. A drastic up-field chemical shift was observed for TFQ when it was reconstituted with ubiquinone-depleted reductase. These results indicate that the binding environments of the benzoquinone ring and the alkyl side chain of the Q molecule are different. The strong up-field chemical shift for TFQ, and lack of significant chemical shift for 9FQ, suggest that the benzoquinone ring is bound near the paramagnetic cytochrome b heme."
https://openalex.org/W1563741429,"During the double-stranded passage that takes place because of the topoisomerase action, a plectonemically interwound DNA often becomes knotted. In this process, a portion of the substrate supercoils are converted into interlinks that contribute to the topology of the knot formed. In this appendix, an approximate formula is derived for the average number of these interlinks in terms of the number of supercoils and branches in the substrate. This will give an indication of the complexity of the average knot obtained. When two regions of DNA come together before passage, the substrate is divided into two domains in essentially the same way as intramolecular recombination divides the substrate into two domains (Boles, T. C., White, J. H., and Cozzarelli, N. R. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 213, 931-951). Nodes formed between DNA segments from different domains are called interdomainal."
